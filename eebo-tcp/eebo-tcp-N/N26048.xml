            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>PRAY WITHOUT CEASING—GIVE THANKS.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the words juſt read, the inſpired apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates on us the two important duties of prayer and thankſgiving, which the Preſident of the United States invites us all to perform on this day. We have need to pray for the pardon of our ſins, as a <hi>nation,</hi> and as <hi>individuals,</hi> and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ourſelves profoundly before God on account of them; and we have need to pray for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the mercies, both ſpiritual and temporal, which we have hitherto enjoyed. To the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Supreme Magiſtrate, our Right Rev. Biſhop has been pleaſed to add his ſtrong recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, in which, in addition to the objects of humiliation and prayer common to all our fellow-citizens, he urges us to beſeech the Lord to put a ſtop to the dreadful perſecution which is now ravaging his own church, and to comfort and ſtrengthen its viſible head. But, though the duty of humiliation and prayer be incumbent on us at all times, and <hi>more eſpecially at the preſent,</hi> ſtill, ſeeing the aſtoniſhing change that has lately taken place in the public mind, I conſider the duty of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving as yet more preſſing—I ſhall, therefore, at
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034646_0006_0FFF455854CAF3C8"/>
this time, mention to you ſome of the motives which ſhould excite us all to gratitude and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to the great Beſtower of all good; and, as I proceed, I ſhall, from time to time, make ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections as are proper to incline our hearts to prayer and humiliation.</p>
            <p>DURING the whole courſe of my miniſtry among you, my brethren, I have never before entered into any details concerning political affairs; nor ſhould I do it now, were it not to teach you to appreciate duly the government under which you live, and to point out your duties towards it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE firſt bleſſing which demands our cordial thanks to God is, that we live under the freeſt and moſt eaſy government in the world. The conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States unites a proper degree of energy with all the liberty which any reaſonable perſon can deſire. It is well-balanced, our execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, legiſlative and judicial authorities being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of, and mutually checked by, each other. They all emanate from the people at large; who have always the power to put an end to any real abuſes which may take place, by diſplacing their preſent repreſentatives and appointing others that have their confidence—and as long as the great body of the people do not ſee the neceſſity of a change of men and meaſures, we may reſt aſſured, that the abuſes, however they may be magnified by party-ſcribblers and declaimers, are not of a very alarming nature. Under ſuch a government as this, every inſurrection againſt the conſtituted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, or oppoſition to them, is a revolt of a part againſt the general will, by which thoſe author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities exiſt, and is highly criminal. Praiſed be God, that this happy conſtitution, under which perſons of all denominations enjoy entire ſecurity for their lives, property, and liberty, whether ſpiritual or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034646_0007_0FFF4559E5026D20"/>
political, is ſtill unimpaired and in full operation; and that all the attempts to overturn, or to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it, by concentrating all its powers in the ſingle houſe of repreſentatives, have only ſerved to throw light upon its principles, and to give it additional ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER cauſe of thankſgiving to God is, that the adminiſtration of this moſt excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ever ſince its firſt eſtabliſhment, has been committed to men eminent for their wiſdom, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and patriotic ſervices. I need only mention a WASHINGTON, that guardian genius, that ſaviour of his country, that ornament of the human race, to excite in all your hearts the warmeſt feelings of eſteem, gratitude and love.—Long may he enjoy the charms of that retirement in which he has choſen to ſpend the evening of his life: may the bleſſings of this country and of the univerſe be yet many years his reward; and at length, enriched with every chriſtian as well as moral virtue, may he enter the realms of everlaſting felicity.</p>
            <p>WE have great reaſon to be thankful, that, when that approved warrior and admired ſtateſman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the helm of ſtate, and ſought the repoſe which his age and health required, God did not permit the intrigues of a foreign, inſidious nation to ſucceed in raiſing the man of their choice to the preſidential chair; but inſpired us with ſufficient courage to place at our head a ſtateſman and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, whoſe ability and integrity, proved in the moſt trying times, eminently entitle him to our confidence and affection. Such is the illuſtrious JOHN ADAMS, the preſent Preſident of theſe ſtates. This great man can have nothing in view but the happineſs and proſperity of his fellow-citizens, with whoſe fortunes his own, and thoſe of his family, are evidently and inſeparably connected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:034646_0008_0FFF455D81ED2230"/>
HE wiſhes for no power unwarranted by the conſtitution, and for no ſupport incompatible with the generous ſpirit of freedom. Since the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his inſtructions to our meſſengers of peace, we have learned, better than ever, to appreciate his worth. We are now aſſured of his moderate and conciliatory temper, as well as of his deciſive firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Under ſuch a leader we have nothing to fear: never will he ſacrifice the honor of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; never will he relinquiſh any part of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence which has long been the object of all his toils and labors, and for the obtaining of which ſo many of our brave countrymen have ſpilt their blood and loſt their lives. Let us offer up our fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers to Heaven, on this day, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable life may be preſerved, and his health con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; that God would give him wiſdom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what are the beſt meaſures to be adopted for the good of his country, and the fortitude to put them into execution, in ſpite of every obſtacle and oppoſition; and that all thoſe who aſſiſt him in council may be men of ability and integrity, ſo that the public may receive no detriment from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity or diſhoneſty. Let us all reſolve to give him a generous and cordial ſupport, and openly avow this reſolution by ſetting our names to the manly and ſpirited addreſſes which are now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the ſignature of all citizens. Let us tell him, that we feel, as we ought, the value of that liberty which we enjoy, and that we pledge our fortunes and ſacred honour to defend it with loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fidelity, under the banners of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we have choſen. Let us expreſs our indignation at the repeated inſults offered to this government, which has ſought peace by every poſſible mean compatible with the dignity and honour of an independent nation. Let us declare,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034646_0009_0FFF455F069C8140"/>
with the firmneſs and ſelf-reſpect of freemen, our readineſs to unite in every effort, which ſhall be made, to prevent our being ſubjected to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading conditions which a foreign nation ſeeks to impoſe upon us, as preliminary to all negociation for peace, and that we conſider war, with all its attendant calamities, as by far the leaſt of the two evils. Let us ſhow, that we love the government which protects us, and that we are not divided from it, either in intereſt or affection. In fine, let us expreſs our warm and unequivocal approbation of the wiſe and temperate ſyſtem which has hitherto been purſued with regard to foreign nations, and our increaſing confidence in him who preſides over us with ſo much wiſdom and prudence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A THIRD motive, which we have, of the ſincereſt thanks to Heaven is, that, while a ſpirit of diſorganization and diſorder has produced ſuch baleful effects in other countries, America, in ſpite of the efferveſcence produced among us by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exertions of foreign and domeſtic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguers, yet remains in a happy ſtate of tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. France appears to have been raiſed up by God for the chaſtiſement of an impious world. I ſpeak not of France governed by the deſcendants of St. Louis; it was <hi>then</hi> the guardian of religion and good morals, and the aſylum of the unfortunate. Happy land! where I received the moſt valuable part of my education, and where I paſſed my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt years among eſteemed friends and beloved aſſociates! alas! to me no more! they are all either cruelly butchered, baniſhed, or reduced to wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs at home. If I forget thee, O dear, charming abode, <hi>may my right hand forget her cunning; may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</hi> But now, how changed! my heart ſinks within me, my ſpirits die away, when I recal the fate of ſome of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034646_0010_0FFF45608C3467A8"/>
my deareſt inmates. But ſoon the painful recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is ſwallowed up in the conſideration of the complicated diſtreſſes of that once highly favoured empire.</p>
            <p>FRANCE revolutionized is more truly the ſcourge of God, than was ever Attila, or any other barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conqueror recorded in hiſtory. Its tyrants, like Satan, their father, may be literally ſaid <hi>to go about, ſeeking whom they may devour.</hi> If we caſt an eye over the map of the world, we ſhall find, in almoſt every part, moſt dreadful traces of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive plans. The miſeries which they have ſpread throughout the globe are beyond all the powers of calculation;—miſeries ſo univerſal as to have excited the horror of <hi>all</hi> who have the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or merit the name, of human beings—miſeries which will never be effaced from the memory of mankind, and which entire ages of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity will be ſcarcely able to repair. What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled calamities have they not inflicted on their own wretched country! what wanton cruelties and atrocities have they not committed there! their own writers confeſs, that, by the different modes of deſtruction, the guillotine, ſhooting, drowning, and the like, upwards of 30,000 perſons were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Lyons, and that that once magnificent city was in great part levelled to the ground,—that, at Nantz, according to the loweſt eſtimate, 27,000 (ſome ſay, 40,000) were murdered, chiefly by drowning,<note n="*" place="bottom">THIS mode of putting people to death they blaſphemouſly called the <hi>National Baptiſm.</hi>
               </note> ſo that the water of the Loire, on which it ſtands, became putrid, and was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be drunk,—that at Paris, 150,000, and in la Vendee 300,000 were deſtroyed. They own themſelves, that, ſince the beginning of their execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble revolution, two millions of their nation have

been ſacrificed, of which 250,000 were women, and 30,000 children: and in this immenſe carnage are not included the ſoldiers who have periſhed in camp and fallen in battle, nor the unborn infants who were deſtroyed together with their mothers.—Look into that country, and examine its preſent ſtate—Though, by plunder, forced loans, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other iniquitous means, its lordly rulers have made a very great part of the riches of Europe to concentre there; ſtill, by their narrow policy, by the ruin of all manufactures, commerce, and every other regular ſource of wealth and revenue, and by the entire ſubverſion of all public confidence, they have reduced the wretched inhabitants to a ſtate little ſhort of actual beggary and ſtarvation. No ſlavery can be equal to their's: their condition is the moſt degraded that can be conceived. Every thing they poſſeſs, and even their very perſons, are in a conſtant ſtate of <hi>requiſition;</hi> that is, they muſt be given up at the call of their rapacious maſters, under pain of death, if they refuſe. No man there dares write, print, ſpeak, or even indicate, by the ſmalleſt ſign, any diſapprobation of whatever meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures may chance to be dictated by the faction actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in power. Every preſs is ſeized that ſends forth the leaſt word in oppoſition to the mandates of the haughty directors, and the editors are put to death, impriſoned or baniſhed. The people have no ſtable, fixed laws, by which to regulate their conduct: one edict is ſcarcely rendered public be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is annulled by another directly contrary; ſo that what is conſidered as lawful, and even <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotic,</hi> to-day, may to-morrow be accounted a crime worthy of death and confiſcation.</p>
            <p>UNDER theſe accumulated calamities, the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlaves might find their yoke leſs galling, their burdens leſs inſupportable, if they could enjoy, <hi>as it

were by ſtealth,</hi> the conſolations of religion, for which they hunger and thirſt. But no: their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants have nearly dried up this ſource of comfort. And here, my friends, what horrid ſcenes preſent themſelves to our recollection! Many years before the revolution burſt forth, the ſelf-ſtyled philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, a tribe compoſed of deiſts, atheiſts and materialiſts, had, by their ſecret clubs, by impious and obſcene publications, and by various other means, ſuggeſted by the infernal ſpirit, attempted, and <hi>in part</hi> ſucceeded, to corrupt the different claſſes of ſociety in France. But never could their ſyſtem of impiety take effect upon the great maſs of the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens, who found, and ever will find, their happineſs in the belief of religion. They had long plotted the utter extirpation of all religion, but, in the firſt place, of that which, by its greater extenſion and ſuperior attachment to order and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtood more immediately in the way of their nefarious projects: this religion was the ROMAN CATHOLIC: its overthrow was, therefore, reſolved on; and the moment they had trampled down the ancient authorities of the kingdom, they employed every artifice, and made every effort, to effect their purpoſe. They began their impious attack on the church, by degrading her miniſters in the eyes of the populace, by ſtripping them of thoſe diſtinctive garments of their order, which, for ages, had rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered them reſpectable to the faithful. They then deprived them of their livings and other poſſeſſions, and repreſented them as inimical to the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of the country, becauſe they would not take oaths which tended to nothing leſs, than the renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the authority of the ſovereign pontiff and of the biſhops; in a word, of the catholic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which had been tranſmitted to them through ſeveral ſucceeding centuries. Upon their noble and

               <hi>almoſt</hi> unanimous refuſal to apoſtatize from their faith, one of the moſt horrible perſecutions (and perhaps the moſt ſo), that was ever levelled againſt the miniſters of the altar, commenced, and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, with almoſt unabating fury, until the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moment: according to the very laſt authentic accounts, the prieſts are ſtill hunted down, and very great rewards are offered for delivering them up. Thouſands of theſe holy men, of theſe gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt, have been put to death, by drowning, ſhooting, and guillotining, or have periſhed through want and ill treatment. Thouſands and tens of thouſands of them have been baniſhed from their homes, deſtitute of all means of ſubſiſtence, by the bloody edicts of the monſters of France; or have gone into voluntary exile, and are now wandering in foreign climes, where they either ſuffer all the horrors of indigence, or prolong their exiſtence by the precarious charities of ſtrangers. I need not inform you, my brethren, that the two excellent prieſts, who govern this flock with ſo much profit, and who are ſo deſervedly dear<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </gap>ians were ſent into their ſacred aſylums, who uſed every ſpecies of violence to force them to take the ſacrilegious oath to give up their religion. Many of thoſe unoffending virgins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired under the murderous laſh, to preſerve invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late fidelity to their vows. Very few of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were terrified, or even ſeduced, into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the orders of their tyrants. At length, when all means of perverſion had been eſſayed in vain, a barbarous edict ſtrips them of all their prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty at one ſtroke; their convents are declared to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the nation; and, in one day, all thoſe help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs victims, to the number of 30,000, are turned out by force to all the miſeries attendant on a ſtate of poverty and want. Many of them had grown old in the cloiſter; many of them were ſick and infirm; all of them had given up, under the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former laws, whatever they poſſeſſed in the world, and of courſe found themſelves in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtreſs. No conſideration of this kind was capable of touching the more than adamantine hearts of their enemies, who, to aggravate their wretched and forlorn ſituation, forbad all perſons, under the ſevereſt penalties, to harbour more than two of them together. All the eloquence that ever fell to the lot of a mortal would be totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to point out, in their real turpitude, only a ſmall part of thoſe deeds of horror which have taken place in France within theſe few years paſt. The many traits of ſavage barbarity related in the hiſtory of the world, all collected and united togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, appear <hi>tender mercies,</hi> when compared with the refined cruelties of the ſanguinary factions of that country; cruelties not committed by a few unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed individuals, amid the diſorders of a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by commiſſion from the men in power, and under their immediate eye. Were I to enter

into a few details, ſuch as are given by the writers of their own party, the hairs of your heads would ſtand erect; an involuntary tremor would ſeize every joint and limb of your bodies;—loving huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and wives, you could not reſiſt the ſhock; tender mothers, you would faint at the recital; and your modeſty, my virgin hearers, would be indeed moſt ſenſibly wounded. I, therefore, turn from theſe abominable ſcenes.</p>
            <p>To all their inhuman deeds, they have added the moſt horrid impieties and profanations. They have ſtripped the churches of the holy veſſels, veſtments and other things conſecrated to the worſhip of God, and have converted them all to common uſes. Some of theſe venerable temples they have turned into play-houſes, ſtores, rope-walks, ſtables, and the like; and others they have devoted to the worſhip of impious men and proſtituted women, to whom they have paid the moſt extravagant honours. They have reſpected nothing that has the leaſt relation to religion. They have commanded all bibles, prayer-books, ſacred images, &amp;c. to be brought forth, and have conſumed them in one common maſs. Nor, in this reſpect, has one religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion been more favoured than another; for the diſſenting meeting-houſes, and even the Jewiſh ſynagogues, were emptied alſo, and their contents committed to the flames. They have ſpared no one of the ſacred inſtitutions of Chriſtianity; and, in order to obliterate it entirely from the memory of mankind, they have made it a crime to paſs the firſt day of the week in exerciſes of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (a practice co-eval with the exiſtence of the Chriſtian religion), and have introduced, in its ſtead, the decade, a day wholly devoted to profane amuſements.</p>
            <p>BUT the funeſt effects of the revolution in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034646_0016_0FFF457142D51518"/>
France have not been limited to that country—it has alſo proved a ſweeping deluge to their Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia colonies: it has carried devaſtation and ruin into thoſe once flouriſhing iſlands, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of ſpreading among them the bleſſings of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: the ſlaves have been let looſe upon the whites; the richeſt towns have been given up to plunder, and burnt; and a war of extermination has been declared, and ſtill furiouſly rages.</p>
            <p>IF we look into the European world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the countries which the French have either conquered, or ſeduced to fraternize with them (as they term it), we ſhall ſee every where, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their moſt ſolemn promiſes of liberty of conſcience, of ſecurity of life and property, they have uniformly robbed the churches, taken away the lives and eſtates of thoſe who would not join in all their atrocities, deprived the people of the freedom of religion, plundered them by their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, levied upon them the moſt grievous contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, forced them to give up their ſtrong-holds, and to maintain their conquerors among them for the purpoſe of keeping themſelves in ſubjection. Holland<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Watſon.</note> was an hive of bees; her ſons flew on the wings of the wind to every corner of the globe; and returned laden with the ſweets of every climate. Belgium was a garden of herbs, the oxen were ſtrong to labour, the fields were thickly cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with the abundance of the harveſt. Unhappy Dutchmen! they ſtill toil, but not for their own comfort; they ſtill collect honey, but not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! France ſeizes the hive as often as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry has filled it. Ill-judging Belgians! they no longer eat in ſecurity the fruits of their own grounds; France, all-graſping France (whoſe never-ceaſing cry is, "give, give"), finds occaſion, or makes occaſion, to participate largely in their rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034646_0017_0FFF4573D11E2FD8"/>
it is more truly ſaid of themſelves than of their oxen, they plough the fields, but not for their own profit.</p>
            <p>IT would take up far more time than could be poſſibly given to one diſcourſe, to follow their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering bands to all the places through which, like deſtroying angels, they have ſpread terror and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation. Wherever they have met with the leaſt reſiſtance, eſpecially if an individual Frenchman was killed in the conflict, whole bodies of reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble magiſtrates have been made to expiate, with their lives, the pretended rebellion; entire cities have been threatned with extermination for the ſame offence, and nothing but enormous ſums of money have been able to ſave them from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ruin. Like impetuous torrents, in the rapidity of their courſe, they have borne down ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing before them; and, without diſtinction of friends and enemies, they have effaced, from the liſt of independent nations, Geneva, Genoa, Venice, and the papal territory.</p>
            <p>THE Pope had been for ages, by the liberality of Chriſtian princes, a very conſiderable temporal ſovereign. His dominions had been ſecured to him by the ſame ſolemn treaties, which had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bound kingdoms and ſtates to each other. Yet, in ſpite of thoſe treaties, no ſooner was the National Aſſembly formed, than it forcibly wreſted from him a valuable part<note n="*" place="bottom">Avignon.</note> of his poſſeſſions, under a pretext, which would ſanction every robbery, viz. that it would be a very convenient addition to the French empire. From that firſt aggreſſion they have never deſiſted, one moment, from their project of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the temporal ſovereignty of the Roman Pontiff, and, if poſſible, of putting an end to his ſpiritual ſupremacy in the church. And, though our Holy Father has conſtantly ſhown himſelf the moſt pacific
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034646_0018_0FFF45755DB00190"/>
of men, a true diſciple of the meek and humble Jeſus; though this his diſpoſition has been evident before the eyes of all Europe, as Buonaparte<note n="†" place="bottom">See his letter to the Pope.</note> is obliged to acknowledge; though his unfeigned piety, his firmneſs and moderation amidſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulties, his ſpirit of ſacrifice and conceſſion wherever his conſcience and duty were not impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, have drawn on him the veneration and love of all good men, the admiration and eſteem of his enemies, and have created a lively ſolicitude, among the moſt judicious diſſenters from our faith, for the preſervation of his perſon and temporalities;—notwithſtanding all this, the terrible and all-devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing republic has, at length, made an occaſion to rob him of all his ſtates; and, in order to ſecure the co-operation of his own ſubjects, in the iniquitous work, ſhe has flattered their ears with the ſyren ſound of freedom, which will very ſoon terminate in the moſt wretched ſlavery.</p>
            <p>LET me here fix your attention, for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on the common father of all the faithful. Perhaps, while I am now ſpeaking, he is expoſed to the moſt ignominious treatment, is inſulted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, as was the Redeemer of the world, whom he repreſents on earth; perhaps he is now confined to a horrid dungeon, loaded with chains, as was St. Peter, to whom he is a moſt worthy ſucceſſor; or, perhaps, he has fallen a victim to the fury of the enemies of God and man, and has thus become a glorious martyr for the holy catholic faith. Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are obliged to pray for their parents; the church is bound to pray for her head: thus did the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians for St. Peter, who, on account of their prayers, was delivered from priſon by the miraculous interpoſition of an angel. Our reverend Biſhop has ordered every prieſt to pray for the ſovereign Pontiff, in an eſpecial manner, during
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034646_0019_0FFF4579312E39A8"/>
ſix ſucceſſive months. It is a duty which we moſt cheerfully undertake.—We hope, that each one of you, who has the ſmalleſt love for his religion, will unite his prayers to thoſe which are aſcending, from every part of the catholic church, for the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant object. But, while we urge you earneſtly to pray, we, at the ſame time, exhort you not to be diſcouraged at the preſent gloomy aſpect of affairs in the church. Though ſome fanatics, in the <hi>jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binic</hi> vehicles of ſlander and abuſe, have lately very much exulted over the misfortunes of the Pope, as if the fall of anti-chriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">THERE are many perſons who fancy, and boldly aſſert, that all the impieties and diſorders of the French revolution are ſo many ſteps to bring about, what they term, <hi>the millenium,</hi> a mere chimerical ſtate, which will never have an exiſtence except in their imagination. If ſuch be the prelude, how glorious muſt be the millenium itſelf!—Strange, that they do not clearly ſee, that all theſe things, inſtead of being ſigns of the overthrow of anti-chriſt already eſtabliſhed, are the predicted forerunners of his approaching reign!</note> were near at hand; we catholics deſpiſe ſuch ranting ſtuff, knowing, as we do, with the certitude of divine faith, that all their ſilly forebodings will prove vain; and that the church will ſtand and triumph, in ſpite of earth and hell combined againſt her.—God has declared, that <hi>the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt her;</hi> and his word will be fulfilled. She has paſt through far more grievous trials: all the powers of the world were leagued againſt her from her very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; and for three hundred years together the greateſt part of her chief paſtors ſpilt their blood in her defence. Her paſt preſervation is a pledge of future protection. All her ſufferings were foretold by her Divine Founder, who took care to build her upon ſo ſolid a rock, that ſhe will ever ſtand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable amidſt all the floods and ſtorms of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and impiety which may beat againſt her. Pope Pius the VIth is the ſucceſſor of St. Peter, the prince of the apoſtles; he is the vicar of Jeſus
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034646_0020_0FFF457CCD56A088"/>
Chriſt on earth, and the viſible head of his church; and, therefore, whatever may be <hi>his</hi> fate, yet, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as God is true, ſo ſure he will have a ſucceſſor, even until the end of ages. Mighty revolutions ſhall take place throughout the globe: kingdoms ſhall be changed into republics, and republics into kingdoms: civilization ſhall ſucceed to barbariſm, and barbariſm to civilization: Amid all theſe viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes, ſtill the bark of St. Peter, with his ſucceſſors at the helm, ſhall ſail triumphantly down the ſtream of time; and never will the pilot appear more venerable, than when he guides the veſſel amidſt the howling tempeſts and raging billows. We ought, indeed, to be deeply humbled, that iniquity is permitted to go to ſuch lengths againſt God's holy church; we ought, each one, to conſider our ſins as, in part, the cauſes of this terrible calamity; we ought, therefore, to reſolve on a reformation of life, eſpecially at this time, when the charity of very many catholics is become cold, when the enemies of the church are her own favoured children, whom ſhe has brought up with the tendereſt care and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and fed with the word of God and the ſacraments. But, I repeat it; we muſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, as if all were loſt. God's promiſe will have its full and perfect effect: he is ſtill the ſtrong and Almighty Lord: his arm is not ſhortened; he will yet protect his church, which he has purchaſed with his own precious blood: her enemies will all be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and confounded; and ſhe, like gold tried in the fire, will be purified from all her droſs<note n="*" place="bottom">By <hi>droſs</hi> I mean bad members of the church, whether they be clergymen or laymen.—Theſe are ſeparated from her by the fire of perſecution.—By <hi>droſs</hi> I likewiſe intend all deviations, <hi>in practice,</hi> from the holy doctrine and morality of the Catholic Church, which we hold to be always <hi>infallible and invariable.</hi>—We believe alſo, that the church is infallible in her <hi>general diſcipline,</hi> that is, that her rules of government for all the ſocieties in her communion, however varied according to circumſtances, are always infallibly beſt, every thing conſidered—and this triple infallibility, of <hi>doctrine, morality</hi> and <hi>general diſcipline,</hi> we ſuppoſe to be fully implied in Chriſt's promiſes, that <hi>he will be always with his church,</hi> that <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt her,</hi> and that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach her all truth and abide with her forever.</hi>

                  <p>WHAT is here ſaid, it is hoped, is a ſufficient anſwer to Dr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knap's remarks on popery, in his faſt-ſermon. After "<hi>about twenty years of attentive contemplation, with the beſt helps,</hi>" he has at length made the ludicrous diſcovery, that the Engliſh and French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are "<hi>rotten toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image,</hi>" and that <hi>the pope is doubtleſs a beaſt and a whore.</hi> Wonderful proficiency in ſtudy!—Quere.

                  <p>Dr. Morſe has certainly deſerved well of his country for his intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abridgement of the infernal conſpiracy of the ILLUMINATI.—From the peculiar hatred which theſe miſcreants bear to the Roman Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic Religion, as directly oppoſed to their projects of immorality and diſorder (of which L'abbe Baruel furniſhes abundant proof in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of Illuminatiſm), he might be led to a better opinion of its High-Prieſt—Notwithſtanding which, this reſpectable perſonage is ſo great a bugbear in his eyes, that even <hi>he</hi> cannot conclude his faſt-ſermon without twice attacking him.—It is curious, that the miniſters muſt be always ſeeking ſome occaſion of venting their ſpleen upon the poor pope. If he is falling, in God's name, let him go off the ſtage in peace—At this moment, when our church is oppoſing deiſm, atheiſm, and every other ſyſtem of impiety; when our clergy, with the pope at their head, are victims for the common cauſe of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian morality and good government, as well as for their attachment to their peculiar dogmas of faith; and when even diſſenting min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, whom I could name, own that they ſhould be incapable of the ſame courage; is it not carrying inſult and outrage to the extreme, to perſiſt in calling anti-chriſtian the church which performs ſuch wonders againſt all anti-chriſtian doctrines?

            <p>LET us now conſider what has been the baſeneſs and injuſtice of that GREAT NATION, (as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultingly call themſelves) towards America. At a very early period of their revolution we acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged their exiſtence as a republic, and formally received their ambaſſador; for which act we haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded the diſpleaſure of the principal powers of Europe then leagued againſt them, and war with the moſt formidable of them all. We ſent them our bread when their ports were blockaded, and they were in a ſtarving condition. We even went ſo far as to pay into their hands, and long before it became due, the debt which we had contracted with their good king, whom they had moſt inhumanly murdered. Our merchants were ſeduced to carry them the rich produce of our ſoil; and, to the eternal infamy of that ſwindling republic, they yet remain entirely unpaid, or elſe have been obliged to receive depreciated paper. Our veſſels have been embargoed in their ports, to the very great damage of their owners; our merchants have been plundered, for years together, to the amount of millions; the ſtipulations of our ſolemn treaty
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034646_0023_0FFF4581C7627120"/>
with them have been continually violated;—and all this injurious treatment was given us under the frivolous pretext of <hi>imperious neceſſity;</hi> the ſenſe of which phraſe is more intelligibly expreſſed in the high-wayman's words; <hi>your purſe or your life.</hi>—The deſpots of France have continually interfered in the concerns of our government, from which they have endeavoured, by their ſpies, their bribes, and their nefarious and artful intrigues, to divide the body of the people. They have treated our chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates with the utmoſt indignity and contempt: they have perſuaded the people to deſpiſe and vilify their rulers, to controul the authorities conſtituted by themſelves to act in their behalf, and to eſtabliſh a ſyſtem of diſorganization and a wild, unprincipled, democracy, in place of our preſent rational liberty, which is ſupported by law and order.—All theſe aggravated wrongs, all this accumulation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited injury and abuſe, we have forborne to reſent, ſtill hoping for redreſs from that generoſity and juſtice which are innate in the human heart. We have uſed every mean of conciliation compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the dignity and honour of an independent, ſovereign, people.—Our government firſt ſent over to them a gentleman of the higheſt reſpectability, with full powers to adjuſt all exiſting differences; but he was ſpurned from their preſence, and treated with the moſt marked contempt. But, duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating the great bleſſing of peace, our Preſident ſtill perſiſted in his conciliatory conduct; and, to the gentleman, whom they had already refuſed, he joined two others of our moſt diſtinguiſhed citizens, fondly flattering himſelf, that this mark of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and deference would produce its proper effect. But no ſooner do they arrive, than they are treated with the moſt ſovereign indignity. Still they wait with patience: they ſupplicate: they

ſuffer every degradation to effect a reconciliation,<note n="*" place="bottom">While this diſcourſe was preparing for the preſs, the memorial of our envoys made its appearance. Their <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>adulatory</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the tyrants of France can <hi>ſcarcely</hi> be excuſed by the ardent deſire of peace which dictated it. In every thing elſe it muſt be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to the honeſt pride of true Americans.</note> or even an interview, with the inſolent uſurpers of deſpotic power.—And what is the anſwer which their agents return to all theſe humiliations? It is this, my friends: "<hi>You muſt firſt put into our hands thirty-three millions of dollars, as a free gift and as a loan; that is, more ſilver than can be carried in a hundred waggons, each loaded with a ton weight: and all this enormous ſum only to be admitted into our ſublime preſence, in order to be told, whether, and on what terms, we will make peace with you; for which peace, if we condeſcend to make it, you muſt give us as many millions of dollars as we ſhall be graciouſly pleaſed to demand; and our demand ſhall not be regulated by the juſtice of your claims which we acknowledge and laugh at, but by our power to exact and by your ability to pay</hi>—<hi>and if you refuſe theſe conditions; if you do not give us, as long as you have any thing to give; we will ravage your coaſts; we will treat you as we have treated Holland, Geneva, Genoa, and the other republics; nay, we will deſtroy you as a nation, and parcel you out to whomſoever we pleaſe, as we have done with the moſt ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public in the world,</hi> VENICE, <hi>which we had but juſt before declared free and independent.</hi>" Such is the ſubſtance of the anſwer given to our envoys by the haughty ſultans of France—and is there a ſingle freeman in America, whether a native or a foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe blood does not boil within him at the bare mention of ſo much inſolence, and who does not reply to it, in the language of our envoys; <hi>we will make one manly ſtruggle before we comply?</hi>

            <p>THOUGH many may have been miſled, <hi>in time paſt,</hi> from want of proper information, and from
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034646_0025_0FFF458BA4F7BAD8"/>
an opinion that France was fighting in the cauſe of liberty, no one now, ſince their iniquitous and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive conduct towards this country has come to light, unleſs he be a hired villain, or naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in confuſion, bloodſhed and rapine, can find the leaſt apology for them.—The charm of the word <hi>liberty,</hi> with which they have ſo long faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the ignorant and unwary, is now diſſolved. Honeſt men can now openly and freely expreſs their ſentiments, without any dread of that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, hectoring faction, which has ſo long terrified peaceable people into ſilence, and, in ſome meaſure, over-awed our government.</p>
            <p>FROM a review of what has been ſaid, we ſee great cauſe of humiliation, before God, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme depravity of the human heart. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the uſurpers and people of France, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what men are capable of, when they renounce their God and religion, and give themſelves up to their paſſions.—We ſhould alſo be humbled, in the divine preſence, on conſidering, that we are, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> the partial cauſes of the awful judgments which are abroad in the world: nor muſt we flatter our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with being leſs guilty than others, becauſe we are leſs ſeverely chaſtiſed. Our ſituation hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto has been truly enviable. While we bewail the crimes by which we have merited God's anger, and deprecate his wrath, we ought to give him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned thanks for all our bleſſings. While a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the civilized, chriſtian, world has, for ſeveral ſucceſſive years, heard nothing but the din of arms and the confuſion of war; we have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the happy effects of tranquillity and peace.—While Jacobiniſm, by which I mean the principles of anarchy, diſorganization, plunder and murder, has ſpread its baleful influence throughout the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt portions of the univerſe, it has evidently made
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034646_0026_0FFF458D2C884C90"/>
but ſmall progreſs in America, notwithſtanding the unwearied efforts which have been made for its propagation. That this is the caſe, is now very viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible from the unanimous determination, which has burſt forth, from one end of the Union to the other, to ſupport our happy government, and to ſacrifice every thing rather than to ſubmit to national de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation: an unanimity, in my view, far greater than that which prevailed during our revolutionary war. In that war, many of our moſt reſpectable and virtuous citizens were on the ſide of Great-Britain from real motives of loyalty and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but no American can plead loyalty, relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, conſcience, or any other honourable motive, for diſſenting, from the body of his countrymen, in the noble ſtand they are now making againſt the moſt unjuſt, imperious, inſulting and impious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that inhabits the globe. None but the baſeſt and moſt treaſonable of motives can influence ſuch a wretch. I hope, my brethren, there is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual among you all, who does not feel the ſame patriotic enthuſiaſm which animates the breaſts of <hi>native</hi> citizens. Beſides the motives for indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the generality of <hi>them</hi> have, againſt the vile miſcreants of France who wiſh to lord it over the world, you, as <hi>Catholics,</hi> have a motive yet more powerful; which is, that they have profaned and deſtroyed your churches, barbarouſly oppreſſed, baniſhed, and murdered, your biſhops, prieſts, monks and nuns; and have carried their audacity ſo far, as to lay their ſacrilegious, polluted, hands on the Lord's anointed, the viſible head of the church, the common father of all the faithful.—May we, then, never again hear from the mouth of any Iriſh Catholic, that he rejoices at every vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and applauds every action, of the French, becauſe they are the enemies of his Engliſh oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034646_0027_0FFF458EB7B736D0"/>
Granting the reality of the oppreſſion of which you complain, and that you have ſuffered it all <hi>purely</hi> on account of your attachment to the catholic faith, which has been the glory of your nation from St. Patrick to the preſent day: yet what has this in common with the defence of the conſtitution, the government and laws of united America?—This country has received you into her boſom with the greateſt affection: ſhe makes you partakers of the ſame privileges and<note n="*" place="bottom">I SPEAK here of the federal government; for, in ſeveral of the ſtates, as in Maſſachuſetts, Roman Catholics are ſubjected to certain diſqualifications.</note> immunities which her native ſons enjoy: ſhe takes under her protection your lives, property and religion. The moſt of you are probably ſettled her for life: many of you have wives and children, to whom you are tenderly attached, and whoſe welfare, as well as your own, is intimately connected with the welfare of the country. It is, therefore, evidently your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that America remain free and independent, in order that the bleſſings of liberty and good gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment may be tranſmitted to your poſterity. It would be the height of baſeneſs and ingratitude not to join heart and hand in defending the land where you earn your bread, and enjoy all the happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which reſult from ſocial life. England, which you deem your enemy and oppreſſor, it is true, is grappling with the nation which is now plundering and inſulting us. It is not, for that reaſon, the cauſe of England that we are called to defend.—I know, that, to engage the ignorant and unwary on the ſide of France, it has been ſaid by her partiſans, that ſhe is defending the cauſe of all the oppreſſed, throughout the world, againſt their tyrants, and the cauſe of republicaniſm againſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy: but this language is too ſtale to paſs current,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034646_0028_0FFF459151C299B0"/>
at this time, even with the moſt uninformed; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince ſhe has ſwallowed up all the republics of the old world.—France is the great oppreſſor of the univerſe; and, therefore, oppoſition to her is ths <hi>common cauſe of the human race</hi> againſt their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, plunderers and murderers: it is the <hi>cauſe of every regular government, and of all civilized ſociety</hi> againſt diſorganization, anarchy and terror: it is <hi>the cauſe of all religion and virtue</hi> againſt deiſm, athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and every ſpecies of immorality: it is <hi>your</hi> cauſe; it is <hi>my</hi> cauſe; it is every <hi>honeſt</hi> man's cauſe: it is a cauſe, in which are deeply intereſted our lives, our property, our liberty, our conſcience, our every thing that is dear to us for time and eternity.—Fly, then, to the ſtandard of this country; and oppoſe, by every mean in your power, all the open or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious attacks of the enemy. Cheerfully ſubſcribe your names to the addreſs of this town to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Union, in which an offer of life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is made to him for the efficient defence of the country. No neutrality, my brethren: "<hi>he that is not with me, is againſt me,</hi>" is as true with reſpect to the land that feeds you, as with reſpect to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—Avoid all thoſe men who ſeek to inflame your paſſions againſt England, in order to range you on the ſide of France. Read none of thoſe ſeditious, lying, papers, in which our own rulers, the men of our choice, and all their meaſures, are perpetually villified, calumniated, and miſrepreſented, and in which every thing that is done by the French, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abſurd, inconſiſtent and infamous, is forever extolled, and held up as the model of perfection;—papers which, with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> for their motto, are always replete with <hi>falſehood</hi> and with the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>ſlaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF you wiſh to eſcape the horrors which jacobin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm has produced in France, and wherever elſe its
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034646_0029_0FFF4593E345A1F0"/>
peſtilential maxims have gained ground, you muſt ſtrive to deſtroy it in the bud; that is, you muſt ſuppreſs all inſubordination, diſobedience, or even diſreſpect, towards your civil rulers, as well as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your eccleſiaſtical ſuperiors. You have heard much of <hi>the rights of man,</hi> it is high time now to attend to <hi>the duties of man.</hi> Remember, that no one can ever have a <hi>right to do wrong,</hi> and that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reſpect to your lawfully eſtabliſhed rulers are among your ſtricteſt <hi>duties.</hi> The contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is extremely wrong and ſinful.—A ſpirit of diſobedience and revolt is ſtrangely prevalent among children and ſervants. This is, at preſent, a very general complaint;<note n="*" place="bottom">WITHOUT being a prophet or the ſon of a prophet, I venture to predict, that proper ſubordination, among the youth of this town, can never be re-eſtabliſhed, until the mode and degree of correction be again placed in the hands of the ſchool-maſters.
