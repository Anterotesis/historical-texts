            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS we believe it to be the Expreſs Command of our bleſſed Saviour <hi>Matth. 5.34 Not to swear at all,</hi> and that therefore we refuſe to ſwear in any caſe ſo it is chiefly the Subject of the following undertaking to ſhew that our Teſtimony therein is truly conſistent with the harmonious Belief and Teſtimony of divers Primitive Chriſtians, famous Fathers godly Martyrs &amp; learned Proteſtants, leaving behind for brevity ſake many more that might be inſtanced: for though Chriſtianity hath ſuſtained a great Degeneracy in this and alſo many other things, yet there was often found many of great Account in the Church Godly Witneſſes that kept up and bore a faithful Teſtimony to the Doctrine of our Lord in this Matter.</p>
            <p>Our Teſtimonies are abſtracted and taken from a book called a Treatiſe of Oaths, as mentioned in the Title Page in which book our Friends Reaſons againſt Swearing in any Caſe are largely ſet forth and then fortified with divers Teſtimonies of excellent Men &amp; Chriſtians; but that it may not ſwell too bulky we at preſent chuſe to collect &amp; abſtract ſuch of them as appear most ſuitable to our preſent Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Pages of the ſaid book are ſet down at the End of each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that they may readily as well as more at large be found.</p>
            <p>Our deſire in this Work is firſt to inform thoſe who among our ſelves may be ignorant how our Chriſtian Doctrine hath been kept to and maintained by the moſt Antient, as well as modern Christians. Secondly, that thoſe our Neighbours and others who are not of our Perſwaſion in this caſe and may think ſometimes themſelves unſafe under our plain Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may ſee that the ſentiments of their &amp; our Predeceſſors,
<pb facs="unknown:001578_0003_0FB3D9B5E67E2810"/>
called Fathers in the Church (in Reſpect to Chriſt's Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the little Security there is in Oaths) were exactly one with us in this matter.</p>
            <p>And we deſire our Neighbours to conſider, that our Penſilvania plain Attest (to wit) <hi>I ſolemnly promiſe &amp;c.</hi> we had in the beginning of our Settlement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here, and afterwards by Law Eſtabliſhed by Coll. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> and was confirm'd by <hi>King William,</hi> and was practiſed among us, before and ſince, that time for about twenty years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any known Prejudice to any one, either in Perſon or Eſtate: and until an Order from the <hi>Queen</hi> was procured to put in practice the Engliſh Affirmation.</p>
            <p>We alſo think it pertinent to this preſent work to deſire all to conſider, that in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>Meniſts,</hi> who are a conſiderable Body of ſober Religious People, and who cann't for Conſcience ſake take an Oath, nor, as is ſaid bear A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that they were ſo tolerated, appears by Letters ſent from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to the Inhabitants of <hi>Middelburgh,</hi> part of one of which Letters is as followeth the ſaid Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first ſhewed that the ſaid People ſupplicated him for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ef in reſpect to Oaths, ſaith thus, —
<q>Seeing they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not deſire any thing elſe, than to live in the Liberty of their Conſciences, upon which Account this preſent war againſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath been by his Subjects ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, &amp; all Ceremonies contrary thereunto reſiſted: in which ſuch Advance is, through the help of God, made, that the aforeſaid Liberty of Conſcience is preſerved, and
<pb facs="unknown:001578_0004_0FB3D9B756D53318"/>
therefore it would be an unequal thing to deprive the Supplicants thereof who have helped to acquire the ſame by bearing Taxes, Contributions and other Burthens &amp;c. Eſpecially ſeeing the aforeſaid Petitioners do proffer, that their Yea paſſing for an Oath, the Tranſgreſſor ſhall be puniſhed as Oath—breakers; therefore his Excellency having conſidered the premiſſes, and having maturely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated upon the ſame, hath, with the previous Advice of the Governour and Council of <hi>Zealand,</hi> Ordered that the aforeſaid Petitioners <hi>Yea,</hi> ſhall be received, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the aforeſaid City inſtead of an Oath, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the Tranſgreſſors ſhall be puniſhed as Oathbreakers. <bibl>Page 162.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This was done in the year <hi>1577,</hi> and we hear nothing but they continue ſo to this day — And in <hi>Hoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ſaid, the <hi>Prince</hi> anſwered ſharply, viz.
<q>That theſe men's Yea muſt paſs for an Oath, or we muſt confeſs that the Papiſts had Reaſon enough to force us to a Religion contrary to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcien'ces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in a Treaty of peace, between the States General, Kings of Spain, England &amp;c. <hi>Anno 1674</hi> there is a Special Article that all Ship Maſters of Merchant ſhips ſhall carry along with them a ſea Brief, declaring that the Maſter did upon Oath teſtifie that ſuch ſhip did properly belong &amp;c. — Yet the ſolemn Affirmation of thoſe who cannot ſware is there taken inſtead of an Oath, and then their Certificate runs thus, viz.
<q>Theſe are to Certify &amp;c. that <hi>A. B.</hi> hath ſolemnly Affirmed and Declared that the Ship &amp;c. <bibl>

            <p>From which it is obſervable, That though thoſe People cannot <hi>ſwear,</hi> no, nor bear Arms, yet paying their Taxes and Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as they declared in their ſaid Supplication they had freely done equal with others,) they had free Liberty to dwell, trade and merchandize among them, upon their bear Yea and Nay, or upon their plain and ſolemn Affirming or Declaring this or that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>Now behold Friendly, Reader, Is not here <hi>a Series</hi> of Chriſtian Teſtimonies, of the Antient and Famous Men of the Church, from the Apoſtle <hi>James's</hi> time downwards, againſt taking any <hi>Oath, or Swearing at all,</hi> and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more might be brought; yet in as much as accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proverb, there is nothing can be ſaid but ſome may Object againſt it, and knowing many objections to theſe two poſitive Precepts, of our LORD and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James,</hi> are brought to oppugn their ſaid Doctrine as profeſſed by us (<hi>viz.) Not to ſwear in any Caſe</hi> we think it therefore needful, what in us lies, to remove thoſe objections, and that chiefly in the very words of the forementioned, and other Famous and Learned Men, as cited in the ſaid Treatiſe of Oaths, ſtill citing the pages where to find them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. St. Paul ſaith, That an Oath for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to them an End of all ſtrife. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though Paul as it were indefinitely ſpeaking, ſaith That among men it was ſo yet it does not follow that it was always, nor at any time, univerſally ſo: for in page 37. of the ſaid Treatiſe, we read that the <hi>Eſſaeans</hi> the moſt Religions People among the Jews, ſhun'd Oaths as Perjury, and cites <hi>Joſeph. de Bello Judaico</hi> l 2. c. 7. and in page 30. cites <hi>Sociad.</hi> in <hi>Stob.</hi> 28. ſaying It was one part of the Doctrine of the Seven Sages ſo famous in <hi>Greece;</hi> That men ought not to Swear. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more in the ſaid Treatiſe are cited both of Jews and Gentiles, even before Chriſt's time, that denied-Swearing. And cites <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> l. 16, ſaying That the <hi>Perſians</hi> (which was a great People) gave the Right Hand as a

Token of Truth Speaking, and he that did it deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully was counted more deteſtable than if he had ſworn. <hi>page</hi> 28. (Mark) did they not then eſteem Swearing deteſtable? Again in page 29. cites <hi>Quint. Curt. in Vit Alex.</hi> What the <hi>Scythians</hi> (alſo a Great Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> upon the occaſion of an expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Security, thus, Think not that the <hi>Scythians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm 'their Friedſhip by Oath; they Swear by keeping 'their Word. And we find <hi>Chryſostom</hi> ſaying, That before <hi>Abraham's</hi> time, which was about 2000 Years after the Creation, there was not an Oath; and then Queries, <hi>Whence then came in an Oath?</hi> and anſwers, 'When Evils increaſed, when all things became topſy turvy, when they inclined to Idolatry, then verily, when they appear'd unfaithful, they call'd God to witneſs, as giving Surety for ſecurity for their words &amp;c, <hi>page</hi> 83. However, were they more or leſs that in <hi>Paul's</hi> time, or ſince that, did or do ſwear, the Queſtion is not what men did, or now do, but what the Lord &amp; Saviour of men has commanded to do, which is, <hi>Not to Swear at all.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It ſeems then that Chriſt forbidding to Swear by the Heaven, forbad to Swear by the true God: for he that Swears by Heaven, Swears by the Throne of God, &amp; by him that ſits thereon which ſurely is the True God. <hi>Matt.</hi> 23 22. And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, That Chriſt to put off the hearers that they ſhould not Swear by God, he ſaith neither by Heaven, for it is God's Throne &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 37.</p>
