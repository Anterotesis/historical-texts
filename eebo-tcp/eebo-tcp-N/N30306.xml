            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very incongruous to Reaſon, to think I can have any Hand, or be any Way concerned in this Plot, if theſe Things be duly weighed, That after the Diſcovery of the Conſpiracy, and the Execution of many for it, that I ſhould act ſuch a lunatick Part, if I was guilty, as to continue in this City, join with Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> and not only ſo, but publickly advertize myſelf for teaching of Grammar; yea further, that I ſhould ſtill continue, even after the Caution Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> gave me, a Week and a few Days before I was taken into Cuſtody: He told me, that Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> told him, that the Eyes of this City were fixed on me, and that I was ſuſpected to be a <hi>Roman Prieſt,</hi> and thought to be in the Plot. I anſwered, my Innocency would protect me, I valued not what the World ſaid in that Caſe: Again, another Inſtance that muſt free me from this Plot, is, when Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi> went to take Poſſeſſion of <hi>Hewſon</hi>'s Houſe, his Daughter refuſing to go out, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a <hi>Life-Guard</hi> Man, I took up the Cauſe, Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi> not exerting himſelf as I thought was proper at that Time, and told her, that if ſhe would not go out quietly, I would take another Method with her, for I would have no ſuch wicked Perſon live where I was to dwell. Now, Reaſon muſt pronounce me Innocent, for had I been engaged in their Schemes, my Guilt, my Fears would have forced me to have acted in a very different Manner; rather to have ſoothed her, and gave her Liberty to ſtay till provided for, inſtead of not ſhewing her the leaſt Countenance. And further, what corroborates my Non-Knowledge of this Plot, is, That the Negroe, who confeſs'd, as it is ſaid, that he ſet Fire to the Fort, did not mention me in all his Confeſſion. If he was bound by any Oath or Oaths, as he confeſs'd it ſhewed he thought it or them of no Value; doubtleſs he would have confeſs'd and laid open the whole Scheme, and all
<pb facs="unknown:040262_0002_1015D5C6B16687B8"/>
the Perſons he knew concerned in it, but more eſpecially the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as is ſaid I am. And what is ſtill more ſtrong for my Innocency, is, That neither <hi>Hewſon,</hi> his Wife, nor the Creature that was hanged with them, nor any that have been put to Death ſince, did once name me.</p>
            <p>Certainly <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if I am a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as you take me to be, I could not be ſo fooliſh to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> a Halter for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as there is a great, unknown and tremendous Being, whom we call God, I never ſaw <hi>Hewſon,</hi> his Wife, nor the Creature that was hanged with them, to my Knowledge, living, dying or dead; nor the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe that is ſaid to have fired the Fort, excepting in his laſt Moments. But put the Caſe, I had known <hi>Hewſon,</hi> and had been at his Houſe, is it to be inferr'd from thence, that I muſt be acquainted with his Villany, or know his Secrets? And as he kept a Publick Houſe, which is open and free for all, is it reaſonable to think, that all, or any Man's being ſeen at <hi>Hewſon</hi>'s, muſt make him or them culpable or chargeable with his Villany? Surely, No: For if ſo, ſad would be the Caſe of many Gentlemen, who, in travelling the Countries in <hi>England,</hi> have uſed bad Houſes or Inns, and lit into the Company of Highway-Men, who by their Garb and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they have taken for ſome honeſt Country Gentlemen or Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and theſe Highway-Men have been taken up, while in Company, and yet thoſe Perſons have not in the leaſt been ſuſpected, much leſs come into any Trouble. But I fear all that this Trouble of mine ſprings from, is grounded upon the Apprehenſions of my being a <hi>Roman Prieſt,</hi> and therefore muſt be a Plotter; for, ſay they in the Chain of general Woes, <hi>The firſt and the laſt Link is moſt commonly tied to the Prieſt's Girdle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I muſt aſſure you, from Reading and Converſation, I believe no Prieſt would hold Confederacy with Negroes; they are too wiſe, too cunning, to truſt ſuch Sort of Gentry. It is not Men of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, good Senſe, and Learning, they care to meddle with or entruſt, in ſuch Affairs as Plots, excepting they be Men of their own Kidney, of their own Way of Thinking in Religion, ſuppoſing a Prieſt could be ſo fooliſh, or become ſo <hi>Non compos mentis,</hi> as to plot. In ſhort, a Prieſt, a joint Contriver of Firing a Fort, a Celebrater of Maſſes, a Diſpencer of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, as it is ſaid I am, ſo long paſſed by, ſuch a particular Perſon, forgotten! No, Gentlemen, you muſt think and believe, he would have been the next Perſon, after the Diſcovery of the Plot, that would have been brought on the Carpet. And further, what is of great Note, is, That <hi>Hewſon,</hi> at the firſt Diſcovery of the Plot, was ſworn to be the whole Projector and Carrier on of the Plot. And if theſe Witneſſes knew me ſo well as they pretend to now, how came it about, what I not know any Thing of me before I came to Priſon? Doubtleſs, they would have been eager to have betrayed me, when the Scheme was diſcovered; for, being a Prieſt, and conſequently artful and cunning, they would have been afraid of my Eſcaping. No, if I had been engaged, they would have ſoon informed, thinking to have ſaved their own Lives, knowing how this Government ſtands affected to ſuch Gentlemen as I am ſaid to be, namely, a Prieſt.</p>
