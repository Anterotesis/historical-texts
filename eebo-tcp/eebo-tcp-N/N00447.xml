            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GEntlemen, the great God, by his Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence, hath brought about such a Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> as doubtless no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story can parrallel, unless that in Sacred Writ, of delivering the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and this, I think, is little Inferiour to that, if we consider it in all its circumstances: And now, Gentlemen, having a <hi>King</hi> after our own Hearts, one that is as Truly and Rightfully our <hi>King</hi> as ever was in <hi>England,</hi> I know not what can be more clearly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, unless God had sent us one immediately from Heaven it self, and said from thence, by a loud Voyce, <hi>You Good Men of</hi> England, <hi>this Man I have sent down to be your</hi> King: We have the Voyce that is next unto this, that is, <hi>Vox Populie,</hi> The Voyce of the People; and that by a common saying is <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> the Voice of God: And you Gentlemen, the Good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> have engaged this our <hi>King</hi> upon as Good and Glorious a Work as ever by a Man was undertaken; that is, to pull down the Great <hi>French Bear,</hi> that <hi>most Christian Turk,</hi> the Great Tyrant of the Earth, and Hater of Mankind; you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to this our Good <hi>King,</hi> to stand by him with your Lives and Fortunes; and he in order to facilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this Great and Good Work, hath engaged potent Allyes both by Sea and Land to help you; and now things stand in so fair a way, and you have laid your Hand to the Plough, look not back; for not only our <hi>King</hi>'s Honour, but Yours, and all that is dear to you is Engaged to go on; and leave not off until by Gods help you have finished the Work; it is a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, great and good Work; and no Trifling and Jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Business; therefore it concerns you Highly, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and Dilligently, without loss of any more time Heartily to assist the <hi>King</hi> in this Business; and your Assistance must be a threefold Assistance. The First, with advice; the <hi>Second,</hi> with <hi>Money</hi> and the Third with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> if other of these in their place and time is wanting, you cannot expect to have the Work done. All Men agree, that <hi>Money</hi> is the Sinnews of <hi>War,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi> to these Sinnews; but it is <hi>good Advice</hi> that is the <hi>Blood</hi> &amp; <hi>Brains</hi>; that makes these <hi>Sinnews, Flesh</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi> to move regularly; therefore says the Wise-man, <hi>With good Advice make War</hi>; and when once begun, I am sure <hi>Good Advice</hi> is absolutely necessary to carry it on: therefore I say, Advise the <hi>King</hi> what Men to chuse as most fit to be used in all <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; its not beneath the <hi>King</hi> in this Great and Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affair to take your Advice, as believing him to be a Wise-man; and the wisest of Kings has said, <hi>In the multitude of Councellors there is safety</hi>; you have seen the false steps that have been already taken, and what Loss and Dammage, besides Disgrace, that has been thereby; and who have been the Advisers therein, nor only in the never to be forgotten miscarriage in the Fleet last Year, but those before in <hi>Yrland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> it self, and else where; I say, it is your duty to Advise the taking in of Faithful Labourers into this Harvest, Men of approved Honour, Courage, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and Integrity; the <hi>King</hi> will stand in need of the help of all the Hands and Hearts of his Good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in this Work, here will be Work for all the Dogs to Bait this Bear. 'Tis not all the <hi>God Dammy-Dogs</hi> in <hi>England</hi> that will take this <hi>French Bear</hi> by the Nose and pull him down; no, it must be all the Dogs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whether <hi>Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independant, Annabaptist, Quietist</hi> and <hi>Jansenist</hi>; all sorts must have a Hand in this Work; yea, <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, all but that one sort of <hi>Jesuited Papists,</hi> and those are the fast Friends of this great <hi>French Tyrant,</hi> and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray all to him where ever they are Intrusted; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any such be in <hi>England,</hi> in any disguise, they are not to be Trusted, but a watchful Eye ought to be upon them. A <hi>Second</hi> Sort, not to be Employed nor Trusted, are those that have been the <hi>Betrayers of the Nation</hi> under the late Reigns, those that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reigns had brought the Nations almost to <hi>Deaths Door,</hi> are the Men that would make the Cure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of them as Tedious and as Chargeable as they can, that so the Nations might never have time to call them to a Reckoning: I will never chuse him to be my Doctor, that has once endeavoured to Poyson me: I will never put him in a great Post to help pull down <hi>France,</hi> that has been a chief Instrument to raise him up to his Greatness; that has been a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and made his own Fortunes by Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nations to him, as far as was in his Power. I hope, Gentlemen, amongst the <hi>Honest Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> there is not such a Barrenness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, but that a Number sufficient may be found out as may be able with the <hi>King</hi> to carry on this great Work with Courage and Conduct; such as have been Faithful to the Nations Interest under the late Reign and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Your Neighbours will be soon weary in helping you, if you play any more foul play with them, and will not take right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to help your selves; and if it be Work enough for you altogether, I doubt you will find it too hard a Task for your selves alone, if they be justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to leave you to his Rage; for the <hi>Bear</hi> would willingly give them Honourable Terms, so that they would but leave you alone, to be under his Paws; therefore shew your selves Wise and Honest Men whilst you have so good Neighbours to help you: In order therefore to the speedy carrying on this Great and Good Work, lay a good foundation, clear away all the <hi>Rubbish,</hi> begin first amongst your selves, see your own House first swept and cleansed; from all Filth of Dust and Rubbish, and cleansed from Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs and Spiders, and other Vermin: chuse such to Represent you that are Men of <hi>Honour, Vertue, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi>; and not by the <hi>Great Estate,</hi> the <hi>Great Titles,</hi> the <hi>fine Laced Coats,</hi> the <hi>fine smoothed Tongues,</hi> who only can make thereby fine Speeches, to make the better Bargains for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by making Markets of you. Chuse none to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present you that are of little narrow Souls, Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing and Self-seeking Fellows, that will Sell you to the <hi>French King</hi> for a Place or Pension; Let none Represent you that have had either: Sell not your <hi>Birth-Right</hi> for a <hi>Mess of Pottage</hi>; Sell not your <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> for <hi>Strong-Beer</hi> and ROST BEEF: Let not the <hi>Black-Gown</hi> of <hi>Lawyer</hi> or <hi>Gospeller</hi> be Consulted by you, in your choice, but if they will make a Noyse for this or the other, unless you know them well in your own Judgment to be Honest Men; be you sure otherwise to go contrary to them; for those two sorts are seldom in the right, if they are, its for the most part against their Wills: without you make a good Choice your selves, and cleanse your own House of the Dust and Rubbish, you cannot expect to perswade the other House to cleanse theirs.</p>

            <p>But methinks I hear some Object, and say, <hi>The</hi> Commons <hi>of</hi> England <hi>are for a</hi> Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>If by a <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> is meant a <hi>Common Good,</hi> that I dare say every honest man is for; but if by a <hi>Common Wealth</hi> is meant <hi>a Government vvithout a</hi> King; that I do believe is not meant nor designed by any honest Man: But I do believe, that there are a sort of persons that do buz such things into the King's Ears, to make him jealous of his People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to disable him from doing any great things, and by that means serve the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and may have good store of <hi>Levvedores</hi> for their pains: but I doubt not but the King will see through the Designs of this sort of men, that they are nothing but Shams and Lyes, done on purpose to abuse him, and to secure themselves from the Justice of the Nation. This farther I will boldly say, Those that buz these things in the Kings Ears, if any such be, they are the Kings greatest Enemies, and would Mislead the King to follow the Course of the last Reigns, on purpose to bring all into Confusion, knowing no other and better way to serve their dearly beloved <hi>French King,</hi> and themselves escape Vengeance. I doubt not but the King sees his rtue Interest, and will stick by those good Motives that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to hazard all to Rescue these Nations from Popery and Slavery; and the King is so wise a Man, that no old or new <hi>treacherous corrupted Courtiers</hi> shall ever make a <hi>Division</hi> and <hi>Jealousie</hi> between <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>People</hi>; it is that which they foment for their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, but hope they shall never attain it: I dare be bold to answer for the honest People of <hi>England,</hi> they are willing to keep in their old state of <hi>Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; between a <hi>Common VVealth,</hi> and an <hi>Absolute Government of Tyranny</hi>: but the old <hi>Troublers</hi> of our <hi>Israel</hi> will prevent our Peace and good Settlement, if they can.</p>
            <p>I know, in some forreign parts it hath been cast in the Teeth of the <hi>English, That they are a Quarrelsome, Disquiet, and Troublesome People, and are never satisfied, but are almost every Age Quarrelling vvith their</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>falling-out vvith their</hi> Kings, <hi>and no</hi> King <hi>can please them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer, I dare affirm, that the plain honest People of <hi>England</hi> are as <hi>Quiet</hi> and as <hi>Governable</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as any People in the World; but if in an Ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing <hi>King</hi>'s Reign, he shall, with the Help of his <hi>Flattering</hi> and <hi>Ill designing Courtiers</hi> and <hi>Evil Councellors,</hi> with some pickt out of the Scum of the <hi>Commons,</hi> shall with them endeavour to undermine their <hi>Liberties,</hi> and invade their <hi>Properties,</hi> and by <hi>Oppressing</hi> some and <hi>Destroying</hi> others, by illegal Practices, then none can wonder if the <hi>Commons</hi> stir in defence of their <hi>Religion, Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> as was our Case under the late Reigns; and some evil men are so impudent already as to be nibling at the same sport again; but I hope the King sees it, and will hearken to the Voice of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and then things will go well; for it is the Strength of the Bodies and Purses of the <hi>Commons</hi> must do the <hi>French</hi> Business, and not a few flattering <hi>Scicophants,</hi> that were <hi>against</hi> his being <hi>King,</hi> and would now lift Him out of the Throne again, if the <hi>Commons</hi> did not stand by Him; those <hi>false Flatterers,</hi> with the help of the Jesuits Journey men, are making way for the French King as fast as they can; they some of them above board make a Noise for King <hi>James,</hi> but in reality join with the Jesuits for King <hi>Levves</hi>; He that has but half an Eye may see it; and most of the Priests are at that lay now, that they care not if the <hi>Devil vvere King,</hi> for then they cannot miss of being his Priests and Favorites, and have Power from him to plague the rest of M<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Gentlemen, was it not high time for the <hi>Commons</hi> to stir in this last Revolution, when all lay at the last gasp, brought to pass by the then Evil Ministers of State and Evil Councellors, with the Help of the Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits?

No, not until their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are chopped off; there is a way will break all their Measures, and that very quickly too, if you can but once hit on it; but Temporizing will never do the Work; the Plough will never do good Work, and go on cleverly, that is drawn by an Ox and an Ass, let one Plough be drawn all by one Sort, and another by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sort; and see which makes best Work, and most riddance; a faithful, willing, dilligent Servant will dispatch more in a Day, than he that is only an Eye-Servant will do in two; if you will do fine Work, you must use fine Tools; and if you will do Honest Work, you must imploy Honest Men.</p>
