         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE, BY A LADY.</head>
            <head>Written in 1724.</head>
            <p>I WAS going, like common editors, to advertiſe the reader of the beauties and excellencies of the work laid before him: To tell him that the illuſtrious author had oportunities, that other travellers, whatever their quality or curioſity may have been, cannot obtain; and a genius capable of making the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every opportunity. But if the reader, after peruſing <hi>one</hi> letter only, has not diſcernment to diſtinguiſh that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural elegance, that delicacy of ſentiment and obſervation, that eaſy gracefulneſs, and lovely ſimplicity (which is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of writing) and in which theſe <hi>Letters</hi> exceed all that have appeared in
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:041644_0004_101AD1688138DDC0"/>
this kind, or almoſt in any other, let him lay the book down, and leave it to thoſe who have.</p>
            <p>The noble author had the goodneſs to lend me her M. S. to ſatisfy my curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in ſome enquiries I had made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her travels; and when I had it in my hands, how was it poſſible to part with it? I once had the vanity to hope I might acquaint the public, that it owed this invaluable treaſure to my importunities. But alas! the moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious author has condemned it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity during her life; and conviction, as well as deference, obliges me to yield to her reaſons. However, if theſe <hi>Letters</hi> appear hereafter when I am in my grave, let this attend them, in teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to poſterity, that among her cotemporaries, <hi>one</hi> woman, at leaſt, was juſt to her merit.</p>
            <p>There is not any thing ſo excellent, but ſome will carp at it, and the rather, becauſe of its excellency. But to ſuch hypercritics, I ſhall only ſay * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I am malicious enough to deſire, that the world ſhould ſee, to how much better purpoſe the LADIES tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel than their LORDS; and that,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:041644_0005_101AD16AA1C779E8"/>
whilſt it is ſurfeited with <hi>Male-Travels,</hi> all in the ſame tone, and ſtuft with the ſame trifles; a lady has the ſkill to ſtrike out a new path, and to embelliſh a worn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubject, with variety of freſh and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant entertainment. For beſides the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity and ſpirit which enlivens every part, and that inimitable beauty which ſpreads through the whole; beſides the purity of the ſtyle, for which it may be juſtly accounted the ſtandard of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tongue; the reader will find a more true and accurate account of the cuſtoms and manners of the ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with whom this lady converſed, than he can in any other author. But as her ladyſhip's penetration diſcovers the inmoſt follies of the heart, ſo the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of her temper paſſed over them with an air of pity rather than reproach; treating with the politeneſs of a court, and the gentleneſs of a lady, what the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>verity of her judgment could not but condemn.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, let her own ſex at leaſt, do her juſtice, lay aſide diabolical Envy, and its <hi>Brother</hi> Malace<note n="*" place="bottom">This fair and elegant prefacer has reſolved, that <hi>Malice</hi> ſhould be of the Maſculine Gender: I believe it is both <hi>Maſculine</hi> and <hi>Feminine,</hi> and I heartily wiſh it were <hi>Neuter.</hi>

company, ſly whiſpering, cruel back-biting, ſpiteful detraction, and the reſt of that hideous crew, which I hope are very falſely ſaid to attend the <hi>Tea-Table,</hi> being more apt to think they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thoſe public places where virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous women never come. Let the men malign one another, if they think ſit, and ſtrive to pull down merit when they cannot equal it. Let us be better natured, than to give way to any unkind or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectful thought of ſo bright an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſex, merely becauſe ſhe has better ſenſe; for I doubt not but our hearts will tell us, that this is the real and unpardonable offence, whatever may be pretended. Let us be better Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than to look upon her with an evil eye, only becauſe the giver of all good gifts has entruſted and adorned her with the moſt excellent talents. Rather let us freely own the ſuperiority of this ſublime genius, as I do in the ſincerity of my ſour, pleaſed that a <hi>woman</hi> triumphs, and proud to follow in her train. Let us offer her the palm which is ſo juſtly her due: and if we pretend to any laurels, lay them willingly at her feet.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT OF THE EDITOR.</head>
            <p>THE editor of theſe Letters, who during his reſidence at Venice, was honoured with the eſteem and friendſhip of their ingenious and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant author, preſents them to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, for the two following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it was the manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Lady M—y W—y M—e, that this SELECT COLLECTION of her Letters ſhould be communicated to the public: an intention declared, not only to the Editor, but to a few more choſen friends, to whom ſhe gave co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of theſe incomparable Letters.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> and principal reaſon that has engaged the Editor to let this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſee the light, is, that the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe letters will be an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal monument to the memory of Lady M—y W—y; and will ſhew, as long as the Engliſh language endures,
<pb facs="unknown:041644_0009_101AD173E0D53E30"/>
the ſprightlineſs of her wit, the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of her judgment, the extent of her knowledge, the eligance of her taſte, and the excellence of her <hi>real</hi> character.</p>
            <p>The SELECT COLLECTION, here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, was faithfully tranſcribed from the original manuſcript of her ladyſhip at Venice.</p>
            <p>The Letters from <hi>Ratisbon, Vienna, Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Peterwaradin, Belgrade, Adrianople, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Pera, Tunis, Genoa, Lions,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> are, certainly, the moſt curious and intereſting part of this publication; and both in point of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> are, to ſay no more of them, ſingularly worthy of the curioſity and attention of all <hi>men of taſte,</hi> and even of all <hi>women of faſhion.</hi> As to thoſe female readers, who read for improvement, and think their beauty an inſipid thing if it is not ſeaſoned by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual charms, they will find in theſe Letters what they ſeek for, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in their author, an ornament and model to their ſex.</p>

            <p>I FLATTER myſelf (dear ſiſter) that I ſhall give you ſome pleaſure in letting you know that I have ſafely paſſed the ſea, though we had the ill fortune of a ſtorm. We were perſuaded by the captain of the yatcht to ſet out in a calm, and he pretended there was nothing ſo eaſy as to tide it over; but, after two days ſlowly moving, the wind blew ſo hard, that none of the ſailors could keep their feet, and we were all Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night toſſed very handſomely. I never ſaw a man more frighted than the captain. For my part, I have been ſo lucky, neither to ſuffer from fear nor ſea-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; tho', I confeſs, I was ſo impatient to ſee myſelf once more upon dry land, that I would not ſtay till the yatcht could get to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> but went in a long-boat to <hi>Helvoetſluys,</hi> where we had voitures to carry us to <hi>Briel.</hi> I was charmed with the neatneſs of that little town; but my arrival at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> preſented me a new ſcene of pleaſure. All the ſtreets are paved with broad ſtones, and before many of the meaneſt artificers doors are placed ſeats of various coloured marbles, ſo neatly kept, that I aſſure you, I walked almoſt all over the town yeſterday, <hi>incognito,</hi> in my ſlippers, without receiving one ſpot of dirt: and you may ſee the Dutch maids waſhing the pavement of the ſtreet, with more application than ours do our bed-chambers. The town ſeems ſo full of people, with ſuch buſy faces, all in
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:041644_0011_101AD1778D8D40E8"/>
motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not ſome celebrated fair; but I ſee it is every day the ſame. 'Tis certain no town can be more advantageouſly ſituated for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Here are ſeven large canals, on which the merchants ſhips come up to the very doors of their houſes. The ſhops and warehouſes are of a ſurprizing neatneſs and magnificence, filled with an incredible quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fine merchandize, and ſo much cheaper than what we ſee in England, that I have much ado to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf I am ſtill ſo near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be ſeen. One is not ſhocked with thoſe loathſome cripples, ſo common in London, nor teized with the importunity of idle fellows and wenches, that chooſe to be naſty and lazy. The common ſervants and little ſhop-women, here, are more nicely clean, than moſt of our ladies, and the great variety of neat dreſſes (every woman dreſſing her head after her own faſhion) is an additional pleaſure in ſeeing the town. You ſee, hitherto, I make no complaints, dear ſiſter, and, if I continue to like travelling as well as I do at preſent, I ſhall not repent my project. It will go a great way in making me ſatisfied with it, if it affords me an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of entertaining you. But it is not from Holland, that you muſt expect a <hi>diſintereſted</hi> offer. I can write enough in the ſtile of Rotterdam, to tell you plainly, in one word, that I expect returns of all the London news. You ſee I have already learnt to make a good bargain, and that it is not for nothing I will ſo much as tell you, I am, Your affectionate ſiſter.</p>

            <p>I MAKE haſte to tell you, dear Madam, that after all the dreadful fatigues you threatened me with, I am hitherto very well pleaſed with my journey. We take care to make ſuch ſhort ſtages every day, that I rather fancy myſelf upon parties of pleaſure, than upon the road, and ſure nothing can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland. The whole country appears a large garden; the roads are well paved, ſhaded on each ſide with rows of trees, and boarded with large canals, full of boats, paſſing and repaſſing. Every twenty paces gives you the proſpect of ſome villa, and every four hours, that of a large town, ſo ſurpriſingly neat, I am ſure you would be charmed with them. The place I am now at, is certainly one of the fineſt villages in the world. Here are ſeveral ſquares finely built, and, (what I think a particular beauty) the whole ſet with thick large trees. The <hi>Voor-hout</hi> is, at the ſame time, the Hide Park and Mall of the people of quality; for they take the air in it both on foot and in coaches. There are ſhops for wafers, cool liquors, &amp;c. I have been to ſee ſeveral of the moſt celebrated gardens, but I will not teize you with their deſcriptions. I dare ſwear you think my letter already long enough. But I muſt not conclude without begging your pardon, for not obeying your commands, in ſending the lace you ordered me. Upon my word I can yet find none, that is not dearer than you may buy in London. If you want any India goods, here are great variety of penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths, and I ſhall follow your orders with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and exactneſs, being, Dear Madam, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>I AM extremely ſorry, my dear S. that your fears of diſobliging your relations, and their fears for your health and ſafety, have hindered me from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happineſs of your company, and you the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a diverting journey. I receive ſome degree of mortification from every agreeable novelty, or pleaſing proſpect, by the reflection of your having ſo unluckily miſſed the delight which I know it would have given you. If you were with me in this town, you would be ready to expect to receive viſits from your <hi>Nottingham</hi> friends. No two places were ever more reſembling; one has but to give the <hi>Maeſe</hi> the name of the <hi>Trent,</hi> and there is no diſtinguiſhing the proſpect. The houſes, like thoſe of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> are built one above another, and are intermixed, in the ſame manner, with trees and gardens. The Tower, they call <hi>Julius Caeſar'</hi>s, has the ſame ſituation with <hi>Nottingham</hi> Caſtle; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help fancying I ſee from it, the <hi>Trent-field, Adboul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> places ſo well known to us. 'Tis true, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications make a conſiderable difference. All the learned in the art of war, beſtow great commendations on them; for my part, that know nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall content myſelf with telling you, 'tis a very pretty walk on the ramparts, on which there is a tower, very deſervedly called the <hi>Belvidera,</hi> where people go to drink coffee, tea, &amp;c. and enjoy one of the fineſt proſpects in the world. The public walks have no great beauty, but the thick ſhade of the trees, which is ſolemnly delightful. But I muſt not forget to take
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:041644_0014_101AD17E4FA474A0"/>
notice of the bridge, which appeared very ſurpriſing to me. It is large enough to hold hundreds of men, with horſes and carriages. They give the value of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh two-pence to get upon it, and then away they go, bridge and all, to the other ſide of the river, with ſo slow a motion, one is hardly ſenſible of any at all. I was yeſterday at the French church, and ſtared very much at the manner of ſervice. The parſon clapped on a broad-brimed hat in the firſt place, which gave him entirely the air of, <hi>what d'ye call him,</hi> in Bartholomew fair, which he kept up by extraordinary antic geſtures, and preaching much ſuch ſtuff, as t'other talked to the puppets. However the congregation ſeemed to receive it with great devotion; and I was informed, by ſome of his flock, that he is a perſon of particular fame amongſt them. I believe by this time, you are as much tired with my account of him, as I was with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; but I am ſure your brother will excuſe a digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in favour of the church of England. You know, ſpeaking diſreſpectfully of the Calviniſts, is the ſame thing as ſpeaking honourably of the church. Adieu, my dear S. always remember me, and be aſſured, I can never forget you, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>IF my lady—could have any notion of the fatigues that I have ſuffered theſe two laſt days, I am ſure ſhe would own it a great proof of regard, that I now ſit down to write to her. We hired horſes from Nimeguen hither, not having the conveniency of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:041644_0015_101AD1809D051B90"/>
poſt, and found but very indifferent accommodations at Reinberg, our firſt ſtage; but it was nothing to what I ſuffered yeſterday. We were in hopes to reach Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logn; our horſes tired at Stamel, three hours from it, where I was forced to paſs the night in my clothes, in a room, not at all better than an hovel; for though I have my bed with me, I had no mind to undreſs, where the wind came from a thouſand places. We left this wretched lodging at day break, and about ſix, this morning, came ſafe here, where I got immediately into bed. I ſlept ſo well for three hours, that I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perfectly recovered, and have had ſpirits enough to go and ſee all that is curious in the town, that is to ſay, the churches, for here is nothing elſe worth ſeeing. This is a very large town, but the moſt part of it is old built. The Jeſuits church, which is the neateſt, was ſhewed me, in a very complaiſant manner, by a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome young Jeſuit; who, not knowing who I was, took a liberty in his compliments and ralleries, which very much diverted me. Having never before ſeen any thing of that nature, I could not enough admire the magnificence of the altars, the rich images of the ſaints (all maſſy ſilver) and the <hi>enchaſures</hi> of the relicks, though I could not help murmuring in my heart, at the profuſion of pearls, diamonds, and rubies, beſtowed on the adornment of rotten teeth and dirty rags. I own that I had wickedneſs enough to covet <hi>St. Urſula'</hi>s pearl necklace; though perhaps this was no wickedneſs at all, an image not being certainly one's neighbour; but I went yet farther, and wiſhed the wench herſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into dreſſing plate. I ſhould alſo gladly ſee converted into ſilver, a great <hi>St. Chriſtopher,</hi> which I imagine would look very well in a ciſtern. Theſe were my pious reflections; though I was very well ſatisfied to ſee, piled up to the honour of our nation, the ſkulls
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041644_0016_101AD182D0E3F980"/>
of the Eleven Thouſand Virgins. I have ſeen ſome hundreds of relicks here of no leſs conſequence; but I will not imitate the common ſtile of travellers ſo far, as to give you a liſt of them; being perſuaded, that you have no manner of curioſity for the titles given to jaw bones and bits of worm-eaten wood.—Adieu, I am juſt going to ſupper, where I ſhall drink your health in an admirable ſort of Lorrain wine, which I am ſure is the ſame you call Burgundy in London, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>AFTER five days travelling poſt, I could not ſit down to write on any other occaſion than to tell my dear Lady, that I have not forgot her obliging command of ſending her ſome account of my travels. I have already paſſed a large part of Germany, have ſeen all that is remarkable in Cologn, Frankfort, Wurtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, and this place. 'Tis impoſſible not to obſerve the difference between the free towns, and thoſe under the government of abſolute princes, as all the little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns of Germany are. In the firſt there appears an air of commerce and plenty. The ſtreets are well built and full of people, neatly and plainly dreſſed. The ſhops are loaded with merchandize, and the commonalty are clean and cheerful. In the other you ſee a ſort of ſhabby finery, a number of dirty people of quality taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out; narrow naſty ſtreets out of repair, wretchedly thin of inhabitants, and above half of the common ſort aſking alms. I cannot help fancying one, under the figure of a clean Dutch citizen's wife, and the other
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:041644_0017_101AD185986ADEA8"/>
like a poor town lady of pleaſure, painted, and rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boned out in her head-dreſs, with tarniſhed ſilver-laced ſhoes, a ragged under-petticoat, a miſerable mixture of vice, and poverty.—They have ſumptuary laws in this town, which diſtinguiſh their rank by their dreſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the exceſs which ruins ſo many other cities, and has a more agreeable effect to the eye of a ſtranger, than our faſhions. I need not be aſhamed to own, that I wiſh theſe laws were in force in other parts of the world. When one conſiders impartially, the merit of a rich ſuit of clothes in moſt places, the reſpect and the ſmiles of favour it procures, not to ſpeak of the envy and ſighs it occaſions (which is very often the principal charm to the wearer) one is forced to confeſs, that there is need of an uncommon underſtanding, to reſiſt the temptation of pleaſing friends and mortifying rivals; and that it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to young people to fall into a folly, which betrays them to that want of money, which is the ſource of a thouſand baſeneſſes. What numbers of men have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the world with generous inclinations, that have afterwards been the inſtruments of bringing miſery on a whole people, being led by a vain expence into debts that they could clear no other way, but by the forfeit of their honour, and which they never could have contracted, if the reſpect the multitude pays to habits, was fixed by law, only to a particular colour or cut of plain cloth. Theſe reflections draw after them others that are too melancholy. I will make haſte to put them out of your head by the farce of relicks, with which I have been entertained in all Romiſh churches.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> are not quite free from theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. I have ſeen here, in the principal church, a large piece of the Croſs ſet in jewels, and the point of the ſpear, which, they told me, very gravely, was the ſame that pierced the ſide of our Saviour. But I was
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:041644_0018_101AD1871B413BE0"/>
particularly diverted in a little Roman catholic church which is permitted here, where the profeſſors of that religion are not very rich, and conſequently cannot adorn their images in ſo rich a manner as their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For not to be quite deſtitute of all finery, they have dreſſed up an image of our Saviour over the altar, in a fair full-bottomed wig, very well powdered. I imagine I ſee your ladyſhip ſtare at this article, of which you very much doubt the veracity; but upon my word, I have not yet made uſe of the privilege of a traveller, and my whole account is written with the ſame plain ſincerity of heart, with which I aſſure you that I am, dear Madam, your &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>I HAD the pleaſure of receiving yours, but the day before I left London. I give you a thouſand thanks for your good wiſhes, and have ſuch an opinion of their efficacy, that, I am perſuaded, I owe, in part, to them the good luck of having proceeded ſo far on my long journey without any ill accident. For I don't reckon it any, to have been ſtopped, a few days, in this town by a cold, ſince it has not only given me an opportunity of ſeeing all that is curious in it, but of making ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the ladies, who have all been to ſee me with great civility, particularly <hi>Madame</hi>—, the wife of our King's envoy from Hanover. She has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to all the aſſemblies, and I have been magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently entertained at her houſe, which is one of the fineſt here. You know that all the nobility of this
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:041644_0019_101AD189429F5B30"/>
place are Envoys from different States. Here are a great number of them, and they might paſs their time agreeably enough, if they were leſs delicate on the point of ceremony. But inſtead of joining in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of making the town as pleaſant to one another as they can, and improving their little ſocieties, they amuſe themſelves no other way, than with perpetual quarrels, which they take care to eternize, by leaving them to their ſucceſſors; and an envoy to Ratisbon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, regularly, half a dozen quarrels, among the perquiſites of his employment. You may be ſure the ladies are not wanting, on their ſide, in cheriſhing and improving theſe important <hi>piques,</hi> which divide the town almoſt into as many parties, as there are families. They chooſe rather to ſuffer the mortification of ſitting almoſt alone on their aſſembly nights, than to recede one jot from their pretenſions. I have not been here above a week, and yet I have heard from almoſt every one of them, the whole hiſtory of their wrongs, and dreadful complaints of the injuſtice of their neighbours, in hopes to draw me to their party. But I think it very prudent to remain neuter, though if I was to ſtay amongſt them, there would be no poſſibility of continuing ſo, their quarrels running ſo high, that they will not be civil to thoſe that viſit their adverſaries. The foundation of theſe everlaſting diſputes, turns entirely upon rank, place, and the title of Excellency, which they all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and what is very hard, will give it to no body. For my part I could not forbear adviſing them (for the public good) to give the title of Excellency to every body, which would include the receiving it from every body; but the very mention of ſuch a diſhonourable peace, was received with as much indignation, as Mrs. <hi>Blackaire</hi> did the motion of a reference. And indeed, I began to think myſelf ill-natured, to offer to take from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:041644_0020_101AD18B65A469E0"/>
them, in a town where there are ſo few diverſions, ſo entertaining an amuſement. I know that my peaceable diſpoſition already gives me a very ill figure, and that 'tis <hi>publicly</hi> whiſpered as a piece of impertinent pride in me, that I have hitherto been fancily civil to every body, as if I thought no body good enough to quarrel with. I ſhould be obliged to change my behaviour, if I did not intend to purſue my journey in a few days. I have been to ſee the churches here, and had the permiſſion of touching the relics, which was never ſuffered in places where I was not known. I had, by this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, the opportunity of making an obſervation, which I doubt not might have been made in all the other churches, that the emeralds and rubies which they ſhow round their relics and images, are moſt of them falſe; though they tell you that many of the <hi>Croſſes</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donas,</hi> ſet round with theſe ſtones, have been the gifts of Emperors and other great Princes. I don't doubt indeed but they were at firſt jewels of value; but the good fathers have found it convenient to apply them to other uſes, and the people are juſt as well ſatisfied with bits of glaſs. Amongſt theſe relics, they ſhewed me a prodigious claw ſet in cold, which they called the claw of a Griffin, and I could not forbear aſking the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prieſt that ſhewed it, whether the Griffin was a Saint? The queſtion almoſt put him beſide his gravity; but he anſwered, they only kept it as a curioſity. I was very much ſcandalized at a large ſilver image of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> where the <hi>Father</hi> is repreſented under the figure of a decrepit old man, with a beard down to his knees, and triple crown on his head, holding in his arms. the Son, fixed on the Croſs, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in the ſhape of a dove hovering over him. Madam—is come this minute to call me to the aſſembly, and forces me to tell you very abruptly, that I am ever your, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>I AM now, my dear ſiſter, ſafely arrived at Vienna, and I thank God, have not at all ſuffered in my health, nor (what is dearer to me) in that of my child, by all our fatigues. We travelled by water from Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, a journey perfectly agreeable, down the Danube, in one of thoſe little veſſels, that they, very properly, call wooden houſes, having in them all the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a palace, ſtoves in the chambers, kitchens, &amp;c. they are rowed by twelve men each, and move with ſuch an incredible ſwiftneſs, that in the ſame day you have the pleaſure of a vaſt variety of proſpects, and within the ſpace of a few hours you have the pleaſure of ſeeing a populous city, adorned with magnificent palaces, and the moſt romantic ſolitudes, which appear diſtant from the commerce of mankind, the banks of the Danube being charmingly diverſified with woods, rocks, mountains covered with vines, fields of corn, large cities and ruins of antient caſtles. I ſaw the great towns of Paſſau and Lintz, famous for the retreat of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court, when Vienna was beſieged. This town, which has the honour of being the Emperor's reſidence, did not at all anſwer my expectation, nor ideas of it, being much leſs than I expected to find it; the ſtreets are very cloſe, and ſo narrow, one cannot obſerve the fine fronts of the palaces, though many of them very well deſerve obſervation, being truly magnificent. They are all built of fine white ſtone, and are exceſſive high. For as the town is too little for the number of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that deſire to live in it, the builders ſeem to have projected to repair that miſfortune, by clapping
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:041644_0022_101AD18FB6EE9770"/>
one town on the top of another, moſt of the houſes being of five, and ſome of them of ſix ſtories. You may eaſily imagine that, the ſtreets being ſo narrow, the rooms are extremely dark, and what is an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency much more intolerable in my opinion, there is no houſe has ſo few as five or ſix familes in it. The apartments of the greateſt ladies, and even of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of ſtate, are divided, but by a partition, from that of a taylor or ſhoe-maker, and I know no body that has above two floors in any houſe, one for their own uſe, and one higher for their ſervants. Thoſe that have houſes of their own, let out the reſt of them, to whoever will take them, and thus the great ſtairs (which are all of ſtone) are as common and as dirty as the ſtreet. 'Tis true, when you have once travelled through them, nothing can be more ſurpriſingly magnificent than the apartments. They are commonly a <hi>ſuite</hi> of eight or ten large rooms, all inlaid, the doors and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows richly carved and gilt, and the furniture ſuch as is ſeldom ſeen in the palaces of foreign princes in other countries. Their apartments are adorned with hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the fineſt tapeſtry of Bruſſels, prodigious large looking-glaſſes in ſilver frames, fine japan tables, beds, chairs, canopies and window curtains of the richeſt Genoa damaſk or velvet, almoſt covered with gold lace or embroidery. All this is made gay by pictures and vaſt jars of japan china, and large luſtres of rock cryſtal. I have already had the honour of being invited to dinner by ſeveral of the firſt people of quality, and I muſt do them the juſtice to ſay, the good taſte and magnificence of their tables very well anſwer to that of their furniture. I have been more than once entertained with fifty diſhes of meat, all ſerved in ſilver, and well dreſſed; the deſſert proportionable, ſerved in the fineſt china. But the variety and richneſs of their wines, is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:041644_0023_101AD191DFFF0E28"/>
what appears the moſt ſurpriſing. The conſtant way is, to lay a liſt of their names upon the plates of the gueſts along with the napkins, and I have counted ſeveral times, to the number of eighteen different ſorts, all exquiſite in their kinds. I was yeſterday at Count <hi>Schoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn,</hi> the vice-chancellor's garden, where I was invited to dinner. I muſt own, I never ſaw a place ſo perfectly delightful as the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of Vienna. It is very large, and almoſt wholly compoſed of delicious palaces. If the Emperor found it proper to permit the gates of the town to be laid open, that the Fauxbourgs might be joined to it, he would have one of the largeſt and beſt built cities in Europe. Count Schoonbourn's villa is one of the moſt magnificent; the furniture all rich brocades, ſo well fancied and fitted up, nothing can look more gay and ſplendid; not to ſpeak of a gallery, full of rarities of coral, mother of pearl, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole houſe a profuſion of gilding, carving, fine paintings, the moſt beautiful porcelain, ſtatues of alabaſter and ivory, and vaſt orange and lemon trees in gilt pots. The dinner was perfectly fine and well ordered, and made ſtill more agreeable by the good humour of the Count. I have not yet been at court, being forced to ſtay for my gown, without which there is no waiting on the Empreſs; though I am not without great impatience to ſee a beauty that has been the admiration of ſo many different nations. When I have had that honour, I will not fail to let you know my real thoughts, always taking a particular pleaſure in communicating them to my dear ſiſter.</p>

               </gap>t, I have not yet repented my ſeeing it. Nothing of That kind ever was more magnificent; and I can eaſily believe, what I am told, that the decorations and habits coſt the Emperor thirty thouſand pounds ſterling. The stage was built over a very large canal, and at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſecond act, divided into two parts, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the water, on which there immediately came, from different parts, two fleets of little gilded veſſels, that gave the repreſentation of a naval fight. It is not eaſy to imagine the beauty of this ſcene, which I took par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of. But all the reſt were perfectly fine in their kinds. The ſtory of the Opera is the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Alcina,</hi> which gives opportunities for great
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:041644_0025_101ABF9233F116B0"/>
variety of machines and changes of the ſcenes, which are performed with a ſurpriſing ſwiftneſs. The theatre is ſo large that 'tis hard to carry the eye to the end of it, and the habits in the utmoſt magnificence to the number of one hundred and eight. No houſe could hold ſuch large decorations; but the ladies all ſitting in the open air, expoſes them to great inconveniencies; for there is but one canopy for the imperial family; and the firſt night it was repreſented, a ſhower of rain happening, the opera was broke off, and the company crowded away in ſuch confuſion, that I was almoſt ſqueezed to death.—But if their operas are thus delightful, their comedies are, in as high a degree, ridiculous. They have but one play-houſe, where I had the curioſity to go to a German comedy, and was very glad it happened to be the ſtory of Amphitrion. As that ſubject has been already handled by a Latin, French and Engliſh poet, I was curious to ſee what an Auſtrain author would make of it. I underſtand enough of that language to comprehend the greateſt part of it, and beſides I took with me a lady that had the goodneſs to explain to me every word. The way is to take a box, which holds four, for yourſelf and company. The fixed price is a gold ducat. I thought the houſe very low and dark; but I confeſs the commedy admirably recompenſed that defect. I never laughed ſo much in my life. It begun with <hi>Jupiter'</hi>s falling in love out of a peep-hole in the clouds, and ended with the birth of <hi>Hercules.</hi> But what was moſt pleaſant was the uſe Jupiter made of his metamorphoſis, for you no ſooner ſaw him under the figure of <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> but inſtead of flying to <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mena,</hi> with the raptures Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> puts into his mouth, he ſends for Amphitrion's taylor, and cheats him of a laced coat, and his banker of a bag of money, a Jew of a diamond ring, and beſpeaks a great ſupper in his name;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:041644_0026_101AD1986E8A7978"/>
and the greateſt part of the comedy turns upon poor Amphitrion's being tormented by theſe people for their debts. <hi>Mercury</hi> uſes <hi>Soſia</hi> in the ſame manner. But I could not eaſily pardon the liberty the poet has taken of larding his play with, not only indecent expreſſions, but ſuch groſs words as I don't think our mob would ſuffer from a mountebank. Beſides, the two Soſia's very fairly let down their breeches in the direct view of the boxes, which were full of people of the firſt rank that ſeemed very well pleaſed with their entertainment, and aſſured me this was a celebrated piece. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my letter with this remarkable relation, very well worthy the ſerious conſideration of Mr. Collier. I won't trouble you with farewell compliments, which I think generally as impertinent, as courtiſies at leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the room when the viſit has been too long already.</p>

            <p>THOUGH I have ſo lately troubled you, my dear ſiſter, with a long letter, yet I will keep my promiſe in giving you an account of my firſt going to Court. In order to that ceremony, I was ſqueezed up in a gown, and adorned with a Gorget and the other implements thereunto belonging, a dreſs very inconvenient, but which certainly ſhows the neck and ſhape to great advantage. I cannot forbear giving you ſome deſcription of the faſhions here, which are more monſtrous and contrary to all common ſenſe and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:041644_0027_101AD19B56956AF8"/>
reaſon, than 'tis poſſible for you to imagine. They build certain fabrics of gauſe on their heads, about a yard high, conſiſting of three or four ſtories fortified with numberleſs yards of heavy ribbon. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this ſtructure is a thing they call a <hi>Bourlé,</hi> which is exactly of the ſame ſhape and kind, but about four times as big as thoſe rolls our prudent milk-maids make uſe of to fix their pails upon. This machine they cover with their own hair, which they mix with a great deal of falſe, it being a particular beauty to have their heads too large to go into a moderate tub. Their hair is prodigiouſly powdered to conceal the mixture, and ſet out with three or four rows of bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins (wonderfully large, that ſtick out two or three inches from their hair) made of diamonds, pearls, red, green and yellow ſtones, that it certainly requires as much art and experience to carry the load upright, as to dance upon May-day with the garland. Their whalebone petticoats outdo ours by ſeveral yards cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, and cover ſome acres of ground. You may eaſily ſuppoſe how this extraordinary dreſs ſets off and improves the natural uglineſs, with which God Almighty has been pleaſed to endow them, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking. Even the lovely Empreſs herſelf is obliged to comply, in ſome degree, with theſe abſurd faſhions, which they would not quite for all the world. I had a private audience (according to ceremony) of half an hour, and then all the other ladies were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come and make their court. I was perfectly charmed with the Empreſs; I cannot however tell you that her features are regular; her eyes are not large, but have a lively look full of ſweetneſs; her complexion the fineſt I ever ſaw; her noſe and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head well made, but her mouth has ten thouſand charms, that touch the ſoul. When ſhe ſmiles, 'tis
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:041644_0028_101AD19D8EEB6D70"/>
with a beauty and ſweetneſs, that forces adoration. She has a vaſt quantity of fine fair hair; but then her perſon!—one muſt ſpeak of it poetically to do it rigid juſtice; all that the poets have ſaid of the mien of <hi>Juno,</hi> the air of <hi>Venus,</hi> come not up to the truth. The <hi>Graces</hi> move, with her; the famous ſtatue of Medicis was not formed with more delicate proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; nothing can be added to the beauty of her neck and hands. Till I ſaw them, I did not believe there were any in nature ſo perfect, and I was almoſt ſorry that my rank here did not permit me to kiſs them; but they are kiſſed ſufficiently, for every body, that waits on her, pays that homage at their entrance, and when they take leave. When the ladies were come in, ſhe ſat down to <hi>Quinze.</hi> I could not play at a game I had never ſeen before, and ſhe ordered me a ſeat at her right hand, and had the goodneſs to talk to me very much, with that grace ſo natural to her. I expected every moment, when the men were to come in to pay their court; but this drawing-room is very different from that of England; no man enters it but the grand maſter, who comes in to advertiſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of the approach of the Emperor. His Imperial Majeſty did me the honour of ſpeaking to me in a very obliging manner, but he never ſpeaks to any of the other ladies, and the whole paſſes with a gravity and air of ceremony that has ſomething very formal in it. The Empreſs Amelia, dowager of the late Emperor Joſeph, came this evening to wait on the reigning Empreſs, followed by the two arch-ducheſſes her daughters, who are very agreeable young prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. Their Imperial Majeſties roſe and went to meet her at the door of the room, after which ſhe was ſeated in an armed chair next the Empreſs and in the ſame manner at ſupper, and there the men had the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:041644_0029_101AD1B12EA8BF78"/>
permiſſion of paying their court. The arch-ducheſſes ſat on chairs with backs without arms. The table was entirely ſerved and all the diſhes ſet on by the Empreſſes maids of honour, which are twelve young ladies of the firſt quality. They have no ſalary, but their chamber at court, where they live in a ſort of confinement, not being ſuffered to go to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies or public places in town, except in compliment to the wedding of a ſiſter maid, whom the Empreſs always preſents with her picture ſet in diamonds. The three firſt of them are called <hi>Ladies of the Key,</hi> and wear gold keys by their ſides; but what I find moſt pleaſant, is the cuſtom, which obliges them as long as they live, after they have left the Empreſs's ſervice, to make her ſome preſent every year on the day of her feaſt. Her Majeſty is ſerved by no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried women but the <hi>Grande Maitreſſe,</hi> who is generally a widow of the firſt quality, always very old, and is at the ſame time <hi>groom of the ſtole</hi> and mother of the maids. The dreſſes are not, at all, in the figure they pretend to in England, being looked upon no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as downright chamber-maids. I had an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence next day of the Empreſs-mother, a princeſs of great virtue and goodneſs, but who piques herſelf too much on a violent devotion. She is perpetually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming extraordinary acts of pennance, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever done any thing to deſerve them. She has the ſame number of maids of honour, whom ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to go in colours; but ſhe herſelf never quits her mourning; and ſure nothing can be more diſmal than the mourning here; even for a brother, there is not the leaſt bit of linen to be ſeen; all black crape inſtead of it. The neck, ears and ſide of the face are covered with a plated piece of the ſame ſtuff, and the face that peeps out in the midſt of it, looks as if it
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:041644_0030_101AD1B35921C6E0"/>
were pilloried. The widows wear over and above, a crape-forehead cloth, and in this ſolemn weed, go to all the public places of diverſion without ſcruple. The next day I was to wait on the Empreſs Amelia, who is now at her palace of retirement, half a mile from the town. I had there the pleaſure of ſeeing a diverſion wholly new to me, but which is the common amuſement of this court. The Empreſs herſelf was ſeated on a little throne at the end of the fine alley in her garden, and on each ſide of her were ranged two parties of her ladies of quality, headed by two young arch-ducheſſes, all dreſſed in their hair, full of jewels, with fine light guns in their hands, and at proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances were placed three oval pictures, which were the marks to be ſhot at. The firſt was that of a CUPID, filling a bumper of Burgundy, and the motto, <hi>"'Tis eaſy to be valiant here."</hi> The ſecond a FORTUNE holding a garland in her hand, the motto, <hi>"For her whom Fortune favours."</hi> The third was a SWORD with a laurel wreath on the point, the motto, <hi>"Here is no ſhame to the vanquiſhed."</hi>—Near the Empreſs was a gilded trophy wreathed with flowers, and made of little crooks, on which were hung rich Turkiſh handkerchiefs, tippets, ribbons, laces, &amp;c. for the ſmall prizes. The Empreſs gave the firſt with her own hand, which was a fine ruby ring ſet round with dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds in a gold ſnuff box. There was for a ſecond, a little Cupid ſet with brilliants, and beſides theſe a ſet of fine china for the tea table, enchaſed in gold, japan trunks, fans, and many gallantries of the ſame nature. All the men of quality at Vienna were ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators; but the ladies only had permiſſion to ſhoot, and the arch-ducheſs Amelia carried off the firſt prize. I was very well pleaſed with having ſeen this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and I do not know but it might make as good
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:041644_0031_101AD1B4DAFB8438"/>
a figure as the prize ſhooting in the AEneid, if I could write as well as Virgil. This is the favourite pleaſure of the Emperor, and there is rarely a week without ſome feaſt of this kind, which makes the young ladies ſkilful enough to defend a ſort. They laughed very much to ſee me afraid to handle a gun. My dear ſiſter, you will eaſily pardon an abrupt concluſion. I believe by this time you are ready to think I ſhall never conclude at all.</p>

            <p>I AM extremely rejoiced, but not at all ſurpriſed, at the long, delightful letter, you have had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſend me. I know that you can think of an abſent friend even in the midſt of a court, and you love to oblige, where you can have no view of a return, and I expect from you that you ſhould love me, and think of me, when you don't ſee me. I have compaſſion for the mortifications, that you tell me befal our little, old friend, and I pity her much more, ſince I know, that they are, only, owing to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cuſtoms of our country. Upon my word, if ſhe were here, ſhe would have no other fault but that of being ſomething too young for the faſhion, and ſhe has nothing to do but to tranſplant herſelf hither about ſeven years hence, to be again a young and blooming beauty. I can aſſure you that wrinkles, or a ſmall ſtoop in the ſhoulders, nay even grey hairs,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:041644_0032_101AD1B853C9E718"/>
are no objection to the making new conqueſts, I know you cannot eaſily figure to yourſelf, a young fellow of five and twenty, ogling my Lady <hi>S—ff—k</hi> with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or preſſing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and the Counteſs of O—d from an Opera. But ſuch are the ſights I ſee every day, and I don't perceive any body ſurpriſed at them but myſelf. A woman till five and thirty, is only looked upon as a raw girl, and can poſſibly make no noiſe in the world till about forty. I don't know what your ladyſhip may think of this matter, but 'tis a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comfort to me to know there is upon earth ſuch a paradiſe for old women, and I am content to be inſignificant at preſent, in the deſign of returning when I am fit to appear no where elſe. I cannot help lamenting on this occaſion, the pitiful caſe of too many Engliſh ladies, long ſince retired to prudery and rata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fia, whom if their ſtars had luckily conducted hither, would ſtill ſhine in the firſt rank of beauties. Beſides that perplexing word <hi>reputation,</hi> has quite another meaning here than what you give it at London, and getting a lover, is ſo far from loſing, that 'tis properly getting reputation; ladies being much more reſpected in regard to the rank of their lovers, than that of their husbands.</p>
            <p>But what you'll think very odd, the two ſects that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our whole nation of petticoats, are utterly unknown in this place. Here are neither <hi>Coquettes</hi> nor <hi>Prudes.</hi> No woman dares appear coquette enough to encourage two lovers at a time. And I have not ſeen any ſuch prudes, as to pretend fidelity to their husbands, who are certainly the beſt-natured ſet of people in the world, and look upon their wives' gallants as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as men do upon their deputies, that take the troubleſome part of their buſineſs off their hands. They have not however the leſs to do on that account;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:041644_0033_101AD1BA76D8D908"/>
for they are generally deputies in another place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; in one world, 'tis the eſtabliſhed cuſtom for every lady to have two husbands, one that bears the name, and another that performs the duties. And the engagements are ſo well known, that it would be a downright affront, and publicly reſented, if you invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a woman of quality to dinner, without, at the ſame time, inviting her two attendants of lover and husband, between whom ſhe ſits in ſtate with great gravity. The <hi>ſub-marriages</hi> generally laſt twenty years together, and the lady often commands the poor lover's eſtate, even to the utter ruin of his family. Theſe connections, indeed, are as ſeldom begun by any real paſſion, as other matches; for a man makes but an ill figure that is not in ſome commerce of this nature, and a woman looks out for a lover as ſoon as ſhe's married, as part of her equipage, without which ſhe could not be genteel, and the firſt article of the treaty is eſtabliſhing the penſion, which remains to the lady, in caſe the gallant ſhould prove inconſtant. This chargeable point of honour, I look upon as the real foundation of ſo many wonderful inſtances of conſtancy. I really know ſeveral women of the firſt quality, whoſe penſions are as well known as their annual rents, and yet no body eſteems them the leſs; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, their diſcretion would be called in queſtion if they ſhould be ſuſpected to be miſtreſſes for nothing. A great part of their emulation conſiſts in trying who ſhall get moſt; and having no intrigue at all is ſo far a diſgrace, that I'll aſſure you, a lady who is very much my friend here, told me but yeſterday, how much I was obliged to her for juſtifying my conduct in a converſation relating to me, where it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly aſſerted, that I could not poſſibly have common ſenſe, ſince I had been in town above a fortnight, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:041644_0034_101AD1BC00D42C68"/>
had made no ſteps towards commencing an amount. My friend pleaded for me that my ſtay was uncertain, and ſhe believed that was the cauſe of my ſeeming ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and this was all ſhe could find to ſay in my juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. But one of the pleaſanteſt adventures I ever met in my life; was laſt night, and it will give you a juſt idea, in what a delicate manner the <hi>Belles paſſions</hi> are managed in this country. I was at the aſſembly of the Counteſs of—, and the young Count of—leading me down ſtairs, aſked me how long I was to ſtay at Vienna; I made anſwer that my ſtay depended on the Emperor, and it was not in my power to determine it. Well, Madam, (ſaid he) whether your time here is to be longer or ſhorter, I think you ought to paſs it agreeably, and to that end you muſt engage in a <hi>little affair of the heart.</hi>—My heart (anſwered I gravely enough) does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage very eaſily, and I have no deſign of parting with it. I ſee, Madam, (ſaid he ſighing) by the ill nature of that anſwer, I am not to hope for it, which is a great mortification to me that am charmed with you. But, however, I am ſtill devoted to your ſervice, and ſince I am not worthy of entertaining you myſelf, do me the honour of letting me know, whom you like beſt amongſt us, and I'll engage to manage the affair entirely to your ſatisfaction. You may judge in what manner I ſhould have received this compliment in my own country; but I was well enough acquainted with the way of this, to know that he really intended me an obligation, and I thanked him with a very grave courteſy, for his zeal to ſerve me, and only aſſured him, I had no occaſion to make uſe of it. Thus you ſee, my dear, that gallantry and good breeding are as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, in different climates, as morality and religion. Who have the righteſt notions of both, we ſhall never
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:041644_0035_101AD1BDC28F5D70"/>
know till the Day of Judgment, for which great day of <hi>Eclairciſſement,</hi> I own there is very little impatience in your, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>I WAS never more agreeably ſurpriſed than by your obliging letter. 'Tis a peculiar mark of my eſteem, that I tell you ſo, and I can aſſure you, that if I loved you one grain leſs than I do, I ſhould be very ſorry to ſee it ſo diverting as it is. The mortal averſion I have to writing makes me tremble at the thoughts of a new correſpondent, and I believe I diſobliged no leſs than a dozen of my London acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by refuſing to hear from them, though I did verily think they intended to ſend me very entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letters. But I had rather loſe the pleaſure of reading ſeveral witty things, than be forced to write many ſtupid ones. Yet in ſpite of theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am charmed with the proof of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and beg a continuation of the ſame goodneſs, though I fear the dulneſs of this will make you imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately repent of it. It is not from Auſtria that one can write with vivacity, and I am already infected with the phlegm of the country. Even their amours and their quarrels are carried on with a ſurpriſing temper, and they are never lively, but upon points of ceremony. There, I own, they ſhew all their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and 'tis not long ſince two coaches meeting in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:041644_0036_101AD1BFF2F472E8"/>
a narrow ſtreet at night, the ladies in them not being able to adjuſt the ceremonial of which ſhould go back, ſat there with equal gallantry till two in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were both ſo fully determined to die upon the ſpot rather than yield, in a point of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that the ſtreet would never have been cleared till their deaths, if the Emperor had not ſent his guards to part them, and even then they refuſed to ſtir, till the expedient could be found out, of taking them both our in chairs, exactly in the ſame moment. After the ladies were agreed, it was with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, that the paſs was decided between the two coachmen, no leſs tenacious of their rank than the ladies. This paſſion is ſo omnipotent in the breaſts of the women, that even their husbands never die, but they are ready to break their hearts, becauſe that fatal hour puts an end to their rank, no widows hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any place at Vienna. The men are not much leſs touched with this point of honour, and they don't only ſcorn to marry, but even to make love to any woman of family not as illuſtrious as their own, and the pedigree is much more conſidered by them, than either the complexion or features of their miſtreſſes. Happy are the She's that can number amongſt their anceſtors, Counts of the Empire; they have neither occaſion for beauty, money, nor good conduct to get them husbands. 'Tis true as to money, 'tis ſeldom any advantage to the man they marry; the laws of Auſtria confine the woman's portion to two thouſand florins (about two hundred pounds Engliſh) and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have beſide, remains in their own poſſeſſion and diſpoſal. Thus here are many ladies much richer than their husbands, who are however obliged to allow them pin-money agreeable to their quality; and I attribute to this conſiderable branch of prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,

I am ſure you, that know my lazineſs and extreme indifference on this ſubject, will pity me, intangled amongſt all theſe ceremonies, which are a wonderful burden to me, though I am the envy of the whole town, having by their own cuſtoms the paſs before them all. They, indeed, ſo revenge upon the poor Envoys, this great reſpect ſhewed to Ambaſſadors, that (with all my indifference) I ſhould be very uneaſy to ſuffer it. Upon days of ceremony they have no entrance at court, and on other days muſt content themſelves with walking after every ſoul, and being the very laſt taken notice of.

They have many faſhions peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they think it indecent for a widow ever to wear green or roſe colour, but all the other gayeſt colours at her own diſcretion. The aſſemblies here are the only regular diverſion, the opera's being always at court, and commonly on ſome particular occaſion. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Rabutin</hi> has the aſſembly conſtantly every night at her houſe; and the other ladies, whenever they have a mind to diſplay the magnificence of their apartments, or oblige a friend by complimenting them on the day of their Saint, they declare, that on ſuch a day the aſſembly ſhall be at their houſe in honour to the feaſt of the Count or Counteſs—<hi>ſuch a one.</hi> Theſe days are called days of <hi>Gala,</hi> and all the friends or relations of the lady, whoſe Saint it is, are obliged to appear in their beſt clothes and all their jewels.

               </gap> now I am ſpeaking of Vienna, I am ſure you expect I ſhould ſay ſomething of the convents; they are of all ſorts and ſizes, but I am beſt pleaſed with that of <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> where the eaſe and neatneſs they ſeem to live with, appears to me much more edifying than thoſe ſtricter orders, where perpetual pennance and naſtineſſes muſt breed diſcontent and wretchedneſs. The nuns are all of quality. I think there are to the number of fifty. They have each of them, a little cell perfectly clean, the walls of which are covered with pictures, more or leſs fine, according to their quality. A long white ſtone gallery runs by all of them, furniſhed with the pictures of exemplary ſiſters; the chapel is extremely neat and richly adorned. But I could not forbear laughing at their ſhewing me a wooden head of our Saviour, which they aſſured me, ſpoke, during the ſiege of Vienna; and, as a proof of it, bid me remark his mouth, which had been open ever ſince. Nothing can be more becoming than the dreſs of theſe nuns. It is a white robe, the ſleeves of which are turned up with fine white callico, and their head dreſs the ſame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a ſmall veil of black crape that falls behind. They have a lower ſort of ſerving nuns, that wait on them as their chamber-maids. They receive all viſits of women, and play at ombre in their chambers with permiſſion of their Abbeſs, which is very eaſy to be obtained. I never ſaw an old woman ſo good-natured; ſhe is near fourſcore, and yet ſhews very little ſign of decay, being ſtill lively and cheerful. She careſſed me as if I had been her daughter, giving me ſome pretty things of her own work, and ſweetmeats in abundance. The grate is not one of the moſt rigid; it is not very hard to put a head through; and I don't doubt but a man, a little more ſlender than
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:041644_0040_101AD1C9799FF400"/>
ordinary, might ſqueeze in his whole perſon. The young Count of <hi>Salamis</hi> came to the grate, while I was there, and the Abbeſs gave him her hand to kiſs. But I was ſurpriſed to find here, the only beautiful young woman I have ſeen at Vienna, and not only beautiful but genteel, witty and agreeable, of a great family and who had been the admiration of the town. I could not forbear ſhewing my ſurpriſe at ſeeing a nun like her. She made me a thouſand obliging compliments, and deſired me to come often. It will be an infinite pleaſure to me(ſaid ſhe ſighing) but I avoid, with the greateſt care, ſeeing any of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acquaintance, and whenever they come to our convent, I lock myſelf in my cell. I obſerved tears come into her eyes, which touched me extremely, and I began to talk to her in that ſtrain of tender pity ſhe inſpired me with; but ſhe would not own to me, that ſhe is not perfectly happy. I have ſince endeavoured to learn the real cauſe of her retirement, without being able to get any other account, but that every body was ſurpriſed at it, and no body gueſſed the reaſon. I have been ſeveral times to ſee her; but it gives me too much melancholy to ſee ſo ageeable a young creature buried alive. I am not ſurpriſed that nuns have ſo often inſpired violent paſſions; the pity one naturally feels for them, when they ſeem worthy of another deſtiny, making an eaſy way for yet more tender ſentiments. I never in my life had ſo little charity for the Roman. Catholic religion, as ſince I ſee the miſery it occaſions; ſo many poor unhappy women! and then the groſs ſuperſtition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who are ſome or other of them, day and night, offering bits of candle to the wooden figures, that are ſet up in almoſt every ſtreet. The proceſſions I ſee very often are a pageantry, as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

            <p>I DESERVE not all the reproaches you make me. If I have been ſome time without anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your letter, it is not, that I don't know how many thanks are due to you for it; or that I am ſtupid enough to prefer any amuſements, to the pleaſure of hearing from you; but after the profeſſions of eſteem you have ſo obligingly made me, I cannot help delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as long as I can, ſhewing you, that you are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. If you are ſincere, when you ſay, you expect to be extremely entertained by my letters, I ought to be mortified at the diſappointment that I am ſure you will receive, when you hear from me; tho' I have done my beſt endeavours to find out ſomething worth writing to you. I have ſeen every thing that was to be ſeen with a very diligent curioſity. Here are ſome fine villa's, particularly, the late Prince of Lichtenſtein's; but the ſtatues are all modern, and the pictures not of the firſt hands. 'Tis true, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror has ſome of great value. I was yeſterday to ſee
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:041644_0042_101AD1CDCEC576B0"/>
the repoſitory, which they call his <hi>Treaſure,</hi> where they ſeem to have been more diligent in amaſſing a great quantity of things, than in the choice of them. I ſpent above five hours there, and yet there were very few things that ſtopped me long to conſider them. But the number is prodigious, being a very long gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery filled, on both ſides, and five large rooms. There is a vaſt quantity of paintings, amongſt which are many fine miniatures, but the moſt valuable pictures are a few of <hi>Corregio,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Titian</hi> being at the <hi>Favorita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cabinet of jewels did not appear to me ſo rich as I expected to ſee it. They ſhewed me here a cup, about the ſize of a tea diſh, of one entire <hi>emerald,</hi> which they have ſo particular a reſpect for, that only the Emperor has the liberty of touching it. There is a large cabinet full of curioſities of clock-work, only one of which I thought worth obſerving, that was a craw fiſh with all the motions ſo natural, that it was hard to diſtinguiſh it from the life.</p>
            <p>The next cabinet was a large collection of <hi>Agates,</hi> ſome of them extremely beautiful and of an uncommon ſize, and ſeveral vaſes of <hi>Lapis Lazuli.</hi> I was ſurpriſed to ſee the cabinet of medals ſo poorly furniſhed; I did not remark one of any value, and they are kept in a moſt ridiculous diſorder. As to the <hi>Antiques,</hi> very few of them deſerve that name. Upon my ſaying they were modern, I could not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the anſwer of the profound antiquary that ſhewed them, that <hi>they were ancient enough, for to his knowledge they had been there theſe forty years;</hi> but the next cabinet diverted me yet better, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a parcel of wax babies, and toys in ivory, very well worthy to be preſented to children of five years old. Two of the rooms were wholly filled
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:041644_0043_101AD1D0077729D0"/>
with theſe trifles of all kinds, ſet in jewels, amongſt which I was deſired to obſerve a crucifix, that they aſſured me had ſpoke very wiſely to the Emperor <hi>Leopold.</hi> I won't trouble you with a catalogue of the reſt of the lumber, but I muſt not forget to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſmall piece of loadſtone that held up an anchor of ſteel too heavy for me to lift. This is what I thought moſt curious in the whole treaſure. There are ſome few heads of ancient ſtatues; but ſeveral of them are defaced by modern additions. I foreſee that you will be very little ſatisfied with this letter, and I dare hardly aſk you, to be good-natured enough to charge the dulneſs of it, on the barrenneſs of the ſubject, and to overlook the ſtupidity of</p>

            <p>I HOPE my dear ſiſter wants no new proof of my ſincere affection for her; but I am ſure if you do, I could not give you a ſtronger than writing at this time, after three days, or, more properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, three nights and days, hard poſt-travelling.—The kingdom of Bohemia is the moſt deſert of any I have ſeen in Germany. The villages are ſo poor, and the poſt-houſes ſo miſerable, that clean ſtraw and fair water are bleſſings not always to be met with, and better accommodation not to be hoped for.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:041644_0044_101AD1D34FF8EDA0"/>
Though I carried my own bed with me, I could not ſometimes find a place to ſet it up in; and I rather choſe to travel all night, as cold as it is, wrapped up in my furs, than go into the common ſtoves, which are filled with a mixture of all ſorts of ill ſcents.</p>
            <p>This town was once the royal feat of the Bohemian King, and is ſtill the capital of the kingdom. There are yet ſome remains of its former ſplendour, being one of the largeſt towns in Germany, but, for the moſt part, old built and thinly inhabited, which makes the houſes very cheap. Thoſe people of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity who cannot eaſily bear the expence of Vienna, chooſe to reſide here, where they have aſſemblies, muſic, and all other diverſions, (thoſe of a court ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) at very moderate rates, all things being here in great abundance, eſpecially, the beſt wild fowl I ever taſted. I have already been viſited by ſome of the moſt conſiderable ladies, whoſe relations I know at Vienna. They are dreſſed after the faſhions there, after the manner that the people at Exeter imitate thoſe of London; that is, their imitation is more exceſſive than the original. 'Tis not eaſy to deſcribe what extraordinary figures they make. The perſon is ſo much loſt between head-dreſs and petticoat, that they have as much occaſion to write upon their backs, <hi>"This is a Woman,"</hi> for the information of travellers, as ever ſign-poſt painter had to write, <q>

            <p>I BELIEVE, dear ſiſter, you will eaſily forgive my not writing to you from Dreſden, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, when I tell you, that I never went out of my chaiſe from Prague to this place. You may imagine how heartily I was tired with twenty-four hours poſt-travelling, without ſleep or refreſhment (for I can never ſleep in a coach however fatigued.) We paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by moon-ſhine, the frightful precipices that divide Bohemia from Saxony, at the bottom of which runs the river Elbe; but I cannot ſay, that I had reaſon to fear drowning in it, being perfectly convinced, that in caſe of a tumble, it was utterly impoſſible to come alive to the bottom. In many places the road is ſo narrow, that I could not diſcern an inch of ſpace between the wheels and the precipice. Yet I was ſo good a wife not to wake Mr. W—y, who was faſt aſleep by my ſide, to make him ſhare in my fears, ſince the danger was unavoidable, till I perceived by the bright light of the moon, our poſtillions nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on horſe-back, while the horſes were on a full gallop. Then indeed I thought it very convenient to call out to deſire them to look where they were going. My calling waked Mr. W—y, and he was much more ſurpriſed than myſelf at the ſituation we were in, and aſſured me that he paſſed the Alps five times in different places, without ever having gone a road ſo dangerous. I have been told ſince, that 'tis
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:041644_0046_101AD1D6F89B7480"/>
common to find the bodies of travellers in the Elbe, but thank God that was not our deſtiny, and we came ſafe to Dreſden, ſo much tired with fear and fatigue, it was not poſſible for me to compoſe myſelf to write. After paſſing theſe dreadful rocks, Dreſden appeared to me a wonderfully agreeable ſituation, in a fine large place on the banks of the Elbe. I was very glad to ſtay there a day to reſt myſelf. The town is the neateſt. I have ſeen in Germany; moſt of the houſes are new built; the Elector's palace is very handſome, and his repoſitory full of curioſities of different kinds, with a collection of medals very much eſteemed. Sir—, our King's Envoy, came to ſee me here, and Madam de L—, whom I knew in London, when her husband was Miniſter to the King of Poland there. She offered me all things in her power to entertain me, and brought ſome ladies with her, whom ſhe preſented to me. The Saxon ladies reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Auſtrian no more, than the Chineſe do thoſe of London; they are very genteely dreſſed after the Engliſh and French modes, and have, generally, pretty faces, but they are the moſt determined <hi>Minaudieres</hi> in the whole world. They would think it a mortal ſin againſt good breeding, if they either ſpoke or moved in a natural manner. They all affect a little ſoft liſp, and a pretty <hi>pitty pat</hi> ſtep; which female frailties ought, however, to be forgiven them in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their civility and good nature to ſtrangers, which I have a great deal of reaſon to praiſe.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Cozelle</hi> is kept priſoner in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy caſtle, ſome leagues from hence, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear telling you what I have heard of her, becauſe it ſeems to me very extraordinary, though I foreſee I ſhall ſwell my letter to the ſize of a pacquet.—She was miſtreſs to the King of Poland (Elector of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:041644_0047_101AD1D965FA5DC8"/>
Saxony) with ſo abſolute a dominion over him, that never any lady had ſo much power in that court. They tell a pleaſant ſtory of his Majeſty's firſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of love, which he made in a viſit to her, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one hand a bag of a hundred thouſand crowns, and in the other a horſe-ſhoe, which he ſnapped aſunder before her face, leaving her to draw the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch remarkable proofs of <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>liberality.</hi> I know not which charmed her moſt, but ſhe conſented to leave her husband and to give her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to him intirely, being divorced publicly, in ſuch a manner as by their laws, permits either party to marry again. God knows whether it was at this time, or in ſome other fond fit, but 'tis certain the king had the weakneſs to make her a formal contract of marriage; which, though it could ſignify nothing during the life of the Queen, pleaſed her ſo well, that ſhe could not be contented, without telling it to all the people ſhe ſaw, and giving herſelf the airs of a Queen. Men endure every thing while they are in love; but when the exceſs of paſſion was cooled by long poſſeſſion, his Majeſty begun to reflect on the ill conſequences of leaving ſuch a paper in her hands, and deſired to have it reſtored to him. But ſhe rather choſe to endure all the moſt violent effects of his anger than give it up; and though ſhe is one of the richeſt and moſt avaritious ladies of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhe has refuſed the offer of the continuation of a large penſion, and the ſecurity of a vaſt ſum of money ſhe has amaſſed, and has, at laſt, provoked the King to confine her perſon to a caſtle, where ſhe endures all the terrors of a ſtrait impriſonment, and remains ſtill inflexible either to threats or promiſes. Her violent paſſions have brought her indeed into fits, which 'tis ſuppoſed will ſoon put an end to her
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:041644_0048_101AD1DC49EDEA78"/>
life. I cannot forbear having ſome compaſſion for a woman, that ſuffers for a point of honour, however miſtaken, eſpecially in a country where points of honour are not over ſcrupulouſly obſerved among ladies.</p>
            <p>I could have wiſhed Mr. W—y's buſineſs had permitted him a longer ſtay at Dreſden.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I am partial to a town where they profeſs the Proteſtant Religion, but every thing ſeemed to me with quite another air of politeneſs, than I have found in other places. <hi>Leipſic,</hi> where I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is a town very conſiderable for its trade, and I take this opportunity of buying page's liveries, gold ſtuffs for myſelf, &amp;c. all things of that kind being at leaſt double the price at Vienna, partly becauſe of the exceſſive cuſtoms, and partly through want of genius and induſtry in the people, who make no one ſort of thing there, ſo that the ladies are obliged to ſend, even for their ſhoes, out of Saxony. The fair here is one of the moſt conſiderable in Germany, and the reſort of all the people of quality, as well as of the merchants. This is alſo a fortified town, but I avoid ever mentioning fortifications, being ſenſible that I know not how to ſpeak of them. I am the more eaſy under my ignorance, when I reflect that I am ſure you'll willingly forgive the omiſſion; for if I made you the moſt exact deſcription of all the ravelins and baſtions I ſee in my travels, I dare ſwear you would aſk me what is a ravelin? and what is a baſtion?</p>

            <p>I AM juſt come to Brunſwick, a very old town, but which has the advantage of being the capital of the Duke of Wolfenbuttle's dominions, a family (not to ſpeak of its ancient honours) illuſtrious, by having its younger branch on the throne of England, and having given two Empreſſes to Germany. I have not forgot to drink your health here in <hi>Mum,</hi> which I think very well deſerves its reputation of being the beſt in the world. This letter is the third I have writ to you during my journey, and I declare to you, that if you don't ſend me immediately a full and true account of all the changes and chances amongſt our London acquaintance, I will not write you any deſcription of Hanover, (where I hope to be to night) though I know you have more curioſity to hear of that place than any other.</p>

            <p>I RECEIVED your ladyſhip's letter but the day before I left Vienna, though, by the date, I ought to have had it much ſooner; but nothing was ever worſe regulated than the poſt in moſt parts of Germany. I can aſſure you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pacquet at Prague was behind my chaiſe, and in that manner conveyed to Dreſden, ſo that the ſecrets of half the country were at my mercy, if I had had any curioſity for them. I would not longer delay my thanks for yours, though the number of my acquaintances here, and my duty of attending at court, leaves me hardly any time to diſpoſe of. I am extremely pleaſed that I can tell you, without flattery or partiality, that our young Prince<note n="*" place="bottom">The father of his preſent Majeſty.</note> has all the accompliſhments that 'tis poſſible to have at his age, with an air of ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and underſtanding, and ſomething ſo very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging and eaſy in his behaviour, that he needs not the advantage of his rank to appear charming. I had the honour of a long converſation with him laſt night, before the King came in. His governor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired on purpoſe (as he told me afterwards) that I might make ſome judgment of his genius, by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſpeak without conſtraint; and I was ſurpriſed at the quickneſs and politeneſs, that appeared in every thing he ſaid, joined to a perſon perfectly agreeable, and the fine fair hair of the Princeſs.</p>

This town is neither large nor handſome; but the palace is capable of holding a much greater court than that of St. James. The King has had the goodneſs to appoint us a lodging in one part of it, without which we ſhould have been very ill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated; for the vaſt number of Engliſh crowds the town ſo much, 'tis very good luck to get one ſorry room in a miſerable tavern. I dined to day with the Portugueſe Ambaſſador, who thinks himſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to have two wretched parlours in an inn. I have now made the <hi>Tour</hi> of Germany, and cannot help obſerving a conſiderable difference between travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here and in England. One ſees none of thoſe fine ſeats of noblemen, ſo common amongſt us, nor any thing like a country gentleman's houſe, though they have many ſituations perfectly fine. But the whole people are divided into abſolute ſovereignties, where all the riches and magnificence are at court, or into communities of merchants, ſuch as Nurenburgh and Frankfort, where they live always in town for the convenience of trade. The King's company of French comedians play here every night. They are very well dreſſed, and ſome of them not ill actors. His Majeſty dines and ſups conſtantly in public. The court is very numerous, and his affability and goodneſs makes it one of the moſt agreeable places in the world.</p>

            <p>I AM very glad my dear Lady R—, that you have been ſo well pleaſed, as you tell me, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my returning to England; though, like other pleaſures, I can aſſure you it has no real foundation. I hope you know me enough to take my word againſt any report concerning me. 'Tis true, as to diſtance of place, I am much nearer to London than I was ſome weeks ago; but as to the thoughts of a return. I never was farther off in my life. I own, I could with great joy indulge the pleaſing hopes of ſeeing you and the very few others that ſhare my eſteem; but while Mr. W—is determined to proceed in his deſign, I am determined to follow him.—I am running on upon my own affairs, that is to ſay, I am going to write very dully, as moſt people do, when they write of themſelves. I will make haſte to change the diſagreeable ſubject, by telling you, that I am now got into the region of beauty. All the women have, literally, roſy cheeks, ſnowy foreheads and boſoms, jet eyebrows, and ſcarlet lips, to which they generally add coal-black hair. Thoſe perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions never leave them, till the hour of their deaths, and have a very fine effect by candle light; but I could wiſh they were handſome with a little more variety. They reſemble one another as much as Mrs. <hi>Salmon</hi>'s court of Great-Britain, and are in as much danger of melting away, by too near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:041644_0053_101AD1E713A90CF0"/>
the fire, which they, for that reaſon, carefully avoid, though 'tis now ſuch exceſſive cold weather, that I believe they ſuffer extremely by that piece of ſelf-denial. The ſnow is already very deep, and the people begin to ſlide about in their <hi>Traineaus.</hi> This is a favourite diverſion all over Germany. They are little machines fixed upon a ſledge, that hold a lady and a gentleman, and are drawn by one horſe. The gentleman has the honour of driving, and they move with a prodigious ſwiftneſs. The lady, the horſe and the Traineau, are all as fine as they can be made, and when there are many of them together, 'tis a very agreeable ſhow. At Vienna, where all pieces of magnificence are carried to exceſs, there are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times machines of this kind, that coſt five or ſix hundred pounds Engliſh. The Duke of Wolfenbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is now at this court; you know he is nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to our King, and uncle to the remaining Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, who is, I believe, the moſt beautiful Princeſs upon earth. She is now with child, which is all the conſolation of the Imperial Court for the loſs of the Arch-duke. I took my leave of her the day before I left Vienna, and ſhe begun to ſpeak to me, with ſo much grief and tenderneſs of the death of that young Prince, I had much ado to with-hold my tears. You know that I am not at all partial to people for their titles; but I own, that I love that charming Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (if I may uſe ſo familiar an expreſſion) and if I had not, I ſhould have been very much moved at the tragical end of an only ſon, born after being ſo long deſired, and at length killed by want of good management, weaning him in the beginning of the winter. Adieu, dear Lady R—, continue to write to me, and believe none of your goodneſs is loſt upon.</p>

            <p>I RECEIVED yours, dear ſiſter, the very day I left Hanover. You may eaſily imagine I was then in too great a hurry to anſwer it, but you ſee I take the firſt opportunity of doing myſelf that pleaſure. I came here the 15th, very late at night, after a terrible journey, in the worſt roads and weather that ever poor traveller ſuffered. I have taken this little fatigue, merely to oblige the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Empreſs, and carry a meſſage from her Imperial Majeſty to the Ducheſs of Blankenburg, her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is a Princeſs of great addreſs and good breeding, and may be ſtill called a fine woman. It was ſo late when I came to this town, I did not think it proper to diſturb the Duke and Ducheſs with the news of my arrival; ſo I took up my quarters in a miſerable inn; but as ſoon as I had ſent my compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their Highneſſes, they immediately ſent me their own coach and ſix horſes, which had however enough to do to draw us up the very high hill on which the caſtle is ſituated. The Ducheſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely obliging to me, and this little court is not without its diverſions. The Duke <hi>taillys</hi> at <hi>Baſſet</hi> every night, and the Ducheſs tells me, ſhe is ſo well pleaſed with my company, that it makes her play leſs than ſhe uſed to do. I ſhould find it very difficult to ſteal time to write, if ſhe was not now at church, where I cannot wait on her, not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:041644_0055_101AD1EB07ACC860"/>
the language enough to pay my devotions in it. You will not forgive me, if I do not ſay ſomething of Hanover; I cannot tell you that the town is either large or magnificent. The opera-houſe, which was built by the late Elector, is much finer than that of Vienna. I was very ſorry that the ill weather did not permit me to ſee <hi>Hernhauſen</hi> in all its beauty; but in ſpite of the ſnow, I thought the gardens very fine. I was particularly ſurpriſed, at the vaſt number of orange trees, much larger than any I have ever ſeen in England, though this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is certainly colder. But I had more reaſon to wonder, that night at the King's table, to ſee a preſent from a gentleman of this country, of two large baſkets full of ripe oranges and lemons of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts, many of which were quite new to me; and what I thought worth all the reſt, two ripe <hi>Ananaſſes,</hi> which, to my taſte, are a fruit perfectly delicious. You know they are naturally the growth of <hi>Brazil,</hi> and I could not imagine how they came here but by enchantment. Upon enquiry, I learn't that they have brought their ſtoves to ſuch perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they lengthen their ſummer as long as they pleaſe, giving to every plant the degree of heat it would receive from the ſun in its native ſoil. The effect is very near the ſame; I am ſurpriſed we do not practiſe, in England, ſo uſeful an invention. This reflection leads me to conſider our obſtinacy in ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with cold five months in the year, rather than make uſe of ſtoves, which are certainly one of the greateſt conveniencies of life. Beſides, they are ſo far from ſpoiling the form of a room, that they add very much to the magnificence of it, when they are painted and gilt, as they are at Vienna, or at Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where they are often in the ſhapes of china

jars, ſtatues or fine cabinets, ſo naturally repreſented, that they are not to be diſtinguiſhed. If ever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, in defiance to the faſhion, you ſhall certainly ſee one in the chamber of,</p>

            <p>I HAVE juſt received here at Vienna, your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's compliments on my return to England, ſent me from Hanover. You ſee, Madam, all things that are aſſerted with confidence, are not abſolutely true; and that you have no ſort of reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me for making my deſigned return a myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to you, when, you ſay, all the world are informed of it. You may tell all the world in my name, that they are never ſo well informed of my affairs as I am myſelf, that I am very poſitive I am at this time at Vienna, where the carnival is begun, and all ſorts of diverſions are carried to the greateſt height, except that of maſquing, which is never permitted during a war with the Turks. The balls are in public places, where the men pay a gold ducat at entrance, but the ladies nothing. I am told that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:041644_0057_101AD1EF5192D720"/>
theſe houſes get ſometimes a thouſand ducats in a night. They are very magnificently furniſhed, and the muſic good, if they had not that deteſtable cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of mixing hunting horns with it, that almoſt deafen the company. But that noiſe is ſo ageeable here, they never make a concert without them. The ball always concludes with Engliſh country dances, to the number of thirty or forty couple, and ſo ill danced, that there is very little pleaſure in them. They know but half a dozen, and they have danced them over and over theſe fifty years. I would fain have taught them ſome new ones, but I found it would be ſome months labour to make them compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them. Laſt night there was an Italian comedy acted at court. The ſcenes were pretty, but the comedy itſelf ſuch intolerable low farce, without either wit or humour, that I was ſurpriſed how all the court could ſet there attentively for four hours together. No women are ſuffered to act on the ſtage, and the men dreſſed, like them, were ſuch aukward figures, they very much added to the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule of the ſpectacle. What completed the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was the exceſſive cold, which was ſo great I thought I ſhould have died there. It is now the very extremity of the winter here; the Danube is entirely frozen, and the weather not to be ſupported without ſtoves and furs; but, however, the air ſo clear, almoſt every body is well, and colds not half ſo common as in England. I am perſuaded there cannot be a purer air, nor more wholeſome than that of Vienna. The plenty and excellence of all ſorts of proviſions are greater here than in any place I ever was before, and 'tis not very expenſive to keep a ſplendid table. 'Tis really a pleaſure to paſs through the markets, and ſee the abundance of what we

ſhould think rarities, of fowls and veniſon, that are daily brought in from Hungary and Bohemia. They want nothing but ſhell-fiſh, and are ſo fond of oyſters, that they have them ſent from Venice, and eat them very greedily, ſtink or not ſtink. Thus I obey your commands, Madam, in giving you an account of Vienna, though I know you will not be ſatisfied with it. You chide me for my lazineſs in not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you a thouſand agreeable and ſurpriſing things, that you ſay you are ſure I have ſeen and heard. Upon my word, Madam, 'tis my regard to truth, and not lazineſs, that I do not entertain you with as many prodigies as other travellers uſe to divert their readers with. I might eaſily pick up wonders in every town I paſs through, or tell you a long ſeries of Popiſh miracles, but I cannot fancy that there is any thing new in letting you know that prieſts will lie, and the mob believe, all the world over. Then as for news, that you are ſo inquiſitive about, how can it be entertaining to you (that don't know the people) that the Prince of—has forſaken the Counteſs of—? or that the Princeſs <hi>ſuch a one,</hi> has an intrigue with Count <hi>ſuch a one?</hi> Would you have me write novels like the Counteſs of D'—, and is it not better to tell you a plain truth,</p>

            <p>I AM now, dear ſiſter, to take leave of you for a long time, and of Vienna for ever, deſigning, to-morrow, to begin my journey through Hungary in ſpite of the exceſſive cold, and deep ſnows, which is enough to damp a greater courage than I am miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of. But my principle of <hi>paſſive obedience,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries me through every thing. I have had my audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of leave of the Empreſs. His Imperial Majeſty was pleaſed to be preſent when I waited on the reigning Empreſs, and, after a very obliging conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, both their Imperial Majeſties invited me to take Vienna in my road back; but I have no thoughts, of enduring, over again, ſo great a fatigue. I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a letter from the Ducheſs of Blankenburg. I ſtaid but a few days at that court, though her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs preſſed me very much to ſtay; and when I left her, engaged me to write to her. I wrote you a long letter from thence, which I hope you have received, though you don't mention it; but I believe I forgot to tell you one curioſity in all the German courts, which I cannot forbear taking notice of: All the princes keep favourite dwarfs. The Emperor and Empreſs have two of theſe little monſters, as ugly as devils, eſpecially the female; but they are all bedawbed with diamonds, and ſtand at her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's elbow in all public places. The Duke of Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenbuttle has one, and the Ducheſs of Blankenburg
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:041644_0060_101AD1F6D52446F8"/>
is not without hers, but indeed the moſt proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable I ever ſaw. I am told the King of Denmark has ſo far improved upon this faſhion, that his dwarf is his chief miniſter. I can aſſign no reaſon for their fondneſs of theſe pieces of deformity, but the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion all the abſolute Princes have, that 'tis below them to converſe with the reſt of mankind; and not to be quite alone, they are forced to ſeek their companions among the refuſe of human nature; theſe creatures being the only part of their court privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged to to talk freely to them. I am at preſent confined to my chamber by a ſore throat, and am really glad of the excuſe to avoid ſeeing people, that I love well enough to be very much mortified when I think I am going to part with them for ever. 'Tis true, the Auſtrians, are not commonly the moſt polite people in the world, nor the moſt agreeable. But Vienna is inhabited by all nations, and I had formed to myſelf a little ſociety of ſuch as were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to my own taſte. And though the number was not very great, I could never pick up, in any other place, ſuch a number of reaſonable, agreeable people. We were almoſt always together, and you know I have ever been of opinion, that a choſen converſation, compoſed of a few that one eſteems, is the greateſt happineſs of life. Here are ſome Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards of both ſexes, that have all the vivacity and generoſity of ſentiments antiently aſcribed to their nation; and could I believe, that the whole kingdom were like them, I ſhould wiſh nothing more than to end my days there. The ladies of my acquaintance have ſo much goodneſs for me, they cry whenever they ſee me, ſince I have determined to undertake this journey. And, indeed, I am not very eaſy when I reflect on what I am going to ſuffer. Almoſt
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:041644_0061_101AD1F8FAA8F7C0"/>
every body I ſee frights me with ſome new difficulty. Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> has been ſo good as to ſay all the things he could to perſuade me to ſtay till the Danube is thawed, that I may have the conveniency of going by water, aſſuring me, that the houſes in Hungary are ſuch, as are no defence againſt the weather, and that I ſhall be obliged to travel three or four days between <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Eſſeek,</hi> without finding any houſe at all, through deſart plains covered with ſnow; where the cold is ſo violent, many have been killed by it. I own theſe terrors have made a very deep impreſſion on my mind, becauſe I believe he tells me things truly as they are, and no body can be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed of them.</p>
            <p>Now I have named that great man, I am ſure you expect, I ſhould ſay ſomething particular of him, having the advantage of ſeeing him very often; but I am as unwilling to ſpeak of him at <hi>Vienna,</hi> as I ſhould be to talk of <hi>Hercules</hi> in the court of <hi>Omphale,</hi> if I had ſeen him there. I don't know what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort other people find in conſidering the weakneſs of great men, (becauſe, perhaps, it brings them nearer to their level) but 'tis always a mortification to me, to obſerve, that there is no perfection in humanity. The young Prince of Portugal is the admiration of the whole court; he is handſome and polite with a great vivacity. All the officers tell wonders of his gallantry the laſt campaign. He is lodged at court with all the honours due to his rank.—Adieu, dear ſiſter, this is the laſt account you will have from me of Vienna. If I ſurvive my journey, you ſhall hear from me again. I can ſay with great truth, in the words of <hi>Moneſes, I have long learnt to hold myſelf as nothing;</hi> but when I think of the fatigue my poor infant muſt ſuffer, I have all a mother's fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:041644_0062_101AD1FA825B64C0"/>
in my eyes, and all her tender paſſions in my heart.</p>
            <p>P. S. I have written a letter to my lady—, that I believe ſhe won't like; and upon cooler reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think I had done better to have let it alone; but I was downright peeviſh at all her queſtions, and her ridiculous imagination, that I have certainly ſeen abundance of wonders which I keep to myſelf out of meer malice. She is very angry that I won't lie like other travellers. I verily believe ſhe expects I ſhould tell her of the <hi>Anthropophagie,</hi> men whoſe heads grow below their ſhoulders; however, pray ſay ſomething to pacify her.</p>

            <p>AT length, dear ſiſter, I am ſafely arrived with all my family in good health at <hi>Peterwaradin;</hi> having ſuffered ſo little from the rigour of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (againſt which we were well provided by furs) and found ſuch tolerable accommodation every where, by the care of ſending before, that I can hardly forbear laughing when I recollect all the frightful ideas that were given me of this journey. Theſe, I ſee, were wholly owing to the tenderneſs of my Vienna friends, and their deſire of keeping me with them for this winter. Perhaps it will not be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to you to give a ſhort journal of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, being through a country entirely unknown to you, and very little paſſed, even by the Hungarians themſelves, who generally chooſe to take the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of going down the Danube. We have had the bleſſing of being favoured with finer weather than is common at this time of the year; though the ſnow was ſo deep, we were obliged to have our
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:041644_0064_101AD1FEE0817110"/>
own coaches fixed upon <hi>Traineaus,</hi> which move ſo ſwift and ſo eaſily, 'tis by far the moſt agreeable manner of travelling poſt, We came to <hi>Raab</hi> (the ſecond day from Vienna) on the ſeventeenth inſtant, where Mr. W—ſending word of our arrival to the governor, the beſt houſe in the town was provided for us, the garriſon put under arms, a guard ordered at our door, and all other honours paid to us. The governor and all other officers immediately waited on Mr. W—, to know if there was any thing to be done for his ſervice. The biſhop of <hi>Temeſwar</hi> came to viſit us, with great civility, earneſtly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to dine with him next day; which we refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as being reſolved to purſue our journey, he ſent us ſeveral baskets of winter fruit, and a great variety of Hungarian wines, with a young hind juſt killed. This is a prelate of great power in this country, of the ancient family of <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> ſo conſiderable, for many ages, in this kingdom. He is a very polite, agreeable, cheerful old man, wearing the Hungarian habit, with a venerable white beard down to his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.—<hi>Raab</hi> is a ſtrong own, well garriſoned and fortified, and was a long time the frontier town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Turkiſh and German Empires. It has its name from the river <hi>Rab,</hi> on which it is ſituated, juſt on its meeting with the Danube, in an open champain country. It was firſt taken by the Turks under the command of Baſſa <hi>Sinan,</hi> in the reign of Sultan <hi>Amurath</hi> III. in the year fifteen hundred ninety-four. The governor being ſuppoſed to have betrayed it, was afterwards beheaded by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's command. The Counts of <hi>Swartzenburg</hi> and <hi>Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i</hi> retook it by ſurpriſe 1598, ſince which time it has remained in the hands of the Germans, though the Turks once more attempted to gain it by ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:041644_0065_101AD201CB4FF348"/>
in 1642. The cathedral is large and well built, which is all I ſaw remarkable in the town. Leaving <hi>Comora</hi> on the other ſide of the river, we went the eighteenth to <hi>Noſmuhl,</hi> a ſmall village, where, however, we made ſhift to find tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. We continued two days travelling between this place and <hi>Buda,</hi> thro' the fineſt plains in the world, as even as if they were paved, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fruitful; but for the moſt part deſart and uncultivated, laid waſte by the long wars between the Turk and the Emperor; and the more cruel civil war, occaſioned by the barbarous perſecution of the Proteſtant religion, by the Emperor Leopold. That Prince has left behind him the character of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary piety, and was naturally of a mild merciful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but, putting his conſcience into the hands of a jeſuit, he was more cruel and treacherous to his poor Hungarian ſubjects, than ever the Turk has been to the Chriſtians; breaking, without ſcruple, his coronation oath, and his faith ſolemnly given in many public treaties. Indeed nothing can be more melancholy than in travelling through Hungary, to reflect on the former flouriſhing ſtate of that kingdom, and to ſee ſuch a noble ſpot of earth almoſt uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. Such are alſo the preſent circumſtances of <hi>Buda</hi> (where we arrived very early the twenty ſecond) once the royal ſeat of the Hungarian kings, whoſe palace there, was reckoned one of the moſt beautiful buildings of the age, now wholly deſtroyed, no part of the town having been repaired ſince the laſt ſiege, but the fortifications and the caſtle, which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reſidence of the governor general <hi>Ragule,</hi> an officer of great merit. He came immediately to ſee us, and carried us in his coach to his houſe, where I was received by his lady, with all poſſible civility,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:041644_0066_101AD2035066E9E0"/>
and magnificently entertained. This city is ſituated upon a little hill on the ſouth ſide of the Danube. The caſtle is much higher than the town, and from it the proſpect is very noble. Without the walls lie a vaſt number of little houſes, or rather huts, that they call the <hi>Raſcian</hi> town, being altogether inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by that people. The governor aſſured me it would furniſh twelve thouſand fighting men. Theſe towns look very odd; their houſes ſtand in rows, many thouſands of them ſo cloſe together, that they appear, at a little diſtance, like old-faſhioned thatched tents. They conſiſt, every one of them, of one hovel above, and another under ground; theſe are their ſummer and winter apartments. Buda was firſt taken by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, in 1526, and loſt the following year to Ferdinand the firſt, King of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia. <hi>Solyman</hi> regained it by the treachery of the garriſon, and voluntarily gave it into the hands of King <hi>John</hi> of Hungary, after whoſe death, his ſon being an infant, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> laid ſiege to it, and the Queen-mother was forced to call Solyman to her aid. He indeed raiſed the ſiege; but left a Turkiſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in the town, and commanded her to remove her court from thence, which ſhe was forced to ſubmit to in 1541. It reſiſted afterwards the ſieges laid to it, by the Marquis of Brandenburgh, in the year 1542; Count Schwartzenburg, in 1598; General Roſworm, 1602; and the Duke of Lorrain, commander of the Emperor's forces, in 1684, to whom it yielded in 1686, after an obſtinate defence, <hi>Apti Baſſa,</hi> the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, being killed, fighting in the breach, with a Roman bravery. The loſs of this town was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and ſo much reſented by the Turks, that it occaſioned the depoſing of their Emperor <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Fourth, the year following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:041644_0067_101AD205712281A8"/>
We did not proceed on our journey till the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>third, when we paſſed through <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Todowar,</hi> both conſiderable towns, when in the hands of the Turks, but now quite ruined. The remains, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of ſome Turkiſh towns, ſhew ſomething of what they have been. This part of the country is very much over-grown with wood, and little fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented. 'Tis incredible what vaſt numbers of wild fowl we ſaw, which often live here to a good old age,—and <hi>undiſturb'd by guns, in quiet ſleep.</hi>—We came the five and twentieth to <hi>Mohatch,</hi> and were ſhewed the field near it, where <hi>Lewis,</hi> the young King of Hungary, loſt his army and his life, being drowned in a ditch trying to fly from <hi>Balybeus,</hi> general of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent. This battle opened the firſt paſſage for the Turks into the heart of Hungary.—I don't name to you the little villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of which I can ſay nothing remarkable, but I'll aſſure you, I have always found a warm ſtove and great plenty, particularly of wild boar, veniſon and all kinds of <hi>Gibier.</hi> The few people that inhabit Hungary, live eaſily enough; they have no money; but the woods and plains afford them proviſion in great abundance; they were ordered to give us all things neceſſary, even what horſes we pleaſed to demand, <hi>gratis;</hi> but Mr. W—would not oppreſs the poor country people, by making uſe of this order, and always paid them to the full worth of what we had. They were ſo ſurpriſed at this unexpected genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which they are very little uſed to, that they always preſſed upon us, at parting, a dozen of fat pheaſants, or ſomething of that ſort for a preſent. Their dreſs is very <hi>primitive,</hi> being only a plain ſheep's ſkin, and a cap and boots of the ſame ſtuff. You may eaſily imagine this laſts them many winters;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:041644_0068_101AD20710D255E0"/>
and thus they have very little occaſion for money. The twenty-ſixth, we paſſed over the frozen Danube, with all our equipage, and carriages. We met, on the other ſide, general <hi>Veterani,</hi> who invited us, with great civility, to paſs the night at a little caſtle of his, a few miles off, aſſuring us we ſhould have a very hard day's journey to reach <hi>Eſſek.</hi> This we found but too true, the woods being very dangerous, and ſcarce paſſable, from the vaſt quantity of wolves that hoard in them. We came, however, ſafe, though late, to Eſſek, where we ſtayed a day, to diſpatch a courier with letters to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of Belgrade; and I took that opportunity of ſeeing the town, which is not very large, but fair built and well fortified. This was a town of great trade, very rich and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, when in the hands of the Turks. It is ſituated on the <hi>Drave,</hi> which runs into the Danube. The bridge was eſteemed one of the moſt extraordinary in the world, being eight thouſand paces long, and all built of oak. It was burnt, and the city laid in aſhes by Count <hi>Leſly</hi> 1685, but was again repaired and fortified by the Turks, who however abandoned it in 1687. General <hi>Dunnewalt</hi> then took poſſeſſion of it for the Emperor, in whoſe hands it has remained ever ſince, and is eſteemed one of the bulwarks of Hungary. The twenty-eighth we went to Bocorvar, a very large Raſcian town, all built after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have deſcribed to you. We were met there by Colonel—, who would not ſuffer us to go any where but to his quarters, where I found his wife, a very agreeable Hungarian lady, and his niece and daughter, two pretty young women, crowded into three or four Raſcian houſes, caſt into one, and made as neat and convenient as thoſe places are capable of being made. The Hungarian ladies are much
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:041644_0069_101AD20AA95D4B60"/>
handſomer than thoſe of Auſtria. All the Vienna beauties are of that country. They are generally very fair and well ſhaped, and their dreſs, I think, is extremely becoming. This lady was in a gown of ſcarlet velvet, lined and faced with ſables, made exact to her ſhape, and the ſkirt falling to her feet. The ſleeves are ſtrait to their arms, and the ſtays buttoned before, with two rows of little buttons of gold, pearl, or diamonds. On their heads they wear a taſſel of gold, that hangs low on one ſide, lined with ſable, or ſome other fine fur.—They gave us a handſome dinner, and I thought the converſation very polite and agreeable. They would accompany us part of our way.—The twenty-ninth, we arrived here, where we were met by the commanding officer at the head of all the officers at the garriſon. We are lodged in the beſt apartment of the governor's houſe, and entertained in a very ſplendid manner, by the Emperor's order. We wait here till all points are adjuſted, concerning our reception on the Turkiſh frontiers. Mr. W—'s courier, which he ſent from Eſſek, returned this morning, with the Baſſa's anſwer in a purſe of ſcarlet ſattin, which the Interpreter here has tranſlated. 'Tis to promiſe him to be honourably received. I deſired him to appoint where he would be met, by the Turkiſh convoy.—He has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the courier back, naming Betſko, a village in the midway between Peterwaradin and Belgrade. We ſhall ſtay here till we receive his anſwer.—Thus, dear ſiſter, I have given you a very particular, and (I am afraid you'll think) a tedious account of this part of my travels. It was not an affectation of ſhewing my reading that has made me tell you ſome little ſcraps of the hiſtory of the towns I have paſſed through. I have always avoided any thing of that

kind, when I ſpoke of places that I believe you knew the ſtory of, as well as myſelf. But Hungary being a part of the world which I believe quite new to you, I thought you might read with ſome pleaſure an account of it, which I have been very ſolicitous to get from the beſt hands. However, if you don't like it, 'tis in your power to forbear reading it.</p>

            <p>I DID verily intend to write you a long letter from Peterwaraden, where I expected to ſtay three or four days, but the Baſſa here was in ſuch haſte to ſee us, that he diſpatched the courier back (which Mr. W—had ſent to know the time he would ſend the convoy to meet us) without ſuffering him to pull off his boots. My letters were not thought important enough to ſtop our journey, and we left Peterwaradin the next day, being waited on by the chief officers of the garriſon, and a conſiderable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of Germans and Raſcians. The Emperor has ſeveral regiments of theſe people; but, to ſay the truth, they are rather plunderers than ſoldiers; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no pay, and being obliged to furniſh their own
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:041644_0071_101AD20E5B93FB78"/>
arms and horſes; they rather look like vagabond gypſies, or ſtout beggars, than regular troops. I cannot forbear ſpeaking a word of this race of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who are very numerous all over Hungary. They have a patriarch of their own at Grand Cairo, and are really of the Greek church, but their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ignorance gives their prieſts occaſion to impoſe ſeveral new notions upon them. Theſe fellows let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their hair and beard grow inviolate, make exactly the figure of the Indian Bramins. They are heirs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general to all the money of the laiety; for which, in return, they give them formal paſſports ſigned and ſealed for heaven; and the wives and children only inherit the houſe and cattle. In moſt other points they follow the Greek church.—This little digreſſion has interrupted my telling you we paſſed over the fields of <hi>Carlowitz,</hi> where the laſt great victory was obtained by Prince Eugene over the Turks. The marks of that glorious bloody day are yet recent, the field being yet ſtrewed with the ſkulls and carcaſſes of unburied men, horſes and camels. I could not look, without horror, on ſuch numbers of mangled human bodies, nor without reflecting on the injuſtice of war, that makes murder, not only neceſſary, but meritorious. Nothing ſeems to be a plainer proof of the <hi>irrationality</hi> of mankind (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fine claims we pretend to reaſon) than the rage with which they conteſt for a ſmall ſpot of ground, when ſuch vaſt parts of fruitful earth lie quite unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited. 'Tis true, cuſtom has now made it unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but can there be a greater demonſtration of want of reaſon, than a cuſtom being firmly eſtabliſhed, ſo plainly contrary to the intereſt of man in general? I am a good deal inclined to believe Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> that the <hi>ſtate of nature,</hi> is a <hi>ſtate of war;</hi> but thence I
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:041644_0072_101AD21086BC49F8"/>
conclude human nature not rational, if the word reaſon means common ſenſe, as I ſuppoſe it does. I have a great many admirable arguments to ſupport this reflexion; I won't however trouble you with them, but return, in a plain ſtile, to the hiſtory of my travels.</p>
            <p>We were met at Betſko (a village in the midway between Belgrade and Peterwaradin) by an Aga of the Janizaries, with a body of Turks, exceeding the the Germans by one hundred men, though the Baſſa had engaged to ſend exactly the ſame number. You may judge by this of their fears. I am really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that they hardly thought the odds of one hundred men ſet them even with the Germans; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I was very uneaſy till they were parted, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome quarrel might ariſe notwithſtanding the <hi>parole</hi> given. We came late to Belgrade, the deep ſnows making the aſcent to it very difficult. It ſeems a ſtrong city, fortified, on the eaſt ſide, by the Danube; and on the ſouth, by the river <hi>Save,</hi> and was formerly the barrier of Hungary. It was firſt taken by Solyman the Magnificent; and ſince, by the Emperor's forces, led by the Elector of Bavaria. The Emperor held it only two years, it being reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Grand Vizier. It is now fortified with the utmoſt care and ſkill the Turks are capable of, and ſtrengthened by a very numerous garriſon, of their braveſt Janizaries, commanded by a Baſſa <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſkier (i. e.</hi> General;) though this laſt expreſſion is not very juſt; for to ſay truth, the Seraſkier, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Janizaries. Theſe troops have an abſolute authority here, and their conduct carries much more the aſpect of rebellion, than the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſubordination. You may judge of this by the following ſtory, which at the ſame time, will
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:041644_0073_101AD2134F31D8C8"/>
give you an idea of the <hi>admirable</hi> intelligence of the Governor of Peterwardin, though ſo few hours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. We were told by him at Peterwaradin, that the garriſon and inhabitants of Belgrade were ſo weary of the war, they had killed their Baſſa about two months ago, in a mutiny, becauſe he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be prevailed upon, by a bribe of five purſes (five hundred pound ſterling) to give permiſſion to the Tartars to ravage the German fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. We were very well pleaſed to hear of ſuch favourable diſpoſitions in the people; but when we came hither, we found the governor had been ill informed, and the real truth of the ſtory to be this. The late Baſſa fell under the diſpleaſure of his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for no other reaſon, but reſtraining their incurſions on the Germans. They took it into their heads from that mildneſs, that he had intelligence with the enemy, and ſent ſuch information to the Grand Signior at Adrianople; but, redreſs not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quick enough from thence, they aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a tumultuous manner, and by force dragged their Baſſa before the Cadi and Mufti, and there demanded juſtice in a mutinous way; one crying out, Why he protected the Infidels? Another, Why he ſqueezed them of their money? The Baſſa, eaſily gueſſing their purpoſe, calmly replied to them, that they aſked him too many queſtions, and that he had but one life, which muſt anſwer for all. They then immediately fell upon him with their ſcymitars, (without waiting the ſentence of their heads of the law) and in a few moments cut him in pieces. The preſent Baſſa has not dared to puniſh the murder; on the contrary, he affected to applaud the actors of it, as brave fellows, that knew how to do themſelves juſtice. He takes all pretences of throwing money
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:041644_0074_101AD214D30D5990"/>
amongſt the garriſon, and ſuffers them to make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle excurſions into Hungary, where they burn ſome poor Raſcian houſes.</p>
            <p>You may imagine, I cannot be very eaſy in a town which is really under the government of an inſolent ſoldiery.—We expected to be immediately diſſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, after a night's lodging here; but the Baſſa de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains us till he receives orders from Adrianople, which may, poſſibly, be a month a coming. In the mean time, we are lodged in one of the beſt houſes, belonging to a very conſiderable man amongſt them, and have a whole chamber of Janizaries to guard us. My only diverſion is the converſation of our hoſt <hi>Achmet-beg,</hi> a title ſomething like that of Count in Germany. His father was a great Baſſa, and he has been educated in the moſt polite Eaſtern learning, being perfectly ſkilled in the Arabic and Perſian languages, and an extraordinary ſcribe, which they call <hi>Effendi.</hi> This accompliſhment makes way to the greateſt preferments; but he has had the good ſenſe to prefer an eaſy, quiet ſecure life, to all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous honours of the Porte. He ſups with us every night, and drinks wine very freely. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine how much he is delighted with the liberty of converſing with me. He has explained to me many pieces of Arabian poetry, which, I obſerve, are in numbers, not unlike ours, generally of an alternate verſe, and of a very muſical ſound. Their expreſſions of love are very paſſionate and lively. I am ſo much pleaſed with them, I really believe I ſhould learn to read Arabic, if I was to ſtay here a few months. He has a very good library of their books of all kinds; and, as he tells me, ſpends the greateſt part of his life there. I paſs for a great ſcholar with him, by relating to him ſome of the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:041644_0075_101AD216F7C00C88"/>
Perſian tales, which I find are genuine. At firſt, he believed I underſtood Perſian. I have frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with him, concerning the difference of our cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, particularly the confinement of women. He aſſures me, there is nothing at all in it; only, ſays he, we have the advantage, that when our wives cheat us, no body knows it. He has wit, and is more polite than many Chriſtian men of quality. I am very much entertained with him.—He has had the curioſity to make one of our ſervants ſet him an alphabet of our letters, and can already write a good Roman hand. But theſe amuſements do not hinder my wiſhing heartily to be out of this place; though the weather is colder than I believe it ever was, any where, but in Greenland.—We have a very large ſtove conſtantly kept hot, and yet the windows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f the room are frozen on the inſide.—God knows when I may have an opportunity of ſending this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but I have written it, for the diſcharge of my own conſcience; and you cannot now reproach me, that one of yours makes ten of mine. Adieu.</p>

            <p>I HAVE now, Madam, finiſhed a journey that has not been undertaken by any Chriſtian, ſince the time of the Greek Emperors; and I ſhall not regret all the fatigues I have ſuffered in it, if it gives me an opportunity of amuſing your R. H. by an account of places utterly unknown amongſt us; the Emperor's Embaſſadors, and thoſe few Engliſh that have come hither, always going on the Danube to Nicopolis. But the river was now frozen, and Mr. W—was ſo zealous for the ſervice of his Majeſty, that he would not defer his journey to wait for the conveniency of that paſſage. We croſſed the deſarts of Servia, almoſt quite over-grown with wood, though a country naturally fertile. The inhabitants are induſtrious; but the oppreſſion of the peaſants is ſo great, they are forced to abandon their houſes, and neglect their tillage; all they have being a prey to the Janizaries, whenever they pleaſe to ſeize upon it.

               </gap>, we came to Niſſa, once the capital of Servia, ſituated in a fine plain on the river <hi>Niſſava,</hi> in a very good air, and ſo fruitful a ſoil, that the great plenty is hardly

credible. I was certainly aſſured, that the quantity of wine laſt vintage was ſo prodigious, that they were forced to dig holes in the earth to put it in, not having veſſels enough in the town to hold it. The happineſs of this plenty is ſcarce perceived by the oppreſſed people. I ſaw here a new occaſion for my compaſſion. The wretches that had provided twenty waggons for our baggage from Belgrade hither for a certain hire, being all ſent back without payment, ſome of their horſes lamed, and others killed, without any ſatisfaction made for them. The poor fellows came round the houſe weeping and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hair and beards in a moſt pitiful manner, without getting any thing but drubs from the inſolent ſoldiers. I cannot expreſs to your R. H. how much I was moved at this ſcene. I would have paid them the money, out of my own pocket, with all my heart; but it would only have been giving ſo much to the Aga, who would have taken it from them without any remorſe. After four days journey from this place over the mountains, we came to <hi>Sophia,</hi> ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in a large beautiful plain on the river Iſca, and ſurrounded with diſtant mountains. 'Tis hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſee a more agreeable landſkip. The city itſelf is very large and extremely populous. Here are hot baths, very famous for their medicinal virtues.—Four days journey from hence we arrived at <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popolis,</hi> after having paſſed the ridges between the mountains of <hi>Haemus</hi> and <hi>Rhodope,</hi> which are always covered with ſnow. This town is ſituated on a riſing ground, near the river Hebrus, and is almoſt wholly inhabited by Greeks; here are ſtill ſome antient Chriſtian churches. They have a biſhop; and ſeveral of the richeſt Greeks live here; but they are forced to conceal their wealth with great care, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

of poverty (which includes part of its inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies) being all their ſecurity againſt feeling it in earneſt. The country from hence to Adrianople, is the fineſt in the world. Vines grow wild on all the hills, and the perpetual ſpring they enjoy, makes every thing gay and flouriſhing. But this climate, happy as it ſeems, can never be preferred to England, with all its froſts and ſnows, while we are bleſſed with an eaſy government, under a King, who makes his own happineſs conſiſt in the liberty of his people, and chooſes rather to be looked upon as their father than their maſter.—This theme would carry me very far, and I am ſenſible, I have already tired out your R. H's. patience. But my letter is in your hands, and you may make it as ſhort as you pleaſe, by throwing it into the fire, when weary of reading it.</p>

            <p>I AM now got into a new world, where every thing I ſee, appears to me a change of ſcene; and I write to your ladyſhip with ſome content of mind, hoping, at leaſt, that you will find the charm of novelty in my letters, and no longer reproach me, that I tell you nothing extraordinary. I won't trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with a relation of our tedious journey; but I muſt not omit what I ſaw remarkable at <hi>Sophia,</hi> one
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:041644_0079_101AD22023947988"/>
of the moſt beautiful towns in the Turkiſh Empire, and famous for its hot baths, that are reſorted to both for diverſion and health. I ſtop'd here one day, on purpoſe to ſee them; and deſigning to go <hi>incognito,</hi> I hired a Turkiſh coach. Theſe voitures are not at all like ours, but much more convenient for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the heat being ſo great that glaſſes would be very troubleſome. They are made a good deal in the manner of the Dutch ſtage coaches, having woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lattices painted and gilded; the inſide being alſo painted with baſkets and noſegays of flowers, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed commonly with litle poetical mottos. They are covered all over with ſcarlet cloth, lined with ſilk, and very often richly embroidered and fringed. This covering entirely hides the perſons, in them, but may be thrown back at pleaſure, and thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ladies to peep through the lattices. They hold four people very conveniently, ſeated on cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but not raiſed.</p>
            <p>In one of theſe covered waggons, I went to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> about ten o'clock. It was already full of women. It is built of ſtone, in the ſhape of a dome, with no windows but in the roof, which gives light enough. There were five of theſe domes joined together, the outmoſt being leſs than the reſt, and ſerving only as a hall, where the <hi>Portreſs</hi> ſtood at the door. Ladies of quality generally give this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a crown or ten ſhillings, and I did not forget that ceremony. The next room is a very large one, paved with marble, and all round it are two raiſed Sofas of marble, one above another. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling firſt into marble baſons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpoſe, which carried the ſtreams into the next room, ſomething leſs than this,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:041644_0080_101AD222EEEEE098"/>
with the ſame ſort of marble Sofas, but ſo hot with ſteams of ſulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it, 'twas impoſſible to ſtay there with one's clothes on. The two other domes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it, to temper it to what degree of warmth the bathers pleaſed to have.</p>
            <p>I was in my travelling habit, which is a riding dreſs, and certainly appeared very extraordinary to them. Yet there was not one of them that ſhewed the leaſt ſurpriſe or impertinent curioſity, but received me with all the obliging civility poſſible. I know no European court, where the ladies would have behaved themſelves in ſo polite a manner to ſuch a ſtranger. I believe, upon the whole, there were two hundred women, and yet none of thoſe diſdainful ſmiles, and satyrical whiſpers, that never fail in our aſſemblies, when any body appears that is not dreſſed exactly in the faſhion. They repeated over and over to me. "UZELLE, PEK UZELLE," which is nothing but, <hi>Charming, very charming."</hi>—The firſt Sofas were covered with cuſhions and rich carpets, on which ſat the ladies; and on the ſecond, their ſlaves behind them, but without any diſtinction of rank by their dreſs, all being in the ſtate of nature, that is, in plain Engliſh, ſtark naked, without any beauty or defect concealed. Yet there was not the leaſt wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſmile or immodeſt geſture amongſt them. They walked and moved with the ſame majeſtic grace, which Milton deſcribes our General Mother with. There were many among them, as exactly proportioned as every any goddeſs was drawn by the pencil of a Guido or Titian,—And moſt of their ſkins ſhiningly white, only adorned by their beautiful hair, divided into many treſſes, hanging on their ſhoulders, braided
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:041644_0081_101AD22512F17108"/>
either with pearl or ribbon, perfectly repreſenting figures of the graces.</p>
            <p>I was here convinced of the truth of a reflection I have often made; <hi>that if it were the faſhion to go naked, the face would be hardly obſerved.</hi> I perceived that the ladies of the moſt delicate ſkins and fineſt ſhapes, had the greateſt ſhare of my admiration, though their faces were ſometimes leſs beautiful than thoſe of their companions. To tell you the truth, I had wickedneſs enough, to wiſh ſecretly, that Mr. <hi>Gervais</hi> could have been there inviſible. I fancy it would have very much improved his art, to ſee ſo many fine women naked, in different poſtures, ſome in converſation, ſome working, others drinking cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee or ſherbet, and many negligently lying on their cuſhions, while their ſlaves (generally pretty girls of ſeventeen, or eighteen) were employ'd in braiding their hair in ſeveral pretty fancies. In ſhort, 'tis the woman's coffee-houſe, where all the news of the town is told, ſcandal invented, &amp;c.—They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take this diverſion once a week, and ſtay there at leaſt four or five hours, without getting cold, by immediate coming out of the hot-bath into the cool room, which was very ſurpriſing, to me. The lady, that ſeemed the moſt conſiderable amongſt them, entreated me to ſit by her, and would fain have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed me for the bath, I excuſed myſelf with ſome difficulty. They being however all ſo earneſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading me, I was at laſt forced to open my ſhirt, and ſhew them my ſtays, which ſatisfied them very well; for, I ſaw, they believed I was locked up in that machine, and that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they attributed to my husband.—I was charmed with their civility and beauty, and ſhould have been very glad to paſs more

time with them; but Mr. W—reſolving to purſue his journey next morning early, I was in haſte to ſee the ruins of Juſtinian's church, which did not afford me ſo agreeable a proſpect as I had left, being little more than a heap of ſtones.</p>
            <p>Adieu, Madam, I am ſure I have now entertained you, with an account of ſuch a ſight, as you never ſaw in your life, and what no book of travels could inform you of, as 'tis no leſs than death for a man to be found in one of theſe places.</p>

            <p>YOU ſee that I am very exact in keeping the promiſe you engaged me to make. I know not, however, whether your curioſity will be ſatisfied with the accounts I ſhall give you, tho' I can aſſure you, the deſire I have to oblige you to the utmoſt of my power, has made me very diligent in my inquiries and obſervations. 'Tis certain we have but very imperfect accounts of the manners and religion of theſe people. This part of the world being ſeldom viſited, but by merchants, who mind little but their own affairs; or travellers, who make too ſhort a ſtay to be able to report any thing exactly of their own knowledge. The Turks are too proud to converſe familiarly with merchants, who can only pick up ſome confuſed informations, which are generally falſe, and can give no better account of the ways here,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:041644_0083_101AD228C14A1FB8"/>
than a French Refugée, lodging in a garret in Greek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, could write of the court of England. The journey we have made from Belgrade hither, cannot poſſibly be paſſed by any out of the public character. The deſert woods of Servia, are the common refuge of thieves, who rob, fifty in a company, ſo that we had need of all our guards to ſecure us; and the villages are ſo poor, that only force could extort from them neceſſary proviſions. Indeed the Janizaries had no mercy on their poverty, killing all the poultry and ſheep they could find, without aſking to whom they belonged; while the wretched owners durſt not put in their claim for fear of being beaten. Lambs juſt fallen, geeſe and turkies big with egg, all maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred without diſtinction! I fancied I heard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Melibeus,</hi> for the hope of his flock. When the Baſſas travel, 'tis yet worſe. Thoſe oppreſſors are not content, with eating all that is to be eaten belonging to the peaſants; after they have crammed themſelves and their numerous retinue, they have the impudence to exact what they call <hi>Teeth money,</hi> a contribution for their uſe of their teeth, worn with doing them the honour of devouring their meat. This is literally and exactly true, however extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant it may ſeem; and ſuch is the natural corruption of a military government, their religion not allowing of this barbarity, any more than ours does.</p>
            <p>I had the advantage of lodging three weeks at Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, with a principal Effendi, that is to ſay, a ſcholar. This ſet of men are equally capable of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in the law or the church; thoſe two ſciences being caſt into one, and a lawyer and a prieſt being the ſame word in the Turkiſh language. They are the only men really conſiderable in the Empire, all the profitable employments and church revenues
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:041644_0084_101AD22B8257FDA8"/>
are in their hands. The Grand Signior, though general heir to his people, never preſumes to touch their lands or money, which go, in an uninterrupted ſucceſſion, to their children. 'Tis true, they loſe this privilege, by accepting a place at court, or the title of Baſſa; but there are few examples of ſuch fools among them. You may eaſily judge of the power of theſe men, who have engroſſed all the learning, and almoſt all the wealth of the Empire. 'Tis they that are the real authors, tho' the ſoldiers are the actors, of revolutions. They depoſed the late Sultan <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and their power is ſo well known, that 'tis the Emperor's intereſt to flatter them.</p>
            <p>This is a long digreſſion. I was going to tell you, that an intimate, daily converſation with the Effendi <hi>Achmet-beg,</hi> gave me an opportunity of knowing their religion and morals in a more particular manner than perhaps any Chriſtian ever did. I explained to him the difference between the religion of England and Rome; and he was pleaſed to hear there were Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that did not worſhip images, or adore the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary.</hi> The ridicule of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very ſtrong to him.—Upon comparing our creeds together, I am convinced that if our friend Dr.—had free liberty of preaching here, it would be very eaſy to perſuade the generality to Chriſtianity, whoſe notions are very little different from his. Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> would make a very good Apoſtle here. I don't doubt but his zeal will be much fired, if you communicate this account to him; but tell him, he muſt firſt have the gift of tongues, before he can poſſibly be of any uſe.—Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is divided into as many ſects as Chriſtianity, and the firſt inſtitution as much neglected, and obſcured by interpretations. I cannot here forbear reflecting
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:041644_0085_101AD22DAFBBF498"/>
on the natural inclination of mankind, to make myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and novelties.—The <hi>Zeidi, Kudi, Jabari,</hi> &amp;c. put me in mind of the <hi>Catholics, Lutherans, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> and are equally zealous againſt one another. But the moſt prevailing opinion, if you ſearch into the ſecret of the Effendi's, is plain Deiſm. This is indeed kept from the people, who are amuſed with a thouſand different notions, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent intereſt of their preachers.—There are very few amongſt them (<hi>Achmet-beg</hi> denied there were any) ſo abſurd, as to ſet up for wit, by declaring they believe no God at all. And Sir <hi>Paul Rycaut</hi> is miſtaken (as he commonly is) in calling the ſect <hi>Mute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> (i. e. <hi>the ſecret with us</hi>) Atheiſts, they being Deiſts, whoſe impiety conſiſts in making a jeſt of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Achmet-beg</hi> did not own to me, that he was of this opinion, but made no ſcruple of deviating from ſome part of Mahomet's law, by drinking wine with the ſame freedom we did. When I aſked him how he came to allow himſelf that liberty; he made anſwer, That all the creatures of God are good, and deſigned for the uſe of man; however, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of wine was a very wiſe maxim, and meant for the common people, being the ſource of all diſorders amongſt them; but that the prophet never deſigned to confine thoſe that knew how to uſe it with moderation; nevertheleſs, he ſaid, that ſcandal ought to be avoided, and that he never drank it in public. This is the general way of thinking amongſt them, and very few forbear drinking wine, that are able to afford it. He aſſured me, that if I underſtood Arabic, I ſhould be very well pleaſed with reading the Alcoran, which is ſo far from the nonſenſe we charge it with, that 'tis the pureſt morality, delivered in the very beſt language. I have ſince heard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:041644_0086_101AD22F338CD6A0"/>
Chriſtians ſpeak of it in the ſame manner; and I don't doubt but that all our tranſlations are from copies got from the Greek prieſts, who would not fail to falſify it with the extremity of malice. No body of men ever were more ignorant, or more corrupt; yet they differ ſo little from the Romiſh Church, that, I confeſs, nothing gives me a greater abhorrence of the cruelty of your clergy, than the barbarous perſecution of them, whenever they have been their maſters, for no other reaſon, than their not acknowledging the Pope. The diſſenting in that one article, has got them the titles of Heretics, and Schiſmatis; and what is worſe, the ſame treatment. I found at Phillippopolis, a ſect of Chriſtians that call themſelves <hi>Paulines.</hi> They ſhew an old church where, they ſay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and he is their favourite Saint, after the ſame manner that St. <hi>Peter</hi> is at Rome; neither do they forget to give him the ſame preference over the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But of all the religions I have ſeen, that of the <hi>Arnounts</hi> ſeems to me the moſt particular; they are natives of <hi>Arnountlich,</hi> the antient <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and ſtill retain the courage and hardineſs, tho' they have loſt the name of Macedonians, being the beſt militia in the Turkiſh Empire, and the only check upon the Janizaries. They are foot ſoldiers; we had a guard of them, relieved in every conſiderable town we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; they are clothed and armed at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, dreſſed in clean white coarſe cloth, carrying guns of a prodigious length, which they run with upon their ſhoulders, as if they did not feel the weight of them, the leader ſinging a ſort of a rude tune, not unpleaſant, and the reſt making up the chorus. Theſe people living between Chriſtians and Mahometans, and not being ſkilled in controverſy,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:041644_0087_101AD2317B142928"/>
declare that they are utterly unable to judge which religion is beſt; but to be certain of not entirely rejecting the truth, they very prudently follow both. They go to the moſques on Fridays and to the church on Sunday, ſaying for their excuſe, that at the day of judgment they are ſure of protection from the true prophet; but which that is, they are not able to determine in this world. I believe there is no other race of mankind, who have ſo modeſt an opinion of their own capacity.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the remarks I have made, on the diverſity of religions I have ſeen. I don't aſk your pardon for the liberty I have taken in ſpeaking of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I know you equally condemn the quackery of all churches, as much as you revere the ſacred truths, in which we both agree.</p>
            <p>You will expect I ſhould ſay ſomething to you of the antiquities of this country, but there are few remains of antient Greece. We paſſed near the piece of an arch which is commonly called <hi>Trajan's gate,</hi> from a ſuppoſition that he made it to ſhut up the paſſage over the mountains, between Sophia and Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippopolis. But I rather believe it the remains of ſome triumphal arch (though I could not ſee any inſcription;) for if that paſſage had been ſhut up, there are many others, that would ſerve for the march of an army; and notwithſtanding the ſtory of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of Flanders, being overthrown in theſe ſtraits, after he won Conſtantinople, I don't fancy the Germans would find themſelves ſtopped by them at this day. 'Tis true, the road is now made (with great induſtry) as commodious as poſſible, for the march of the Turkiſh army; there is not one ditch or puddle between this place and Belgrade, that has not a large ſtrong bridge of planks built over it; but the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:041644_0088_101AD233A0BF4D00"/>
are not ſo terrible as I had heard them repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At theſe mountains, we lay at the little village Kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koi, wholly inhabited by Chriſtians, as all the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants of Bulgaria are. Their houſes are nothing but little huts, raiſed of dirt baked in the ſun, and they leave them and fly into the mouutains, ſome months before the march of the Turkiſh army, who would elſe entirely ruin them, by driving away their whole flocks. This precaution ſecures them in a ſort of plenty; for ſuch vaſt tracts of land lying in common, they have the liberty of ſowing what they pleaſe and are generally very induſtrious husbandmen. I drank here ſeveral ſorts of delicious wine. The women dreſs themſelves in a great variety of coloured glaſs-beads, and are not ugly, but of tawney com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. I have now told you all, that is worth telling you, and perhaps more, relating to my journey. When I am at Conſtantinople, I'll try to pick up ſome curioſities, and then you ſhall hear again from.</p>

is ſo great, the ſame ſort of things are not proper for <hi>Caftans</hi> and <hi>Manteaus.</hi> However, I will not give over my ſearch, but renew it again at Conſtantinople, though I have reaſon to believe there is nothing finer than what is to be found here, as this place is at preſent the reſidence of the court. The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's eldeſt daughter was married ſome few days before I came hither, and upon that occaſion the Turkiſh Ladies diſplay all their magnificence. The bride was conducted to her husband's houſe in very great ſplendor. She is widow of the late Vizier, who was killed at Peterwaradin, though that ought rather to be called a <hi>contract,</hi> than a <hi>marriage,</hi> ſince ſhe never has lived with him; however, the greateſt part of his wealth is hers. He had the permiſſion of viſiting her in the Seraglio; and being one of the handſomeſt men in the empire, had very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her affections.—When ſhe ſaw this ſecond husband, who is at leaſt fifty, ſhe could not forbear burſting into tears. He is indeed a man of merit, and the declared favourite of the Sultan, (which they call <hi>Moſayp</hi>) but that is not enough to make him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the eyes of a girl of thirteen.</p>
            <p>The government here is entirely in the hands of the army. The Grand Signior, with all his abſolute power, is as much a ſlave as any of his ſubjects, and trembles at a Janizary's frown. Here is, indeed, a much greater appearance of ſubjection than amongſt us; a miniſter of ſtate is not ſpoke to, but upon the knee; ſhould a reflection on his conduct be dropt in a coffee houſe, (for they have ſpies every where) the houſe would be raz'd to the ground, and perhaps the whole company put to the torture. No <hi>huzzaing mobs, ſenſeleſs pamphlets, and tavern diſputes about politicks;</hi>

                  <l>A bad effect,—but from a noble cauſe.</l>
               </q>
None of our harmleſs calling names! but when a miniſter here diſpleaſes the people, in three hours time he is dragged even from his maſter's arms. They cut off his hands, head and feet, and throw them before the palace-gate, with all the reſpect in the world; while the Sultan (to whom they all profeſs an unlimited adoration) ſits trembling in his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dare neither defend nor revenge his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. This is the bleſſed condition of the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute monarch upon earth, who owns no <hi>Law</hi> but his <hi>Will.</hi>

            <p>I cannot help wiſhing, in the loyalty of my heart, that the Parliament would ſend hither a ſhip load of your paſſive obedient men, that they might ſee arbitrary government in its cleareſt ſtrongeſt light, where 'tis hard to judge, whether the Prince, People or Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are moſt miſerable. I could make many reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this ſubject; but I know, Madam, your own good ſenſe, has already furniſhed you with better than I am capable of.</p>
            <p>I went yeſterday along with the French Ambaſſadreſs to ſee the Grand Signior in his paſſage to the Moſque. He was preceded by a numerous guard of Janizaries, with vaſt white feathers on their heads, as alſo by the <hi>Spahis</hi> and <hi>Boſtangees,</hi> (theſe are foot and horſe guards) and the Royal Gardeners, which are a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable body of men, dreſſed in different habits of fine lively colours, ſo that, at a diſtance, they appeared like a parterre of tulips. After them the Aga of the Janizaries, in a robe of purple velvet, lined with ſilver tiſſue, his horſe led by two ſlaves richly dreſſed. Next him the <hi>Kyzlier-Aga,</hi> (your ladyſhip knows, this
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:041644_0091_101AD23A2D2BE378"/>
is the chief guardian of the Seraglio Ladies) in a deep yellow cloth (which ſuited very well to his black face) lined with ſables. Laſt came his <hi>Sublimity</hi> himſelf, arrayed in green, lined with the fur of a black Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite fox, which is ſuppoſed worth a thouſand pounds ſterling, and mounted on a fine horſe, with furniture embroidered with jewels. Six more horſes richly capariſoned were led after him; and two of his principal courtiers bore, one his gold, and the other his ſilver coffee-pot, on a ſtaff; another carried a ſilver ſtool on his head, for him to ſit on.—It would be too tedious to tell your ladyſhip, the various dreſſes and turbants by which their rank is diſtinguiſhed; but they are all extremely rich and gay, to the number of ſome thouſands; ſo that perhaps there cannot be ſeen a more beautiful proceſſion. The Sultan appeared to us a handſome man of about forty, with ſomething, however, ſevere in his countenance, and his eyes very full and black. He happened to ſtop under the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow where we ſtood, and (I ſuppoſe being told who we were) looked upon us very attentively, ſo that we had full leiſure to conſider him. The French Ambaſſadreſs agreed with me as to his good mien. I ſee that lady very often; ſhe is young, and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation would be a great relief to me, if I could perſuade her to live without thoſe forms and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that make life formal and tireſome. But ſhe is ſo delighted with her guards, her four and twenty footmen, gentlemen-uſhers, &amp;c. that ſhe would rather die than make me a viſit without them; not to reckon a coachful of attending damſels yolep'd maids of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. What vexes me is that as long as ſhe will viſit me with a troubleſome equipage, I am obliged to do the ſame; however, our mutual intereſt makes us much together. I went with her the other day all
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:041644_0092_101AD23BF1F55E20"/>
round the town, in an open gilt chariot, with our joint train of attendants, preceded by our guards, who might have ſummoned the people to ſee what they had never ſeen, nor ever perhaps would ſee again, two young Chriſtian Ambaſſadreſſes at the ſame time. Your ladyſhip may eaſily imagine, we drew a vaſt croud of ſpectators, but all ſilent as death. If any of them had taken the liberties of our mobs upon any ſtrange ſight, our Janizaries had made no ſcruple of falling on them with their ſcymitars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger for ſo doing, being above law. Theſe people however (I mean the Janizaries) have ſome good qualities; they are very zealous and faithful where they ſerve, and look upon it as their buſineſs to fight for you on all occaſions. Of this I had a very pleaſant inſtance in a village on this ſide Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippopolis, where we were met by our domeſtic guards. I happened to beſpeak pigeons for ſupper, upon which one of my Janizaries went immediately to the <hi>Cadi</hi> (the chief civil officer of the town) and ordered him to ſend in ſome dozen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The poor man anſwered, that he had already ſent about, but could get none, My Janizary, in the height of his zeal for my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, immediately locked him up priſoner in his room, telling him he deſerved death for his impudence, in offering to excuſe his not obeying my command; but, out of reſpect to me, he would not puniſh him but by my order. Accordingly he came very gravely to me, to aſk what ſhould be done to him; adding, by way of compliment, that if I pleaſed he would bring me his head.—This may give you ſome idea of the unlimited power of theſe fellows, who are all ſworn brothers, and bound to revenge the injuries done to one another, whether at Cairo, Aleppo, or any part of the world. This inviolable league makes them ſo
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:041644_0093_101AD23F559E8BC0"/>
powerful, that the greateſt man at court never ſpeaks to them, but in a flattering tone; and in Aſia, any man that is rich, is forced to enroll himſelf a Janizary to ſecure his eſtate.—But I have already ſaid enough, and I dare ſwear, dear Madam, that, by this time, 'tis a very comfortable reflection to you, that there is no poſſibility of your receiving ſuch a tedious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but once in ſix months; 'tis that conſideration has given me the aſſurance of entertaining you ſo long, and will, I hope, plead the excuſe of, dear Madam,</p>

Pray let me into more particulars, and I will try to awaken your gratitude, by giving you a full and true relation of the novelties of this place, none of which would ſurpriſe you more than a ſight

of my perſon, as I am now in my Turkiſh habit, though I believe you would be of my opinion, that 'tis admirably becoming.—I intend to ſend you my picture; in the mean time accept of it here.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of my dreſs is a pair of drawers, very full, that reach to my ſhoes, and conceal the legs more modeſtly than your petticoats. They are of a thin roſe coloured damaſk, brocaded with ſilver flowers. My ſhoes are of white kid leather, embroidered with gold. Over this hangs my ſmock, of a fine white ſilk gauze, edged with embroidery. This ſmock has wide ſleeves, hanging half-way down the arm, and is cloſed at the neck with a diamond button; but the ſhape and colour of the boſom is very well to be diſtinguiſhed through it.—The <hi>Antery</hi> is a waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, made cloſe to the ſhape, of white and gold da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk, with very long ſleeves falling back, and fringed with deep gold fringe, and ſhould have diamond or pearl buttons. My <hi>Caftan,</hi> of the ſame ſtuff with my drawers, is a robe exactly fitted to my ſhape and reaching to my feet, with very long ſtrait falling ſleeves. Over this is the girdle, of about four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad, which all that can afford it, have entirely of diamonds or other precious ſtones; thoſe, who will not be at that expence, have it of exquiſite em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery on ſattin; but it muſt be faftened before with a claſp of diamonds.—The <hi>Curdee</hi> is a looſe robe they throw off, or put on, according to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being of a rich brocade (mine, is green and gold) either lined with ermine or ſables; the ſleeves reach very little below the ſhoulders. The head-dreſs is compoſed of a cap, called <hi>Talpock,</hi> which is, in winter, of fine velvet embroidered with pearls or dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and, in ſummer, of a light ſhining ſilver ſtuff. This is fixed on one ſide of the head, hanging a little
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:041644_0095_101AD2434FBE1B08"/>
way down with a gold taſſel, and bound on, either with a circle of diamonds (as I have ſeen ſeveral) or a rich embroidered handkerchief. On the other ſide of the head, the hair is laid flat; and here the ladies are at liberty to ſhew their fancies; ſome putting flowers, others a plume of heron's feathers, and, in ſhort, what they pleaſe; but the moſt general faſhion is, a large <hi>Bouquet</hi> of jewels, made like natural flowers, that is, the <hi>buds</hi> of pearl; the <hi>roſes</hi> of different coloured rubies; the <hi>jeſſamines</hi> of diamonds; the <hi>jonquils</hi> of topazes, &amp;c. ſo well ſet and enamelled, 'tis hard to imagine any thing of that kind ſo beautiful. The hair hangs at its full length behind, divided into treſſes braided with pearl or ribbon, which is always in great quantity. I never ſaw in my life, ſo many fine heads of hair. In one lady's I have counted a hundred and ten of the treſſes, all natural; but it muſt be owned that every kind of beauty is more common here than with us. 'Tis ſurpriſing to ſee a young woman that is not very handſome. They have naturally the moſt beautiful complexions in the world, and generally large black eyes. I can aſſure you with great truth, that the court of England (though I believe it the faireſt in Chriſtendom) does not contain ſo many beauties as are under our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection here. They generally ſhape their eye-brows, and both Greeks and Turks have the cuſtom of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting round their eyes a black tincture, that, at diſtance, or by candle light, adds very much to the blackneſs of them. I fancy many of our ladies would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed to know this ſecret; but 'tis too viſible by day. They dye their nails a roſe-colour; but I own, I cannot enough accuſtom myſelf to this faſhion, to find any beauty in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:041644_0096_101AD24573416238"/>
As to their morality or good conduct, I can ſay, like Harlequin, that 'tis juſt as 'tis with you; and the Turkiſh ladies don't commit one ſin the leſs for not being Chriſtians. Now that I am a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their ways, I cannot forbear admiring, either the exemplary diſcretion, or extreme ſtupidity of all the writers that have given accounts of them. 'Tis very eaſy to ſee, they have in reality more liberty than we have. No woman, of what rank ſoever, is permitted to go into the ſtreets without two <hi>Murlins,</hi> one that covers her face, all but her eyes; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hides the whole dreſs of her head, and hangs half way down her back. Their ſhapes are alſo wholly concealed, by a thing they call a <hi>Ferigee,</hi> which no woman of any ſort appears without; this has ſtrait ſleeves, that reach to their fingers ends, and it laps all round them, not unlike a riding-hood. In winter, 'tis of cloth; and in ſummer, of plain ſtuff or ſilk. You may gueſs then, how effectually this diſguiſes them, ſo that there is no diſtinguiſhing the great lady from her ſlave. 'Tis impoſſible for the moſt jealous husband to know his wife, when he meets her, and no man dare touch or follow a woman in the ſtreet.</p>
            <p>This perpetual maſquerade gives them entire liberty of following their inclinations without danger of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The moſt uſual method of intrigue is, to ſend an appointment to the lover to meet the lady at a Jew's ſhop, which are as notoriouſly convenient as our Indian-houſes; and yet, even thoſe who don't make uſe of them, do not ſcruple to go to buy penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths, and tumble over rich goods, which are chiefly to be found amongſt that ſort of people. The great ladies ſeldom let their gallants know who they are; and 'tis ſo difficult to find it out, that they can very
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:041644_0097_101AD2487408DCA0"/>
ſeldom gueſs at her name, whom they have correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with for above half a year together. You may eaſily imagine the number of faithful wives very ſmall in a country where they have nothing to fear from a lover's indiſcretion, ſince we ſee ſo many have the courage to expoſe themſelves to that in this world, and all the threatened puniſhment of the next, which is never preached to the Turkiſh damſels. Neither have they much to apprehend from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of their husbands: thoſe ladies that are rich, having all their money in their own hands. Upon the whole, I look upon the Turkiſh women, as the only free people in the Empire; the very Divan pays a reſpect to them, and the Grand Signior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when a <hi>Baſſa</hi> is executed, never violates the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the <hi>Haram,</hi> (or womens apartment) which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unſearched and entire to the widow. They are Queens of their ſlaves, whom the husband has no permiſſion ſo much as to look upon, except it be an old woman or two that his lady chooſes. 'Tis true, their law permits them four wives, but there is no inſtance of a man of quality that makes uſe of this liberty, or of a woman of rank that would ſuffer it. When a husband happens to be inconſtant (as thoſe things will happen) he keeps his miſtreſs in a houſe apart, and viſits her as privately as he can, juſt as 'tis with you. Amongſt all the great men here, I only know the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> (i. e. Treaſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) that keeps a number of ſhe-ſlaves, for his own uſe, (that is, on his own ſide of the houſe, for a ſlave once given to ſerve a lady, is entirely at her diſpoſal) and he is ſpoke of as a libertine, or what we ſhould call a rake; and his wife won't ſee him, though ſhe continues to live in his houſe. Thus you ſee, dear ſiſter, the manners of mankind do not differ ſo widely, as our
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:041644_0098_101AD249F61D31F8"/>
voyage writers would make us believe. Perhaps, it would be more entertaining to add a few ſurpriſing cuſtoms of my own invention; but nothing ſeems to me ſo agreeable as truth, and I believe nothing ſo acceptable to you. I conclude therefore, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the great truth of my being,</p>

            <p>I DARE ſay you expect, at leaſt, ſomething very new in this letter, after I have gone a journey, not undertaken, by any Chriſtian, for ſome hundred years. The moſt remarkable accident that happened to me, was my being very near over-turned into the Hebrus; and, if I had much regard for the glories that one's name enjoys after death, I ſhould certainly be ſorry for having miſſed the romantic concluſion of ſwimming down the ſame river in which the muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal head of <hi>Orpheus</hi> repeated verſes, ſo many ages ſince:

I deſpair of ever hearing ſo many fine things ſaid of me, as ſo extraordinary a death would have given occaſion for.</p>
            <p>I am at this preſent moment writing in a houſe ſituated on the banks of the Hebrus, which runs under my chamber window. My garden is full of tall cypreſs trees, upon the branches of which, ſeveral couple of true turtles are ſaying ſoft things to one an other from morning till night. How naturally do <hi>boughs</hi> and <hi>vows</hi> come into my mind, at this minute? And muſt not you confeſs, to my praiſe, that 'tis more than an ordinary diſcretion, that can reſiſt the wicked ſuggeſtions of poetry in a place where truth, for once, furniſhes all the ideas of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral. The ſummer is already far advanced, in this part of the world; and for ſome miles round Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople, the whole ground is laid out in gardens, and the banks of the rivers are ſet with rows of fruit trees, under which all the moſt conſiderable Turks divert themſelves every evening, not with walking, that is not one of their pleaſures; but a ſet party of them chooſe out a green ſpot, where the ſhade is very thick, and there they ſpread a carpet, on which they ſit drinking their coffee, and are generally attended by ſome ſlave with a fine voice, or that plays on ſome inſtrument. Every twenty paces you may ſee one of theſe little companies, liſtening to the daſhing of the river; and this taſte is ſo univerſal, that the very gardeners are not without it. I have often ſeen them and their children ſitting on the banks of the river, and playing on a rural inſtrument, perfectly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſcription of the ancient <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of unequal reeds, with a ſimple but agreeable ſoftneſs in the ſound.</p>

Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> might here make the experiment he ſpeaks of in his travels; there not being one inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of muſic among the Greek or Roman Statues, that is not to be found in the hands of the people of this country. The young lads generally divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with making garlands for their favourite lambs, which I have often ſeen painted and adorned with flowers, lying at their feet, while they ſung or played. It is not that they ever read Romances. But theſe are the ancient amuſements here, and as natural to them as cudgel-playing and foot-ball to our Britiſh ſwains; the ſoftneſs and warmth of the climate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all rough exerciſes, which were never ſo much as heard of amongſt them, and naturally inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a lazineſs and averſion to labour, which the great plenty indulges. Theſe gardeners are the only happy race of country people in Turkey. They furniſh all the city with fruits and herbs, and ſeem to live very eaſily. They are moſt of them Greeks, and have little houſes in the midſt of their gardens, where their wives and daughters, take a liberty, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the town, I mean to go unveiled. Theſe wenches are very neat and handſome, and paſs their time at their looms under the ſhade of the trees.</p>
            <p>I no longer look upon <hi>Theocritus</hi> as a romantic wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he has only given a plain image of the way of life amongſt the peaſants of his country; who, before oppreſſion had reduced them to want, were, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, all employed as the better ſort of them are now. I don't doubt had he been born a Briton, but his <hi>Idylliums</hi> had been filled with deſcriptions of threſhing and churning, both which are unknown here, the corn being all trod out by oxen; and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (I ſpeak it with ſorrow) unheard of.</p>

I read over your <hi>Homer</hi> here, with an infinite plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and find ſeveral little paſſages explained, that I did not before entirely comprehend the beauty of: Many of the cuſtoms, and much of the dreſs then in faſhion, being yet retained. I don't wonder to find more remains here, of an age ſo diſtant, than is to be found in any other country, the Turks not taking that pains to introduce their own manners, as has been generally practiſed by other nations, that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves more polite. It would be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you to point out all the paſſages that relate to preſent cuſtoms. But I can aſſure you, that the Princeſſes and great ladies paſs their time at their looms, embroidering veils and robes, ſurrounded by their maids, which are always very numerous, in the ſame manner as we find <hi>Andromache</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. The deſcription of the belt of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> exactly reſembles thoſe that are now worn by the great men, faſtened before with broad golden claſps, and embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered round with rich work. The ſnowy veil, that <hi>Helen</hi> throws over her face, is ſtill faſhionable; and I never ſee half a dozen of old Baſhaws (as I do very often) with their reverend beards, ſitting baſking in the ſun, but I recollect good King <hi>Priam</hi> and his counſellors. Their manner of dancing is certainly the ſame that <hi>Diana</hi> is <hi>ſung</hi> to have danced on the banks of <hi>Eurotas.</hi> The great lady ſtill leads the dance, and is followed by a troop of young girls, who imitate her ſteps, and, if ſhe ſings, make up the chorus. The tunes are extremely gay and lively, yet with ſomething in them wonderfully ſoft. The ſteps are varied according to the pleaſure of her that leads the dance, but always in exact time, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more agreeable than any of our dances, at leaſt in my opinion. I ſometimes make one in the train,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:041644_0102_101AD252C3D00B30"/>
but am not ſkilful enough to lead; theſe are the Grecian dances, the Turkiſh being very different.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have told you, in the firſt place, that the Eaſtern manners give a great light into many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture paſſages that appear odd to us, their phraſes being commonly what we ſhould call Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The vulgar Turk is very different from what is ſpoke at court, or amongſt the people of figure; who always mix ſo much Arabic and Perſian in their diſcourſe, that it may very well be called another language. And 'tis as ridiculous to make uſe of the expreſſions commonly uſed, in ſpeaking to a great man or lady, as it would be to ſpeak broad Yorkſhire, or Somerſetſhire, in the drawing-room. Beſides this deſtinction, they have what they call, the <hi>ſublime,</hi> that is, a ſtyle proper for poetry, and which is the exact Scripture ſtyle. I believe you would be pleaſed to ſee a genuine example of this; and I am very glad I have it in my power to ſatisfy your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, by ſending you a faithful copy of the verſes that <hi>Ibraim Baſſa,</hi> the reigning favourite, has made for the young Princeſs, his contracted Wife, whom he is not yet permitted to viſit without witneſſes though ſhe is gone home to his houſe. He is a man of wit and learning; and whether or no he is capable of writing good verſe, you may be ſure, that on ſuch an occaſion, he would not want the aſſiſtance of the beſt poets in the Empire. Thus the verſes may be looked upon as a ſample of their fineſt poetry; and I don't doubt you'll be of my mind, that it is moſt wonderfully reſembling the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> which alſo was addreſſed to a Royal Bride.</p>

            <p>I have taken abundance of pains to get theſe verſes in a literal tranſlation; and if you were acquainted with my interpreters, I might ſpare myſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of aſſuring you, that they have received no poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical touches from their hands. In my opinion, (allowing for the inevitable faults of a proſe tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a language ſo very different) there is a good deal of beauty in them. The epithet of <hi>ſtag-ey'd</hi> (though the ſound is not very agreeable in Engliſh) pleaſes me extremely; and I think it a very lively image of the fire and indifference in his miſtreſſes eyes.—Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi> has very juſtly obſerved, that we are never to judge of the elevation of an expreſſion in an antient author, by the ſound it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with us; ſince it may be extremely fine with them, when, at the ſame time, it appeals low or uncouth to us. You are ſo well acquainted with <hi>Homer,</hi> you cannot but have obſerved the ſame thing, and you muſt have the ſame indulgence for all ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental poetry. The repetitions at the end of the two firſt Stanza's are meant for a ſort of <hi>Chorus,</hi> and are agreeable to the antient manner of writing. The muſic of the verſes apparently changes in the third Stanza, where the burden is altered; and I think he very artfully ſeems more paſſionate at the concluſion, as 'tis natural for people to warm themſelves by their
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:041644_0105_101AD25A5B29DB80"/>
own diſcourſe, eſpecially on a ſubject in which one is deeply concerned; 'tis certainly far more touching, than our modern cuſtom of concluding a ſong of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with a turn which is inconſiſtent with it. The firſt verſe is a deſcription of the ſeaſon of the year; all the country now being full of Nightingales, whoſe amours with roſes, is an Arabian fable, as well known here, as any part of <hi>Ovid</hi> amongſt us, and is much the ſame as if an Engliſh poem ſhould begin, by ſaying,—<hi>"Now Philomela ſings.".</hi> Or what if I turned the whole into the ſtile of the Engliſh poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to ſee how it would look?</p>

            <p>I have taken the liberty in the ſecond verſe, of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing what I ſuppoſe the true ſenſe of the author, though not literally expreſſed. By his ſaying, <hi>he went down to admire the beauty of the Vines, and her charms raviſhed his ſoul;</hi> I underſtand a poetical fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of having firſt ſeen her in the garden, where he was admiring the beauty of the ſpring. But I could not forbear retaining the compariſon of her eyes with thoſe of a ſtag, though perhaps the novelty of it may give it a burleſque ſound in our language. I cannot determine, upon the whole, how well I have ſucceeded in the tranſlation, neither do I think our Engliſh proper to expreſs ſuch violence of paſſion, which is very ſeldom felt amongſt us. We want, alſo, thoſe compound words which are very frequent and ſtrong in the Turkiſh language.</p>

            <head>LETTER XXXI.</head>
            <head>To Mrs. S. C.</head>

               <dateline>Adrianople, <date>April 1,</date> O. S.</dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my opinion, dear S. I ought rather to quarrel with you, for not anſwering my Nimeguen letter of Auguſt, till December, than to excuſe my not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again till now. I am ſure there is on my ſide a very good excuſe for ſilence, having gone ſuch tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome land-journies, though I don't find the concluſion of them ſo bad as you ſeem to imagine. I am very eaſy here, and not in the ſolitude you fancy me. The great number of Greeks, French, Engliſh and Italians, that are under our protection, make their court to me from morning till night; and I'll aſſure you, are, many of them, very fine ladies; for there is no poſſibility for a Chriſtian to live eaſily under this government, but by the protection of an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador—and the richer they are, the greater is their danger.</p>
            <p>Thoſe dreadful ſtories you have heard of the <hi>Plague,</hi> have very little foundation in truth. I own, I have much ado to reconcile myſelf to the ſound of a word, which has always given me ſuch terrible ideas; though I am convinced there is little more in it, than a fever. As a proof this, let me tell you, that we paſſed through two or three towns moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently infected. In the very next houſe where we lay, (in one of thoſe places) two perſons died of it. Luckily for me, I was ſo well deceived, that I knew
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:041644_0108_101AD2612A3C1A70"/>
nothing of the matter; and I was made believe, that our ſecond cook had only a great cold. However, we left our doctor to take care of him, and yeſterday they both arrived here in good health; and I am now let into the ſecret, that he has had the <hi>Plague.</hi> There are many that eſcape it, neither is the air ever infected. I am perſuaded that it would be as eaſy a matter to root it out here, as out of Italy and France; but it does ſo little miſchief they are not very ſolicitous about it, and are content to ſuffer this diſtemper, inſtead of our variety, which they are utterly unacquainted with.</p>
            <p>A <hi>propos</hi> of diſtempers, I am going to tell you a thing, that will make you wiſh yourſelf here. The <hi>ſmall-pox,</hi> ſo fatal, and ſo general amongſt us, is here entirely harmleſs, by the invention of <hi>engrafting,</hi> which is the term they give it. There is a ſet of old women, who make it their buſineſs to perform the operation, every autumn, in the month of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, when the great heat is abated. People ſend to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the ſmall-pox; they make parties for this purpoſe, and when they are met (commonly fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſixteen together) the old women comes with a nut-ſhell full of the matter of the beſt ſort of ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, and aſks what veins you pleaſe to have opened. She immediately rips open that, you offer to her, with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common ſcratch) and puts into the vein, as much matter as can lie upon the head of her needle, and after that, binds up the little wound with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low bit of ſhell, and in this manner opens four or five veins. The Grecians have commonly the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of opening one in the middle of the forehead, one in each arm, and one on the breaſt, to mark the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:041644_0109_101AD26361A7A190"/>
ſign of the croſs; but this has a very ill effect, all theſe wounds leaving little ſcars, and is not done by thoſe that are not ſuperſtitious, who chooſe to have them in the legs, or that part of the arm that is concealed. The children or young patients play together all the reſt of the day, and are in perfect health to the eighth. Then the fever begins to ſeize them, and they keep their beds two days, very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark, and in eight days time they are as well as before their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Where they are wounded, there remains run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſores during the diſtemper, which I don't doubt is a great relief to it. Every year thouſands undergo this operation, and the French Ambaſſador ſays plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, that they take the ſmall-pox here by way of diverſion, as they take the waters in others countries. There is no example of any one that has died in it, and you may believe I am well ſatisfied of the ſafety of this experiment, ſince I intend to try it on my dear little ſon. I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this uſeful invention into faſhion in England, and I ſhould not fail to write to ſome of our Doctors very particularly about it, if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to deſtroy ſuch a conſiderable branch of their revenue, for the good of mankind. But that deſtemper is too beneficial to them, not to expoſe to all their reſentment, the hardy wight that ſhould undertake to put an end to it. Perhaps, if I live to return, I may, however, have courage to war with them. Upon this occaſion, admire the heroiſm in the heart of,</p>

You would rather be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the ſtrange things that are to be ſeen here; and a letter out of Turkey, that has nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in it, would be as great a diſappointment as my viſitors will receive at London, if I return thither without any rarities to ſhew them.—What ſhall I tell you of?—You never ſaw camels in your life; and perhaps the deſcription of them will appear new to you; I can aſſure you, the firſt ſight of them was ſo to me; and though I have ſeen hundreds of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of thoſe animals, I never ſaw any that was reſembling enough, to give a true idea of them. I am going to make a bold obſervation, and poſſibly a falſe one, becauſe no body has ever made it before me; but I do take them to be of the ſtag-kind; their legs, bodies, and necks, are exactly ſhaped like them, and their colour very near the ſame. 'Tis true, they are much larger, being a great deal higher than a horſe, and ſo ſwift, that, after the defeat of Pete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> waradin, they far out-ran the ſwifteſt horſes, and brought the firſt news of the loſs of the battle to Belgrade. They are never thoroughly tamed; the drivers take care to tye them one to another with
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:041644_0111_101AD267070159A8"/>
ſtrong ropes, fifty in a ſtring, led by an aſs, on which the driver rides. I have ſeen three hundred in one caravan. They carry the third part more than any horſe: but 'tis a particular art to load them, becauſe of the bunch on their backs. They ſeem to me very ugly creatures, their heads being ill formed and diſproportioned to their bodies. They carry all the burdens; and the beaſts deſtined to the plough are buffaloes, and animal you are alſo unacquainted with. They are larger and more clumſy than an ox; they have ſhort thick black horns cloſe to their heads, which grow turning backwards. They ſay this horn looks very beautiful when 'tis well poliſhed. They are all black, with very ſhort hair on their hides, and have extremely little white eyes, that makes them look like devils. The country people dye their tails, and the hair of their forehead red, by way of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Horſes are not put here to any laborious work, nor are they at all fit for it. They are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and full of ſpirit, but generally little, and not ſtrong, as the breed of colder countries; very gentle, however, with all their vivacity, and alſo ſwift and ſure-footed. I have a little white favourite, that I would not part with on any terms; he prances under me with ſo much fire, you would think that I had a great deal of courage to dare mount him; yet I'll aſſure you, I never rid a horſe ſo much at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in my life. My ſide-ſaddle is the firſt that was ever ſeen in this part of the world, and is gazed at with as much wonder, as the ſhip of Columbus in the firſt diſcovery of America. Here are ſome little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rds, held in a ſort of religious reverence, and for that reaſon multiply prodigiouſly; <hi>Turtles,</hi> on the account of their innocence; and <hi>Storcks</hi> becauſe they are ſuppoſed to make every winter the pilgrimage
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:041644_0112_101AD269DA96F608"/>
to Mecca. To ſay truth, they are the happieſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under the Turkiſh government, and are ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their privileges, that they walk the ſtreets without fear, and generally build in the low parts of houſes. Happy are thoſe whoſe houſes are ſo diſtinguiſhed, as the vulgar Turks are perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that they will not be, that year, attacked either by fire or peſtilence. I have the happineſs of one of their ſacred neſts under my chamber-window.</p>
            <p>Now I am talking of my chamber, I remember, the deſcription of the houſes here will be as new to you, as any of the birds or beaſts. I ſuppoſe you have read in moſt of our accounts of Turkey, that their houſes are the moſt miſerable pieces of building in the world. I can ſpeak very learnedly on that ſubject, having been in ſo many of them; and I aſſure you, 'tis no ſuch thing. We are now lodged in a palace, belonging to the Grand Signior. I really think the manner of building here very agreeable, and proper for the country. 'Tis true, they are not at all ſolicitous to beautify the outſides of their houſes, and they are generally built of wood, which, I own, is the cauſe of many inconveniencies; but this is not to be charged on the ill taſte of the people, but on the oppreſſion of the government. Every houſe, at the death of its maſter, is at the Grand Signior's diſpoſal, and therefore no man cares to make a great expence, which he is not ſure his family will be the better for. All their deſign is to build a houſe commodious, and that will laſt their lives; and they are very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent if it falls down the year after. Every houſe, great and ſmall, is divided into two diſtinct parts, which only join together by a narrow paſſage. The firſt houſe has a large court before it, and open gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries all round it, which is, to me, a thing very
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:041644_0113_101AD26C174FFCB0"/>
agreeable. This gallery leads to all the chambers, which are commonly large, and with two rows of windows, the firſt being of painted glaſs; they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom build above two ſtories, each of which has gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries. The ſtairs are broad, and not often above thirty ſteps. This is the houſe belonging to the lord, and the adjoining one is called the <hi>Haram,</hi> that is, the ladies apartment, (for the name of Seraglio is peculiar to the Grand Signior) it has alſo a gallery running round it towards the garden, to which all the windows are turned, and the ſame number of chambers as the other, but more gay and ſplendid, both in painting and furniture. The ſecond row of windows are very low, with grates like thoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, the rooms are all ſpread with Perſian carpets, and raiſed at one end of them (my chambers are raiſed at both ends) about two foot. This is the <hi>Sopha,</hi> which is laid with a richer ſort of carpet, and all round it a ſort of couch raiſed half a foot, covered with rich ſilk, according to the fancy or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the owner. Mine is of ſcarlet cloth with a gold fringe; round about this are placed, ſtanding againſt the wall, two rows of cuſhions, the firſt very large, and the next little ones; and here the Turks diſplay their greateſt magnificence. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally brocade, or embroidery of gold wire upon white sattin—Nothing can look more gay and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did.—Theſe ſeats are alſo ſo convenient and eaſy, that I believe I ſhall never endure chairs as long as I live.—The rooms are low which I think no fault, and the ceiling is always of wood, generally inlaid or painted with flowers. They open in many places, with folding-doors, and ſerve for cabinets, I think more conveniently than ours. Between the windows are little arches to ſet pots of perfume or
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:041644_0114_101ABF98AA867980"/>
baſkets of flowers. But what pleaſes me beſt, is the faſhion of having marble fountains in the lower part of the room, which throw up ſeveral ſpouts of water, giving, at the ſame time, an agreeable coolneſs, and a pleaſant daſhing ſound, falling from one baſon to another. Some of theſe are very magnificent. Each houſe has a bagnio, which conſiſts generally in two or three little rooms leaded on the top, paved with marble, with baſons, cocks of water, and all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies for either hot or cold baths.</p>
            <p>You will perhaps be ſurpriſed at an account ſo different from what you have been entertained with by the common voyage-writers, who are very fond of ſpeaking of what they don't know. It muſt be under a very particular character, or on ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſion, that a Chriſtian is admitted into the houſe of a man of quality, and their <hi>Harams</hi> are always forbidden ground. Thus they can only ſpeak of the outſide, which makes no great appearance; and the womens apartments are always built back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, removed from ſight, and have no other proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect than the gardens, which are incloſed with very high walls. There is none of our parterres in them; but they are planted with high trees, which give an agreeable ſhade, and, to my fancy, a pleaſing view. In the midſt of the garden is the <hi>Chioſk,</hi> that is, a large room, commonly beautified with a fine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the midſt of it. It is raiſed nine or ten ſteps, and encloſed with gilded lattices, round which, vines, jeſſamines, and honey-ſuckles, make a ſort of green wall. Large trees are planted round this place, which is the ſcene of their greateſt pleaſures, and where the ladies ſpend moſt of their hours, employed by their muſick or embroidery.—In the public gardens, there are public <hi>Chioſks,</hi> where people go, that are not ſo
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:041644_0115_101AD26F2EB27BA8"/>
well accommodated at home, and drink their coffee, ſherbet, &amp;c. Neither are they ignorant of a more durable manner of building; their Moſques are all of free ſtone, and the public <hi>Hanns,</hi> or Inns, extremely magnificent, many of them taking up a large ſquare, built round with ſhops under ſtone arches, where poor artificers are lodged <hi>gratis.</hi> They have always a Moſque joining to them, and the body of the <hi>Hann</hi> is a moſt noble hall, capable of holding three or four hundred perſons, the court extremely ſpacious, and cloiſters round it, that give it the air of our colleges. I own, I think it a more reaſonable piece of charity than the founding of convents.—I think I have now told you a great deal for once. If you don't like my choice of ſubjects, tell me what you would have me write upon; there is nobody more deſirous to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you than, dear Mrs. T—,</p>

            <p>I WROTE to you, dear ſiſter, and to all my other Engliſh correſpondents, by the laſt ſhip, and only Heaven can tell, when I ſhall have another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſending to you; but I cannot forbear to write again, though perhaps my letter may lye upon my hands this two months. To confeſs the truth, my head is ſo full of my entertainment yeſterday, that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:041644_0116_101AD2730CCD9E50"/>
'tis abſolutely neceſſary, for my own repoſe, to give it ſome vent. Without farther preface I will then begin my ſtory.</p>
            <p>I was invited to dine with the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi>'s lady, and it was with a great deal of pleaſure I prepared myſelf for an entertainment, which was never before given to any Chriſtian. I thought, I ſhould very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfy her curioſity, (which I did not doubt was a conſiderable motive to the invitation) by going in a dreſs ſhe was uſed to ſee, and therefore dreſſed myſelf in the court habit of Vienna, which is much more magnificent than ours. However, I choſe to go <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> to avoid any diſputes about ceremony, and went in a Turkiſh coach, only attended by my woman, that held up my train, and the Greek lady, who was my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteſs. I was met, at the court-door, by her black Eunuch, who helped me out of the coach with great reſpect, and conducted me through ſeveral rooms, where her ſhe ſlaves, finely dreſſed, were ranged on each ſide. In the innermoſt, I found the lady ſitting on her ſofa, in a sable veſt. She advanced to meet me, and preſented me half a dozen of her friends, with great civility. She ſeemed a very good woman, near fifty years old. I was ſurpriſed to obſerve ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle magnificence in her houſe, the furniture being all very moderate; and except the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> its and number of her ſlaves, nothing about her appeared expenſive. She gueſſed at my thoughts, and told me, ſhe was no longer of an age to ſpend either her time or money in ſuperfluities; that her whole expence was in charity, and her whole employment praying to God. There was no affectation in this ſpeech; both ſhe and her husband are entirely given up to devotion. He never looks upon any other woman; and what is much more extraordinary, touches no bribes, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:041644_0117_101AD2753B623988"/>
example of all his predeceſſors. He is ſo ſcrupulous in this point, he would not accept Mr. W—'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, till he had been aſſured over and over, that it was a ſettled perquiſite of his place, at the entrance of every Ambaſſador. She entertained me with all kind of civility, till dinner came in, which was ſerved, one diſh at a time, to a vaſt number, all finely dreſſed after their manner, which I don't think ſo bad as you have perhaps heard it repreſented. I am a very good judge of their eating, having lived three weeks in the houſe of an <hi>Effendi</hi> at Belgrade, who gave us very magnificent dinners, dreſſed by his own cooks. The firſt week they pleaſed me extremely; but, I own, I t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>wn cook might add a diſh or two after our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But I attribute this to cuſtom, and am very much inclined to believe that an Indian, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> either, would prefer their cookery to ours. Their ſauces are very high, all the roaſt very much done. They uſe a great deal of very rich ſpice. The ſoop is ſerved for the laſt diſh; and they have, at leaſt, as great a variety of ragouts, as we have. I was very ſorry I could not eat of as many as the good lady would have had me, who was very earneſt in ſerving me of every thing. The treat concluded with coffee and perfumes, which is a high mark of reſpect; two ſlaves kneeling <hi>cenſed</hi> my hair, clothes, and handkerchief. After this ceremony, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her ſlaves to play and dance, which they did with their guitars in their hands, and ſhe excuſed to me their want of ſkill, ſaying ſhe took no care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh them in that art.</p>
            <p>I returned her thanks, and ſoon after took my leave. I was conducted back in the ſame manner I entered, and would have gone ſtrait to my own houſe
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:041644_0118_101AD26D9A2E4158"/>
but the Greek lady, with me, earneſtly ſolicited me to viſit the <hi>Kahya's</hi> lady, ſaying, he was the ſecond officer in the Empire, and ought indeed to be looked upon as the firſt, the Grand Vizier having only the name, while he exerciſed the authority. I had found ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diverſion in the Vizier's <hi>Haram,</hi> that I had no mind to go into another. But her importunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with me, and I am extremely glad, I was ſo complaiſant. All things here were with quite another air than at the Grand Vizier's; and the very houſe confessed the difference between an old devotee, and a young beauty. It was nicely clean and magnificent. I was met at the door by two black Eunuchs, who led me through a long gallery, between two ranks of beautiful young girls, with their hair finely plaited, almoſt hanging to their feet, all dreſſed in fine light damaſks, brocaded with ſilver. I was ſorry that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency did not permit me to ſtop to conſider them nearer. But that thought was loſt upon my entrance into a large room, or rather pavillion, built round with gilded ſaſhes, which were moſt of them thrown up, and the trees planted near them gave an agreeable ſhade, which hindered the Sun from being trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The jeſſamines and honey-ſuckles that twiſted round their trunks, ſhed a ſoft perfume, increaſed by a white marble fountain playing ſweet water in the lower part of the room, which fell into three or four baſons, with a pleaſing ſound. The roof was painted with all ſorts of flowers, falling out of gilded baſkets, that ſeemed tumbling down. On a Sofa, raiſed three ſteps, and covered with fine Perſian carpets, ſat the Kahya's lady, leaning on cuſhions of white ſattin em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered; and at her feet ſat two young girls about twelve years old, lovely as angels, dreſſed perfectly rich, and almoſt covered with jewels. But they were
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:041644_0119_101ABF9A63993478"/>
hardly ſeen near the fair <hi>Fatima,</hi> for that is her name) ſo much her beauty effaced every thing I have ſeen, nay, all that has been called lovely either in England or Germany. I muſt own, that I never ſaw any thing ſo gloriouſly beautiful, nor can I recollect a face that would have been taken notice of near her's. She ſtood up to receive me, ſaluting me, after their faſhion, putting her hand to her heart, with a ſweetneſs full of majeſty, that no court breeding could ever give. She ordered cuſhions to be given me, and took care to place me in the corner, which is the place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I confeſs, though the Greek lady had before given me a great opinion of her beauty, I was ſo ſtruck with admiration, that I could not, for ſome time, ſpeak to her, being wholly taken up in gazing. That ſurpriſing harmony of features! That charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſult of the whole! That exact proportion of body! That lovely bloom of complexion unſullied by art! The unutterable enchantment of her ſmile!—But her eyes!—Large and black, with all the ſoft languiſhment of the blue! every turn of her face diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſome new grace.</p>
            <p>After my firſt ſurpriſe was over, I endeavoured, by nicely examining her face, to find out ſome imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any fruit of my ſearch, but my being clearly convinced of the error of that vulgar notion, that a face exactly proportioned, and perfectly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, would not be agreeable; nature having done for her, with more ſucceſs, what <hi>Appelles</hi> is ſaid to have eſſayed by a collection of the moſt exact features to form a perfect face. Add to all this, a behaviour ſo full of grace and ſweetneſs, ſuch eaſy motions with an air ſo majeſtic, yet free from ſtiffneſs or affectation, that I am perſuaded, could ſhe be ſuddenly tranſported upon the moſt polite throne of Europe, no body would
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:041644_0120_101ABFA10C68AE78"/>
think her other than born and bred to be a Queen, though educated in a country we call barbarous. To ſay all in a word, our moſt celebrated Engliſh beauties would vaniſh near her.</p>
            <p>She was dreſſed in a <hi>Caftan</hi> of gold brocade, flowered with ſilver, very well fitted to her ſhape, and ſhewing to advantage the beauty of her boſom, only ſhaded by the thin gauze of her ſhift. Her drawers were pale pink, her waiſtcoat green and ſilver, her ſlippers white ſattin finely embroidered; her lovely arms adorned with bracelets of diamonds, and her broad girdle ſet round with diamonds; upon her head a rich Turkiſh handkerchief of pink and ſilver, her own fine black hair hanging a great length, in various treſſes, and on one ſide of her head ſome bodkins of jewels. I am afraid you will accuſe me of extravagance in this deſcription. I think I have read ſomewhere, that women always ſpeak in rapture, when they ſpeak of beauty, and I cannot imagine why they ſhould not be allowed to do ſo. I rather think it a virtue to be able to admire without any mixture of deſire or envy. The graveſt writers have ſpoke with great warmth of ſome celebrated pictures and ſtatues. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of Heaven, certainly excels all our weak imitations, and I think, has a much better claim to our praiſe. For my part, I am not aſhamed to own, I took more pleaſure in looking on the beauteous <hi>Fatima</hi> than the fineſt piece of ſculpture could have given me. She told me the two girls at her feet were her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though ſhe appeared too young to be their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Her fair maids were ranged below the Sofa, to the number of twenty, and put me in mind of the pictures of the antient nymphs. I did not think all nature could have furniſhed ſuch a ſcene of beauty. She made them a ſign to play and dance. Four of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:041644_0121_101AD19F15C63800"/>
them immediately begun to play ſome ſoft airs on inſtruments, between a lute and a guitar, which they accompanied with their voices, while the others, danced by turns. This dance was very different from what I had ſeen before. Nothing could be more artful, or more proper to raiſe <hi>certain ideas.</hi> The tunes ſo ſoft!—The motions ſo languiſhing! Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pauſes and dying eyes! half-falling back, and then recovering themſelves in ſo artful a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that I am very poſitive, the coldeſt and moſt rigid prude upon earth, could not have looked upon them without thinking of <hi>ſomething not to be ſpoke of.</hi>—I ſuppoſe you may have read that the Turks have no muſic, but what is ſhocking to the ears; but this account is from thoſe who never heard any but what is played in the ſtreets, and is juſt as reaſonable, as if a foreigner ſhould take his ideas of Engliſh muſic, from the <hi>bladder</hi> and <hi>ſtring,</hi> or the <hi>marrowbones</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eavers.</hi> I can aſſure you, that the muſic is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pathetic; 'tis true, I am inclined to prefer the Italian, but perhaps I am partial. I am acquainted with a Greek lady, who ſings better than Mrs. <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and is very well ſkilled in both, who gives the preference to the Turkiſh. 'Tis certain they have very fine natural voices, theſe were very agreeable. When the dance was over, four fair ſlaves came into the room, with ſilver cenſors in their hands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed the air with amber, aloes-wood, and others ſcents. After this, they ſerved me coffee upon their knees, in the fineſt japan china, with <hi>ſoucoups</hi> of ſilver gilt. The lovely <hi>Fatima</hi> entertained me, all this while, in the moſt polite agreeable manner, calling me often <hi>Uzelle Sultanam,</hi> or the Beautiful Sultana, and deſiring my friendſhip with the beſt grace in the world, lamenting that ſhe could not entertain me in my own language.</p>

When I took my leave, two maids brought in a fine ſilver baſket of embroidered handkerchiefs; ſhe beg'd I would wear the richeſt for her ſake, and gave the others to my woman and interpreteſs.—I retired, thro' the ſame ceremonies as before, and could not help thinking, I had been ſome time in Mahomet's paradiſe, ſo much I was charmed with what I had ſeen.

            <p>I AM going to leave Adrianople, and I would not do it, without giving you ſome account of all that is curious in it, which I have taken a great deal of pains to ſee. I will not trouble you with wiſe diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, whether or no this is the ſame city that was antiently called <hi>Oreſteſit</hi> or <hi>Oreſte,</hi> which you know better than I do. It is now called from the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> and was the firſt European ſeat of the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Empire, and has been the favourite reſidence of many Sultans. MAHOMET the fourth, and MUSTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHA, the Brother of the reigning Emperor, were ſo fond of it, that they wholly abandoned Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which humour ſo far exaſperated the Janizaries, that it was a conſiderable motive to the rebellions that

depoſed them. Yet this man ſeems to love to keep his court here. I can give you no reaſon for this partiality. 'Tis true, the ſituation is fine, and the country all round very beautiful; but the air is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely bad, and the Seraglio itſelf is not free from the ill effect of it. The town is ſaid to be eight miles in compaſs. I ſuppoſe they reckon in the gardens. There are ſome good houſes in it, I mean large ones; for the architecture of their palaces never makes any great ſhew. It is now very full of people; but they are, moſt of them, ſuch as follow the court, or camp, and when they are removed, I am told 'tis no popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous city. The river <hi>Maritza</hi> (anciently the <hi>Hebrus</hi>) on which it is ſituated, is dried up every ſummer, which contributes very much to make it unwholeſome. It is now a very pleaſant ſtream. There are two noble bridges built over it. I had the curioſity to go to ſee the Exchange in my Turkiſh dreſs, which is diſguiſe ſufficient. Yet I own, I was not very eaſy when I ſaw it crouded with Janizaries; but they dare not be rude to a woman, and made way for me with as much reſpect, as if I had been in my own figure. It is half a mile in length, the roof arched, and kept extremely neat. It holds three hundred and ſixty-five ſhops, furniſhed with all ſorts of rich goods, expoſed to ſale in the ſame manner as at the New Exchange in London. But the pavement is kept much neater, and the ſhops are all ſo clean, they ſeem juſt new painted.—Idle people of all ſorts walk here for their diverſion, or amuſe themſelves with drinking coffee, or ſherbet, which is cried about as oranges and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats are in our playhouſes. I obſerved moſt of the rich Tradeſmen were Jews. That people are in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible power in this country. They have many privileges above all the natural Turks themſelves, and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:041644_0124_101AD1A60DC7D118"/>
have formed a very conſiderable common-wealth here, being judged by their own laws. They have drawn the whole trade of the Empire into their hands, partly by the firm union amongſt themſelves, and partly by the idle temper and want of induſtry in the Turks. Every Baſſa has his Jew, who is his <hi>"homme d'affaires;"</hi> he is let into all his ſecrets, and does all his buſineſs. No bargain is made, no bribe received, no merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe diſpoſed of, but what paſſes through their hands. They are the phyſicians, the ſtewards, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of all the great men. You may judge how advantageous this is to a people who never fail to make uſe of the ſmalleſt advantages. They have found the ſecret of making themſelves ſo neceſſary, that they are certain of the protection of the court, whatever miniſtry is in power. Even the Engliſh, French, and Italian merchants, who are ſenſible of their artifices, are, however, forced to truſt their affairs to their negotiation, nothing of trade being managed without them, and the meaneſt amongſt them being too important to be diſobliged, ſince the whole body take care of his intereſts with as much vigour as they would thoſe of the moſt conſiderable of their members. There are many of them vaſtly rich, but they take care to make little public ſhew of it; though they live in their houſes in the utmoſt luxury and magnificence. This copious ſubject has drawn me from my deſcription of the exchange, founded by <hi>Ali Baſſa,</hi> whoſe name it bears. Near it is the <hi>Sherſki,</hi> a ſtreet of a mile in length, full of ſhops of all kind of fine merchandiſe, but exceſſive dear, nothing being made here. It is covered on the top with boards to keep out the rain, that merchants may meet conveniently in all weathers. The <hi>Beſiten</hi> near it, is another exchange, built upon pillars, where all
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:041644_0125_101AD1A793E96980"/>
ſorts of horſe furniture is ſold. Glittering every where with gold, rich embroidery and jewels; it makes a very agreeable ſhew. From this place I went in my Turkiſh coach, to the camp, which is to move in a few days to the frontiers. The Sultan is already gone to his tents, and all his court; the appearance of them is, indeed, very magnificent. Thoſe of the great men are rather like palaces than tents, taking up a great compaſs of ground, and being divided into a vaſt number of apartments. They are all of green, and the <hi>Baſſa's of three Tails,</hi> have thoſe enſigns of their power placed in a very conſpicuous manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their tents, which are adorned, on the top, with gilded balls, more or leſs, according to their different ranks. The ladies go in coaches to ſee the camp, as eagerly as ours did to that of <hi>Hyde-Park;</hi> but 'tis very eaſy to obſerve, that the ſoldiers do not begin the campaign with any great chearfulneſs. The war is a general grievance upon the people, but particularly hard upon the tradeſmen, now that the Grand Signior is reſolved to lead his army in perſon. Every compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them is obliged, upon this occaſion, to make a preſent according to their ability.</p>
            <p>I took the pains of riſing at ſix in the morning to ſee the ceremony, which did not however begin till eight. The Grand Signior was at the Seraglio window, to ſee the proceſſion, which paſſed thro' the principal ſtreets. It was preceded by an <hi>Effendi,</hi> mounted on a camel, richly furniſhed, reading aloud the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> finely bound, laid upon a cuſhion. He was ſurrounded by a parcel of boys, in white, ſinging ſome verſes of it, followed by a man dreſſed in green boughs, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clean husbandman ſowing ſeed. After him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reapers with garlands of ears of corn, as <hi>Ceres</hi> is pictured, with ſcythes in their hands ſeeming to mow.
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:041644_0126_101AD1AA6327B9B0"/>
Then a little machine drawn by oxen, in which was a wind-mill, and boys employed in grinding corn, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by another machine drawn by buffaloes carrying an oven, and two more boys, one employed in kneading the bread, and another in drawing it out of the oven. Theſe Boys threw little cakes on both ſides amongſt the crowd, and were followed by the whole company of bakers, marching on foot, two by two, in their beſt cloaths, with cakes, loaves, paſties, and pies of all ſorts on their heads, and after them two buffoons, or jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puddings, with their faces and clothes ſmeared with meal, who diverted the mob with their antic geſtures. In the ſame manner followed all the companies of trade in the Empire; the nobler ſort, ſuch as jewellers, mercers, &amp;c. finely mounted, and many of the pageants that repreſent their trades perfectly magnificent; amongſt which, that of the Furriers made one of the beſt figures, being a very large machine ſet round with the ſkins of ermins, foxes, &amp;c. ſo well ſtuffed, that the animals ſeemed to be alive, and followed by muſic and dancers. I believe they were, upon the whole, twenty thouſand men, all ready to follow his Highneſs if he commanded them. The rear was cloſed by the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who came to beg the honour of dying in his ſervice. This part of the ſhew ſeemed to me ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borous, that I removed from the window upon the firſt appearance of it. They were all naked to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Some had their arms pierced thorough with arrows left ſticking in them. Others had them ſticking in their heads, the blood trickling down their faces. Some ſlaſhed their arms with ſharp knives, making the blood ſpring out upon thoſe that ſtood there; and this is looked upon as an expreſſion of their zeal for glory. I am told, that ſome make uſe of it to advance their love;
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:041644_0127_101AD1ABE716CA48"/>
and when they are near the window, where their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſtands (all the women in town being veiled to ſee this ſpectacle) they ſtick another arrow for her ſake, who gives ſome ſign of approbation and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to this gallantry. The whole ſhew laſted for near eight hours, to my great ſorrow, who was heartily tired, though I was in the houſe of the widow of the <hi>Captain Baſſa</hi> (Admiral) who refreſhed me with coffee, ſweetmeats, ſherbet, &amp;c. with all poſſible civility.</p>
            <p>I went two days after, to ſee the Moſque of Sultan <hi>Selim</hi> I. which is a building very well worth the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of a traveller. I was dreſſed in my Turkiſh ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and admitted without ſcruple; though I believe they gueſſed who I was, by the extreme officiouſneſs of the door-keeper, to ſhew me every part of it. It is ſituated very advantageouſly in the midſt of the city, and in the higheſt part of it, making a very noble ſhow. The firſt court has four gates, and the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt three. They are both of them ſurrounded with cloiſters, with marble pillars of the Ionic order, finely poliſhed, and of very lively colours; the whole pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of white marble, and the roof of the cloiſters divided into ſeveral cupola's or domes, headed with gilt balls on the top. In the midſt of each court are fine fountains of white marble; and before the great gate of the Moſque a portico with green marble pillars, which has five gates, the body of the Moſque being one prodigious dome. I underſtand ſo little of architecture, I dare not pretend to ſpeak of the proportions. It ſeemed to be very regular; this I am ſure of, it is vaſtly high and I thought it the nobleſt building I ever ſaw. It has two rows of marble galleries on pillars, with marble ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtres; the pavement is alſo marble covered with Perſian carpets. In my opinion, it is a great addition to its beauty, that it is not divided into pews, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with forms and benches like our churches;
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:041644_0128_101AD1AFA9B60250"/>
nor the pillars (which are moſt of them red and white marble) disfigured by the little tawdry images, and pictures, that give Roman Catholic churches the air of toy-ſhops. The walls ſeemed to me inlaid, with ſuch very lively colours, in ſmall flowers, that I could not imagine what ſtones had been made uſe of. But going nearer, I ſaw they were cruſted with japan china, which has a very beautiful effect. In the midſt hung a vaſt lamp of ſilver gilt; beſides which, I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there were at leaſt two thouſand of a leſſer ſize. This muſt look very glorious when they are all light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but being at night, no women are ſuffered to enter. Under the large lamp is a great pulpit of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wood gilt, and juſt by, a fountain to waſh, which you know is an eſſential part of their devotion. In one corner is a little gallery encloſed with gilded lattices, for the Grand Signior. At the upper end a large <hi>Niche,</hi> very like an altar, raiſed two ſteps, covered with gold brocade, and ſtanding before it two ſilver gilt candleſticks, the height of a man, and in them white wax candles, as thick as a man's waiſt. The outſide of the Moſque is adorned with towers vaſtly high, gilt on the top, from whence the <hi>Imaums</hi> call the people to prayers. I had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to go up one of them, which is contrived ſo art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as to give ſurprize to all that ſee it. There is but one door, which leads to three different ſtair-caſes, going to the three different ſtories of the tower, in ſuch a manner, that three prieſts may aſcend, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without ever meeting each other; a contrivance very much admired. Behind the Moſque, is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change full of ſhops, where poor artificers are lodged gratis. I ſaw ſeveral Derviſes at their prayers here. They are dreſſed in a plain piece of woollen, with their arms bare, and a woollen cap on their heads, like a high crowned hat without brims. I went to
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:041644_0129_101AD3296FC62DC8"/>
ſee ſome other Moſques, built much after the ſame manner, but not comparable, in point of magnificence, to this I have deſcribed, which is infinitely beyond any church in Germany or England; I won't talk of other countries, I have not ſeen. The Seraglio does not ſeem a very magnificent palace. But the gardens are very large, plentifully ſupplied with water, and full of trees; which is all I know of them, having never been in them.</p>
            <p>I tell you nothing of the order of Mr. W—'s entry, and his audieuce. Theſe things are always the ſame, and have been ſo often deſcribed, I won't trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with the repetition. The young Prince, about eleven years old, ſits near his father, when he gives audience; he is a handſome boy, but, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, will not immediately ſucceed the Sultan, there being two ſons of Sultan, MUSTAPHA (his eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) remaining; the eldeſt about twenty years old, on whom the hopes of the people are fixed. This reign has been bloody and avaritious. I am apt to believe they are very impatient to ſee the end of it. I am, Sir,</p>

            <p>I HAVE had the advantage of very fine weather all my journey, and as the ſummer is now in its beauty, I enjoyed the pleaſure of fine proſpects; and the meadows being full of all ſorts of garden flowers, and ſweet herbs my berlin perfumed the air as it preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them. The Grand Signior furniſhed us with thirty covered waggons for our baggage, and five coaches of the country for my women. We found the road full of the great <hi>Spahis</hi> and their equipages coming out of Aſia to the war. They always travel with tents; but I choſe to lie in houſes all the way. I will not trouble you with the names of the villages we paſſed, in which there was nothing remarkable, but at <hi>Ciorl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i,</hi> where there was a <hi>Conac,</hi> or little <hi>Seraglio,</hi> built for the uſe of the Grand Signior, when he goes this road. I had the curioſity to view all the apartments deſtined for the ladies of his court. They were in the midſt of a thick grove of trees, made freſh by fountains; but I was moſt ſurpriſed to ſee the walls almoſt covered with little diſtichs of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh verſe, writ with pencils. I made my interpreter explain them to me, and I found ſeveral of them very well turned; tho' I eaſily believed him, that they had loſt much of their beauty in the tranſlation. One was literally thus in Engliſh.

The reſt of our journey was through fine painted meadows, by the ſide of the ſea of <hi>Marmora,</hi> the antient Propontis. We lay the next night at <hi>Seliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> antiently a noble town. It is now a good ſea port, and neatly built enough, and has a bridge of thirty-two arches. Here is a famous antient Greek church. I had given one of my coaches to a Greek lady, who deſired the conveniency of travelling with me; ſhe deſigned to pay her devotions, and I was glad of the opportunity of going with her. I found it an ill built edifice, ſet out with the ſame ſort of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but leſs rich, as the Roman Catholic churches. They ſhewed me a ſaint's body, where I threw a piece of money; and a picture of the Virgin Mary, drawn by the hand of St. LUKE, very little to the credit of his painting; but, however, the fineſt Madona of Italy, is not more famous for her miracles. The Greeks have a monſtrous taſte in their pictures, which, for more fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are always drawn upon a gold ground. You may imagine what a good air this has; but they have no notion either of ſhade or proportion. They have a biſhop here, who officiated in his purple robe, and ſent me a candle almoſt as big as myſelf for a preſent, when I was at my lodging. We lay that night at a town called <hi>Bujuk Cekmege,</hi> or Great Bridge; and the night following, at <hi>Kujuk Cekmege,</hi> or Little Bridge, in a very pleaſant lodging, formerly a monaſtery of Derviſes, having before it a large court, encompaſſed with marble cloiſters, with a good fountain in the middle. The proſpect from this place, and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens round it, is the moſt agreeable I have ſeen; and ſhews, that monks of all religions know how to chooſe their retirements. 'Tis now belonging to a <hi>Hogia,</hi> or School-maſter, who teaches boys here. I aſked him to ſhew me his own apartment, and was ſurpriſed
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:041644_0132_101AD27849547168"/>
to ſee him point to a tall cypreſs tree in the garden, on the top of which was a place for a bed for himſelf, and a little lower one for his wife and two children, who ſlept there every night. I was ſo much diverted with the fancy. I reſolved to examine his neſt nearer; but after going up fifty ſteps, I found I had ſtill fifty to go up, and then I muſt climb from branch to branch, with ſome hazard of my neck. I thought it therefore the beſt way to come down again.</p>
            <p>We arrived the next day at Conſtantinople; but I can yet tell you very little of it, all my time having been taken up with receiving viſits, which are, at leaſt, a very good entertainment to the eyes, the young women being all beauties, and their beauty highly improved by the high taſte of their dreſs.</p>
            <p>Our palace is in <hi>Pera,</hi> which is no more a ſuburb of Conſtantinople, than Weſtminſter is a ſuburb to London. All the Ambaſſadors are lodged very near each other. One part of our houſe ſhews us the Port, the City, and the Seraglio, and the diſtant hills of Asia, perhaps, all together, the moſt beautiful proſpect in the world.</p>
            <p>A certain French author ſays, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is twice as big as <hi>Paris.</hi> Mr. W—y is unwilling to own 'tis bigger than London, though I confeſs it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be ſo; but I don't believe 'tis ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous. The burying fields about it are certainly much larger than the whole city. 'Tis ſurpriſing what a vaſt deal of land is loſt this way in Turkey. Sometimes I have ſeen burying places of ſeveral miles, belonging to very inconſiderable villages, which were formerly great towns, and retain no other mark of their antient grandeur, than this diſmal one. On no occaſion do they ever remove a ſtone that ſerves for a monument. Some of them are coſtly enough,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:041644_0133_101AD27BA8BB5670"/>
for a monument. Some of them are coſtly enough, being of very fine marble. They ſet up a pillar with a carved turbant on the top of it, to the memory of a man; and as the turbants, by their different ſhapes, ſhew the quality or profeſſion, 'tis in a manner put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the arms of the deceaſed. Beſides, the pillar commonly bears an inſcription in gold letters. The ladies have a ſimple pillar, without other ornament, except thoſe that die unmarried, who have a roſe on the top of their monument. The ſepulchres of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular families are railed in, and planted round with trees. Thoſe of the Sultans, and ſome great men, have lamps conſtantly burning in them.</p>
            <p>When I ſpoke of their religion, I forgot to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two particularities, one of which I had read of, but it ſeemed ſo odd to me, I could not believe it; yet 'tis certainly true; that when a man has divorced his wife, in the moſt ſolemn manner, he can take her again upon no other terms, than permitting another man to paſs a night with her; and there are ſome examples of thoſe who have ſubmitted to this law, rather than not have back their beloved. The other point of doctrine is very extraordinary. Any woman that dies unmarried, is looked upon to die in a ſtate of reprobation. To confirm this belief, they reaſon, that the end of the creation of woman, is to increaſe and multiply, and that ſhe is only properly employed in the works of her calling, when ſhe is bringing forth children, or taking care of them, which are all the virtues that God expects from her. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, their way of life, which ſhuts them out of all public commerce, does not permit them any other. Our vulgar notion, that they don't own women to have any ſouls, is a miſtake. 'Tis true they ſay, they are not of ſo elevated a kind, and therefore muſt
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:041644_0134_101AD27DEF70D620"/>
not hope to be admitted into the Paradiſe appointed for the men, who are to be entertained by celeſtial beauties. But there is a place of happineſs deſtined for ſouls of the inferior order, where all good women are to be in eternal bliſs. Many of them are very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and will not remain widows ten days, for fear of dying in the reprobate ſtate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a uſeleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But thoſe, that like their liberty, and are not ſlaves to their religion, content themſelves with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying when they are afraid of dying. This is a piece of theology, very different from that, which teaches nothing to be more acceptable to God, than a vow of perpetual virginity; which divinity is moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, I leave you to determine.</p>
            <p>I have already made ſome progreſs in a collection of Greek medals. Here are ſeveral profeſſed anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries, who are ready to ſerve any body that deſires them. But you cannot imagine how they ſtare in my face, when I enquire about them, as if no body was permitted to ſeek after medals, till they were grown a piece of antiquity themſelves. I have got ſome very valuable ones of the Macedonian Kings, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly one of PERSEUS, ſo lively, I fancy I can ſee all his ill qualities in his face. I have a Porphyry head finely cut, of the true Greek ſculpture; but who is repreſents, is to be gueſſed at by the learned when I return. For you are not to ſuppoſe theſe antiquaries (who are all Greeks) know any thing. Their trade is only to ſell; they have correſpondents at Aleppo, Grand Cairo, in Arabia and Paleſtine, who ſend them all they can find, and very often great heaps, that are only fit to melt into pans and kettles. They get the beſt price they can for any of them, without knowing thoſe that are valuable, from thoſe that are not. Thoſe that pretend to ſkill, generally find
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:041644_0135_101AD27F74166D48"/>
Greek cities. One of them, ſhewing me the figure of a Pallas, with a victory in her hand on a reverſe, aſſured me it was the Virgin holding a crucifix. The ſame man offered me the head of a Socrates, on a Sardonix; and to enhance the value, gave him the title of Saint Auguſtine. I have beſpoke a mummy, which, I hope, will come ſafe to my hands, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the misfortune that befel a very fine one, deſigned for the King of Sweden. He gave a great price for it, and the Turks took it into their heads, that he muſt have ſome conſiderable project depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it. They fancied it the body of God knows who, and that the ſtate of their Empire myſtically depended on the conſervation of it. Some old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were remembered upon this occaſion, and the mummy committed priſoner to the Seven Towers, where it has remained under cloſe confinement ever ſince. I dare not try my intereſt in ſo conſiderable a point, as the releaſe of it; but I hope mine will paſs without examination. I can tell you nothing more at preſent of this famous city. When I have looked a little about me, you ſhall hear from me again. I am, Sir,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I HOPE before this time, you have received two or three of my letters. I had yours but yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, though dated the third of February, in which you ſuppoſe me to be dead and buried. I have already let you know that I am ſtill alive; but to ſay truth, I look upon my preſent circumſtances to be exactly the ſame with thoſe of departed ſpirits. The heats of Conſtantinople have driven me to this place, which perfectly anſwers the deſcription of the Elyſian fields. I am in the middle of a wood, conſiſting chiefly of fruit trees, watered by a vaſt number of fountains, famous for the excellency of their water, and divided into many ſhady walks, upon ſhort graſs, that ſeems to me artificial; but, I am aſſured, is the pure work of nature—within view of the Black-ſea, from whence we perpetually enjoy the refreſhment of cool breezes, that makes us inſenſible of the heat of the ſummer. The village is only inhabited by the richeſt amongſt the Chriſtians, who meet every night at a fountain, forty paces from my houſe, to ſing and dance. The beauty and dreſs of the women, exactly reſemble the ideas of the antient nymphs, as they are given us by the repreſentations of the poets and painters. But what perſuades me more fully of my deceaſe, is the ſituation of my own mind, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ignorance I am in, of what paſſes among the living (which only comes to me by chance) and the

great calmneſs with which I receive it. Yet I have ſtill a hankering after my friends and acquaintances left in the world, according to the authority of that admirable author,

And 'tis very neceſſary to make a perfect Elyſium, that there ſhould be a river <hi>Lethe,</hi> which I am not ſo happy as to find. To ſay truth, I am ſometimes very weary of the ſinging and dancing, and ſunſhine, and wiſh for the ſmoke and impertinencies in which you toil; though I endeavour to perſuade myſelf that I live in a more agreeable variety than you do; and that <hi>Monday,</hi> ſetting of partridges; <hi>Tueſday,</hi> reading Engliſh; <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> ſtudying in the Turkiſh language, (in which, by the way, I am already very learned;) <hi>Thurſday,</hi> claſſical authors; <hi>Friday,</hi> ſpent in writing; <hi>Saturday,</hi> at my needle, and <hi>Sunday,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of viſits and hearing of muſic, is a better way of diſpoſing of the week, than, <hi>Monday</hi> at the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room; <hi>Tueſday,</hi> Lady Mohun's; <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> at the opera; <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the play; <hi>Friday,</hi> Mrs. Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynd's, &amp;c. a perpetual round of hearing the ſame ſcandal, and ſeeing the ſame follies acted over and over, which here affect me no more than they do other dead people.

I can neither be ſenſibly touched with joy or grief, when I conſider that, poſſibly, the cauſe of either is removed, before the letter comes to my hands.

            <p>I HEARTILY beg your ladyſhip's pardon; but I really could nor forbear laughing heartily at your letter, and the commiſſions you are pleaſed to honour me with. You deſire me to buy you a Greek ſlave, who is to be miſtreſs of a thouſand good qualities. The Greeks are <hi>ſubjects</hi> and not <hi>ſlaves.</hi> Thoſe who are to be bought in that manner, are either ſuch as are taken in war, or ſtolen by the Tartars, from Ruſſia, Circaſſia or Georgia, and are ſuch miſerable awkward poor wretches, you would not think any of them fit to be your houſe maids. 'Tis true, that many thouſands were taken in the <hi>Morea;</hi> but they have been moſt of them redeemed by the charitable contributions of the Chriſtians, or ranſomed by their own relations at Venice. The fine
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:041644_0139_101AD289FA8D5970"/>
ſlaves that wait upon the great ladies, or ſerve the pleaſures of the great men, are all bought at the age of eight or nine years old, and educated with great care to accompliſh them in ſinging, dancing, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, &amp;c, they are commonly <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> and their patron never ſells them, except it is, as a puniſhment for ſome very great fault. If ever they grow weary of them, they either preſent them to a friend, or give them their freedom. Thoſe that are expoſed to ſale at the markets, are always either guilty of ſome crime, or ſo entirely worthleſs, that they are of no uſe at all. I am afraid that you will doubt the truth of this account, which, I own, is very different from our common notions in England; but it is no leſs truth for all that.—Your whole letter is full of miſtakes from one end to the other. I ſee you have taken your ideas of Turkey from that worthy author <hi>Dumont,</hi> who has writ with equal ignorance and confidence. 'Tis a particular pleaſure to me here, to read the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to the Levant, which are generally ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from truth, and ſo full of abſurdities, I am very well diverted with them. They never fail giving you an account of the women, whom, 'tis certain, they never ſaw; and talking very wiſely of the genius of the men, into whoſe company they are never admittted; and very often deſcribe <hi>Moſques,</hi> which they dared not even peep into. The Turks are very proud, and will not converſe with a ſtranger they are not aſſured is conſiderable in his own country. I ſpeak of the men of diſtinction; for, as to the ordinary fellows, you may imagine what ideas their converſation can give of the general genius of the people.</p>
            <p>As to the balm of <hi>Mecca,</hi> I will certainly ſend you ſome; but it is not ſo eaſily got as you ſuppoſe it, and I cannot in conſcience adviſe you to make uſe of it. I
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:041644_0140_101AD28D9B766D10"/>
know not how it comes to have ſuch univerſal applauſe. All the Ladies of my acquaintance at London and Vienna, have begged me to ſend pots of it to them. I have had a preſent of a ſmall quantity (which I'll aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you is very valuable) of the beſt ſort, and with great joy applied it to my face, expecting ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effect to my advantage. The next morning the change, indeed, was wonderful; my face was ſwelled to a very extraordinary ſize, and all over as red as my Lady H—'s. It remained in this lamentable ſtate three days, during which you may be ſure I paſſed my time very ill. I believed it would never be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and to add to my mortification, Mr. W—y reproached my indiſcretion without ceaſing. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my face is ſince in <hi>ſtatu quo;</hi> nay, I am told by the ladies here, that 'tis much mended by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I confeſs I cannot perceive in my looking glaſs. Indeed, if one was to form an opinion of this balm from their faces, one ſhould think very well of it. They all make uſe of it, and have the lovelieſt bloom in the world. For my part, I never intend to endure the pain of it again; let my complexion take its natural courſe, and decay in its own due time. I have very little eſteem for medicines of this nature; but do as you pleaſe, Madam; only remember, before you uſe it, that your face will not be ſuch as you will care to ſhew in the drawing room for ſome days after. If one was to believe the women in this country, there is a ſurer way of making one's ſelf beloved, than by becoming handſome, though you know that's our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. But they pretend to the knowledge of ſecrets, that, by way of enchantment, give them the entire empire over whom they pleaſe. For me, who am not very apt to believe in wonders, I cannot find faith for this. I diſputed the point laſt night with a lady, this
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:041644_0141_101AD28FD81106A8"/>
who really talks very ſenſibly on any other ſubject: but ſhe was downright angry with me, in that ſhe did not perceive ſhe had perſuaded me of the truth of forty ſtories ſhe told me of this kind; and, at laſt, mentioned ſeveral ridiculous marriages, that there could be no other reaſon aſſigned for. I aſſured her, that in England, where we were entirely ignorant of all magick, where the climate is not half ſo warm, nor the women half ſo handſome, we were not without our ridiculous marriages; and that we did not look upon it, as any thing ſupernatural, when a man played the fool for the ſake of a woman. But my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could not convince her againſt (as ſhe ſaid) her certain knowledge. To this ſhe added, that ſhe ſcrupled making uſe of <hi>charms</hi> herſelf; but that ſhe could do it whenever ſhe pleaſed; and ſtaring me in my face, ſaid, (with a very learned air) that no enchantments would have their effects upon me, and that there were ſome people exempt from their power, but very few. You may imagine how I laughed at this diſcourſe: but all the women are of the ſame opinion. They don't pretend to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the devil, but only that there are certain compoſitions adapted to inſpire love. If one could ſend over a ſhip-load of them, I fancy it would be a very quick way of raiſing an eſtate. What would not ſome ladies of our acquaintance give for ſuch merchandize? Adieu, my dear lady—I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my letter with a ſubject that affords more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſcenes to the imagination. I leave you to figure to yourſelf, the extreme court that will be made to me, at my return, if my travels ſhould furniſh me ſuch a uſeful piece of learning. I am, dear Madam,</p>

            <p>I AM infinitely obliged to you, dear Mrs. T—for your entertaining letter. You are the only one of my correſpondents that have judged right enough, to think I would gladly be informed of the news amongſt you. All the reſt of them tell me (almoſt in the ſame words) that they ſuppoſe I know every thing. Why they are pleaſed to ſuppoſe in this manner, I can gueſs no reaſon, except they are perſuaded that the breed of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s pigeon ſtill ſubſiſts in this country, and that I receive ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural intelligence. I wiſh I could return your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with ſome diverting accounts from hence. But I know not what part of the ſcenes here would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify your curioſity, or whether you have any curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity at all, for things ſo far diſtant. To ſay the truth, I am, at this preſent writing, not very much turned for the recollection of what is diverting, my head being wholly filled with the preparations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the increaſe of my family, which I expect every day. You may eaſily gueſs at my uneaſy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But I am, however, comforted in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by the glory that accrues to me from it, and a reflection on the contempt I ſhould otherwiſe fall under. You won't know what to make of this ſpeech: but, in this country, 'tis more deſpicable to be married and not fruitful, than 'tis with us to be fruitful before marriage. They have a notion, that whenever a woman leaves off bringing forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:041644_0143_101AD29397C334C8"/>
'tis becauſe ſhe is too old for that buſineſs, whatever her face ſays to the contrary. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion makes the ladies here ſo ready to make proofs of their youth, (which is as neceſſary in order to be a <hi>received beauty,</hi> as it is to ſhew the proofs of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be admitted <hi>Knights of Malta</hi>) that they do not content themſelves with uſing the natural means, but fly to all ſorts of quackeries to avoid the ſcandal of being paſt child-bearing, and often kill themſelves by them. Without any exaggeration, all the women of my acquaintance have twelve or thirteen children; and the old ones boaſt of having had five and twenty or thirty a-piece, and are reſpected according to the number they have produced.—When they are with child, 'tis their common expreſſion to ſay, <hi>They hope God will be ſo merciful as to ſend them two this time;</hi> and when I have aſked them ſometimes, how they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to provide for ſuch a flock as they deſire? They anſwer, that the plague will certainly kill half of them; which, indeed, generally happens without much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to the parents, who are ſatisfied with the vanity of having brought forth ſo plentifully. The French Ambaſſadreſs is forced to comply with this faſhion as well as myſelf. She has not been here much above a year, and has lain in once, and is big again. What is moſt wonderful, is, the exemption they ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy from the curſe entailed on the ſex. They ſee all company the day of their delivery, and at the fortnight's end, return viſits, ſet out in their jewels and new clothes. I wiſh I may find the influence of the climate in this particular. But I fear I ſhall continue an Engliſh woman in that affair, as well as I do in my dread of fire and plague, which are two things very little feared here. Moſt families have had their houſes burnt down once or twice, occaſioned by their
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:041644_0144_101AD29673147E08"/>
extraordinary way of warming themſelves, which is neither by chimnies nor ſtoves, but by a certain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine called a <hi>Tendour,</hi> the height of two foot, in the form of a table, covered with a fine carpet or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery. This is made only of wood, and they put into it a ſmall quantity of hot aſhes, and ſit with their legs under the carpet. At this table they work, read, and, very often, ſleep; and if they chance to dream, kick down the <hi>Tendour,</hi> and the hot aſhes commonly ſet the houſe on fire. There were five hundred houſes burnt in this manner about a fortnight ago, and I have ſeen ſeveral of the owners ſince, who ſeem not at all moved at ſo common a misfortune. They put their goods into a <hi>Bark,</hi> and ſee their houſes burn with great philoſophy, their perſons being very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom endangered, having no ſtairs to deſcend.</p>
            <p>But having entertained you with things I don't like, 'tis but juſt I ſhould tell you ſomething what pleaſes me. The climate is delightful in the extremeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. I am now ſitting, this preſent fourth of January, with the windows open, enjoying the warm ſhine of the Sun, while you are freezing over a ſad ſea-coal fire; and my chamber is ſet out with carnations, roſes, and jonquils, freſh from my garden. I am alſo charmed with many points of the Turkiſh law, to our ſhame be it ſpoken, better deſigned, and better executed than ours; particularly, the puniſhment of convicted liars (triumphant criminals in our country God knows:) They are burnt in the forehead with a hot iron, when they are proved the authors of any notorious falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. How many white foreheads ſhould we ſee disfigured? How many fine gentlemen would be forced to wear their wigs as low as their eye-brows, were this law in practice with us? I ſhould go on to tell you many other parts of juſtice, but I muſt ſend for my midwife.</p>

            <p>I HAVE not written to you, dear ſiſter, theſe many months—a great piece of ſelf-denial. But But I know not where to direct, or what part of the world you are in. I have received no letter from you ſince that ſhort note of April laſt, in which you tell me, that you are on the point of leaving England, and promiſe me a direction for the place you ſtay in; but I have, in vain, expected it till now, and now I only learn from the Gazette, that you are returned, which induces me to venture this letter to your houſe at London. I had rather ten of my letters ſhould be loſt, than you imagine I don't write; and I think it is hard fortune, if one in ten don't reach you. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am reſolved to keep the copies, as teſtimonies of my inclination to give you, to the utmoſt of my power, all the diverting part of my travels, while you are exempt from all the fatigues and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, I wiſh you joy of your niece; for I was brought to bed of a daughter<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent Counteſs of Bute.</note> five weeks ago. I don't mention this as one of my divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adventures; though I muſt own, that it is not half ſo mortifying here as in England; there being as much difference, as there is between a little cold in the head, which ſometimes happens here, and the conſumption coughs ſo common in London. No

body keeps their houſe a month for lying in; and I am not ſo fond of any of our cuſtoms, as to retain them when they are not neceſſary. I returned my viſits at three weeks end, and about four days ago croſſed the ſea, which divides this place from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, to make a new one, where I had the good fortune to pick up many curioſities. I went to ſee the Sultana <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iten,</hi> favourite of the late Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Muſtapha, who, you know, (or perhaps you don't know) was depoſed by his brother, the reigning Sultan, and died a few weeks after, being poiſoned, as it was generally believed. This lady was, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his death, ſaluted with an abſolute order to leave the Seraglio, and chooſe herſelf a husband among the great men at the Porte. I ſuppoſe you may imagine her overjoyed, at this propoſal—Quite the contrary.—Theſe women, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eſteem themſelves Queens, look upon this liberty, as the greateſt diſgrace and affront that can happen to them. She threw herſelf at the Sultan's feet, and begged him to poignard her, rather than uſe her brother's widow with that contempt. She repreſented to him, in agonies of ſorrow, that ſhe was privileged from this misfortune, by having brought five princes into the Ottoman family; but all the boys being dead, and only one girl ſurviving, this excuſe was not received, and ſhe was compelled to make her choice. She choſe <hi>Bekir Effendi,</hi> then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of ſtate, and above four-ſcore years old, to convince the world that ſhe firmly intended to keep the vow ſhe had made, of never ſuffering a ſecond husband to approach her bed; and ſince ſhe muſt honour ſome ſubject ſo far, as to be called his wife, ſhe would chooſe him, as a mark of her gratitude, ſince it was he that had preſented her at the age of ten
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:041644_0147_101AD29C877706A8"/>
years to her laſt lord. But ſhe never permitted him to pay her one viſit; though it is now fifteen years ſhe has been in his houſe, where ſhe paſſes her time in uninterrupted mourning, with a conſtancy very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle known in Chriſtendom, eſpecially in a widow of one and twenty, for ſhe is now but thirty-ſix. She has no black Eunuchs for her guard, her husband being obliged to reſpect her as a Queen, and not to inquire, at all, into what is done in her apartment.</p>
            <p>I was led into a large room, with a Sofa the whole length of it, adorned with white marble pillars like a <hi>Ruelle,</hi> covered with pale blew figured velvet, on a ſilver ground, with cuſhions of the ſame, where I was deſired to repoſe till the Sultana appeared, who had contrived this manner of reception to avoid riſing up at my entrance, though ſhe made me an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her head, when I roſe up to her. I was very glad to obſerve a lady that had been diſtinguiſhed by the favour of an Emperor, to whom beauties were every day, preſented from all parts of the world. But ſhe did not ſeem to me to have ever been half ſo beautiful as the fair <hi>Fatima</hi> I ſaw at Adrianople; though ſhe had the remains of a fine face, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by ſorrow than time. But her dreſs was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſurpriſingly rich, that I cannot forbear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it to you. She wore a veſt called <hi>Dualma,</hi> which differs from a Caftan by longer ſleeves, and folding over at the bottom. It was of purple cloth, ſtrait to her ſhape, and thick ſet, on each ſide down to her feet and round the ſleeves, with pearls of the beſt water, of the ſame ſize as their buttons commonly are. You muſt not ſuppoſe that I mean as large as thoſe of my Lord—, but about the bigneſs of a pea; and to theſe buttons, large loops of diamonds, in the form of thoſe gold loops, ſo common on birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:041644_0148_101AD2A1CEFD95E0"/>
day coats. This habit was tied, at the waiſt, with two large taſſels of ſmaller pearls, and round the arms embroidered with large diamonds. Her ſhift was faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at the bottom, with a great diamond, ſhaped like a lozenge; her girdle, as broad as the broadeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ribband, entirely covered with diamonds. Round her neck ſhe wore three chains, which reached to her knees; one of large pearl, at the bottom of which hung a fine coloured emerald as big as a turkey-egg; another, conſiſting of two hundred emeralds, cloſe joined together, of the moſt lively green, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matched, every one as large as a half-crown piece, and as thick as three crown pieces, and another of ſmall emeralds perfectly round. But her ear-rings eclipſed all the reſt. They were two diamonds ſhaped exactly like pears, as large as a big hazle-nut. Round her <hi>Talpoche</hi> ſhe had four ſtrings of pearl—the whiteſt and moſt perfect in the world, at leaſt enough to make four necklaces, every one as large as the Ducheſs of Marlborough's, and of the ſame ſhape, faſtened with two roſes, conſiſting of a large ruby for the middle ſtone, and round them twenty drops of clean diamonds to each. Beſides this, her head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs was covered with bodkins of emeralds and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. She wore large diamond bracelets, and had five rings on her fingers (except Mr. Pitt's) the largeſt I ever ſaw in my life. 'Tis for jewellers to compute the value of theſe things; but, according to the common eſtimation of jewels in our part of the world, her whole dreſs muſt be worth a hundred thouſand pounds ſterling. This I am ſure of, that no European Queen has half the quantity, and the Empreſs's jewels, though very fine, would look very mean near hers. She gave me a dinner of fifty diſhes of meat, which (after their faſhion) were placed
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:041644_0149_101AD2A3527BD790"/>

               </gap>dious. But the magnificence of her table anſwered very well to that of her dreſs. The knives were of gold, and the hafts ſet with diamonds. But the piece of luxury which grieved my eyes, was the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-cloth and napkins, which were all tiffany embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with ſilk and gold, in the fineſt manner, in natural flowers. It was with the utmoſt regret that I made uſe of theſe coſtly napkins, which were as finely wrought as the fineſt handkerchiefs that ever came out of this country. You may be ſure, that they were entirely ſpoiled before dinner was over. The <hi>ſherbet</hi> (which is the liquor they drink at meals) was ſerved in china bowls; but the covers and ſalvers maſſy gold. After dinner, water was brought in gold baſons, and towels of the ſame kind with the napkins, which I very unwillingly wiped my hands upon, and coffee was ſerved in china with gold <hi>Soucoups</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Sultana ſeemed in a very good humour, and talked to me with the utmoſt civility.

                  </gap>ir Aga,</hi> to ſignify to the lady the honour he intends her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She is immediately complimented upon it by the others, and led to the bath, where ſhe is perfumed and dreſſed in the moſt magnificent and becoming manner. The Emperor precedes his viſit by a royal preſent, and then comes into her apartment: neither is there any ſuch thing
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:041644_0150_101AD2A584C17BC8"/>
as her creeping in at the bed's foot. She ſaid, that the firſt he made choice of, was always after the firſt in rank, and not the mother of the eldeſt ſon, as other writers would make us believe. Sometimes the Sultan diverts himſelf in the company of all his ladies who ſtand in a circle round him. And ſhe confeſſed, they were ready to die with envy and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the <hi>happy ſhe,</hi> that he diſtinguſhed by any appearance of preference. But this ſeemed to me neither better nor worſe than the circles in moſt courts, where the glance of the monarch is watched, and every ſmile is waited for with impatience, and envied by thoſe who cannot obtain it.</p>
            <p>She never mentioned the Sultan without tears in her eyes, yet ſhe ſeemed very fond of the diſcourſe. <q>My paſt happineſs, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> appears a dream to me. Yet I cannot forget that I was beloved by the greateſt and moſt lovely of mankind. I was choſen from all the reſt, to make all his campaigns with him; and I would not ſurvive him, if I was not paſſionately fond of the Princeſs my daughter. Yet all my tenderneſs for her was hardly enough to make me preſerve my life. When I left him, I paſſed a whole twelve-month without ſeeing the light. Time has ſoftened my deſpair; yet I now paſs ſome days every week in tears, devoted to the memory of my Sultan.</q> There was no affectation in theſe words. It was eaſy to ſee ſhe was in a deep melancholy, though her good humour made her will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divert me.</p>
            <p>She aſked me to walk in her garden, and one of her ſlaves immediately brought her a <hi>Pellice</hi> of rich brocade lined with ſables. I waited on her into the garden, which had nothing in it remarkable but the fountains; and from thence, ſhe ſhewed me all her
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:041644_0151_101AD2A8793B69B8"/>
apartments. In her bed-chamber, her toilet was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, conſiſting of two looking glaſſes, the frames covered with pearls, and her night <hi>Talpoche</hi> ſet with bodkins of jewels, and near it three veſts of fine fables, every one of which is at leaſt worth a thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (two hundred pounds Engliſh money.) I don't doubt but theſe rich habits were purpoſely placed in ſight, though they ſeemed negligently thrown on the Sofa. When I took my leave of her, I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented with perfumes as at the Grand Vizier's, and preſented with a very fine embroidered handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Her ſlaves were to the number of thirty, beſides ten little ones, the eldeſt not above ſeven years old. Theſe were the moſt beautiful girls I ever ſaw, all richly dreſſed; and I obſerved that the Sultana took a great deal of pleaſure in theſe lovely children, which is a vaſt expence; for there is not a handſome girl of that age, to be bought under a hundred pounds ſterling. They wore little garlands of flowers, and their own hair, braided, which was all their head-dreſs; but their habits were all of gold ſtuffs. Theſe ſerved her coffee kneeling; brought water when ſhe waſhed, &amp;c.—'Tis a great part of the buſineſs of the older ſlaves to take care of theſe young girls, to learn them to embroider, and to ſerve them as carefully as if they were children of the family. Now do you imagine I have entertained you, all this while, with a relation that has, at leaſt, received many embelliſhments from my hand? This, you will ſay, is but too like the Arabian Tales—Theſe embroidered napkins! and a jewel as large as a turkey's egg?—You forget, dear ſiſter, thoſe very tales were written by an author of this country, and (excepting the enchantments) are a real repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the manners here. We travellers are in
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:041644_0152_101AD2AA0456C760"/>
very hard circumſtances. If we ſay nothing but what has been ſaid before us, <hi>we are dull, and we have obſerved nothing.</hi> If we tell any thing new, we are laughed at as <hi>fabulous and romantic,</hi> not allowing either for the difference of ranks, which afford diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of company, or more curioſity, or the change of cuſtoms that happen every twenty years in every country. But the truth is, people judge of travellers, exactly with the ſame candour, good nature, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, they judge of their neighbours upon all occaſions. For my part, if I live to return amongſt you, I am ſo well acquainted with the morals of all my dear friends and acquaintances, that I am reſolved to tell them nothing at all, to avoid the imputation (which their charity would certainly incline them to) of my telling too much. But I depend upon your knowing me enough, to believe whatever I ſeriouſly aſſert for truth; though I give you leave to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at an account ſo new to you. But what would you ſay, if I told you, that I have been in a <hi>Haram,</hi> where the winter apartment was wainſcotted with inlaid work of mother of pearl, ivory of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and olive wood, exactly like the little boxes, you have ſeen brought out of this country; and in whoſe rooms deſigned for ſummer, the walls are all cruſted with Japan china, the roofs gilt, and the floors ſpread with the fineſt Perſian carpets? Yet there is nothing more true; ſuch is the palace of my lovely friend, the fair <hi>Fatima,</hi> whom I was acquainted with at <hi>Adrianople.</hi> I went to viſit her yeſterday; and if poſſible, ſhe appeared to me handſomer than before. She met me at the door of her chamber, and, giving me her hand with the beſt grace in the world; You Chriſtian ladies (ſaid ſhe with a ſmile, that made her as beautiful as an angel) have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:041644_0153_101AD2AC70D7B150"/>
of inconſtancy, and I did not expect, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goodneſs you expreſſed for me at Adrianople, that I ſhould ever ſee you again. But I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that I have really the happineſs of pleaſing you; and if you knew how I ſpeak of you amongſt our ladies, you would be aſſured, that you do me juſtice in making me your friend. She placed me in the corner of the Sofa, and I ſpent the afternoon in her converſation, with the greateſt pleaſure in the world.—The Sultana <hi>Hafifien,</hi> is what one would naturally expect to find a Turkiſh lady, willing to oblige, but not knowing how to go about it; and 'tis eaſy to ſee in her manner, that ſhe has lived excluded from the world. But <hi>Fatima</hi> has all the politeneſs and good breeding of a court, with an air that inſpires at once, reſpect and tenderneſs; and now that I underſtand her language, I find her wit as agreeable as her beauty. She is very curious after the manners of other countries, and has not the partiality for her own, ſo common to little minds. A Greek that I carried with me, who had never ſeen her before (nor could have been admitted now, if ſhe had not been admitted in my train) ſhewed that ſurpriſe at her beauty and manner, which is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable at the firſt, ſight, and ſaid to me in Italian,—<hi>"This is no Turkiſh lady, ſhe is certainly ſome Chriſtian."—Fatima</hi> gueſſed ſhe ſpoke of her, and aſked what ſhe ſaid; I would not have told her, thinking ſhe would have been no better pleaſed with the compliment, than one of our court beauties to be told, ſhe had the air of a Turk. But the Greek lady told it to her, and ſhe ſmiled, ſaying, <hi>It is not the firſt time I have heard ſo; my mother was a Polozene taken at the ſiege of Caminiec; and my father uſed to rally me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he believed his Chriſtian wife had found ſome
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:041644_0154_101AD2AEE216DA38"/>
Chriſtian gallant; for that I had not the air of a Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh girl.</hi>—I aſſured her, that if all the Turkiſh ladies were like her, it was abſolutely neceſſary to confine them from public view for the repoſe of mankind; and proceeded to tell her, what a noiſe ſuch a face as hers would make in London or Paris. <hi>I can't believe you,</hi> replied ſhe agreeably; <hi>if beauty was ſo much valued in your country, as you ſay, they would never have ſuffered you to leave it.</hi>—Perhaps, dear ſiſter, you laugh at my vanity in repeating this compliment, but I only do it, as I think it very well turned, and give it you as an inſtance of the ſpirit of her converſation. Her houſe was magnificently furniſhed, and very well fancied; her winter rooms being furniſhed with figured velvet on gold grounds, and, thoſe for ſummer, with fine Indian quilting em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with gold. The houſes of the great Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh ladies are kept clean with as much nicety as thoſe in Holland. This was ſituated in a high part of the town; and from the window of her ſummer apartment we had the proſpect of the ſea, the iſlands and the Aſian mountains,—My letter is inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly grown ſo long, I am aſhamed of it. This is a very bad ſymptom. 'Tis well if I don't dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into a down right ſtory-teller. It may be, our proverb, that <hi>knowledge is no burden,</hi> may be true, as to one's ſelf; but knowing too much, is very apt to make us troubleſome to other people.</p>

You ſee this letter is all in verſe, and I can aſſure you, there is as much fancy ſhewn in the choice of them, as in the moſt ſtudied expreſſions, of our let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; there being, I believe, a million of verſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for this uſe. There is no colour, no flower, no weed, no fruit, herb, pebble, or feather, that has not a verſe belonging to it; and you may quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, reproach, or ſend letters of paſſion, friendſhip, or civility, or even of news, without ever inking your fingers.</p>
            <p>I fancy you are now wondering at my profound learning; but alas, dear madam, I am almoſt fallen into the misfortune ſo common to the ambitious; while they are employed on diſtant inſignificant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts abroad, a rebellion ſtarts up at home;—I am in great danger of loſing my Engliſh. I find 'tis not half ſo eaſy to me to write in it, as it was a twelvemonth ago. I am forced to ſtudy for expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and muſt leave off all other languages, and try to learn my mother tongue.—Human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is as much limited as human power, or human ſtrength. The memory can retain but a certain number of images; and 'tis as impoſſible for one human creature to be perfect maſter of ten different languages, as to have, in perfect ſubjection, ten dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kingdoms, or to fight againſt ten men at a time. I am afraid I ſhall at laſt know none as I ſhould do. I live in a place, that very well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Tower of Babel; in Pera they ſpeak <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, Arabic, Perſian, Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, Sclavonian, Walachian, German, Dutch, French, Engliſh, Italian, Hungarian;</hi> and what is worſe, there are ten of theſe languages ſpoken in my own family. My grooms are <hi>Arabs,</hi> my footmen <hi>French, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Germans;</hi> my nurſe an <hi>Armenian;</hi> my houſe maids

               <hi>Ruſſians;</hi> half a dozen other ſervants <hi>Greeks;</hi> my ſteward an <hi>Italian;</hi> my Janizaries <hi>Turks;</hi> ſo that I live in perpetual hearing of this medley of ſounds, which produces a very extraordinary effect upon the people that are born here; for they learn all theſe languages at the ſame time, and without knowing any of them well enough to write or read in it. There are very few men, women, or even children here, that have not the ſame compaſs of words in five or ſix of them. I know, myſelf, ſeveral infants of three or four years old, that ſpeak Italian, French, Greek, Turkiſh, and Ruſſian, which laſt they learn of their nurſes, who are generally of that country. This ſeems almoſt incredible to you, and is, in my mind, one of the moſt curious things in this country, and takes off very much from the merit of our ladies, who ſet up for ſuch extraordinary geniuſes upon the credit of ſome ſuperficial knowledge of French and Italian.</p>
            <p>As I prefer Engliſh to all the reſt, I am extremely mortified at the daily decay of it in my head, where, I'll aſſure you (with grief of heart) it is reduced to ſuch a ſmall number of words, I cannot recollect any tolerable phraſe to conclude my letter with, and am forced to tell your ladyſhip very bluntly, that I am</p>

            <head>LETTER XLI. To the Counteſs of B—.</head>
            <p>AT length I have heard from my dear lady B—, for the firſt time. I am perſuaded you have had the goodneſs to write before, but I have had the ill fortune to loſe your letters. Since my laſt, I have ſtayed quietly at Conſtantinople, a city that I ought in conſcience to give your ladyſhip a right notion of, ſince I know you can have none but what is partial and miſtaken from the writings of travellers. 'Tis certain, there are many people that paſs years here in <hi>Pera,</hi> without having ever ſeen it, and yet they all pretend to deſcribe it, <hi>Tophana,</hi> and <hi>Galata,</hi> wholly inhabited by French-Chriſtians (and which, together, make the appearance of a very fine town) are divided from it by the ſea, which is not above half ſo broad as the broadeſt part of the Thames; but the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian men are loath to hazard the adventures they ſometimes meet with amongſt the <hi>Levents</hi> or Seamen (worſe monſters than our watermen) and the women muſt cover their faces to go there, which they have á perfect averſion to do. 'Tis true, they wear veils in Pera, but they are ſuch as only ſerve to ſhew their beauty to more advantage, and would not be permitted in Conſtantinople. Theſe reaſons deter almoſt every creature from ſeeing it; and the French Ambaſſadreſs will return to France (I believe) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever having been there. You'll wonder, madam, to hear me add, that I have been there very often. The <hi>Aſmack,</hi> or Turkiſh veil, is become not only very eaſy, but agreeable to me; and if it was not, I would be content to endure ſome inconveniency to
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:041644_0160_101AD2BEB2E54818"/>
gratify a paſſion that is become ſo powerful with me, as curioſity. And indeed, the pleaſure of going in a barge to Chelſea, is not comparable to that of rowing upon the canal of the ſea here, where for twenty miles together down the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> the moſt beautiful variety of proſpects preſent themſelves. The Aſian ſide is covered with fruit trees, villages, and the moſt delightful landſkips in nature; on the European, ſtands Conſtantinople, ſituated on ſeven hills.—The unequal heights make it ſeem as large again as it is (tho' one of the largeſt cities in the world) ſhewing an agreeable mixture of gardens, pine and cypreſs trees, palaces, moſques, and public buildings, raiſed one above another, with as much beauty and appearance of ſymmetry as your ladyſhip ever ſaw in a cabinet adorned by the moſt ſkilful hands, where jars ſhew themſelves above jars, mixed with caniſters, babies, and candleſticks. This is a very odd compariſon; but it gives me an exact idea of the thing. I have taken care to ſee as much of the Seraglio as is to be ſeen. It is on a point of land running into the ſea; a palace of prodigious extent, but very irregular. The gardens take in a large compaſs of ground, full of high cypreſs trees, which is all I know of them. The buildings are all of white ſtone, headed on top, with gilded turrets and ſpires, which look very magnificent; and indeed, I believe there is no Chriſtian King's palace half ſo large. There are ſix large courts in it, all built round and ſet with trees, having galleries of ſtone; one of thoſe for the guard, another for the ſlaves, another for the officers of the kitchen, another for the ſtables, the fifth for the Divan, and the ſixth for the apartment deſtined for audiences. On the ladies ſide there are, at leaſt, as many more, with
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:041644_0161_101AD2C0F07FFC30"/>
diſtinct courts belonging to their eunuchs and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, their kitchens, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next remarkable ſtructure is that of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> which 'tis very difficult to ſee. I was forced to ſend three times to the <hi>Caimaicam,</hi> (the Governor of the Town) and he aſſembled the chief <hi>Effendi'</hi>s or heads of the law, and inquired of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> whether it was lawful to permit it. They paſſed ſome days in this important debate; but, I inſiſting on my requeſt, permiſſion was granted. I can't be informed why the Turks are more delicate on the ſubject of this Moſque, than on any of the others, where, what Chriſtian pleaſes may enter without ſcruple. I fancy they imagine that, having been once conſecrated, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on pretence of curioſity, might profane it with prayers, particularly to thoſe Saints, who are ſtill very viſible in Moſiaic work, and no other way defaced but by the decays of time; for it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe tho' ſo univerſally aſſerted, that the Turks defaced all the images that they found in the city. The dome of St. <hi>Sophia</hi> is ſaid to be one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen foot diameter, built upon arches, ſuſtained by vaſt pillars of marble, the pavement and ſtair-caſe marble. There are two rows of galleries ſupported with pillars of parti-coloured marble and the whole roof moſaic work, part of which decays very faſt, and drops down. They preſented me a handful of it; the compoſition ſeems to me a ſort of glaſs, or that paſte with which they make counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit jewels. They ſhew here the tomb of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> for which they have a great veneration.</p>
            <p>This is a dull imperfect deſcription of this celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted building; but I underſtand architecture ſo little, that I am afraid of talking nonſenſe in endeavouring to ſpeak of it particularly. Perhaps I am in the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:041644_0162_101AD2C33B062350"/>
wrong, but ſome Turkiſh Moſques pleaſe me better. That of Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> is an exact ſquare, with four fine towers in the angles; in the midſt is a noble <hi>Cupola</hi> ſupported with beautiful marble pillars; two leſſer at the ends, ſupported in the ſame manner; the pavement and gallery round the Moſque, of marble; under the great cupola is a fountain adorned with ſuch fine coloured pillars, that I can hardly think them natural marble; on the one ſide is the pulpit of white marble, and on the other the little gallery for the Grand Signior. A fine ſtair-caſe leads to it, and it is built up with gilded lattices. At the upper end is a ſort of altar, where the name of God is written; and, before it, ſtand two candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, as high as a man, with wax candles as thick as three flambeaux. The pavement is ſpread with fine carpets, and the Moſque illuminated with a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of lamps. The court leading to it is very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, with galleries of marble of green columns, covered with twenty-eight leaded cupola's on two ſides, and a fine fountain of baſons in the midſt of it.</p>
            <p>This deſcription may ſerve for all the Moſques in Conſtantinople. The model is exactly the ſame, and they only differ in largeneſs and richneſs of materials. That of the Sultana VALIDA is the largeſt of all, built entirely of marble, the moſt prodigious, and I think the moſt beautiful ſtructure I ever ſaw, be it ſpoke to the honour of our ſex, for it was founded by the mother of MAHOMET the fourth. Between friends, <hi>Paul's Church</hi> would make a pitiful figure near it; as any of our ſquares would do, near the <hi>Atlerdan,</hi> or place of horſes, (<hi>at</hi> ſignifying a horſe in Turkiſh.) This was the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> in the reign of the Greek Emperors. In the midſt of it is a brazen column of three ſerpents twiſted together,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:041644_0163_101AD2C577BF7048"/>
with their mouths gaping. 'Tis impoſſible to learn why ſo odd a pillar was erected; the Greeks can tell nothing but fabulous legends when they are aſked the meaning of it, and there is no ſign of its having ever had any inſcription. At the upper end is an obeliſk of porphyry, probably brought from Egypt, the hieroglyphicks all very entire, which I look upon as mere antient puns. It is placed on four lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle brazen pillars, upon a pedeſtal of ſquare free ſtone, full of figures in bas-relief on two ſides; one ſquare repreſenting a battle, another an aſſembly. The others having inſcriptions in Greek and Latin; the laſt I took in my pocket-book, and it is as follows.
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Difficilis quondam, Dominis parere Serenis</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Juſſus, et extinctis palmam portare Tyrannis</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Omnia Theodoſio cedunt, ſobolique perenni.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
Your Lord will interpret theſe lines. Don't fancy they they are a love-letter to him.</p>
            <p>All the figures have their heads on; and I cannot forbear reflecting again on the impudence of authors, who all ſay they have not; but I dare ſwear the greateſt part of them never ſaw them; but took the report from the Greeks, who reſiſt, with incredible fortitude, the conviction of their own eyes, whenever they have invented lies to the diſhonour of their enemies. Were you to believe them, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth ſeeing in Conſtantinople, but <hi>Sancta Sohpia,</hi> tho' there are ſeveral larger, and in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, more beautiful Moſques in that city. That of Sultan <hi>Achmet,</hi> has this particularity, that its gates are of braſs. In all theſe Moſques there are little chapels, where are the tombs of the founders and their families, with wax candles burning before them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:041644_0164_101AD2C7D2396BA8"/>
The <hi>Exchanges</hi> are all noble buildings, full of fine alleys, the greateſt part ſupported with pillars, and kept wonderfully neat. Every trade has its diſtinct alley, where the merchandize is diſpoſed in the ſame order as in the New Exchange at London. The <hi>Biſiſten,</hi> or jeweller's quarter, ſhews ſo much riches, ſuch a vaſt quantity of diamonds, and all kinds of precious ſtones, that they dazzle the ſight. The embroiderers is alſo very glittering, and people walk here as much for diverſion as buſineſs. The markets are moſt of them handſome ſquares, and admirably well provided, perhaps better than in any other part of the world.</p>
            <p>I know you'll expect I ſhould ſay ſomething par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the ſlaves; and you will imagine me half a Turk, when I don't ſpeak of it with the ſame horror other Chriſtians have done before me. But I cannot forbear applauding the humanity of the Turks to theſe creatures; they are never ill uſed, and their ſlavery is in my opinion, no worſe than ſervitude all over the world. 'Tis true they have no wages; but they give them yearly clothes to a higher value than our ſalaries to our ordinary ſervants. But you'll ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that men buy women <hi>with an eye to evil.</hi> In my opinion they are bought and ſold as publicly and as infamouſly in all our Chriſtian great cities.</p>
            <p>I muſt add to the deſcription of Conſtantinople, that the <hi>Hiſtorical Pillar</hi> is no more. It dropped down about two years before I came to this part of the world. I have ſeen no other footſteps of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity except the aquaeducts, which are ſo vaſt, that I am apt to believe they are yet more antient than the Greek Empire. The Turks, indeed, have clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ſome ſtones with Turkiſh inſcriptions, to give their natives the honour of ſo great a work; but the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:041644_0165_101AD2CA08D68AF0"/>
deceit is eaſily diſcovered.—The other public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are the <hi>Hans</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries;</hi> the firſt are very large and numerous; the ſecond few in number, and not at all magnificent. I had the curioſity to viſit one of them, and to obſerve the devotions of the <hi>Derviſes,</hi> which are as whimſical as any at Rome. Theſe fellows have permiſſion to marry, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to an odd habit, which is only a piece of coarſe white cloath, wrapped about them, with their legs and arms naked. Their order has few other rules, except that of performing their fantaſtick rites, every Tueſday and Friday, which is done in this manner: They meet together in a large hall, where they all ſtand with their eyes fixed on the ground, and their arms acroſs, while the <hi>Imaum</hi> or preacher reads part of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> from a pulpit, placed in the midſt; and when he has done, eight or ten of them make a melancholy concert with their pipes, which are no unmuſical inſtruments. Then he reads again, and makes a ſhort expoſition on what he has read; after which they ſing and play, till their Superior (the only one of them dreſſed in green) riſes and begins a ſort of ſolemn dance. They all ſtand about him in a regular figure, and while ſome play, the others tie their robe (which is very wide) faſt round their waiſt, and begin to turn round with an amazing ſwiftneſs, and yet with great regard to the muſic, moving ſlower or faſter as the tune is played. This laſts above an hour, without any of them ſhewing the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of giddineſs, which is not to be wondered at, when it is conſidered, they are all uſed to it from their infancy; moſt of them being devoted to this way of life from their birth. There turned amongſt them ſome little Derviſes of ſix or ſeven years old, who ſeemed no more diſordered by that exerciſe than
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:041644_0166_101AD2CCE8AD9300"/>
the others. At the end of the ceremony they ſhout out; <hi>
                  <q>There is no other God, but God, and Mahomet is his Prophet:</q>
               </hi> after which they kiſs the Superor's hand and retire. The whole is performed with the moſt ſolemn gravity. Nothing can be more auſtere than the form of theſe people; they never raiſe their eyes, and ſeem devoted to contemplation. And as ridiculous as this is in deſcription, there is ſomething touching in the air of ſubmiſſion and mortification they aſſume.—This letter is of a horrible length; but you may burn it when you have read enough, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <head>LETTER XLII.</head>
            <head>To the Counteſs of—.</head>
            <p>I AM now preparing to leave Conſtantinople, and perhaps you will accuſe me of hypocriſy, when I tell you, 'tis with regret; but as I am uſed to the air, and have learnt the language, I am eaſy here; and as much as I love travelling, I tremble at the inconveniencies attending ſo great a journey, with a numerous family, and a little infant hanging at the breaſt. However, I endeavour, upon this occaſion, to do as I have hitherto done in all the odd turns of my life; turn them, if I can, to my diverſion. In order to this, I ramble every day, wrapped up in my <hi>Ferige</hi> and <hi>Aſmack,</hi> about Conſtantinople, and amuſe myſelf with ſeeing all that is curious in it. I know you will expect that this declaration ſhould be followed with ſome account of what I have ſeen. But I am in no humour to copy what has been writ
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:041644_0167_101AD2CE6D1C08E0"/>
ſo often over. To what purpoſe ſhould I tell you, that Conſtantinople is the antient Bizantium? that 'tis at preſent the conqueſt of a race of people, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Seythians? that there are five or ſix thouſand moſques in it? that <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> was founded by Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, &amp;c. I'll aſſure you 'tis not for want of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I forbear writing all theſe bright things. I could alſo, with very little trouble, turn over <hi>Knolles</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Rycaut,</hi> to give you a liſt of Turkiſh Emperors; but I will not tell you what you may find in every author that has writ of this country. I am more inclined, out of a true female ſpirit of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to tell you the falſehood of a great part of what you find in authors; as for example, in the admirable Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> who ſo gravely aſſerts, that he ſaw in <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> a ſweating pillar, very balſamic for diſordered heads. There is not the leaſt tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuch matter; and I ſuppoſe it was revealed to him in viſion, during his wonderful ſtay in the Egyptian Catacombs; for I am ſure he never heard of any ſuch miracle here. 'Tis alſo very pleaſant to obſerve how tenderly he and all his brethren voyage-writers, lament the miſerable confinement of the Turkiſh ladies, who are perhaps more free than any ladies in the univerſe, and are the only women in the world, that lead a life of uninterrupted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, exempt from cares, their whole time being ſpent in viſiting, bathing, or the agreeable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpending money and inventing new faſhions. A husband would be thought mad that exacted any degree of oeconomy from his wife, whoſe expences are no way limited but by her own fancy. 'Tis his buſineſs to get money, and her's to ſpend it; and this noble prerogative extends itſelf to the very meaneſt of the ſex. Here is a fellow that carries embroidered
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:041644_0168_101AD2D0A8857190"/>
handkerchiefs upon his back to ſell. And as miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a figure as you may ſuppoſe ſuch a mean dealer; yet I'll aſſure you, his wife ſcorns to wear any thing leſs than cloth of gold; has her ermine furs, and a very handſome ſet of jewels for her head. 'Tis true, they have no places but the bagnios, and theſe can only be ſeen by their own ſex; however, that is a diverſion they take great pleaſure in.</p>
            <p>I was, three days ago, at one of the fineſt in the town, and had the opportunity of ſeeing a Turkiſh bride received there, and all the ceremony uſed on that occaſion, which made me recollect the <hi>Epithala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium</hi> of <hi>Helen,</hi> by <hi>Theocritus;</hi> and it ſeems to me, that the ſame cuſtoms have continued ever ſince. All the ſhe friends, relations and acquaintance of the two families, newly allied, meet at the bagnio; ſeveral others go, out of curioſity, and I believe there were that day two hundred women. Thoſe that were, or had been married, placed themſelves round the rooms, on the marble ſofas; but the virgins very haſtily threw off their clothes, and appeared without other ornament, or covering, than their own long hair braided with pearl or ribbon. Two of them met the bride at the door, conducted by her mother and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grave relation. She was a beautiful maid of about ſeventeen, very richly dreſſed, and ſhining with jewels, but was preſently reduced to the ſtate of nature. Two others filled ſilver gilt pots with perfume, and begun the proceſſion, the reſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pairs, to the number of thirty. The leaders ſung an <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> anſwered by the others in chorus, and the two laſt led the fair bride, her eyes fixed on the ground, with a charming affectation of modeſty. In this order they marched round the three large rooms of the Bagnio. 'Tis not eaſy to
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:041644_0169_101AD2D5F2B2AB10"/>
repreſent to you the beauty of this ſight, moſt of them being well proportioned and white ſkinn'd; all of them perfectly ſmooth, and poliſhed by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of bathing. After having made their <hi>tour,</hi> the bride was again led to every matron round the rooms, who ſaluted her with a compliment and a preſent, ſome of jewels, others of pieces of ſtuff, handkerchiefs, or little gallantries of that nature, which ſhe thanked them for, by kiſſing their hands. I was very well pleaſed with having ſeen this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and you may believe me, that the Turkiſh ladies have, at leaſt, as much wit and civility, nay liberty, as among us. 'Tis true, the ſame cuſtoms that give them ſo many opportunities of gratifying their evil inclinations (if they have any) alſo put it very fully in the power of their husbands to revenge themſelves, if they are diſcovered; and I do not doubt but they ſuffer ſometimes for their indiſcretions in a very ſevere manner. About two months ago, there was found at day-break, not very far from my houſe, the bleeding body of a young woman, naked, only wrapp'd in a coarſe ſheet, with two wounds of a knife, one in her ſide, and another in her breaſt. She was not quite cold, and was ſo ſurpriſingly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, that there was very few men in Pera, that did not go to look upon her; but it was not poſſible for any body to know her, no woman's face being known. She was ſuppoſed to have been brought, in the dead of night, from the Conſtantinople ſide, and laid there. Very little inquiry was made about the murderer, and the corpſe was privately buried without noiſe. Murder is never purſued by the King's officers, as with us. 'Tis the buſineſs of the next relations to revenge the dead perſon; and if they like better to compound the matter for money
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:041644_0170_101AD2D775BE7BE0"/>
(as they generally do) there is no more ſaid of it. One would imagine this defect in their government, ſhould make ſuch tragedies very frequent, yet they are extremely rare; which is enough to prove the people not naturally cruel. Neither do I think, in many other particulars, they deſerve the barbarous character we give them. I am well acquainted with a Chriſtian woman of quality, who made it her choice to live with a Turkiſh husband, and is a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſible lady. Her ſtory is ſo extraordinary, I cannot forbear relating it; but I promiſe you it ſhall be in as few words as I can poſſibly expreſs it.</p>
            <p>She is a Spaniard, and was at Naples with her family, when that kingdom was part of the Spaniſh dominion. Coming from thence in a <hi>Feloucca,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by her brother, they were attacked by the Turkiſh Admiral, boarded and taken.—And now how ſhall I modeſtly tell you the reſt of her adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? The ſame accident happened to her, that happen'd to the fair Lucretia ſo many years before her. But ſhe was too good a Chriſtian to kill herſelf, as that Heatheniſh Roman did. The Admiral was ſo much charmed with the beauty, and <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> of the fair captive, that, as his firſt compliment, he gave immediate liberty to her brother and attendants, who made haſte to Spain, and in a few months ſent the ſum of four thouſand pound ſterling, as a ranſom for his ſiſter. The Turk took the money, which he preſented to her, and told her ſhe was at liberty. But the lady very diſcreetly weighed the different treatment ſhe was likely to find in her native country. Her relations (as the kindeſt thing they could do for her in her preſent circumſtances) would certainly confine her to a nunnery for the reſt of her days.—Her Infidel lover was very handſome, very tender,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:041644_0171_101AD2D9AA5FC740"/>
very fond of her, and laviſhed at her feet all the Turkiſh magnificence. She anſwered him very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that her liberty was not ſo precious to her as her honour, that he could no way reſtore that but by marrying her, and ſhe therefore deſired him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ranſom as her portion, and give her the ſatisfaction of knowing that no man could boaſt of her favours without being her husband. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was tranſported at this kind offer, and ſent back the money to her relations, ſaying he was too happy in her poſſeſſion. He married her, and never took any other wife, and (as ſhe ſays herſelf) ſhe never had reaſon to repent the choice ſhe made. He left her ſome years after, one of the richeſt widows in Conſtantinople. But there is no remaining honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably a ſingle woman, and that conſideration has obliged her to marry the preſent Captain Baſſa (i. e. Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) his ſucceſſor.—I am afraid that you will think my friend fell in love with her raviſher; but I am willing to take her word for it, that ſhe acted wholly on principles of honour, tho' I think ſhe might be reaſonably touched at his generoſity, which is often found amongſt the Turks of rank.</p>
            <p>'Tis a degree of generoſity to tell the truth, and 'tis very rare that any Turk will aſſert a ſolemn falſe-hood. I don't ſpeak of the loweſt ſort; for as there is a great deal of ignoronce, there is very little vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue amongſt them; and falſe witneſſes are much cheaper than in Chriſtendom, thoſe wretches not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed (even when they are publicly detected) with the rigour they ought to be.</p>
            <p>Now I am ſpeaking of their law, I don't know, whether I have ever mentioned to you one cuſtom peculiar to their country, I mean <hi>adoption,</hi> very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt the Turks, and yet more amongſt the
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:041644_0172_101AD2DEE55EECD0"/>
Greeks and Armenians. Not having it in their power to give their eſtates to a friend or a diſtant relation, to avoid its falling into the Grand Signior's treaſury, when they are not likely to have any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their own, they chooſe ſome pretty child of either ſex, amongſt the meaneſt people, and carry the child and its parents before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and there declare they receive it for their heir. The parents, at the ſame time, renounce all future claim to it; a writing is drawn and witneſſed, and a child thus adopted, cannot be diſinherited. Yet I have ſeen ſome common beggars, that have refuſed to part with their children in this manner, to ſome of the richeſt among the Greeks; (ſo powerful is the inſtinctive affection that is natural to parents!) though the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fathers are generally very tender to theſe <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their ſouls,</hi> as they call them. I own this cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom pleaſes me much better than our abſurd one of following our name. Methinks 'tis much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to make happy and rich, an infant whom I educate after my own manner, <hi>brought up</hi> (in the Turkiſh phraſe) <hi>upon my knees,</hi> and who has learnt to look upon me with a filial reſpect, than to give an eſtate to a creature without other merit or relation to me than that of a few letters. Yet this is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity we ſee frequently practiſed.—Now I have mentioned the Armenians, perhaps it will be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to tell you ſomething of that nation, with which I am ſure you are utterly unacquainted. I will not trouble you with the geographical account of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their country, which you may ſee in the maps; or a relation of their antient greatneſs, which you may read in the Roman Hiſtory. They are now ſubject to the Turks; and, being very induſtrious in trade, and increaſing and multiplying, are diſperſed
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:041644_0173_101AD2E1212A72B0"/>
in great numbers through all the Turkiſh dominions. They were, as they ſay, converted to the Chriſtian religion by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and are perhaps the devouteſt Chriſtians in the whole world. The chief precepts of their prieſts, enjoin the ſtrict keeping of their Lents, which are, at leaſt, ſeven months in every year, and are not to be diſpenſed with on the moſt emergent neceſſity; no occaſion whatever can excuſe them if they touch any thing more than mere herbs or roots, (without oil) and plain dry bread. That is their conſtant diet.—Mr. W—y has one of his interpreters of this nation, and the poor fellow was brought ſo low by the ſeverity of his faſts, that his life was deſpaired of. Yet neither his maſter's commands, nor the doctors intreaties (who declared nothing elſe could ſave his life) were powerful enough to prevail with him to take two or three ſpoonfuls of broth. Excepting this, which may rather be called a cuſtom than an article of faith, I ſee very little in their religion different from ours. 'Tis true, they ſeem to incline very much to Mr. <hi>Whiſton'</hi>s doctrine; neither do I think the Greek church very diſtant from it, ſince 'tis certain, the Holy ſpirit's proceding <hi>only</hi> from the father, is making a plain ſubordination in the Son.—But the Armenians have no notion of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> whatever account Sir <hi>Paul Rycaut</hi> gives of them, (which account I am apt to believe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to compliment our court in 1679) and they have a great horror for thoſe amongſt them that change to the Roman religion. What is moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in their cuſtoms, is their matrimony; a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, I believe, unparallel'd all over the world. They are always promiſed very young; but the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed never ſee one another, till three days after their marriage. The bride is carried to church with
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:041644_0174_101AD2E2A5B07BB8"/>
a cap on her head, in the faſhion of a large trencher, and over it a red ſilken veil, which covers her all over to her feet. The prieſt aſks the bridegroom whether he is contented to marry that woman, <hi>be ſhe deaf, be ſhe blind?</hi> Theſe are the literal words; to which having anſwered <hi>yes,</hi> ſhe is led home to his houſe, accompanied with all the friends and relations on both ſides, ſinging and dancing, and is placed on a cuſhion in the corner of the ſofa; but her veil is never lifted up, not even by her husband. There is ſomething ſo odd and monſtrous in theſe ways, that I could not believe them till I had inquired of ſeveral Armenians myſelf, who all aſſured me of the truth of them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one young fellow who wept when he ſpoke of it, being promiſed by his mother to a girl that he muſt marry in this manner, tho' he proteſted to me, he had rather die than ſubmit to this ſlavery, having already figured his bride to himſelf, with all the deformities in nature.—I fancy I ſee you bleſs your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at this terrible relation. I cannot conclude my letter with a more ſurpriſing ſtory, yet 'tis as ſeriouſly true, as that I am,</p>

            <p>I AM extremely pleaſed with hearing from you, and my vanity (the darling frailty of human kind) not a little flattered by the uncommon queſtions you aſk me, tho' I am utterly incapable of anſwering them. And indeed were I as good Mathematician as <hi>Euclid</hi> himſelf, it requires an age's ſtay to make juſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the air and vapours. I have not been yet a full year here, and am on the point of removing. Such is my rambling deſtiny. This will ſurpriſe you, and can ſurpriſe nobody ſo much as myſelf. Perhaps you will accuſe me of lazineſs or dulneſs, or both together, that can leave this place without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſome account of the Turkiſh court. I can only tell you that if you pleaſe to read Sir <hi>Paul Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi> you will there find a full and true account of the <hi>Viziers,</hi> the <hi>Beglerby'</hi>s, the civil and ſpiritual go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the officers of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> &amp;c. things that 'tis very eaſy to procure liſts of, and therefore may be depended on; tho' other ſtories, God knows—I ſay no more—every body is at liberty to write their own remarks; the manners of people may change; or ſome of them eſcape the obſervation of travellers; but 'tis not the ſame of the government, and for that reaſon, ſince I can tell you nothing new, I will tell you nothing of it. In the ſame ſilence ſhall be paſſed over the arſenal and ſeven towers, and for Moſques I have already deſcribed one of the nobleſt to you very particularly. But I cannot forbear tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:041644_0176_101AD2EA4C37E630"/>
notice to you of a miſtake of GEMELLI, though I honour him in a much higher degree than any other voyage-writer:) he ſays that there are no remains of Calcedon; this is certainly a miſtake; I was there yeſterday and went croſs the canal in my galley, the ſea being very narrow between that city and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. 'Tis ſtill a large town, and has ſeveral Moſques in it. The Chriſtians ſtill call it Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and the Turks gave it a name I forgot, but which is only a corruption of the ſame word. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this is an error of his guide, which his ſhort ſtay hindered him from rectifying; for I have, in other matters, a very juſt eſteem for his veracity. Nothing can be pleaſanter than the canal, and the Turks are ſo well acquainted with its beauties, that all their pleaſure-ſeats are built on its banks, where they have, at the ſame time, the moſt beautiful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects in Europe and Aſia; there are near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome hundreds of magnificent palaces. Human grandeur being here yet more unſtable than any where elſe, 'tis common for the heirs of a great three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd Baſſa, not to be rich enough to keep in repair, the houſe he built; thus in a few years they all fall to ruin. I was yeſterday to ſee that of the late Grand Vizier, who was killed at Peterwaradin. It was built to receive his Royal Bride, daughter of the preſent Sultan, but he did not live to ſee her there. I have a great mind to deſcribe it to you; but I check that inclination, knowing very well that I cannot give you, with my beſt deſcription, ſuch an idea of it as I ought. It is ſituated on one of the moſt delightful parts of the canal, with a fine wood on the ſide of a hill behind it. The extent of it is prodigious; the guardian aſſured me there are eight hundred rooms in it; I will not, however, anſwer for that number,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:041644_0177_101AD2EBCF520328"/>
ſince I did not count them; but 'tis certain the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is very large, and the whole adorned with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of marble, gilding, and the moſt exquiſite painting of fruits and flowers. The windows are all faſh'd with the fineſt chryſtaline glaſs, brought from England, and here is all the expenſive magnificence that you can ſuppoſe in a palace founded by a vain luxurious young man, with the wealth of a vaſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at his command. But no part of it pleaſed me better than the apartments deſtined for the Bagnio's. There are two built exactly in the ſame manner, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to one another; the baths, fountains, and pavements all of white marble, the roofs gilt, and the walls covered with Japan china. Adjoining to them are two rooms, the uppermoſt of which is divided into a ſofa; and in the four corners are falls of water from the very roof, from ſhell to ſhell of white mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to the lower end of the room, where it falls into a large baſon, ſurrounded with pipes that throw up the water as high as the room. The walls are in the nature of lattices, and on the outſide of them, there are vines and woodbines planted, that form a kind of green tapeſtry, and give an agreeable obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to thoſe delightful chambers. I ſhould go on and let you into ſome of the other apartments (all worthy your curioſity) but 'tis yet harder to deſcribe a Turkiſh palace than any other, being built entirely irregular. There is nothing that can be properly called front or wings; and tho' ſuch a confuſion is, I think, pleaſing to the ſight, yet it would be very unintelligible in a letter. I ſhall only add, that the chamber deſtined for the Sultan when he viſits his daughter, is wainſcotted with mother of pearl, faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with emeralds like nails. There are others of mother of pearl and olive-wood inlaid, and ſeveral
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:041644_0178_101AD28877CD85C0"/>
of Japan china. The galleries, which are numerous and very large, are adorned with jars of flowers, and procelain diſhes of fruit of all ſorts, ſo well done in plaiſter, and coloured in ſo lively a manner, that it has an enchanting effect. The garden is ſuitable to the houſe, where arbours, fountains, and walks are thrown together in an agreeable confuſion. There is no ornament wanting except that of ſtatues. Thus you ſee, Sir, theſe people are not ſo unpoliſhed as we repreſent them. 'Tis true, their magnificence is of a different taſte from ours, and perhaps of a better. I am almoſt of opinion they have a right notion of life. They conſume it in muſick, gardens, wine and delicate eating, while we are tormenting our brains with ſome ſcheme of politicks, or ſtudying ſome ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which we can never attain, or if we do, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſuade other people to ſet that value upon it we do ourſelves. 'Tis certain what we feel and ſee is properly (if any thing is properly) our own; but the good of fame, the folly of praiſe are hardly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and when obtained, poor recompence for loſs of time and health. We die or grow old before we can reap the fruit of our labours. Conſidering what ſhort liv'd weak animals men are, is there any ſtudy ſo beneficial as the ſtudy of preſent pleaſure? I dare not purſue this theme; perhaps I have already ſaid too much, but I depend upon the true knowledge you have of my heart. I don't expect from you the inſipid railleries I ſhould ſuffer from another in anſwer to this letter. You know how to divide the idea of <hi>pleaſure</hi> from that of <hi>vice,</hi> and they are only mingled in the heads of fools.—But I allow you to laugh at me for the ſenſual declaration in ſaying, that I had rather be a rich Effendi with all his ignorance, than Sir Iſaac Newton with all his knowledge.</p>

            <p>I LEFT Conſtantinople the ſixth of the laſt month, and this is the firſt poſt from whence I could ſend a letter, tho' I have often wiſhed for the opportunity, that I might impart ſome of the pleaſure I found in this voyage, through the moſt agreeable part of the world, where every ſcene preſents me ſome poetical idea.</p>

            <p>I beg your pardon for this ſally, and will, if I can, continue the reſt of my account in plain proſe. The ſecond day after we ſet ſail, we paſſed <hi>Gallipolis,</hi> a fair city, ſituated in the bay of <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> and much reſpected by the Turks, being the firſt town they took in Europe. At five the next morning, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in the Helleſpont, between the caſtles of <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Abydos</hi> now called the <hi>Dardanelli.</hi> There are now two little ancient caſtles, but of no ſtrength, being commanded by a riſing ground behind them, which I confeſs I ſhould never have taken notice of, if I had not heard it obſerv'd by our captain and officers, my imagination being wholly employed by the tragic ſtory that you are well acquainted with:

Verſe again!—I am certainly infected by the poetical air I have paſſed through. That of Abydos is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly very amorous, ſince that ſoft paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the caſtle into the hands of the Turks, who beſieged it in the reign of Orchanes. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's daughter imagining to have ſeen her future husband in a dream (tho' I don't find ſhe had either ſlept upon <hi>Bride-cake</hi> or kept <hi>St. Agnes Faſt</hi>) fancied ſhe ſaw the dear figure in the form of one of her beſiegers, and, being willing to obey her deſtiny, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a note to him over the wall, with the offer of her perſon and the delivery of the caſtle. He ſhewed it to his general, who conſented to try the ſincerity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> her intentions and withdrew his army, ordering the young man to return with a ſelect body of men at midnight. She admitted him at the appointed hour, he deſtroyed the garriſon, took the father priſoner, and made her his wife. This town is in Aſia, firſt founded by the Mileſians. <hi>Seſtos</hi> is in Europe, and was once the principal city of Cherſoneſus. Since I have ſeen this ſtreight, I find nothing improbable in the adventure of <hi>Leander,</hi> or very wonderful in the bridge of boats of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> 'Tis ſo narrow, 'tis not ſurpriſing a young lover ſhould attempt to ſwim, or an ambitious King try to paſs his army over it. But then 'tis ſo ſubject to ſtorms, 'tis no wonder the lover periſhed and the bridge was broken. From hence we had a full view of mount Ida;

Not many leagues fail from hence, I ſaw the point of land where poor old <hi>Hecuba</hi> was buried, and about a league from that place is Cape <hi>Janizary,</hi> the famous promontory of <hi>Sigaeum,</hi> where we anchored. My curioſity ſupplied me with ſtrength to climb to the top of it, to ſee the place where <hi>Achilles</hi> was buried, and where <hi>Alexander</hi> ran naked round his tomb in honour of him, which, no doubt, was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his ghoſt. I ſaw there, the ruins of a very large city, and found a ſtone on which Mr. W—y plainly diſtinguiſhed the words of <hi>Sigan Polin.</hi> We ordered this on board the ſhip; but were ſhew'd others much more curious by a Greek Prieſt, tho' a very ignorant fellow that could give no tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any thing. On each ſide the door of this little church lie two large ſtones, about ten feet long each, five in breadth and three in thickneſs. That on the right is very fine white marble, the ſide of it beautifully carved in <hi>Bas relief;</hi> it repreſents a woman, who ſeems to be deſigned for ſome Deity, ſitting on a chair with a footſtool, and before her another woman weeping and preſenting to her a young child that ſhe has in her arms, followed by a proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of women with children in the ſame manner. This is certainly part of a very ancient tomb; but I dare not pretend to give the true explanation of it. On the ſtone, on the left ſide, is a very fair inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Greek is too ancient for Mr. W—y's interpretation. I am very ſorry not to have the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in my poſſeſſion, which might have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of the poor inhabitants for a ſmall ſum of money. But our captain aſſured us, that, without having machines made on purpoſe, 'twas impoſſible to bear it to the ſea-ſide, and when it was there, his long-boat would not be large enough to hold it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="unknown:041644_0182_101AD2EE2B1A64B0"/>
The ruins of this great city are now inhabited by poor Greek peaſants, who wear the <hi>Sciote</hi> habit, the women being in ſhort petticoats faſtened by ſtraps round their ſhoulders, and large ſmock-ſleeves of white linen, with neat ſhoes and ſtockings, and on their heads a large piece of muſlin, which falls in large folds on their ſhoulders.—One of my countrymen, Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> (whoſe book I doubt not you have read as one of the beſt of its kind) ſpeaking of theſe ruins ſuppoſes them to have been the foundation of a city begun by Conſtantine, before his building Byzantium; but I ſee no good reaſon for that imagination, and am apt to believe them much more ancient.</p>
            <p>We ſaw very plainly from this promontory, the river <hi>Simois</hi> rolling from mount Ida, and running through a very ſpacious valley. It is now a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable river and is called <hi>Simores;</hi> it is joined in the vale by the <hi>Scamander,</hi> which appeared a ſmall ſtream half-choaked with mud, but is perhaps large in the winter. This was <hi>Xanthus</hi> amongſt the Gods, as Homer tells us, and 'tis by that heavenly name, the Nymph <hi>Oenone</hi> invokes it, in her Epiſtle to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Trojan Virgins uſed to offer their firſt favours to it by the name of Scamander, till the adventure, which <hi>Monſieur de la Fontaine</hi> has told ſo agreeably, aboliſhed that heatheniſh ceremony. When the ſtream is mingled with the Simois, they run together to the ſea.</p>
            <p>All that is now left at <hi>Troy</hi> is the ground on which it ſtood; for I am firmly perſuaded whatever pieces of antiquity may be found round it, are much more modern, and I think <hi>Strabo</hi> ſays the ſame thing. However there is ſome pleaſure in ſeeing the valley where I imagined the famous duel of <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> had been fought, and where the greateſt city
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:041644_0183_101AD2DB2EFDF3F8"/>
in the world was ſituated. 'Tis certainly the nobleſt ſituation that can be found for the head of a great empire, much to be preferred to that of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, the harbour here being always convenient for ſhips from all parts of the world, and that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople inacceſſible almoſt ſix months in the year, while the north wind reigns.</p>
            <p>North of the promontory of Sigaeum we ſaw that of <hi>Rhateum,</hi> fam'd for the ſepulchre of <hi>Ajax.</hi> While I viewed theſe celebrated fields and rivers I admired the exact geography of <hi>Homer,</hi> whom I had in my hand. Almoſt every epithet he gives to a mountain or plain, is ſtill juſt for it; and I ſpent ſeveral hours here, in as agreeable <hi>cogitations</hi> as ever <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had on mount <hi>Monteſinos.</hi> We failed next night, to the ſhore where 'tis vulgarly reported <hi>Troy</hi> ſtood, and I took the pains of riſing at two in the morning to view coolly thoſe ruins which are commonly ſhew'd to ſtrangers, and which the Turks call <hi>Eſki-Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boul,</hi> i. e. Old Conſtantinople. For that reaſon as well as ſome others, I conjecture them to be the remains of that city begun by Conſtantine. I hired an aſs (the only voiture to be had there) that I might go ſome miles into the country, and take a tour round the ancient walls which are of a vaſt extent. We found the remains of a caſtle on a hill, and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a valley, ſeveral broken pillars and two pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtals, from which I took theſe Latin inſcriptions:

I do not doubt but the remains of a temple near this place, are the ruins of one dedicated to Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and I know not why Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> calls it a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian temple, ſince the Romans certainly built herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. Here are many tombs of fine marble and vaſt pieces of granate, which are daily leſſen'd by the prodigious balls that the Turks make, from them, for their cannon.

I ſay nothing of <hi>Tenes,</hi> from whom it was called; but naming <hi>Myti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> where we paſſed next, I cannot forbear menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, <hi>Leshos</hi> where SAPPHO ſung and PITTACUS reigned, famous for the birth of ALCEUS, THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHRASTUS and ARION, thoſe maſters in Poetry, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and Muſick. This was one of the laſt iſlands that remained in the Chriſtian dominion after the
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:041644_0185_101AD2F143F50FC0"/>
conqueſt of Conſtantinople by the Turks. But need I talk to you of <hi>Catucuſeno,</hi> &amp;c. Princes that you are as well acquainted with as I am. 'Twas with regret I ſaw us ſail from this iſland into the Egean ſea, now the Archipelago, leaving <hi>Scio</hi> (the ancient <hi>Chios</hi>) on the left, which is the richeſt and moſt populous of theſe iſlands, fruitful in cotton, corn and ſilk, planted with groves of orange and lemon trees, and the Arvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian mountain ſtill celebrated for the Nectar that VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIL mentions. Here is the beſt manufacture of ſilks in all Turkey. The town is well built, the women famous for their beauty, and ſhew their faces as in Chriſtendom. There are many rich families; tho' they confine their magnificence to the inſide of their houſes, to avoid the jealouſy of the Turks, who have a Baſſa here; however they enjoy a reaſonable liberty, and indulge the genius of their country;

Their chains hang lightly on them, tho' 'tis not long ſince they were impos'd, not being under the Turk till 1566. But perhaps 'tis as eaſy to obey the Grand Signior as the ſtate of Genoa, to whom they were ſold by the Greek Emperor. But I forgot myſelf in theſe hiſtorical touches, which are very impertinent when I write to you. Paſſing the ſtreight between the iſlands of <hi>Andros</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> now <hi>Libadia,</hi> we ſaw the promontory of Lunium, now called <hi>Cape Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> where are yet ſtanding the vaſt pillars of a temple of MINERVA. This venerable ſight made me think with double regret, on a beautiful temple of THESEUS, which I am aſſured was almoſt entire at Athens till the laſt campaign in the <hi>Morea,</hi> that the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:041644_0186_101AD2F371B061F8"/>
Turks filled it with power and it was accidentally blown up. You may believe I had a great mind to land on the fam'd <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> tho' it were only to look on the rivers of <hi>Aſopus, Peneus, Inachus</hi> and <hi>Eurotas,</hi> the fields of <hi>Arcadia</hi> and other ſcenes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mythology. But inſtead of Demi-gods and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, I was credibly informed, 'tis now over-run by robbers, and that I ſhould run a great riſque of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into their hands by undertaking ſuch a journey through a deſart country, for which however I have ſo much reſpect, that I have much ado to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der myſelf from troubling you with its whole hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, from the foundation of Nycana and Corinth, to the laſt campaign here; but I check the inclination as I did that of landing. We failed quietly by <hi>Cape Angelo,</hi> once <hi>Malea,</hi> where I ſaw no remains of the famous temple of Apollo. We came that evening in ſight of Candia: it is very mountainous; we eaſily diſtinguiſh'd that of Ida.—We have Virgil's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that here were a hundred cities—

<pb n="178" facs="unknown:041644_0187_101AD2F4F569D400"/>
of ſtatuaries, and converſing with the moſt polite and moſt gay of mankind. Alas! Art is extinct here, the wonders of nature alone remain, and it was with vaſt pleaſure I obſerv'd thoſe of mount AEtna, whoſe flame appears very bright in the night many leagues off at ſea, and fills the head with a thouſand conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. However, I honour Philoſophy too much to imagine it could turn that of EMPEDOCLES, and LU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIAN ſhall never make me believe ſuch a ſcandal of a man of whom Lucretius ſays,
<q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We paſſed <hi>Trinacria</hi> without hearing any of the <hi>Syrens</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> deſcribes, and, being thrown on neither <hi>Sylla</hi> nor <hi>Charybdis,</hi> came ſafe to <hi>Malta,</hi> firſt called Melita, from the abundance of honey. It is a whole rock cover'd with very little earth. The Grand Maſter lives here in the ſtate of a ſovereign Prince; but his ſtrength at ſea now is very ſmall. The forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are reckon'd the beſt in the world, all cut in the ſolid rock with infinite expence and labour.—Off this iſland we were toſſed by a ſevere ſtorm, and were very glad, after eight days, to be able to put into <hi>Porta Farine</hi> on the African ſhore, where our ſhip now rides. At <hi>Tunis</hi> we were met by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh conſul who reſides here. I readily accepted of the offer of his houſe there for ſome days, being very curious to ſee this part of the world, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the ruins of Carthage. I ſet out in his chaiſe at nine at night, the moon being at full. I ſaw the proſpect of the country almoſt as well as I could have done by day light, and the heat of the ſun is now ſo intolerable, 'tis impoſſible to travel at any other time. The ſoil is, for the moſt part, ſandy, but every where
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:041644_0188_101AD2F6775A74B8"/>
fruitful of date, olive and fig trees, which grow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out art, yet afford the moſt delicious fruit in the world. Their vineyards and melon-fields are enclos'd by hedges of that plant, we call <hi>Indian fig,</hi> which is an admirable fence, no wild beaſt being able to paſs it. It grows a great height, very thick, and the ſpikes or thorns are as long and ſharp as bodkins; it bears a fruit much eaten by the peaſants, and which has no ill taſte.</p>
            <p>It being now the ſeaſon of the Turkiſh <hi>Ramadan,</hi> or Lent, and all here profeſſing, at leaſt, the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan religion, they faſt till the going down of the ſun and ſpend the night in feaſting. We ſaw under the trees, companies of the country people, eating, ſinging and dancing to their wild muſick. They are not quite black, but all mulattoes, and the moſt frightful creatures that can appear in a human figure. They are almoſt naked, only wearing a piece of coarſe ſerge wrapped about them.—But the women have their arms to their very ſhoulders and their necks and faces adorn'd with flowers, ſtars, and various ſorts of figures impreſs'd by gun-powder, a conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to their natural deformity, which is, however, eſteemed very ornamental amongſt them; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſuffer a good deal of pain by it.</p>
            <p>About ſix miles from Tunis we ſaw the remains of that noble aqueduct, which carried the water to Carthage, over ſeveral high mountains, the length of forty miles. There are ſtill many arches entire. We ſpent two hours viewing it with great attention, and Mr. W—y aſſured me, that of Rome is very much inferior to it. The ſtones are of a prodigious ſize, and yet all poliſh'd and ſo exactly fitted to each other, very little cement has been made uſe of to join them. Yet they may probably ſtand a thouſand years
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:041644_0189_101AD2FBD22E5BA0"/>
longer, if art is not made uſe of to pull them down. Soon after day-break I arrived at Tunis, a town fairly built of very white ſtone, but quite without gardens, which, they ſay, were all deſtroyed when the Turks firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ok it, none having been planted ſince. The dry ſand gives a very diſagreeable proſpect to the eye, and the want of ſhade contributing to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat of the climate, renders it ſo exceſſive, that I have much to do to ſupport it. 'Tis true, here is every noon the refreſhment of the ſea-breeze, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it would be impoſſible to live; but no freſh water, but what is preſerved in the ciſterns, of the rains that fall in the month of September. The women of the town go veiled from head to foot under a black crape, and being mix'd with a breed of renegadoes are ſaid to be many of them fair and handſome. This city was beſieg'd in 1270 by LEWIS king of France, who died, under the walls of it, of a peſtilential fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. After his death PHILIP, his ſon, and our prince EDWARD, ſon of Henry the IIId, raiſed the ſiege on honourable terms. It remained under its natural Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can kings, till betrayed into the hands of BARBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROSSA, admiral of SOLYMAN the Magnificent. The Emperor Charles V. expelled Barbaroſſa, but it was recovered by the Turk under the conduct of <hi>Sinan Baſſa,</hi> in the reign of SELIM II. From that time till now, it has remained tributary to the Grand Signior, governed by a Bey, who ſuffers the name of ſubject to the Turk, but has renounced the ſubjection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolute and very ſeldom paying any tribute. The great city of Bagdat is, at this time, in the ſame circumſtances; and the Grand Signior connives at the loſs of theſe dominions for fear of loſing even the titles of them.</p>

I went very early yeſterday morning (after one night's repoſe) to ſee the ruins of <hi>Carthage.</hi>—I was however half broiled in the ſun, and overjoyed to be led into one of the ſubterranean apartments, which they called the <hi>ſtables of the Elephants,</hi> but which I cannot believe were ever deſign'd for that uſe. I found in many of them broken pieces of columns of fine marble, and ſome of porphyry. I cannot think any body would take the inſignificant pains of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thither, and I cannot imagine ſuch fine pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were deſign'd for the uſe of ſtables. I am apt to believe they were ſummer apartments under their palaces, which the heat of the climate render'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. They are now uſed as granaries by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people. While I ſat here, from the town of <hi>Tents</hi> not far off many of the women flocked in to ſee me, and we were equally entertain'd with viewing one another. Their poſture in ſitting, the colour of their ſkin, their lank black hair falling on each ſide their faces, their features and the ſhape of their limbs, differ ſo little from their country-people the baboons, 'tis hard to fancy them a diſtinct race; I could not help thinking there had been ſome ancient alliances between them.</p>
            <p>When I was a little refreſh'd by reſt, and ſome milk and exquiſite fruit they brought me, I went up the little hill where once ſtood the caſtle of <hi>Byrſa,</hi> and from thence I had a diſtinct view of the ſituation of the famous city of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which ſtood on an iſthmus, the ſea coming on each ſide of it. 'Tis now a marſhy ground on one ſide, where there are ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds. STRABO calls Carthage forty miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. There are now no remains of it, but what I have deſcrib'd; and the hiſtory of it is too well known to want any abridgment of it. You ſee,

            <p>I BEG your pardon, my dear ſiſter, that I did not write to you from <hi>Tunis,</hi> the only opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity I have had, ſince I left Conſtantinople. But the heat there was ſo exceſſive, and the light ſo bad for the ſight, I was half blind by writing one letter to the Abbot—, and durſt not go to write many others, I had deſign'd; nor indeed could I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained you very well out of that barbarous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I am now ſurrounded with ſubjects of pleaſure, and ſo much charmed with the beauties of Italy, that I ſhould think it a kind of ingratitude not to offer a little praiſe in return for the diverſion I have had here.—I am in the houſe of Mrs. <hi>D'Avenant</hi> at St. <hi>Pierre d' Arena,</hi> and ſhould be very unjuſt not to allow her a ſhare of that praiſe I ſpeak of, ſince her good humour and good company have very much contributed to render this place agreeable to me.</p>

               <hi>Genoa</hi> is ſituated in a very fine bay, and being built on a riſing hill intermixed with gardens, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the moſt excellent architecture, gives a very fine proſpect off at ſea; though it loſt much of its beauty in my eyes, having been accuſtomed to that of Conſtantinople. The Genoeſe were once maſters of ſeveral iſlands in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and all that part of Conſtantinople which is now called Galata. Their betraying the Chriſtian cauſe, by facilitating the taking of Conſtantinople by the Turk, deſerv'd what has ſince happened to them, even the loſs of all their conqueſts on that ſide, to thoſe Infidels. They are at preſent far from rich, and are deſpiſed by the French ſince their Doge was forced by the late King to go in perſon to Paris, to aſk pardon for ſuch a trifle as the arms of France over the houſe of the Envoy, being ſpatter'd with dung in the night. This, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was done by ſome of the Spaniſh faction, which ſtill makes up the majority here, though they dare not openly declare it. The ladies affect the French habit, and are more genteel than thoſe they imitate. I do not doubt but the cuſtom of <hi>Cizisbeis</hi> has very much improved their airs. I know not whether you ever heard of thoſe animals. Upon my word, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but my own eyes could have convinced me there were any ſuch upon earth. The faſhion begun here, and is now received all over Italy, where the husbands are not ſuch terrible creatures as we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them. There are none among them ſuch brutes, as to pretend to find fault with a cuſtom ſo well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo politically founded, ſince I am aſſured that it was an expedient, firſt found out by the Senate, to put an end to thoſe family hatreds, which tore their ſtate to pieces, and to find employment for thoſe young men, who were forced to cut one another's
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:041644_0193_101AD305A0F3A370"/>
throats, <hi>pour paſſer le temps;</hi> and it has ſucceeded ſo well, that ſince the introduction of <hi>Cizisbey,</hi> there has been nothing but peace and good humour amongſt them. Theſe are gentlemen who devote themſelves to the ſervice of a particular lady (I mean a married one, for the Virgins are all inviſible, and confined to Convents:) They are obliged to wait on her to all publick places, ſuch as the plays, opera's and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, (which are called here <hi>Converſations</hi>) where they wait behind her chair, take care of her fan and gloves, if ſhe plays, have the privilege of whiſpers. &amp;c.—When ſhe goes out, they ſerve her inſtead of a <hi>lacquies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> gravely trotting by her chair. 'Tis their buſineſs to prepare for her at preſent againſt any day of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic appearance, not forgetting that of her own name<note n="*" place="bottom">That is, the day of the Saint after whom ſhe is called.</note>; in ſhort, they are to ſpend all their time and money in her ſervice, who rewards them accordingly (for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> have the impudence to ſuppoſe this any other than pure Platonick friendſhip. 'Tis true, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give her a <hi>Cizisbei</hi> of their own chooſing; but when the lady happens not to be of the ſame taſte, as that often happens, ſhe never fails to bring it about to have one of her own fancy. In former times, one beauty uſed to have eight or ten of theſe humble admirers; but thoſe days of plenty and humility are no more. Men grow more ſcarce and ſaucy, and every lady is forced to content herſelf with one at a time.</p>
            <p>You may ſee in this place the <hi>glorious liberty</hi> of a Republick, or, more properly, an Ariſtocracy, the common people being here as arrant ſlaves as the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:041644_0194_101AD30724954BA0"/>
French; but the old nobles pay little reſpect to the DOGE, who is but two years in his office, and whoſe wife, at that very time, aſſumes no rank above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble lady. 'Tis true, the family of <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> (that great man who reſtor'd them that liberty they enjoy) have ſome particular privileges. When the Senate found it neceſſary to put a ſtop to the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury of dreſs, forbidding the wearing of jewels and brocades, they left them at liberty to make what expence they pleaſed. I look with great pleaſure on the ſtatue of that hero, which is in the court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the houſe of duke <hi>Doria.</hi> This puts me in mind of their palaces, which I can never deſcribe as I ought.—Is it not enough that I ſay, they are moſt of them, the deſign of PALLADIO? The ſtreet call'd <hi>Strada Novo,</hi> is perhaps the moſt beautiful line of buildings in the world. I muſt particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the vaſt palaces of <hi>Durazzo,</hi> thoſe of the two <hi>Balbi,</hi> joined together by a magnificent colonade, that of the <hi>Imperiale</hi> at this village of St. <hi>Pierred' Arena,</hi> and another of the Doria. The perfection of archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, and the utmoſt profuſion of rich furniture are to be ſeen here, diſpoſed with the moſt elegant taſte, and laviſh magnificence. But I am charmed with nothing ſo much as the collection of pictures by the pencils of <hi>Raphael, Paulo Veroneſe, Titian, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racci, Michael Angelo, Guido</hi> and <hi>Correggio,</hi> which two I mention laſt as my particular favourites. I own, I can find no pleaſure in objects of horror; and, in my opinion, the more naturally a crucifix is repreſented, the more diſagreeable it is. Theſe my beloved paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhew nature, and ſhew it in the moſt charming light. I was particularly pleaſed with a <hi>Lucretia</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Balbi;</hi> the expreſſive beauty of that face and boſom; gives all the paſſion of pity and
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:041644_0195_101AD308A68023E0"/>
admiration, that could be raiſed in the ſoul, by the fineſt poem on that ſubject. A <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> of the ſame hand, deſerves to be mentioned; and I ſhould ſay more of her, if Lucretia had not firſt engaged my eyes.—Here are alſo ſome ineſtimable ancient buſto's—The Church of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> is built of black and white marble, where is kept that famous plate of a ſingle emerald, which is not now permitted to be handled, ſince a plot, which, they ſay, was diſcover'd to throw it on the pavement and break it; a childiſh piece of malice, which they aſcribe to the King of Sicily, to be revenged for their refuſing to fell it to him. The church of the <hi>Annunciation</hi> is finely lined with marble; the pillars are of red and white marble: that of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> has been very much adorn'd by the Jeſuits; but I confeſs all the churches appeared ſo mean to me, after that of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> I can hardly do them the honour of writing down their names. But I hope you will own, I have made good uſe of my time, in ſeeing ſo much, ſince 'tis not many days that we have been out of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine, from which no body is exempted, coming from the Levant. Ours, indeed, was very much ſhortened, and very agreeably paſs'd in Mrs. <hi>D' Avenant's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in the village of St. <hi>Pierre Lárene,</hi> about a mile from Genoa, in a houſe built by Palladio, ſo well deſigned, and ſo nobly proportioned, 'twas a pleaſure to walk in it. We were viſited here only by a few Engliſh, in the company of a noble Genoeſe, commiſſioned to ſee we did not touch one another.—I ſhall ſtay here ſome days longer, and could almoſt wiſh it were for all my life; but mine, I fear, is not deſtin'd to ſo much tranquility.</p>

            <p>I CAME in two days, from Genoa, through fine roads to this place. I have already ſeen what is ſhew'd to ſtrangers in the town, which indeed is not worth a very particular deſcription; and I have not reſpect enough for the holy handkerchief, to ſpeak long of it. The churches are handſome, and ſo is the King's palace; but I have lately ſeen ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of architecture, I did not give much of my attention to theſe pieces. The town itſelf is fairly built, ſituated in a fine plain on the banks of the <hi>Po.</hi> At a little diſtance from it, we ſaw the palaces of <hi>La Venerie,</hi> and <hi>La Valentin,</hi> both very agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats.—We were lodg'd in the <hi>Piazza Royale,</hi> which is one of the nobleſt ſquares I ever ſaw, with a fine portico of white ſtone quite round it. We were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately viſited by the <hi>Chevalier</hi>—, whom you knew in England, who with great civility, begg'd to introduce us at court, which is now kept at <hi>Rivoli,</hi> about a league from Turin. I went thither yeſterday, and had the honour of waiting on the Queen, being preſented to her by her firſt lady of honour. I found her Majeſty in a magnificent apartment, with a train of handſome ladies all dreſs'd in gowns, amongſt which it was eaſy to diſtinguiſh the fair Princeſs of Carignan. The Queen entertain'd me with a world of ſweetneſs and affability, and ſeemed miſtreſs of a great ſhare of good ſenſe. She did not forget to put me in mind of her Engliſh blood; and added, that

ſhe always felt in herſelf a particular inclination to love the Engliſh. I returned her civility, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her the title of Majeſty, as often as I could, which perhaps ſhe will not have the comfort of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many months longer.—The King has a great deal of vivacity in his eyes; and the young Prince of Piedmont, is a very handſome young man; but the great devotion, which this court is, at preſent, fallen into, does not permit any of thoſe entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper for his age. Proceſſions and maſſes are all the magnificence in faſhion here; and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry is ſo criminal, that the poor Count of—, who was our acquaintance at London, is very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſgraced, for ſome ſmall overtures he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to make to a maid of honour. I intend to ſet out to-morrow, and to paſs thoſe dreadful Alps, ſo much talked of.—If I come to the bottom, you ſhall hear of me.</p>

            <p>I REGEIVED, at my arrival here, both your obliging letters, and alſo letters from many of my other friends, deſign'd to Conſtantinople, and ſent me from Marſeilles hither; our merchant there, knowing we were upon our return. I am ſurpriſed to hear my ſiſter—has left England. I ſuppoſe

what I wrote to her from Turin will be loſt, and where to direct I know not, having no account of her affairs from her own hand. For my own part, I am confin'd to my chamber, having kept my bed till yeſterday, ever ſince the 17th, that I came to this town, where I have had ſo terrible a fever, I believ'd for ſome time, that all my journies were ended here; and I do not at all wonder that ſuch fatigues as I have paſſed, ſhould have ſuch an effect. The firſt day's journey from Turin to <hi>Novaleſſe,</hi> is through a very fine country, beautifully planted and enrich'd by art and nature. The next day we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſcend mount <hi>Cenis,</hi> being carried in little ſeats of twiſted offers, fixed upon poles, upon mens ſhoulders; our chaiſes taken to pieces and laid upon mules.</p>
            <p>The prodigious proſpect of mountains covered with eternal ſnow, of clouds hanging far below our feet, and of vaſt caſcades tumbling down the rocks with a confuſed roaring, would have been entertaining to me, if I had ſuffer'd leſs from the extreme cold that reigns here. But the miſty rain which fall perpetually, penetrated even the thick fur I was wrapped in; and I was half dead with cold before we got to the foot of the mountain, which was not till two hours after dark. This hill has a ſpacious plain on the top of it, and a fine lake there; but the deſcent is ſo ſteep and ſlippery, 'tis ſurpriſing to ſee theſe chairmen go ſo ſteadily as they do. Yet I was not half ſo much afraid of breaking my neck, as I was of falling ſick, and the event has ſhew'd, that I plac'd my fears right.</p>
            <p>The other mountains are now all paſſable for a chaiſe, and very fruitful in vines and paſtures. Amongſt them is a breed of the fineſt goats in the

The ſame night we arrived late at this town, where I have had nothing to do but to take care of my health. I think myſelf already out of any danger, and am determin'd, that the ſore throat, which ſtill remains, ſhall not confine me long. I am impatient to ſee the curioſities of this famous city, and more impatient to continue my journey to Paris, from whence I hope to write to you a more diverting letter than 'tis poſſible for me to do now, with a mind weaken'd by ſickneſs, a head muddled with ſpleen, from a ſorry inn, and a chamber cramm'd with mortifying objects of apothecaries viols and bottles.</p>

If their King had intended to expreſs in one image, <hi>ignorance, ill taſte, and vanity,</hi> his ſculptors could have made no other figures ſo proper for that purpoſe, as this ſtatue, which repreſents the odd mixture of an old <hi>beau,</hi> who had a mind to be a <hi>hero,</hi> with a buſhel of curl'd hair on his head, and a gilt trunchion in his hand.—The French have been ſo voluminous on the hiſtory of this town, I need ſay nothing of it.

            <p>I CANNOT give my dear Lady R—, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proof of the pleaſure I have in writing to her, than chooſing to do it in this ſeat of various amuſements, where I am, <hi>accableed</hi> with viſits, and thoſe ſo full of vivacity and compliments, that 'tis full employment enough to hearken,. whether on anſwers or not. The French Ambaſſadreſs at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, has a very conſiderable and numerous family here, who all come to ſee me, and are never weary of making enquiries. The air of Paris has already had a good effect on me; for I was never in better health, though I have been extreme ill, all the road from Lyons to this place. You may judge how agreeable the journey has been to me; which did not want the addition to make me diſlike it. I think nothing ſo terrible as objects of miſery, except one had the God like attribute of being capable to redreſs them; and all the country villages of France ſhew nothing elſe. While the poſt-horſes are changed, the whole town comes out to beg, with ſuch miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtarv'd faces, and thin tattered clothes, they need <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The apartments of the royal family are very large, and richly gilt; but I ſaw nothing in the architecture or painting worth

remembring. The long gallery, built by Henry IV. has proſpects of all the King's houſes. Its walls are deſign'd after the taſte of thoſe times, but appear now very mean. The park is, indeed, finely wooded and watered, the trees well grown and planted, and in the fiſh-ponds are kept tame carp, ſaid to be, ſome of them, eighty years of age. The late King paſſed ſome months every year at this ſeat; and all the rocks, round it, by the pious ſentences inſcribed on them, ſhew the devotion in faſhion at his court, which I believe died with him; at leaſt I ſee no exterior marks of it at Paris, where all people's thoughts ſeem to be on preſent diverſion.</p>
            <p>The fair of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> is now in ſeaſon. You may be ſure I have been carried thither, and think it much better diſpos'd than ours of Bartholomew. The ſhops being all ſet in rows ſo regularly, and well lighted, they made up a very agreeable ſpectacle. But I was not at all ſatisfied with the <hi>Groſſierte</hi> of their Harlequin, no more than with their muſic at the opera, which was abominably grating, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed to that of Italy. Their houſe is a booth compared to that of the Hay-Market, and the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe not ſo neat as that of Lincoln's-Inn-fields; but then, it muſt be own'd, to their praiſe, their trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are much beyond any of ours. I ſhould hardly allow Mrs. O—d a better place than to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante to La—. I have ſeen the Tragedy of BAJAZET ſo well repreſented, that I think our beſt actors can only be ſaid to ſpeak, but theſe to feel; and 'tis certainly infinitely more moving to ſee a man appear unhappy than to hear him ſay that he is ſo, with a joyful face and a ſtupid ſmirk in his countenance.—<hi>A propos</hi> of countenances, I muſt tell you ſomething of the French ladies; I have ſeen all

the beauties and ſuch—(I can't help making uſe of the coarſe word) nauſeous creatures! ſo fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically abſurd in their dreſs! ſo monſtrouſly unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in their paints! their hair cut ſhort, and curled round their faces, and ſo loaded with powder, that it makes it look like white wool! and on their cheeks to their chins, unmercifully laid on a ſhining red japan, that gliſtens in a moſt flaming manner, ſo that they ſeem to have no reſemblance to human faces. I am apt to believe that they took the firſt hint of their dreſs, from a fair ſheep newly ruddled. 'Tis with pleaſure I recollect my dear pretty country wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and if I was writing to any body elſe, I ſhould ſay, that theſe groteſque dawbers give me ſtill a higher eſteem of the natural charms of dear Lady R—'s auborne hair, and the lively colours of her unſullied complexion.</p>

            <p>YOU ſee I'm juſt to my word in writing to you from Paris, where I was very much ſurpriſed to meet my ſiſter. I need not add, very much pleaſed. She as little expected to ſee me as I her (having not receiv'd my late letters) and this meeting would ſhine under the hand of <hi>de Scuderie,</hi> but I ſhall not imitate his ſtyle ſo far, as to tell you how often we embrac'd, how ſhe enquir'd by what odd chance I return'd from Conſtantinople? And I anſwer'd her by aſking, what adventure brought her to Paris? To ſhorten the ſtory, all queſtions and anſwers, and exclamations and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being over, we agreed upon running about toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have ſeen <hi>Verſailles, Trianon, Marli</hi> and <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> We had an order for the water to play for our diverſion, and I was followed thither by all the Engliſh at Paris. I own Verſailles appeared to me rather vaſt than beautiful; and, after having ſeen the exact proportions of the Italian buildings, I thought the irregularity of it ſhocking.</p>
            <p>The King's cabinet of antiquities and medals, is, indeed, very richly furniſhed. Amongſt that collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, none pleaſed ſo well as the <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> on a large agate, which is one of the moſt delicate pieces of the kind, that I remember to have ſeen. I obſerv'd ſome ancient ſtatues of great value. But the nauſeous flattery and tawdry pencil of LE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BURN, are equally diſguſting in the gallery. I will not pretend to deſcribe to you the great apartment,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:041644_0208_101AD3268508E8F0"/>
the vaſt variety of fountains; the theatre, the grove of AEſop's fables, &amp;c. all which you may read very amply particularized in ſome of the French authors, that have been paid for theſe deſcriptions. <hi>Trianon,</hi> in its littleneſs, pleaſed me better than Verſailles; <hi>Marli,</hi> better than either of them, and <hi>St. Cloud</hi> beſt of all, having the advantage of the Seine running at the bottom of the gardens, the great caſcade, &amp;c. You may find information in the aforeſaid books, if you have any curioſity to know the exact number of the ſtatues, and how many foot they caſt upon the water.</p>
            <p>We ſaw the King's picture in the magnificent houſe of the Duke D'Antin, who has the care of preſerving them till his Majeſty is of age. There are not many, but of the beſt hands. I looked with great pleaſure on the <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> of RAPHAEL, where the ſentiments of ſuperior beings are as well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as in Milton. You won't forgive me, if I ſay nothing of the <hi>Thuilleries,</hi> much finer than our Mall; and the <hi>Cour,</hi> more agreeable than our <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> the high trees giving ſhade in the hotteſt ſeaſon. At the <hi>Louvre,</hi> I had the opportunity of ſeeing the King accompanied by the Duke Regent. He is tall and well ſhap'd, but has not the air of holding the crown ſo many years as his grandfather. And now I am ſpeaking of the court, I muſt ſay I ſaw nothing in France, that delighted me ſo much as to ſee an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman (at leaſt a Briton) abſolute at Paris; I mean Mr. LAW, who treats their Dukes and Peers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely <hi>"de haut en bas,"</hi> and is treated by them with the utmoſt ſubmiſſion and reſpect.—Poor ſouls!—This reflection on their abject ſlavery, puts me in mind of the <hi>place des victoires;</hi> but I will not take up your time and my own with ſuch deſcriptions, which are too numerous.</p>

In general, I think Paris has the advantage of London in the neat pavement of the ſtreets, and the regular lighting them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at nights, in the proportion of the ſtreets, the houſes being all built of ſtone, and moſt of thoſe belonging to people of quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beautified by gardens.

            <p>I AM willing to take your word for it that I ſhall really oblige you, by letting you know, as ſoon as poſſible, my ſafe paſſage over the water. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived this morning at Dover after being toſſed a whole night in the packet boat in ſo violent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the maſter conſidering the weakneſs of his veſſel, thought it proper to remove the mail, and gave us notice of the danger. We call'd a little fiſhing boat, which could hardly make up to us; while all the people on board us were crying to heaven. 'Tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

to be drown'd, I could not forbear being entertain'd at the double diſtreſs of a fellow-paſſenger. She was an Engliſh lady that I had met at Calais, who deſired me to let her go over with me in my cabin. She had bought a fine point head, which ſhe was contriving to conceal from the cuſtom-houſe officers. When the wind grew high, and our little veſſel crack'd, ſhe fell very heartily to her prayers, and thought wholly of her ſoul. When it ſeem'd to abate, ſhe return'd to the worldly care of her head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and addreſſed herſelf to me—<q>
                  <hi>Dear Madam, will you take care of this point? if it ſhould be loſt!—Ah Lord we ſhall all be loſt! Lord have mercy on my ſoul!—Pray Madam, take care of this head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</hi>
               </q> This eaſy tranſition from her ſoul to her head-dreſs, and the alternate agonies that both gave her, made it hard to determine which ſhe thought of greateſt value. But however, the ſcene was not ſo diverting but I was glad to get rid of it, and be thrown into the little boat, tho' with ſome hazard of breaking my neck. It brought me ſafe hither, and I cannot help looking with partial eyes on my native land. That partiality was certainly given us by nature, to prevent rambling, the effect of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thirſt after knowledge, which we are not formed to enjoy. All we get by it is a fruitleſs deſire of mixing the different pleaſures and conveniences which are given to the different parts of the world, and cannot meet in any one of them. After having read all that is to be found in the languages I am miſtreſs of, and having decayed my ſight by midnight ſtudies, I envy the eaſy peace of mind of a ruddy milk-maid, who undiſturb'd by doubt, hears the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with humility, every Sunday, not having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the ſentiments of natural duty in her head

by the vain enquiries of the ſchools, who may be more learn'd, yet, after all, muſt remain as ignorant. And after having ſeen part of Aſia and Africa, and almoſt made the tour of Europe, I think the honeſt Engliſh ſquire more happy, who verily believes the Greek wines leſs delicious than March beer, that the African fruits have not ſo fine a flavour as golden pippens, that the <hi>Beca figuas</hi> of Italy are not ſo well taſted as a rump of beef, and that in ſhort there is no perfect enjoyment of this life out of Old England. I pray God I may think ſo for the reſt of my life; and ſince I muſt be contented with out ſcanty allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of day-light, that I may forget the enlivening ſun of Conſtantinople.</p>

            <p>I HAVE this minute received a letter of yours ſent me from Paris. I believe and hope I ſhall very ſoon ſee both you and Mr. <hi>Congreve;</hi> but as I am here in an inn, where we ſtay to regulate our march to London, bag and baggage, I ſhall employ ſome of my leiſure time in anſwering that part of yours that ſeems to require an anſwer.</p>
            <p>I muſt applaud your good nature in ſuppoſing that your paſtoral lovers, (vulgarly called Haymakers) would have lived in everlaſting joy and harmony, if the lightning had not interrupted their ſcheme of
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:041644_0212_101AD32D67131128"/>
happineſs. I ſee no reaſon to imagine that <hi>John Hughes</hi> and <hi>Sarah Drew</hi> were either wiſer or more virtuous than their neighbours. That a well-ſet man of twenty-five ſhould have a fancy to marry a brown woman of eighteen, is nothing marvellous; and I cannot help thinking that had they married, their lives would have paſſed in the common track with their fellow-pariſhioners. His endeavouring to ſhield her from a ſtorm was a natural action, and what he would certainly have done for his horſe, if he had been in the ſame ſituation. Neither am I of opinion that their ſudden death was a reward of their mutual virtue. You know the Jews were reprov'd for thinking a village deſtroyed by fire, more wicked than thoſe that had eſcaped the thunder. Time and chance happen to all men. Since you deſire me to try my ſkill in an <hi>epitaph,</hi> I think the following lines perhaps more juſt, tho' not ſo poetical as yours.
