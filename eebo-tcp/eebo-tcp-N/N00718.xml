            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Had the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Libel I</hi> am now to anſwer, been ſo juſt to me and the <hi>World,</hi> as to have ſent their <hi>Names</hi> along with it, it might have ſaved me much, if not all, of this Labour; they having (especially of late) ſo ſignalized themſelves, by divers memorable actions, that hardly any whom fame hath reached with the knowledge thereof, will heſitate in giving them their <hi>Character,</hi> and I think it not a little to my reputation, that mine and theirs are ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And though IOHN TATHAM, THOMAS REVELL and NATH. WEST-LAND did at laſt, when I had ſtaged the <hi>Author</hi>' or <hi>Authors</hi> for Forgery and Falſhood, come forth, and own themſelves the <hi>Authors,</hi> yet their <hi>Libel</hi> being before disperſed without a name, and mighty fall into ſome hands, who were Strangers both to the <hi>things</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> I find it neceſsary to purſue it with this. What induced theſe angry <hi>Counſellours,</hi> to fall upon me in this <hi>Booriſh</hi> manner, at this time, is plain, from the burthen of their <hi>Complaint</hi>; That the <hi>Authority</hi> which they have aſſumed is not <hi>recognized,</hi> which I know is a great vexation to men of their temper and circumſtances, whoſe ambition is to rule, and their leiſure from other employments ſuch, as may be a temptation to them, like <hi>Locuſts</hi> to live upon other Mens labours: To wich I having ſhewn ſome averſion, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fondly take an occaſion to magnifie my <hi>Intereſt</hi> with others, to an exceſſive extream, and make me <hi>Author</hi> of all

Let this ſuffice for an <hi>Introduction,</hi> I ſhall now proceed, to touch upon the ſeverall parts of their <hi>Libel,</hi> as it lyes before me in order, and begin firſt with what they call, and would have the World to believe, to be the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This meſſage was very ungrateful to him, who reſolved (as the conſequence hath ſhewn) to cheat us, in what we eſteemed the beſt part of our bargain; For at that time, the <hi>Soil,</hi> without the <hi>Government,</hi> would have been of no value to the <hi>Purchaſers.</hi> And though before our arrival, he was the great <hi>Complainant,</hi> and threatned high what he would do, if his <hi>Authority</hi> ſhould be diſputed, yet finding now, that it was like to come to that indeed (for ſo were we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, viz. if he refuſed to comply with our juſt demands, to complain againſt him at <hi>White-Hall or Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> as able <hi>Counſell</hi> ſhould adviſe) and fearing nothing more than his, and well knowing, that his Actions could not abide ſo ſevere a <hi>Teſt,</hi> makes it his buſineſs with might and main to prevail with our <hi>Friends,</hi> to uſe their endeavours, to take up this buſineſs, and make a more private end of it, if they could, or at leaſt, to prevent our procedure againſt him in the way we intended. Upon which a propoſall was made, by ſome of the <hi>Perſons,</hi> who were afterwards <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators</hi>; That we would ſubmit the <hi>Controverſy,</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of a certain number of <hi>Perſons,</hi> to be equally choſen. To wich we replyed, we had no ſuch power nor direction from our <hi>Principals,</hi> but were it ſo it had affected us only, we ſhould chearfully do it. They urged ſome reaſons, which I ſhall here omit to give, why it was not then a proper time to Proſecute ſuch an affair, in the way we intended; But if it was not in our power, to ſubmit

            <p>Here I charge my <hi>Adverſaries</hi> with downright FORGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY and FALSHOOD, there being no ſuch words in the whole <hi>Award</hi>; as <hi>betraying of truſt,</hi> of which they ſeemed ſo fond, ſuiting their malicious deſign ſo well, that to give it the greater <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> they put it in Capitall Letters; But being now discovered, and their Forgery detected, ſerves only to render them Capitall in malice and abuſe: Nor doth it excuſe them to ſay, as in one of their Papers they do,
<q>That not any thing is couched in the ſaid Printed Award; no not even that noted reflection upon <hi>Samuel</hi> in Capital letters, but what we will prove to be true, when occaſion ſhall require &amp;c.</q>
But this is ſtill to do, and this I leave as a task upon them to perform, when they ſhall think the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requireth. I am glad I am ſo much before hand with them, having Proved my charge againſt them before ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall credible Witneſſes, who for their private ſatisfaction, have compared what they have Printed, with the true <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and (I believe) will not refuſe to give evidence, to the truth of what I here aſſert, if it be deſired; and I do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by further promiſe, to give the like ſatisfaction, to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ſhall ſoberly requeſt it. But, ſay they,
<q>The <hi>Award</hi> now Publiſhed,—as received from their [the <hi>Awarders</hi>] hands, ſo was tranſmitted hither for information, and is by us made publick, for the ſame end, without the leaſt variati—on. And is it more reaſonable to relie upon his vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000865_0007_0FABF3512F1EBE80"/>
in this matter, than the worth and reputation of thoſe honourable <hi>Gentleman</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that ſent it hither verbatim as We have Publiſhed it &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thereby implying as if the <hi>Award</hi> they have Printed is of equal force and validity with the other. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Theirs can be but a <hi>Copy,</hi> as appears by its date, being four daies after the <hi>Originals</hi> were delivered into the hands of the <hi>Parties</hi> concerned, and therefore not of equal credit with the <hi>Original</hi>: But my buſineſs is not to conſider what it is, nor how they come by it; my complaint and charge is That they have Printed and publiſhed to the World, in the name of eight of my Friends, a thing called their <hi>Award,</hi> with <hi>divers Additions, Omiſſions and Variations,</hi> and that <hi>in divers of the moſt conſiderable paſſages in it,</hi> tending greatly to ſlander and reproach me. and this I call <hi>Forgery and Falſhood,</hi> and ſhall leave it upon them, till they can more fairly throw it of, than yet they have done.</p>
            <p>And again in page 3, where they ſay:
<q>Theſe we judge Irregular proceedings, unfair and unwarrantable, unſafe and worthy of Blame in <hi>S. Jenings</hi> and all Perſons concerned therein.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is no mention made of <hi>S. Jenings,</hi> nor any blame laid upon him, but in conjunction with the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> who are Blamed for chuſing, and he for accepting their choice of him for <hi>Governour.</hi> But I am glad of this oppretunity, to clear that point, which I doubt not to do, to the ſatisfaction of any indifferent perſon; and to acquit my ſelf, and the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> too, from any juſt blame upon that occaſion.</p>
            <p>But here I expect to meet with an <hi>Objection,</hi> viz. But why then did your <hi>Friends</hi> blame you in their <hi>Award,</hi> and were not they <hi>Divinely</hi> inſpired in what they did? I anſwer; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find my <hi>Adverſaries</hi> harp ſo much upon that, and make ſuch a perverſe, or rather malicious uſe of it; I put it upon them to prove, when ever our <hi>Friends</hi> have placed their Conduct in <hi>Civil</hi> affairs, ſo high; No, we can very well admitt of different ſentiments in thoſe things, without any braech of <hi>Religious</hi> union; and this being partly a <hi>Law-caſe,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:000865_0008_0FABF351F086DDE8"/>
upon which the judgement of theſe <hi>Friends</hi> was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is not utterly impoſſible, but they might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what miſtaken in it: However, it ſhould have lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht for me, had not I thus unexpectedly, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly been aſſaulted afreſh, and recriminated by the Award. But to meet with this from any <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Weſt-Jerſey,</hi> that would be thought to be tender of her <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> for the ſake of which I ſuffered what I did, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them, is very ſtrange; eſpecially conſidering how much I was importuned, and in a ſence forced, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Peace of the <hi>Province,</hi> into a compliance; which I ſhould think, cannot be forgotten by one of my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi> at leaſt, who had not the leaſt ſhare, in advis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was done; from whom I did not expect ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, for former kindneſſes ſhewed him, by me and others: Who in the time of his neceſſity, enjoyed all the places of profit, that he was capable of in the Government, by the favour of thoſe, over whom he hath ſince made his inſults; by which means, he hath juſtly drawn upon himſelf, the hatefull <hi>Epithet</hi> of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> a thing common to men of his temper, which having branded him with, at preſent I ſhall leave him.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, you may perceive by the <hi>Award,</hi> that the <hi>Agents</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> did alledge when in <hi>England,</hi>
               <q>That they accepted <hi>E. Billing</hi> as Governour <hi>only in Truſt,</hi> in order to have him aſſign his Power and Government to the People.</q>
Which is all very true and reaſonable; for it was to ſuch People, as had before bought and paid for it, and <hi>E- Billing</hi> himſelf, when he Firſt obtained the grant from the <hi>Duke,</hi> endeavoured to make us believe, <hi>that he received it but in truſt, and would uſe it no otherwiſe,</hi> and excuſes thae taking it in his own name, alledging, <hi>It muſt he in a ſingle perſon, and he could not obtain it otherwiſe</hi> Which there was no reaſon to do, had he not been conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf, that the right of it did appertain to others. And <hi>William Penn,</hi> one of <hi>E. Billings</hi> Truſtees, of whom we bought, and well knew the Rights of the People, whoſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000865_0009_0FABF352B603AEB8"/>
Intereſt was the great means of obtaining the Grant of the <hi>Duke,</hi> alwaies declared; <hi>that he ſolicited for it in the name of the People, that they might be able to make good what they had ſold them.</hi> And <hi>Sir William Jones,</hi> on whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the <hi>Duke</hi> much relied, gave it as his opinion, <hi>that the Right belonged to the People</hi>; Upon which the <hi>Duke</hi> Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered, <hi>That a Second Grant ſhould be given</hi>; The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent being only to confirm but not to deſtroy the former. And laſtly, than which nothing can be more clear; The Second Grant, by which the powers of Government were more clearly granted to <hi>Billing,</hi> was never propoſed to be ſought for, but at the requeſt and charge of the <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>; For, ſaies <hi>Billing</hi> and ſome of his Truſtees in a le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>er now in my hands, <hi>it will coſt much money to obtain it, and when gotten, you ſhall have the benefit of it.</hi> This I think is enough to ſay for proof of this Point, though I could ſay a great deal more, but ſhall uſe what brevity the caſe will bear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Billing</hi> having thus obtained the grant as aforesaid, ſends over a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to ſeverall perſons, in which I was firſt named, and in caſe of mortality, the reſt to ſucceed in their order as <hi>Deputy Governours:</hi> Now to ſhew with what caution this was accepted, and no otherwiſe, but vvith a <hi>ſaving our Right,</hi> the <hi>Records</hi> of the firſt <hi>Generall Aſſembly</hi> held in <hi>Weſt-Jerſey</hi> will ſhew. But before that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> was called, I knowing it to be againſt the Rights of the People, for him to grant <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> and aſſume the place of a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> I called together as many as I could, of the moſt antient and conſiderable of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> here, as ſoon as I had received the <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and freely gave my ſenſe of it, and told them; <hi>my reſolution was, never to impoſe it on them nor make any uſe of it, except they apprehended, it might be of ſervice to them:</hi> Upon which the thing was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, debated, and at laſt concluded, <hi>that it was better, not wholly to reject the</hi> Commiſſion; <hi>but to accept it as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, that ſome face of</hi> Authority <hi>might be kept up, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the confuſions of an</hi> Anarchy. Some are yet alive, to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000865_0010_0FABF3536D9CDD58"/>
affirm to the truth of this, though moſt of our antient <hi>Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,</hi> are by death or otherwiſe removed. But beſides all this, when <hi>Billing</hi> ſent his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> he ſent a long Letter with it, in which are contained the <hi>Apologies</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, declaring, <hi>It was his intent ſuddainly to come, and ſettle the affair, to thae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hearts content of all concerned</hi>; and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ack all this, a Ship was then newly arived, in which were Paſſengers, <hi>William Biddle, Elias Farr and Benjamin Scott,</hi> with divers others, but theſe I mention as of moſt note, and intimate with <hi>Billing,</hi> who declared, it as their ſenſe; <hi>That he would he as good as his word, and that he was put upon a neceſſity, of accepting the Grant as he did, and that it was requiſite his Commiſſion ſhould be accepted for the time, till his arrival, which they judged would he ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Thus I have ſhown the manner and reaſons of accepting that <hi>Commiſſion</hi> which I think makes it evident enough, to be but <hi>in truſt</hi>; I come now to ſhew our reaſons for reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Billing,</hi> by this ſoft and crafty dealing with us, had drawn us on to recognize his <hi>Authority</hi> (which he thought had been without condition or teſerve, for kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing him to be hot-headed and raſh as well as Indigent, we gave him no notice of it, leaſt in a Frenzie he ſhould Sell the Government, and ſo make it more troubleſome to us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; but expecting of him here, thought We might beſt deal with him upon the place) he now begins to treat us in other terms, and to let us know, <hi>he did not intend to part with the Gouvernment</hi>; Of which We complaining to him, of his diſhoneſty to us; in his next he tells us, <hi>That it was as much as our necks and eſtates were worth, to aſſume</hi> (what he before had owned to be) <hi>our Right.</hi> This opened the eyes of all, undeceived thoſe that aforetime had been beſt opinionated of him, and the next <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> when Sett, did generally declare, <hi>They would no longer ſubmit to his Authority,</hi> but immediately aſſert their own right, and chuſe their <hi>Governour</hi> themſelves: Which they did; pitching upon me. How unwillingly I yeilded to ſerve them
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000865_0011_0FABF354593B6D48"/>
in that <hi>ſtation,</hi> ſeveral then preſent cannot have forgotten; although I was ſatisfied of the Juſtice and equality of the thing, and that it was no evil in it ſelf, yet it might carry another aſpect, with thoſe who had only heard a ſuperficial account of it.</p>
            <p>I have now ſhown, why we received, and why We rejected <hi>Edw. Billings</hi> Commiſſion; the next is to inquire, how far We (viz the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> and my ſelf) are criminal for it: But eſpecially my ſelf, who (by the forgery of my <hi>Adverſaries</hi>) am repreſented to the World as <hi>a Betrayer of my truſt</hi> to <hi>Billing</hi>; To do which, in common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it muſt be preſuppoſed, that I acepted a <hi>truſt</hi> from him, which I deny ever to have done; for what I did in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> was to ſerve the <hi>Country,</hi> and at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, as I have before ſhewn; nor had I any reaſon to do it for his ſake; who was much a Stranger to me, and from whom I never received any reward for it, and to be yet more plain; the Infamy that he was under was ſuch, that to ſerve him, would have been a blemiſh upon my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet there was a neceſſity that We ſhould acknowledge, that the Government was in him, though but <hi>in truſt,</hi> elſe how could We expect, that he ſhould reconvey it to the <hi>Purchaſers,</hi> as by ſolemn engagements bound. So that upon the whole, the <hi>truſt</hi> was in <hi>Billing,</hi> and not in me, and it was he that <hi>betrayed his truſt,</hi> and not I; nor can I ſee, how any blame is juſtly chargeable upon me, or that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> that renounced his <hi>Authority</hi>; ſeeing to have done otherwiſe, had been to ſtrengthen him in his Injuſtice to the <hi>Province,</hi> or rather to have made our ſelves Parties with him, againſt our own Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And now I have done with this part, wherein I have been ſo plain and candid, as I hope wil ſatisfie the Impartial, and for others, I regard not their clamour.</p>
            <p>And whereas the <hi>Award</hi> ſaies,
<q>And <hi>S. Jenings</hi> as his [<hi>E. Billings] Deputy</hi> engaging to ſerve him, and preſerve his intereſt in that capacity &amp;c.</q>
I anſwer, I know of no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of that kind, that was ever put upon me, and if
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000865_0012_0FABF355060590A0"/>
any ſuch expreſſion did fall from my Pen, in a private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Billing</hi>; it was, before it was diſcovered, that he intended to ſet up a corrupt Intereſt, in oppoſition to the juſt Rights of the People: For at the time he made large prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, <hi>That he would promote no other Intereſt than that</hi> of <hi>the Common-waelt</hi>; Which had he ſtuck to, I ſhould have ſerved him in it: But can any body believe, I was quite ſo ſensleſs or proſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igate, as to engage to ſerve any Intereſt that he ſhould promote, without any regard to the Juſtice of it; I hope not: But the controverting of this point for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, gave occaſion to an Ingenious Friend of mine to ſay:
<q>
                  <l>He that will Judge aright, moſt know as well,</l>
                  <l>As things, the times wherein each thing befell.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I intend to touch upon one thing more in that <hi>Sham A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> that my <hi>Adverſaries</hi> have Printed, and ſo to leave it. It relates to the ſecond Paragraph of the <hi>Award,</hi> page the 3d., at the cloſe of which they note in the name of I know not who, that
<q>Whence (I ſuppoſe it ſhould be whereas) this ſentence above cited was haſtily razed out of the <hi>Original</hi> the 11 of 8 mo. 1684. 'Tis, our judgement that it were better and more clear to be incerted. The Sentence is this. Neither do We underſtand that ſuch a grant as was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was attainable, when the 2d. grant was ſolicited for.</q>
The deſign of incerting this is eaſily ſeen, to be to cover <hi>Billings</hi> head, from a ſtroke that otherwiſe would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>evita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have fallen upon him: For, knowing that the Right of the thing ſought for belonged to the People, which alſo is acknowledged in the <hi>Award,</hi> page the 2d. and 4th.; it could not but look ill in him, ſo much as to take it in his own name, if it could have been otherwiſe obtained: But whoſe judgement it is, that <hi>it were better and more clear, that that Sentence ſhould be inſerted,</hi> I know not; for they have placed it under, and after the names of the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and I would hope, that it is none of their act, nor have I any reaſon to believe it to be ſo, ſince I am ſure, there is nothing of it in that they delivered to me, and I am not willing to entertain a thought, that after the time

<q>That by the <hi>Award</hi> of thoſe eminent <hi>Quakers</hi> (as he in ſcornfully calls them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the Government was in <hi>Billing,</hi> and not in the People of <hi>Weſt-Jarſey.</hi>
               </q>
This is true, but the matter is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo much, in whom it was, as in whom it ought to be: And this was the ground of our complaint againſt him, that he had abuſed us, in taking it to himſelf, and detaining it from us. But I muſt deſire this <hi>Obſervator</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obſerve, That though they did acknowledge it was in him, yet not right fully, and therefore they enjoyn him
<q>To go ſo far as he is able, and lawfully can do to their (viz the <hi>Proprietors</hi>) juſt ſatisfaction.</q>
See <hi>The Caſe put</hi> &amp;c. Page the 4th. And they give reaſons for it, and great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ones too, as in the firſt Paragraph page the 2d. viz
<q>That <hi>E. Billing</hi> hath, by conceſſions, ſigned by himſelf, with other words and circumſtances, as alſo by Letters Written by <hi>Gawen Lowry, Nicholas Lucas &amp;c.</hi> to the <hi>Proprietors,</hi> given them ground to expect that they ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000865_0014_0FABF35B42724820"/>
have and had the Government with the Soyl.</q>
Here I confeſs <hi>Billing</hi> hath been too hard for us; for had We only given him an expectation on the conſideration; as he did us of the Purchaſe, We had been of equall terms with him; and why not as much reaſon for the one, as the other. But to return. The firſt reaſon the <hi>Arbitrators</hi> aſſign for his doing as aforeſaid, is, becauſe of the <hi>Conceſſions</hi> made and <hi>Signed by him ſelf,</hi> which were made the bait to catch buyers, and I believe few purchaſed before they had ſeen them; which conceſſions lodged the whole power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Generall Aſſembly,</hi> and were to be ſo inviolably obſerved, <hi>that whoever ſhoud but attempt to break them, was to be deemed an Enemy to the peace and Priviledges of the</hi> Province: yea, ſo ſacred were they eſteemed, <hi>that if any refuſed to ſign them, they were not to be admitted to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of any Land, though before bought and paid for.</hi> Secondly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thus it is evident, that theſe <hi>Awarders</hi> did grant, That though the Legal part of the Government was in <hi>Billing</hi>; yet, as they ſuppoſed, the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part belonged to us, And though they ſeemed to doubt, whether he could legally and ſafely perform, to a Punctil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, all that he had given us an expectation of, <q>yet (ſay they) We all agree, that he is thereby bound to perform to the <hi>Proprietors,</hi> ſo far as he legally and ſafely may do.

But</hi> (ſay they) the <hi>Act relates to trade, and not to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But I muſt tell them, That what belongs to the conſtitution of a <hi>Governour,</hi> muſt needs very ſenſibly affect the Government, if the having a well qualified <hi>Governour,</hi> be any advantage to a Government, or if to have an ill one, be the contrary. And farther, I think it looks a little unhandſome, if not disloyal, for them to ſuggeſt, That the <hi>King</hi> regards the advantages of trade more than the weal of his ſubjects; For as Parents value their Children above their Inheritances, or Worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſo we ought to beleive, that the <hi>King</hi> as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all his ſubjects, in a Political ſenſe, more regards their well being, than all the advantages of trade. Why ſhould we not then thankfully embrace the <hi>Kings</hi> bounty to us, who will himſelf be ſatisfied, who, or what they are, that are ſo poſted, and not ſuffer every little fellow, to make his Inſults over his Subjects And I ſtill hold my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That if any ſhall attempt it, it is moſt lawfull, and loyal for the People not to ſubmit to their <hi>Authority</hi> who pretend to any ſo high as that of a <hi>Governour,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by their <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> when legally met together; in whom reſides a conſiderable ſhare of the neceſſary powers of Government, and who muſt act along with him, if any thing in <hi>Legislation</hi> be acted.
