            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This God doth not, has not been wont to do ſpeedily; He has ever taken a Conſiderable time to do it in. The Poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> before the Flood, in which the Line of the Church continued, were grown Extraordinarily Sinful and Degenerate: Thus we read, Gen. 6. 5. <hi>And God ſaw the Iniquity of Man was great in the Earth;</hi> Yet the Controverſy God pleaded with them laſted no leſs than One hundred and Twenty years, <hi>v.</hi> 3.

And doth not this courſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſerve to illuſtrate the Covenant, Grace and Mercy of God to his People? He delights in Mercy, and is the inexhauſtible fountain of Grace and Goodneſs: His Grace and Mercy are Eſſential Properties of his Nature, and no ſmall part of the Letters of his Name. The long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and patience God expreſſeth towards his People, whilſt he is pleading his Controverſy with them, do abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate him to be Merciful and full of Compaſſion. It is indeed a part of his Covenant to viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions with a rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes: But yet when he proceeds to this neceſſary piece of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, he delights to repreſent himſelf under the moſt agreeable Character of a Tender hearted Parent, who though he ſometimes is forced to hearden his heart, and ſtop his ears againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Nothing leſs than ſuch a <hi>Reformation</hi> will ſuffice to put an End to Gods Controverſy with ſuch a People, and Secure them from juſtly expected and deſerved Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is true, God hath given encouragement to a reforming People, to hope and believe for his return to them in a way of Mercy and Favour, and that he will repent him of the Evils he hath threatned to bring upon them. Jer. 18. 7, 8. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pull down, and deſtroy it; if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced turn from their Evils, I will repent of the Evil I thought to do unto them.</hi> This duty God recommends unto, and urgeth upon a degenerate People, threat'ned with the Effects of his ſoreſt diſpleaſure, Jer. 7. 3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts the God of Iſrael, Amend your ways, and your doings, and I will cauſe you to dwell in this place.</hi> For ſuch a People God hath appeared in a way of Covenant Compaſſion, recovering them out of thoſe depths of Miſery and diſtreſs into which, by their Sins, they have plunged themſelves.

                     </gap> was grieved for the miſeries of Iſrael.</hi> But without ſuch a Reformation a Profeſſing People have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. When the Wrath of God hath been poured out upon a People, and the more terrible Out-breakings of it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and juſtly Expected, they can never be too ſpeedy in their applications unto the only means of ſafety and ſecurity. In no caſe can delays be ſuppoſed to breed, and bode greater hazzard and danger. For if the Reformation of every thing that is provoking to God amongſt ſuch a People be not ſpeedily purſued, whence can the neglect be ſuppoſed to flow, but from a perverſe reſolvedneſs to perſiſt in their Sinful Courſes, and a wretched inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of, and ſtupid unconcernedneſs about the miſeries conſequential hereupon? And ſurely this cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined an Omen for good to them! The Language of ſuch a negligent People (for Actions Speak as well as Words) is nothing leſs than a bold and daring challenge unto the Almighty to do his worſt; and informs the World, they are equally regardleſs of his frowns and favours. What can the meaning of ſuch an inadvertent conduct be but this, <hi>Let Him make ſpeed, and haſten his work that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. All Orders of Men amongſt ſuch a People, ſhould indeavour, in their ſeveral Stations, and Capacities to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this Reformation. For,</p>

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001429_0024_0FB2F4C0311E3418"/>
the divine Anger may be appeaſed. It is poſſible that thoſe who lead a People may cauſe them to err, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the way of their paths, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3. 12. A culpable in-advertency in them, a careleſs ſlackenning the reins of Government, may give a ſilent, and powerful growth to thoſe impieties which will cauſe the anger of the Lord to ſmoke againſt a People. Their Secular Intereſt may poſſibly diſpoſe them to wink and connive at, or to be leſs active than is meet, for Perſons in their circumſtances, in their appearances againſt and withſtanding thoſe corrupt practices, which ripen a People for ruin and deſtruction. A burning Zeal in them, for the Glory of God may be under too great damps and abatements. A Spirit of fear, timorouſneſs, and cowardize may, poſſibly, ſurprize and indiſpoſe them to a vigourous and ſteady Execution of thoſe Laws, by which bold tranſgreſſors ought to be ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflected on, that Others might hear, and fear, and be diſcouraged from doing ſo wickedly. Whatever of this nature the Rulers of a People may have to charge upon themſelves, the conſideration thereof ſhould doubtleſs be improved to invigorate their indeavour to purſue a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Amongſt the body of a degenerate People incentives to engage them in the work of Reformation, can never be wanting, if the ſhare they have had in the Sins and Tranſgreſſions, which call for and demand it, be duely weighed and conſidered. They will indubitably, upon their inquiry, find reaſon ſufficient to look upon themſelves, as God accounts of them, <hi>A Sinful Nation, a People laden with Iniquities.</hi> Cauſe they have to charge upon themſelves, bold tranſgreſſions againſt, and frequent violations of the wholeſome Laws by which their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſhould be ſquared and ordered. Is it not the Cuſtom of ſuch a People to neglect and deſpiſe the Orders and Calls of their Godly Rulers, to Repent of and Reform their Immoralities? Are they not Arraigned for pulling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Shoulder, ſtopping their Ears, and making their hearts harder than the Adamant and the nether Mileſtone, that they might not hear the Voice of God ſpeaking to

them, by the Miniſters of his Word, who are labouring their Amendment and Reformation? Surely then it is their concernment to indeavour the Reformation by which the heats of Gods anger may be allayed, and the returns of his Favour and Mercy Secur'd?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It cannot be reaſonably expected, that a <hi>Reformation</hi> will be produced unleſs all Orders among a People engage in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Godly Rulers ſhould look upon it their Place to lead the way, and go before the People in the Work of Reformation; they ſhould ariſe therefore, and be of good Courage, for the matter belongeth unto them, <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

How agreable a thing will it be that your Excellency by Powerful Example, and Proper Influence, on all who move under you in a lower Sphere, ſhould Endeavour the bringing back this People to the Lord God of their Fathers?

Your Prudence, Piety, Zeal for the Glory of God, and your Country's good, are greatly relied on, and you will not fail to give ſignal proofs and demonſtrations of them. You forget not that the Country's Purſe is in your hands; you will be careful to Husband it to the beſt Advantage, conſidering it's very low and reduced Circumſtances; but yet will in no ſort be wanting to ſupply the Treaſury, with what is neceſſary for the ſafety and defence of the Country, and the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Support of the Government.</p>

2. <hi>Seriouſly Ponder the Progreſs God hath made in Pleading his Controverſy with us.</hi> Have we not been under a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Series of Judicial Diſpenſations? Hath not the Rain of our Land been frequently turn'd to Powder and Duſt? Have not our Husbandmen been call'd to howl? Have not devouring Inſects, conſuming Droughts, and pinching Froſts repeated the Tokens of Gods anger upon us? How often have Peſtilential Diſeaſes received a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to March thro' the Land? And have not Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes hereby encreaſed the number of our Dead amongſt us? Have not ruining and impoveriſhing loſſes by Sea been multiplied upon us? Hath not the Lord drawn out the Sword of the Covenant againſt us? Has it not for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt four and thirty years, with little Intermiſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured much Fleſh, and increaſed the number of the Lords ſlain in the Land? Are not many of our Sons &amp; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Captivity? How many Towns lye waſt and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late without Inhabitant, and this by the Lords moving us to Jealouſy with thoſe who are not a People, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us to anger with a fooliſh Nation?

Has not the Stink of our Camps been ſent into our Noſtrils, and our hopefuleſt Expeditions frowned upon and diſappointed, ſo that our Enemies laugh amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe that hate us clap their hands? Have not <hi>Spiritual Flagues</hi> been poured on us? Is not the Word to many become Penal, Blinding and Judicial?

Do not the terrible and amazing tokens of a Perverſe, Refractory, Unyielding, Inſenſible Spirit appear upon us, notwithſtanding all the terrible diſpenſations of Gods Wrath againſt us?

               <p>Should you not then, O ye Covenant People of the Lord, with deepeſt Penitential Mourning and Humiliation, fall down before a juſtly irritated and offended God, and with ut-moſt brokenneſs of heart own, &amp; acknowledge all your mighty Sins and multiplied tranſgreſſions, and all their highly aggravated Circumſtances, as being Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt ſo much Light, Love, Merciful diſpenſations, Repeated Convictions, Warnings, Cautions, Confeſſions, Vows and Promiſes of Amendment? Should you not humbly accept the Puniſhment of your Sins, and Confeſs that God is Righteous in all his diſpenſations of humbling Providences, by which he hath teſtified his anger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt you? And that in the midſt of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, He hath remembred Mercy, Puniſhing you leſs than you have deſerved? Is it not duty to repent of, hate, abhor, turn from, forſake, and loath your ſelves for all the high handed Provocations, whereby you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the Divine Majeſty againſt you, and ſo far cauſed Him to become, and act toward you as an Enemy? Is not the Pardoning Grace and Mercy of God thro' the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Redeemer, to be humbly and earneſtly implored, and ſincerely relied on? Should you not Endeavour a full purpoſe of heart, to renounce all the ways of Sin and Folly, and walk uprightly with God in all the duties of the Covenant? And can any of theſe duties be performed by you, unleſs the Lord by the irreſiſtible Grace of his Spirit turn, change and make a victorious Conqueſt upon your hearts, taking away the heart of Stone, and giving you an heart of Fleſh? Is it not then your high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, by earneſt Prayers and Supplications, to implore this Mercy from the Hands of a God hearing Prayer, that
