            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <byline>By Another Hand.</byline>
            <p>THE Author, and principal Subject of the following Story, is a Gentleman well known to many in <hi>New-England,</hi> particularly at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> the Capital of the Province of <hi>New-Hampshire,</hi> the Place of his Nativity, and where he now resides. And such is the Character of Capt. <hi>Peirce,</hi> that no one, who is acquainted with it, will call in Question the Fidelity with which he has related these surprising Adventures. He was desired by his Friends, soon after he returned to them as one risen from the Dead, to commit to Writing the very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Occurrences of his Voyage, while they were fresh in his Memory. And now he has consented to the Printing of this Account, as a publick Acknowledgement of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to Almighty God, whose kind Hand conducted him safely thro' such a Variety of extreme Dangers; and as an Encouragement to others, in every Article of Distress and Hazard to confide in His Providence which determines the Fall of a Sparrow, which numbers even the Hairs of our Heads; and which often affords us De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance in a Way contrary to all human Expectation.</p>
            <p>The Reader, in perusing the ensuing Relation, will naturally call to Mind that devout and animated Passage of Holy Writ: <hi>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do Business in great Waters; these see the Works of God, and his Wonders in the Deep. For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, and raiseth the stormy Wind, which lifteth up the Waves thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down again to the Depth, their Soul is melted because of Trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken Man, and are at their Wits End. Then they cry unto the Lord in their Trouble, and he bringeth them out of their Distresses. Oh that Men would praise the Lord for his Goodness, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men!</hi>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of the great Dangers and Distresses, and the remarkable Deliverance, of Captain NATHANAEL PEIRCE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Brigantine called the <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> NATHANAEL PEIRCE, Master, belonging to Mr. <hi>Robert Odiorne,</hi> and others, of <hi>Portsmouth</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> sail'd from thence the 22d Day of <hi>November</hi> 1752, bound to <hi>Louisbourg;</hi> with a Cargo chiefly of Lumber. The Crew, besides the Master, consisting of the following Persons, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Nathaniel Barns</hi> Mate, <hi>'David Brown</hi> Cooper, <hi>William Langdon, Timothy Cotton, Longford</hi> a Negro Man, all Residents of <hi>Portsmouth</hi> aforesaid; <hi>William Williams</hi> of <hi>Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Chambers</hi> of some Part of the North of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>John Olson</hi> a Dutchman; in all Nine in Number.</p>
            <p>They proceeded for some Days on their intended Voyage, without any uncommon Accident. <hi>December</hi> the first, the Wind having been for three or four Days so much to the Northward, with Snow Squals and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cold, and the Brigantne being deep loaded, and at best a heavy Sailor, they could not get in with the Land; saw it at a Distance, and supposed it to be the Land between Island Harbour and White-Head. The Night before the Wind came to North West by West, by the Favour of which they made the Land at
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007747_0004_102DA79F71E767E8"/>
Day-Light, and judg'd it to be about 10 Leagues to the Westward of <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> and stood close in with it. At Noon, the Wind veering to the Eastward, and no Harbour near that they could get into, and a Storm at Ea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> North East coming on, thick with Snow, and very cold; they tack'd and stood off Shore till four in the Afternoon, and then lay by under the Foresail, with the Head to the Southward. The three last mentioned of the Crew, were very much discouraged at the Severity of the Season, being but just arrived from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and badly cloath'd. They and all the Rest at different Times, were confin'd to their Cabbins by some slight Indisposition, and often beg'd the Master to go off the Coast, which he was very loath to do, as his Vessel and Cargo were disposed of at <hi>Louisbourg</hi> to good Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if he could get in there. But the Weather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing very cold, the People still solliciting, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Cargo on board would suit the West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Market, He at last consented to go off the Coast; and at Eight in the Morning, the second Day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> order'd the Helm a Weather, and bore away, designing to go for the Island of <hi>Antigua,</hi> and stop'd a Course accordingly.</p>
            <p>They sail'd off the Coast under the Foresail till Noon; the Weather being moderate, they made more Sail; making the best of their Way to the Westward of the Island of Sables, and then going to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the Winds and Weather would permit. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued moderate till <hi>December</hi> the fourth at Night, when a Storm arose at West North West. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued before the Wind the remaining Part of the Night, the next Day being the 5th of <hi>December,</hi> the Storm not abating, about 4 o'clock in the Afternoon the Pump was suck'd. About five, the Master and Crew found She had sprung a Leak, and required both Pumps, which were set to work accordingly; but notwithstanding all they could do, the Water gain'd upon them so fast, that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007747_0005_102DA7A17816B808"/>
about eight in the Evening the Water was above the lower Deck; upon the Discovery of which they ceased Pumping, as finding that of no Manner of Service. The Master then went into the Cabbin which was very full, to endeavour to get some of his Papers and Things of Value out of his Chest (if haply he might be saved) but before he had Time to open it, the Things in the Cabbin began to fleet, and shifted forward, and prest too the Door, that it was with very great Difficulty that he got out. They were now in the utmost Consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imaginable, expecting the Vessel would be soon full of Water and then over-set.</p>
            <p>They had no Sail set since the Gale began, but the Fore-sail: As soon as they could resolve what to do, the Ax was secured; the fore Jears were cut, and the Fore-Yard got close down. At the same Time some were employ'd in getting some Salt Pork and Beef upon Deck; which at first, as fast as they threw upon Deck was wash'd overboard, till it was proposed that some of it should be strung, which was done accordingly, and made fast to the aftermost Stantion of the quarter Deck and the Horse-piece. The Master took a Spell to cut away the Main-mast, but for want of Strength, and some one to second him, did not accomplish it. The Rest of the Crew were employed in clearing the Decks of Hoops, Hen-coops, and Lumber, which the Sea in a great Measure facilitated, as by that Time the Vessel was full of Water, and the Sea continually running over them, which washed away the Boats, Caboose &amp; Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; so that before Morning they had nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Deck, save the Main-top-sail, Yard and Sail, bent and furl'd to the Yard, which had not been dry enough to put down, altho' unrig'd some Days before; and now happen'd to be so jamm'd between the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast and Pumps, that the Sea could not wash it away.</p>
            <p>They attempted at first to steer the Vessel before the Wind, but she soon broach'd too, with her Head to the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007747_0006_102DA7A3982DB280"/>
Northward, which though bad on one Account, was good on another. As they reckon'd themselves between the Latitude of 4° 1 and 4° 2 North Latitude (having had no Observation for several Days) and about South from the Island Sables, her Head being to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward she would naturally gain more to the Northward: if so, they thought that they should be more out of the Way of Vessels meeting with them, at that Season of the Year. But then on the other Hand, the Vessel having a Lift to Starboard, the other being the Weather Side (as the Winds for the most Part at that Season of the Year are to the Westward) she was for that Reason the higher out of Water; and this was the only Position to lay in for Safety, as will hereafter appear.</p>
            <p>They past this Night in great Distress, and horrible Apprehensions of every Moments being their last, and their State fixt to all Eternity. And having so sudden a Call, what must be the Consternation of such misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unthinking Wretches as the generality of Seamen are?</p>
            <p>When the Day came on, there was a new Scene of Terror; the Negro Man <hi>Langford</hi> was missing; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be wash'd over-board in the Night; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for the Ax to cut the Main-mast away, it was not to be found, being lost in the Night; and no one could be blamed, as it was with very great Difficulty that they kept themselves on the Wreck, the Sea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually breaking over them. Every Thing in the Cabin and Steerage, such as Casks, Chests, Scrutores, and likewise the Lumber, was by the violent Surges of the Sea stove in Pieces; so that the ruinous State to which these Things were reduc'd, is almost incredible.</p>
            <p>The Crew attended at the Companion, to catch what should come in Sight, that might be of Service. They recovered some Apples, and Part of three Cheeses; but to their great Mortification, could not meet with any of their Cloaths or Bedding. They began now to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007747_0007_102DA7A54A369408"/>
consider of some Way to obtain Rest; and the first Thing to be done, was to unbend the Main-top-sail, and get it aft on the Poop, (which was a Rise of about six Inches from the Quarter-deck, and about eight from the Taffril, and being short Plank, did not blow up, as did most Part of the Quarter-deck afterwards, when she overset.) This they effected; and then fastning the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins to the Rail, from the Crutch aft to the after Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (which was the only Place free from Water) they laid down Side by Side, and hauling the other Part of the Sail over them, they obtain'd some Rest; altho' the Sea would much disturb them by breaking over them; and when it did so, which was very often, they got up to wring their Cloaths, and laid down again. In this Posture they continued as long as any one remained on the Wreck, save when employed on necessary Occasions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> the 7th, proved a moderate and fine clear Day, with but little Wind. Perceiving the Lee Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Plank, and that next to it, of the foremast Part of the Quarter-deck was blown up, and some small Things washing out, they attended to get what they could there; but could meet with nothing that was of any Service to them, excepting one of the Captain's Sheets, and a large Part of the Ensign, which proved of great Service, as will appear hereafter. Every Thing was stove to Pieces in the Steerage and Cabbin, as above; but obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bulk of Boards that was stowed before the Main-mast, between Deck, to remain fast, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded if they could get Water any where, it must be in the Fore-castle, which was stowed full; upon which Account the Water-Casks and other Things there, were more likely to be preserv'd.—</p>
            <p>They went to work, and broke open the Fore-castle, and hawling out the spare Rigging, Wood, Staves, and Shingles, &amp;c. as it came to the Scuttle, which was for the most Part under Water; they at last obtained what they aim'd at, which was one Barrel, and another half
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007747_0008_102DA7A85FE02030"/>
full of Apples, and a French Hogshead of Fresh Water; all which they got aft on the Quarter-deck, and secured them in the best Manner they possibly could. The Water stunk very much, being in Rum Casks, but they tho't it a great Relief in their present Necessity. When they were at Work getting these Things out of the Fore-castle, as large a Shark as they had ever seen, attempted to come in upon Deck to them; but the Master perceiving it, beat him off with a Hogshead Stave; however, he attended about the Wreck for several Days, as a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Sepulchre for them that should fall into his Power. They now tho't themselves in a Condition to subsist for some Days; and had some Hope that God, would of his infinite Mercy, grant them Relief, by sending some Vessel in their Way, to take them off; of which there was but a bare Possibility; however, it was earnestly desired of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>The Water, Cheese, and Apples they used with Discretion; every one taking a little at certain Times: But they were deprived of every Thing commonly used to drink out of, and so were obliged to make Use of one of their Shoes.</p>
            <p>It continued moderate 'till the Ninth Day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> but blowing hard all that Day, about the Dusk of the Evening, in a very severe Squall, the Vessel fell on her starboard Broadside, with her Masts in the Water. The Crew got on the Broadside to Windward, in the best Manner they could, and some of them crawl'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the Outside, and cut away the Lanyards of the Weather-Main and Fore-Shrouds, in Hopes the Masts would go away by the Board, and the Vessel right on her Bottom as before. But the Masts proved too good to be got rid of so easily, and the Vessel remain'd on her Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, the Sea continually running over them, and the Weather very cold; and one large Sea in particular, wash'd the Master from the main Chains of the Wreck to Leeward, but by a kind Providence, he happen'd to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007747_0009_102DA7AA65EDEA48"/>
fall on the Main-mast, where the Sea left him: by the Help of which and the Barricado, he got again on the Windward Side, and was securing himself to the main Chains when the Squall abated, and the Vessel righted on her Bottom as before.</p>
            <p>They then got within Board, and mustering their Number, <hi>William Langdon</hi> and <hi>John Olson</hi> the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were lost, and all the Fresh Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apples and Cheese gone; the Companion and most Part of the Quarter-deck blown up; and the greatest Part of the loose Stuff in the Steerage and Cabbin floated out; and nothing left them to subsist upon, but the raw Salt Pork secured as above. From this Time they had never a drop of Water, but what the Heavens, at Times, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them. It was now that the Sheet and Piece of the Ensign, mentioned above, became serviceable; first, by dividing to each a Piece, to catch Rain Water with; and to some to wrap their sore Legs in, of which some were very bad; and to others, to bind round their Head that had no Cap or Wigg. The Manner they got Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, by standing up when it rained, and spreading out their Cloth with their Arms, leaning on the Rail for Safety, and facing the Rain 'till the Squall was over, or the Cloth full of Water; then each, to make the most of what he had got, laid down, and wringing the Cloth between his Teeth, suck'd out what Water he could. But at first using the Cloth, they were oblig'd to wring out the Water several Times to wash it, for it was so impregnated with Salt, having been soak'd so long in Salt Water, that they could not drink it. And often, to their great Mortification, when they thought they had a Mouth-full of Water in their Cloth, the Spray of the Sea would fly on it, and render the Water unfit for Use; so that it would take two or three Showers to freshen them again. But what will not a Man attempt to save Life? and no Man knows what Hardship he can bear, 'till he is bro't to the Test.—</p>

Either the 12th or 13th Day, <hi>David Brown,</hi> the Cooper, proved delirious; which was first discovered by his asking idle and ridiculous Questions, for which he was reproved at first; but it had no other Effect on him, than to make him whisper instead of calling aloud for Beer, Cyder, and other Liquors, and contriving how he would go and get them. And the next Morning he was missing, and they supposed that he went overboard in the Night.</p>
            <p>About this Time, i. e. the 13th Day of <hi>December, Thomas Chambers,</hi> the ablest and best Seaman on board, went up and cut the Fore-top-sail-Yard away, Sail and all, to prevent the Vessel's oversetting, of which they were very much afraid, it blowing hard, and looking likely for a bad Storm, of which they had several. During this Time, to the 15th, they had several light Showers of Hail, but could save only a very small Quantity, which each as soon as they got it, eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, tho' it gave but small Relief.</p>
            <p>The 16th, <hi>Nathaniel Barns</hi> the Mate, by his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, shew'd that he was delirious; talking and behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much as <hi>Brown</hi> had done; and for Fear that he should steal from them in the Night, as <hi>Brown</hi> had done, they with a Reef Plat took a Turn round his Body, under his Arms, and made the Ends fast to the Crutch, which was between the Master's Birth and <hi>Timothy Cotton;</hi> and before Night they tho't he was struck with Death by some Signs in his Countenance, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Body; but when Night came on, he lay still and soon died, without any Struggle, that they could perceive; and the next Day in the Afternoon they threw him into the Sea.</p>
            <p>From the 9th to this Day, being the 17th, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all they could, to get some loose Boards and Plank that were washing about the Steerage and Cabbin overboard, which this Day they accomplished; when it was hoped that some of the Tools, that were in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007747_0011_102DA7AE0E471EF0"/>
Mate's Cabbin in the Steerage, might be found to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which was considerably under Water.</p>
            <p>The Crew was now reduc'd to the Master, <hi>Timothy Cotton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thomas Chambers,</hi> and <hi>William Williams.</hi> It was ask'd, Who could swim, and venture to dive down to the Lee-side in the Steerage, and search for some of the Tools, to cut the Main-Mast away? The three last could not swim, and when they knew the Master could they let him have no Rest 'till he complied with their Request. But first he made them promise that they would take Spell and Spell with such Tools as he should find, 'till the Mast should fall. He then strip'd off his Cloaths, and soon recovered a new Cooper's Ax, that was never ground, an Iron Crow, and Part of a Bar of Lead. He then split a Stave, and with his Knife made a Handle for the Ax, with which, and the Iron Crow, they took Spell and Spell, according to their Promise, and in about three or four Hours, they got the Mast to fall, when they tho't the Vessel in no Danger of being overset by any Storm. The Bar of Lead they cut to chew and roll about in their Mouths, which they tho't in some Measure allay'd their Thirst, which was at Times very great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and especially about this Time, when they were tempted to drink their own Urine, which one of them had often done before. In this great Distress, the Master not standing upon Niceties, borrow'd one of the Men's Shoes, urin'd in it, and drank it off, which, as he tho't, soon purged him; for which Reason he never repeated it, and endeavoured to diswade others from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as well as from chewing Tobacco, which they would do, altho' wet with Salt Water: Which Advice he had Reason to think was too much slighted. The Reason he borrowed one of the Men's Shoes to drink out of was, because he saw them drink in the same Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and had none of his own, since the second Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Vessel filled with Water, when his Feet swell'd and were so painful, that he was obliged to pull them off,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007747_0012_102DA7B019BA22C8"/>
and there being no Place of Safety, they were soon wash'd overboard.</p>
            <p>In the Evening of this Day <hi>Timothy Cotton</hi> shewed great Signs of a Delirium, by insisting on the Master's giving him some Drink; and when reason'd with upon the Impossibility of complying with his Request<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he insisted on going ashore, and nothing should persuade him out of it: for he said he could easily get ashore, but would not go without Leave from the Master. But upon the Master's telling him, if he would stay till next Day, if he liked the Opportunity he would go with him; he sat down in his Birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and seem'd to be in the full Exercise of his Reason in a Moment; and ask'd the Master if he thought there was any Likelihood of a Vessels meeting with them. This he had encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged them before to hope for, but now told them that there was only a Possibility of such a Thing's happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; all Things being possible to the Almighty, and that it might so happen in the Course of his Providence. But at the same Time he advis'd them not to think much of this, or any Thing in the present Life, but to endeavour to secure their eternal Happiness in the next, by looking unto Jesus Christ their merciful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for sincere Repentance of all their Sins, and Salvation thro' his Blood, and to let that take up all their Thoughts, as they had nothing before their Eyes, but Death, and an Eternity of Joy or Misery. They then earnestly supplicated God to wash away all their Sins, and to receive them into his Favour for the Sake of Jesus Christ; and beg'd for the Continuance of their Reason till their appointed Time should come; and that they might not be left to destroy themselves, or be any Way accessary to their own End; and so humbly submitted themselves to his Will and Pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timothy Cotton</hi> continued very calm and rational till towards the next Evening, which was the eighteenth Day of <hi>December,</hi> when he fell into a more violent Fit than
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007747_0013_102DA7B226EB4990"/>
the Day before; and after insisting on having some Drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in hasher Terms then he had done; and the Master refusing to go with him, as he desir'd, he in a sudden, and violent Manner threw himself into the Sea, and they saw no more of him.</p>
            <p>The Master and two Men that remained with him, were in great Distress for want of Water till this Night, when it pleased God to send a very plentiful Rain, of which by the Use of their Cloths, they got as much as they desired, and drank rather more than did them good. The nineteenth was moderate, but unsettled Weather, and at Night it began to blow hard, and the Sea to run high. Some Time in the Night, the two Men that were left with the Master, while he was asleep, shifted the Helm, which occasioned the Vessel to ware round on the other Tack, which they had often done before, being very much affraid she would overset. And while they had the Forestay-sail, and Strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they hoisted it, and so wore her round again. But now that Sail was render'd useless; and if it were not, they had no Strength to hoist it.—Laying on the Starboard Tack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as was observed before, was much the best both for Safety and Ease; whenever the Vessel was about on the other Tack, then every Sea would run over her as it would over a Rock that is but just above Water. At this Time, no sooner was She about, then the Sea came over them with the utmost Violence. The first Sea very narrowly mist washing the Master over-board, and of Course thoroughly awakened him. When he perceived what was the Matter, he crawled out of the Sail to the Tiller, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lash'd it from the Place where the Men had fastned it, and lash'd it to the Place where it was before, which was then the Weather Side, and returned as soon as possible to his Birth in the Sail, in hopes that the Vessel would ware round on the other Tack. But all he could say to the two Lads could not persuade them to get into their Births in the Sail for Safety. They were weak, and discovered some Signs of a Delirium; and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007747_0014_102DA7B448154660"/>
the Sea having free Passage over them, they were wash'd away, and the Master saw no more of them, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Moment to follow them.</p>
            <p>But it pleased God in about a quarter of an Hour, that the Wreck wore round on the other Tack, when the Difference was so great, that I thought it very comfortable Lodging to what it was before, altho' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Winds and Weather as much as if I had been in the open Field. The Weather was cold, but not enough to freeze. I was now sensible of a general Decay or Weakness in all my Faculties: my Eyes weak and dazzling; my Limbs hardly enabled me to get on my Feet; at the same Time, I had bad Sores on my Ancles, Knees, Hips, Elbows and Sholders and Joynts of my Fingers. But nevertheless I was obliged to get up when it rain'd, or I could get no Water, which proved to be very scarce, seldom being able to get a mouthful for the last four Days; and was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, that I could not have held out above twenty-four Hours longer, having had no Bread from the beginning, and no other Provisions, than as mentioned above: and indeed the Cry of Thirst was so great, that we had very little Desire for Eating in Comparison for that of Drink, of which we had so scanty a Supply, that we never but once had, as we thought, enough.</p>
            <p>I was alone from the Nineteenth to Christmas Eve, expecting to starve to Death, and at the same Time ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly begging God's Mercy in the Forgiveness of my Sins, and a Preservation of my Senses until my Time should come, trusting in the Merits and Satisfaction of Jesus Christ for Acceptance unto Salvation; at the same Time praying for a sincere Submission to the divine Will. But it pleased God that I should continue longer in this World (than I expected) a Monument of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and to grant me a wonderful Deliverance, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Capt. <hi>Thomas Martin,</hi> in the Snow <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from <hi>Hallifax,</hi> loaded with <hi>Fish</hi> bound to <hi>Oporto</hi> in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007747_0015_102DA7B5E4BA8EB0"/>
to take me off the Wreck, the 24th Day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1752, at Noon, when they were in 41° 15 North Latitude, and 113 Leagues to the Eastward of <hi>Halifax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had blown hard, according to the Account they gave me, the Night before, and they had reef'd their Top-sails; and in the Morning it growing moderate, they went up to let their Reefs out; and while they were about it, as it is common, they looked round to see what they could see; and spied as they thought a Sloop lying a Hull. But they soon alter'd their Opinion, and believed it to be a Top-sail Vessel with but one Mast standing. They immediately alter'd their Course, and came close to Windward. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Water run in and out at the Cabbin Windows, and the Hatches and Deck blown up, they concluded that there could be no Body alive on the Wreck; so made what Observations and Remarks on the Vessel they could, and then made Sail and shot a-head. But as they fell under the Lee-bow, they saw a Sailor's Jacket hanging on one of the Crotches, and a Sail fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as above, and thought some Body was in it, but doubted if alive. However, they resolved to take their Speaking-trumpet and hail; which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and I think they told me they repeated it three Times. But being asleep, I heard them but once, and they said they heard me answer them. As soon as I open'd my Eyes I saw a Vessel close by me, under the Lee-bow, I immediately took the Peice of the Ensign I had in my Bosom (which I kept there to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve free from Salt Water, being what I catch'd fresh Water with) and lifted up my Arm as high as I could, and swung it to them; which they answered with their Hats; telling me they would send their Boat imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, which they did as soon as possible. I lay still all the While in my Birth, and saw them hoist out their Boat, and perceived her advancing towards me. All
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007747_0016_102DA7B7F1CD2158"/>
this While I was ruminating in my Mind, whether what I saw was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> real. I thought I could not be deceived with false Appearances, as I was thoroughly sensible of my Condition; and how I came into this Situation; and so resolved to trust to the Reality of it.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Boat came near, they called to me, and asked me, if I could help myself; I told them I could; and as the Boat advanced, I got myself down to the Lee-quarter, ready to throw myself into her; and when a smooth Time offer'd, they back'd the Boat to the Side, when with the Help of the Man that was in the Stern of her, I tumbled myself into the Bottom of the Boat, where I had not above two or three Feet to fall; and so was rowed along Side the Hospitable Snow that received me. The Sea was very rough, and I thought there was Danger in getting out the Boat, especially for one so weak as I was, so desired them to throw me a Rope, which they did, and I fastned it round under my Arms, by the Help of which I got safe upon Deck. As soon as I had fallen on my Face, and thanked Almighty God for so merciful a Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I was help'd down into the Cabbin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they had prepared a little hot Wine, of which they gave me a Glass to drink, which I thought very comfortable, and a Bit of white Bisquet, but I could not eat it, by Reason a I my Teeth were very loose. The Wine soon coming out of my Stomack, I took a little more with a Bit of Bisquet soaked in it, which stay'd by me. They strip'd me of all my Cloaths, which were dirty and ragged; my Shirt being rotten in some Places; and what was left of it, as stiff as Buckrum, by being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wet with Salt Water; and put me on a new clean check'd Shirt, Drawers, and Stockings. They got me also the biggest Pair of Shoes they could find, but my Feet were so swell'd, I could not put my Toes into them. I committed myself to the Care of the Captain, and begged he would be careful of what was given me
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007747_0017_102DA7BB13DF1CC8"/>
to Eat and to Drink; for that I was reduced to the Weakness of a Child. They then put me to Bed, or Cabbin in the Steerage; for as the Vessel was small, and several Passengers in the great Cabbin, there was no Room for me there.</p>
            <p>I no sooner was laid in the Bed assign'd me, than I was in a Delirium, which was so constant, that I know not what I did, or what they gave me to Eat or Drink for some Days. But when I recovered my Reason, I was sensible that Capt. <hi>Martin</hi> must have taken a great Deal of Care of me, and that I must have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been no small Trouble to him; and what I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had Occasion for of his Stores, was at my Service: And till I have it in my Power to make him another Return, can only say, I am greatly oblig'd to him.</p>
            <p>He proceeded on his intended Voyage for <hi>Oporto,</hi> without any uncommon Accident, till we made the Coast of <hi>Portugal.</hi> We were about a Week before we could get in with the Barr, which was occasion'd by little Winds and Calms, and was more tedious than all the Passage besides. The Nights I thought were very sharp and cold; and the scorbutick Habit that I had contracted on the Wreck was now purging off by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Urin, which obliged me to go upon Deck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three or four Times a Night, for Want of a Conveniency below<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed me to the Weather very much; and as I have been told by able Physicians, it was a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Providence that I should recover from so low and starved a Condition; for I was so weak that I was often ready to faint before I could get to my Cabbin again. And once in particular, just as I got down to the Foot of the Ladder in the Steerage, I fainted away, and fell with my Face to the Ladder; and as I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to myself again, I heard one of the Sailors say, what is the Matter with the old Man? I answered, that I had fainted away, and then got to my Cabbin. As I had a long Beard, and was so much ematiated, their
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007747_0018_102DA7BC9B5377D8"/>
distinguishing me by that Name, is not to be wonder'd at.</p>
            <p>About the twentieth Day of <hi>January</hi> we got in with the Barr of <hi>Oporto.</hi> It being a proper Time of Tide and smooth Water, we sail'd directly in, tho poop'd by three Seas: And that Night and the next Day, warpt the Snow up to <hi>Merigiah,</hi> and had Protick; tho' on my Account the Visit-Boat made much Difficulty. But at last the Captain obtain'd it, and then he went ashore with the Passengers. I desired them to procure me a Lodging, which they endeavour'd, as they told me when they came on Board, without Success.</p>
            <p>Had I not been deliver'd from such Extremity of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress, I should now have tho't myself very unhappy; in a strange Country, without any Habitation; without Friends or Money; with little or no Cloaths to my Back, and them very dirty and lousy; and hardly able to stand on my Feet, having several loathsome Sores about me, and no Dressing for them. I desired Capt. <hi>Martin,</hi> when he went ashore the next Day, that he would make my Case know on Change, and acquaint the Consul with it, that I might get Relief like other Beggers—By Change Time we got up to the Key, but outside ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fish Vessel that was then discharging.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Martin</hi> was telling my Story on Change, when it came to the Ears of my good Friend Captain <hi>William Morris,</hi> whose Humanity led him to come directly to see me. When I was call'd, and told that Capt. <hi>Morris</hi> wanted to see me, I had no Notion of its being any Man that I had ever seen; but when I came upon Deck, and saw my old Acquaintance, I had Hopes of Relief. But his seeing me in that Condition, gave him so much Concern, that he could not help showing it in his Countenance; and I being sensible of this at the same Time, could not refrain from Tears, and turn'd about to wipe them away with my Sleeve; and turning again, found he was gone. I was sorry
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007747_0019_102DA7BE431B8070"/>
that he went away so abruptly, tho' I did not doubt but it was for my good.</p>
            <p>I was such a miserable Object to look at, I thought it best to go to my Cabbin, which I did; but was no sooner there, than Capt. <hi>Morris</hi> came down the Steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and his Steward, with a Bag of Cloaths, with which he desired me to dress myself. I soon shifted from Head to Foot, and threw all my dirty, lousey Cloaths into the Cabbin I had so long slept in, and went ashore with Capt. <hi>Morris,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Welkinson,</hi> Merchant there to his House and drank Tea; and he was so good as to send for Dr. <hi>Henry Nickols,</hi> Physician to the English Factory at <hi>Oporto,</hi> who kindly came, and gave me his best Advice and Assistance. It was then agreed that I should go on board the <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> Capt. <hi>William Morris'</hi>s Ship, till he had acquitted the Consul, Mr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> with my Misfortune, and could provide a Lodging for me ashore.</p>
            <p>The Consul, who is a most human Gentleman, and very much beloved by the Factory, when he heard my Story (as I was informed) said he would have a Lodging for me near his own House, that he might often hear from me; and had provided one accordingly in a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugee's House. But at my Friend <hi>Morris'</hi>s Desire, I was lodged at Mr. <hi>Nicholas Webber'</hi>s at <hi>Villa-Nova,</hi> where I met with all the kind Treatment I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or a Person in my weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Circumstances desire—Here, by Order of the Consul and Factory, I was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a Taylor, Perriwig-maker, Shoe-maker, &amp;c. who furnished me with a Suit of Cloaths from Head to Foot, as also with Shirts, Crevats, Handkerchiefs, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c.—And when I was able to take my Passage for <hi>England,</hi> they procured a Passage for me, in the <hi>Mary</hi> Capt. <hi>Francis Smith,</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> and laid in all Manner of Stores necessary for a Gentleman, and five Moidores in my Pocket, all at their own Cost &amp; Charge. Nor must I forget the Kindness of Dr. <hi>Bromley,</hi> who
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007747_0020_102DA7C176318CE8"/>
was so good as to attend me every Day that I was at <hi>Oporto,</hi> to dress my sore Ancles, and gave me proper Dressing for them, to use in the Passage to <hi>England.</hi> Nor can I omit to mention the Present made me by the Masters of the Ships then at <hi>Oporto;</hi> in which kind Affair, Capt. <hi>Knowler,</hi> and my Friend <hi>Morris,</hi> were exceeding active.</p>
            <p>We sail'd over the Barr of <hi>Oporto</hi> the 3d of <hi>March</hi> 1753, and arrived at <hi>Dover</hi> the 13th of the same Month.</p>
            <p>By the Assistance of some Friends in <hi>London,</hi> and the Owners of the <hi>Britania</hi> Capt. <hi>George Spender</hi> in particular, in which I took Passage from <hi>London,</hi> I have had an Opportunity of seeing once more my native Place <hi>Portsmouth</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>
