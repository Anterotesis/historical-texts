            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this Scripture, we may take Notice of theſe ſix Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Apoſtle gives Notice to the belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Congregations of ſpiritual Chriſtians, of a great Evil riſen up in the World, which (if not
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008578_0003_102F8747CD274F40"/>carefully heeded) might occaſion ſome great Trouble and Danger to them; <hi>many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are gone out into the World,</hi> V. 1.</item>
               <item>2. He preſcribes them a ſufficient Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Evil, ſaying, <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That the Faithful may be able to make a right Judgment of Spirits, he gives them one ſhort Rule of Trial, which yet comprehends in itſelf all Rules; Verſes 2 and 3. <hi>Hereby know we the Spirit of God; every Spirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is of God; and every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is not of God,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>4. He ſhews them with whom theſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who have the Spirit of Anti-chriſt, ſhould not prevail; <hi>viz.</hi> with none of the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of God, Verſe 4. <hi>Ye are of God, little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and have overcome them; becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. He ſhews them with whom the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſhould prevail, <hi>viz.</hi> with the World and carnal People; Verſe 5. <hi>They are of the World, therefore ſpeak they of the World, and the World heareth them.</hi> The World, ſeeking its own Things, receives Anti-chriſt, and his Prophets.</item>
               <item>6. He ſhews how the Spirit of Truth and Error may be known in the People, as well as in the Teachers; <hi>viz.</hi> by the Peoples cleaving, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Teachers of Truth, or to the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Error; Verſe 6. <hi>We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008578_0004_102F874964E06A18"/>heareth not us; hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe ſix Things are held forth to us, in this Scripture, and they are all very profitable and neceſſary for the true Church to be acquainted withal, eſpecially in theſe laſt of the laſt Times. I ſhall begin with the firſt, which is,</p>
            <div n="1" type="point">
               <head>The <hi>FIRST POINT.</hi> The great and dangerous Evil, of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives Notice to the Church of Believers; <hi>and that is,</hi> the going out of falſe Prophets into the World.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <q>Many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>AND here it is to be noted, that from the very Beginning of the World, there have been two Seeds or Generations of Men, very contrary the one to the other; as is evident in <hi>Geneſis</hi> iii. 15. where God ſaith to the Serpent, <hi>I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed;</hi> ſo that the Serpent hath his Seed, as well as the Woman her Seed; and this was the Woman's Curſe, to have her <hi>Sorrows and Conceptions multiplied,</hi> and to bring forth the Serpent's Seed, as well as her own, that is, the Children or Seed of the firſt Bleſſing; and both theſe contrary Seeds do partake of one and the ſame common Nature, or Humanity. And one of theſe Seeds are called, <hi>The Sons of God;</hi> the other, <hi>The Sons of Men, Geneſis</hi> vi. 6. And both theſe, being the Children of one <hi>Adam,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008578_0005_102F874B1BB769C8"/>to the Fleſh, are yet diſtinguiſhed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Spirits, that dwell in them, and inſpire them: For the Spirit of God, that is, the Spirit of Righteouſneſs and Truth, doth inſpire the one, and theſe are truly called the Children of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Romans</hi> viii. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> And the Spirit of Satan, which is the Spirit of Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and Error, doth inſpire the other; and theſe are truly called, the Sons of Men, who all have ſinned, and are deprived of the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>Now theſe two different and contrary Spirits, which have dwelt in theſe two diſtinct Seeds, have begun to act preſently from the very Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, each one according to its own Nature, and to trade and traffick about Mankind, and out of it, to bring forth Children to themſelves, like to themſelves in all Things; and ſo one hath endeavoured to beget and bring forth the Children of God, and of Truth; the other, the Children of Men, and of Error: And to this End, the one hath held forth the Truth of God, by the true Spirit of God; the other hath held forth Error and Falſhood, yet as it were the Truth: The one hath endeavoured to bring Man unto God, through true Faith and Repentance; the other to turn Men from God, through Sin: The one hath ſought to work Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Men, the other Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now the falſe Spirit hath been the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the World, and hath had the greateſt Opportunities and Advantages to multiply itſelf,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008578_0006_102F874EC55ED120"/>ſeeing it finds the whole World already lying in Wickedneſs, and fully prepared to receive itſelf. But the true Spirit hath been found in very Few, and that from the Beginning; for there have been but few true Prophets, who have had the true Spirit, and have ſpoken the true Word; as you may ſee all along in Scriptures, eſpecially in the Times of <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Micajah,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and deceive many;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his ſecond Epiſtle, Chapter ii. Verſes 1, 2. <hi>That as there were falſe Prophets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People,</hi> that is, the Jews, <hi>ſo there ſhall be falſe Doctors and Teachers among the Chriſtians,</hi> who ſhould <hi>privily bring in damnable Hereſies;</hi> and <hi>that many ſhould follow their pernicious Ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as there have been many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets from the Beginning, ſo eſpecially in the Days of the New-Teſtament; for the more Chriſt hath appeared by his spirit to lead Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Truth, the more hath the Devil appeared by his Spirit to lead Men into Error; and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Anti-chriſt; For Fleſh and Blood is not Anti-chriſt; but a Spirit contrary to Chriſt's Spirit, that dwells in Fleſh and Blood, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among thoſe that profeſs the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; this is Anti-chriſt.</p>
               <p>No Spirit, in the Jews or Gentiles, is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Anti-chriſt, but the Spirit of Satan in falſe Chriſtians, appearing as an Angel of Light, this is Anti-chriſt. Before Chriſt came in the Fleſh, the Devil was an evil Spirit, and a Liar, and a Murderer, and the unclean Spirit, and Prince of this World; but he was not properly Anti-chriſt,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008578_0007_102F87523997CA28"/>becauſe Chriſt was not then come in the Fleſh. The Devil was the Devil before, and did dwell and work in evil Men; but from the Beginning of the Chriſtian Church, he is called Anti-chriſt, and that not every where, but in the Church or Kingdom of Chriſt: For Anti-chriſt is a Spirit that diſſolves Jeſus, and that not openly, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly and cunningly, yea, under the Name and Pretence of Jeſus, he is wholly contrary to him. Wherefore, the diſcerning of Spirits, as it hath been neceſſary from the Beginning of the World, ſo alſo it is eſpecially neceſſary in the Days of the Goſpel, wherein the Myſtery of Iniquity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt myſterious, through the Operation of Anti-chriſt, in thoſe <hi>many falſe Prophets which are gone forth into the World.</hi> And ſo we proceed to the ſecond Point.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="point">
               <head>
                  <hi>The</hi> SECOND POINT.</head>
               <p>And that is this, <hi>That ſufficient Remedy, which the Apoſtle preſcribes to the true Church, againſt that great Evil of many falſe Prophets being gone out into the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Remedy the Apoſtle preſcribes to the Faithful againſt theſe falſe Prophets, is not that they ſhould ſtir up the ſecular Power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon, baniſh or burn them, that ſo they might be rid of them; for this is Anti-chriſt's proper Remedy againſt thoſe that oppoſe him; but the Apoſtle ſhews a more Chriſtian Remedy, which is this, <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they be of God;</hi> and this Remedy alone is ſufficient for the true ſpiritual Church of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008578_0008_102F8753D70AF4D0"/>Faithful in every Age, to preſerve it ſafe and ſound againſt all falſe Teachers whatſoever, and their falſe Doctrines; neither doth it deſire or need any other. Wherefore in this Caſe the Apoſtle contents himſelf to give only this Caution to the Faithful, <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whether they be of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  </gap>ly to believe every Man's Doctrine, nor yet raſhly and unadviſedly to cenſure and condemn it, till it be heard and known what it is: But it is a Chriſtian's Duty to <hi>prove all Things, and to hold faſt that which is Good,</hi> upon Proof, as <hi>Paul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth; wherefore <hi>John</hi> alſo adds here, <hi>But try the Spirits, whether they be of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence we note, That Chriſtians have Right and Power to try and judge the Spirits and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of their Teachers: And this is evident by many plain Scriptures; as,</p>
               <p>Matthew vii. 15. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Faithful) <hi>which come unto you in Sheeps Clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves; ye ſhall know them by their Fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Matthew xvi. 6. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, take heed and beware of the Leaven of the Phariſees, which is Hypocriſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Matthew xvi. 4. <hi>Jeſus ſaid, take heed that no no Man deceive you, for many ſhall come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:008578_0009_102F8759DD3C67D0"/>
John x. <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and know my Voice, and a Stranger will they not hear, but flee from him, for they know not</hi> (that is, <hi>own not</hi>) <hi>the Voice of Strangers. And all that came before me are Thieves and Robbers, but the Sheep did not hear them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which Scriptures, and many more that might be added, it is manifeſt that the Faithful, the true Sheep of Chriſt, have Right and Power to judge of the Spirit and Doctrines of the Teachers.</p>
               <p>Let Fathers, Schoolmen, Doctors, Councils, Aſſemblies of Divines, Univerſities, Miniſters, propound and publiſh what Doctrine they pleaſe, the Sheep of Chriſt, the faithful Flock, have Power and Authority from Chriſt himſelf to try and judge, whether the Things they ſpeak be of Chriſt, or of themſelves, and of Anti-chriſt. And this Power the faithful People ought not to part with, neither for any Fear, nor for any Favour.</p>
               <p>Yea, it moſt nearly concerns the Faithful to try the Spirits, and judge the Doctrines of the Teachers, for theſe two Conſiderations, among others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe we muſt each one give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for ourſelves before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt: Wherefore it concerns every one of us to look to our own eternal Condition, and not to leave this Care to others for us. In Death and Judgment, each one muſt anſwer for himſelf; and therefore we ought to be as certain of the Word of God, on which we build our immortal Souls, as we are ſure we live, and are Creatures;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008578_0010_102F875F058CF988"/>we ought, I ſay, to be ſure ourſelves, and not to truſt any Body for us in this great Matter, whereon depends either eternal Life, or eternal Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It concerns us to try the Spirits and Doctrines, becauſe otherwiſe we may eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and inſtead of Anti-chriſt, and his Diſciples, daſh againſt Chriſt himſelf, and his precious Saints. Yea, we have ſeen how the World, and worldly Church, not being able to try the Spirits and Doctrines, have contradicted and crucified the Son of God himſelf, and have reproached and perſecuted all his People, who are baptized into one Spirit with him; and doing this, they have thought they have done God good Service too; and all becauſe they were not able to judge of the Spirit and Truth of Chriſt in himſelf and his Members, but have followed the Judgment and Counſel of the chief Guides in the outward Church, who have cauſed them to err, and to miſtake Truth for Error, and Error for Truth, Chriſt for Anti-chriſt, and Anti-chriſt for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it concerns every one to be wiſe to Salvation for himſelf, and to try the Spirits for himſelf, and not to content himſelf to ſay; thus ſaid <hi>Auguſtine, Ambroſe, Hierom,</hi> &amp;c. or this was the Judgment of the Fathers, or thus have the Councils or Univerſities determined, or thus do our Miniſters teach us; but if thou art one of Chriſt's Flock, thou muſt have Skill to know and judge for thyſelf, which is Chriſt's Spirit and Doctrine, and which is Anti-chriſt's; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou wilt certainly miſcarry in this great
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008578_0011_102F8761519E3930"/>Matter, and be undone for ever. If thou build on Men in theſe Things, and canſt not judge for thyſelf, thou wilt be ſure to be undone.</p>
               <p>But now this Power of trying Spirits, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctrines, which Chriſt hath given his true Flock, and which they ought to have upon ſo good Grounds, the Teachers of the falſe and Anti-chriſtian Church, that is, the common Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral Names, Titles, and Degrees, have robbed them of, and have falſly and treacherouſly arrogated to themſelves the Power of trying Spirits, and judging Doctrines, and have ſaid, that it belongs to the Clergy, or national Miniſtry, and their Councils, and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Divines, to judge of Spirits, whether they be right or falſe; and to judge of Doctrines, whether they be agreeable to God's Word, or no; and that all Chriſtians ought to expect their Judgment and Determination, and to ſubmit to it, and to depend on it, as on an Oracle from Heaven, yea, though it be not only without, but alſo againſt their own particular Judgment.</p>
               <p>And theſe Men (I mean the Clergy) through the eccleſiaſtical and temporal Power which they had gotten, have ſtricken great Fear into the whole World, and have miſerably vexed innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Conſciences with a grievous and laſting Bondage, and have even driven them to Deſpair, whilſt none durſt approve or own any Spirit or Doctrine, though never ſo manifeſtly of Chriſt and his Goſpel, without their Allowance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; ſo mightily hath the Power of Anti-chriſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008578_0012_102F876566143EC8"/>prevailed in the World, and that againſt the expreſs Word of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now the Ground of this their anti-chriſtian Pride and Uſurpation is this, that they arrogate to themſelves, that they are the Guides and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of all Chriſtian Men, and are to teach them the Goſpel, which they are only to receive from their Lips; whereas Chriſt hath promiſed his true Church, that they ſhall be all taught of God, and ſhall hear and learn themſelves from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hath alſo promiſed to ſend them the Spirit, to lead them in all Truth, and to give them an Anointing, to teach them all Things.</p>
               <p>Now they, by robbing the Faithful of this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and arrogating it to themſelves, have made themſelves, contrary to Chriſt's Command, Lords and Maſters in the Church of God, and have uſurped to themſelves Superiority and Authority over other Believers, and have ſubjected all the World to their Opinion and Judgment in the Things of God; by which Means, they have ſet wide open the Flood-gates to Anti-chriſt, and his Kingdom, to break in upon the World, and to overflow it, whilſt they had robbed all Chriſtian People of their own Judgment in all Things of God, and had made them to depend wholly on the Judgment of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>And had not Chriſtian People thus unchriſtianly delivered up their Judgments to the Clergy, and that in the very higheſt Points of Religion, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity had not been ſo miſerably blinded and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted as it is, and the Myſtery of Iniquity had not ſo much prevailed in the World, as now it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008578_0013_102F876C600AB688"/>hath. For when Chriſtians would not try the Spirits, whether they were of God, and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, whether they were the Word of God or no, but thought this a Matter too high for them, and would refer and ſubmit all to the Judgment of their Miniſters; then Anti-chriſt (the Apoſtle of the Devil) came forth boldly, and proudly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted himſelf above all that is called God, and his Kingdom, above all the Kingdoms of the World, having firſt put out both the Eyes of Chriſtians, by taking away from them their Right and Power of trying Spirits, and judging Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines.</p>
               <p>But when true Chriſtians ſhall ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as God I truſt hath now fully put into their Hearts to do) and ſhall juſtly and lawfully take to themſelves the Power which God hath given them, to try Spirits and Doctrines, then Anti-chriſt, and his Agents, the carnal Clergy, muſt ſoon be brought down: For the Faithful, by that Word, ſhall ſoon perceive that they are not of God, nor their Doctrine of that right Goſpel, which is after the Mind of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Well then, by what hath been ſaid, you who are of Chriſt's true Sheep may perceive, that it is evident by the Word, that faithful Chriſtians have Right and Power to try Spirits and Doctrines, though Anti-chriſt, for many Ages, hath robbed them of this Privilege.</p>
               <p>For (that I may ſpeak a little more to this Matter) the Trial of Spirits doth unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly belong to all Men, who have received the Spirit of God: For to this Spirit of God which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008578_0014_102F876E7AEC80D0"/>dwells in the Faithful, the Gift of diſcerning Spirits is inſeparably annexed: And the Spirit of Chriſt, which truly dwells in all true Chriſtians, cannot deceive, nor be deceived in the Trial of Spirits. So that this now is a common Grace, that in ſome Meaſure belongs to all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have received the Unction that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all Things, and is true, and is no Lye.</p>
               <p>And though there be in the Church Diverſities of Gifts from the ſame Spirit, which are given to ſome, and not to others, as Tongues, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Tongues, and Miracles, and Gifts of healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> I <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. yet this Gift of trying Spirits is given to all, in ſome Meaſure, that have received the Spirit. For as in the natural Body there are ſeveral Gifts given to ſeveral Members, which are no given to all the Members, as Seeing to the Eye. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ear, Walking to the Foot, &amp;c. but Feeling is given to all the Members; ſo alſo in the Body of Chriſt, that is, the ſpiritual Church, ſeveral Gifts are given to ſeveral Saints, but the Trial of Spirits and Doctrines to Saints, who have received the Spirit; and if any have not Chriſt's Spirit, he is none of his; and if any have not Chriſt's Spirit, he can, in ſome Meaſure, diſcern and judge of all Spirits in the World: And the more any Man receives Chriſt's Spirit, the more able is he to judge of all other Spirits.</p>
               <p>Wherefore they who are true Believers, and have received Chriſt's Spirit, their Judgment is to be preferred in the Trial of Spirits, before the Judgment of a whole Council of Clergymen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:008578_0015_102F87705B7C7FC0"/>
And they only, who can try Spirits by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and Doctrines by the Word of God, written in their Hearts by the Spirit, and fit to commend Miniſters to the Work of God: That is, the Congregations of the Faithful, and not Univerſities, and Aſſemblies of Divines.</p>
               <p>And thus you may perceive that, <hi>ſeeing many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Faithful, as they tender their own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation, not to believe every Spirit that ſpeaks of Chriſt, and his Kingdom, and his Things, but to <hi>try the Spirits, whether they be of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now (it may be) ſome will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, we ought indeed to try the Spirits, ſeeing there are many falſe Prophets in the World, but we hope there are no ſuch Perſons among us, but only ſome up-ſtart Men, with their new Light, who with their Novelties and Fancies trouble the Nation, and would fain turn all Things Up-ſide down, and we know theſe well enough already, and do ſufficiently deſpiſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very like you do; but yet let me ſay to you, Men, Brethren, and Fathers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand yourſelves, and know what ye do in this Matter. For at the Beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation by the Miniſtry of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin,</hi> and divers others, precious Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, the Popiſh Clergy applied all theſe Scriptures, <hi>Try the Spirits, whether they be of God, for many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World; and beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps Clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves;</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:008578_0016_102F8772025221A8"/>I ſay, theſe, and the like Places of Scriptures, they applied to theſe godly Men, and yet they themſelves were the falſe Prophets indeed, and the others, whom they termed ſuch, were true Ones. Wherefore it is poſſible for you to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken as well as they, and no Doubt but you will be miſtaken, except the Lord be gracious to you, and give you his own Spirit, by which alone you can make a right Judgment in this Matter.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, that he that reads may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, you muſt know, that the falſe Prophets are not ſo eaſily diſcerned as you think; for they ſeem to be true Prophets, and godly, holy, learned, orthodox Men, Men of Eminency and Renown in the Church and State: And ſo to Fleſh and Blood, and the Wiſdom and Religion of the World, it will be a difficult, yea, and impoſſible Thing to find them out: For the falſe Prophets have ſeveral glorious Vails over them, to hide and obſcure them from common Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we declare unto you from the Word of the Lord, touching theſe falſe Prophets, who ſhall do ſo much Miſchief.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That they ſhall not proceed, or come forth from among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> or out of the barbarous Nations, but they ſhall ariſe out of ſuch as are called Chriſtians.</item>
                  <item>2. Seeing among Chriſtians ſome are openly prophane and evil, others ſeem to be religious and godly, the falſe Prophets ſhall be found among the better Sort; and therefore, ſaith Chriſt, they ſhall come in Sheeps Clothing, as if they were of Chriſt's own Flock: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008578_0017_102F8779713A8230"/>
                     <hi>They have a Form of Godlineſs,</hi> that is, they ſhall be painted over gloriouſly, with all Appearances of Truth, Righteouſneſs, Honeſty, Goodneſs; and all the Names of Godlineſs.</item>
                  <item>3. Seeing amongſt thoſe that ſeem to be the better Sort of Chriſtians, ſome give themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Word, and ſome do not; the falſe Prophets ſhall be found among thoſe Chriſtians, who take upon themſelves to be Preachers, as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. where hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called together the Elders and Teachers of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he ſaith to them, <hi>Ex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his ipſis; Out of your ownſelves ſhall Men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe Things, to draw away Diſciples after them.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And ſeeing among thoſe who are Miniſters, ſome are light, and vain, and carnal, and formal Perſons, and others are Men of great Worth and Reputation, and ſeem to be the precious Members of Chriſt, and even Pillars in the Church, ſo that the common People think, that all Religion would go down with ſuch good Men, they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Gifts and Enlightenings of the Spirit, and ſeeming more than ordinarily godly, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, wiſe, holy, ſober, devour; now the falſe Prophets ſhall be found among theſe. And as they who oppoſed Chriſt at his firſt coming in the Fleſh, ſeemed more wiſe, and holy, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Church than the reſt, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, and had the outward Letter of the Word in all Exactneſs, and the outward Form of Religion in all Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo they, who do, and ſhall moſt oppoſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008578_0018_102F877C88126FD0"/>Chriſt in his coming in his Spirit, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his Word, and reſiſt his Servants and Witneſſes of his Truth, do, and ſhall appear more wiſe, holy, learned, and godly, than the reſt of the Teachers of the Church.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, that the falſe Prophets of Anti-chriſt ſhall ariſe among Chriſtians, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch Chriſtians as ſeem to be godly; and among ſuch ſeeming godly Chriſtians as preach the Word; and among ſuch Preachers of the Word as ſeem to be of greater Worth and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency than the reſt: And ſo in all theſe Regards it will be a hard Matter to diſcern them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, ſuch Perſons, of ſuch Appearance of Worth and Holineſs as theſe, do uſually get to their Side the greateſt and higheſt Perſons in the Kingdoms and Nations, and do obtain, not only their Countenance and Favour, but alſo their Power and Authority for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By both theſe Means (<hi>viz.</hi> their ſeeming Holineſs, and their Intereſt with worldly Powers) they exceedingly enlarge their Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the World, and do get Multitudes of People and Nations to entertain them.</p>
               <p>For Anti-chriſt could not deceive the World with a Company of fooliſh, weak, ignorant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, contemptible Perſons, but he always hath the greateſt, wiſeſt, holieſt, and moſt eminent in the viſible Church for him, and by theſe he ſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uces and ſubjects to himſelf even the whole World.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they that are againſt him, and his falſe Prophets, are but a very Handful of Saints,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008578_0019_102F87B99973F9D8"/>who have the Spirit of Chriſt, and through his Spirit diſcern them, and oppoſe them; and for ſo doing are deſpiſed and hated of all the World.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is a harder Matter to try theſe falſe Prophets than we are well aware of. And yet, as hard as it is, the Apoſtle, by the Spirit, hath given us a manifeſt and certain Rule of Trial: And this is the third general Thing I named.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="point">
               <head>
                  <hi>The</hi> THIRD POINT.</head>
               <p>To wit, <hi>The ſufficient Rule, whereby the true Church may thoroughly try the Spirits and Prophets, how cunningly and ſubtilly ſoever they are diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and this he lays down, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereby know we the Spirit of God; every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is of God. And every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is not of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now this Scripture we may underſtand two Ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of a right Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt in his own Perſon.</item>
                  <item>2. Of a true Receiving of this Chriſt into us by Faith.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt. <hi>Of the right Knowledge of Chriſt in his own Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For whereas he ſaith, <hi>Every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. This gives us to underſtand, that he is true God, and was before he came into the Fleſh.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:008578_0020_102F877E36E57780"/>
2. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>Every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh;</hi> this gives us to underſtand, that he is true Man, our very Brother, Partaker of the ſame Fleſh and Blood with us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>Every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This alſo gives us to underſtand, that in him, true God and true Man are united into one inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Perſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>Every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. This gives us Occaſion to conſider the End of his Coming; ſeeing God did not become Man in vain, or for ſome ſlight Cauſe, but that he might redeem unto God, all thoſe whom the Father had elected in him, and ſave them perfectly from the Law, Sin, Death and Hell: And hence we may riſe up to conceive of his Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> of his Prieſtly, Prophetical and Kingly Office, and of the infinite Virtue and Efficacy of them.</p>
               <p>Now he that makes this Confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, from the Revelation of the Father, is of God; and he that ſpeaks otherwiſe, is not of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, We may underſtand this Scripture, not only of the true Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo and eſpecially of the true Receiving of him by Faith: <hi>Every Spirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is of God;</hi> that is, he is of God, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and acknowledges that the Son of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is come, not only into that Humanity
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008578_0021_102F87816E7E6B88"/>of Chriſt, that was born of the Virgin, but alſo that he is come into us, and dwells in us; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Scriptures, <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your Hearts by Faith:</hi> And <hi>Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory:</hi> And <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore the Jeſus Chriſt is come into his own Fleſh, but alſo into theirs, which by this Means is made his; and that Chriſt is in them, of a Truth, and dwells in them.</p>
               <p>For Anti-chriſt himſelf, and his Miniſters, do all acknowledge, that Jeſus Chriſt is come into that Fleſh, which he did aſſume of the Virgin; but they will not confeſs, that this is true in him, and in us: They will acknowledge the Myſtery of God manifeſted in the Fleſh, as to Chriſt the Head, but they will deny it as to the Church his Body: And ſo, whilſt they ſeparate the Head from the Body, and the Body from the Head in this Myſtery, they do <hi>ſolvere Jeſum,</hi> they diſſolve Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I ſay ſome hold, that the eternal Word, or divine Nature, came indeed into that Fleſh which was born of the bleſſed Virgin, but they will by no Means allow it to come into ours, through our Union with him by Faith: Only they ſay, ſome created Habits, or Gifts of Grace come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, or in our Fleſh, but not Chriſt himſelf, or the divine Nature, or Son of the living God. And ſo theſe Men ſet up theſe created Gifts and Graces in the Members, inſtead of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Head.</p>

And yet theſe Teachers make a glorious Shew in the Fleſh; and this is Anti-chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> when Men think that theſe created Habits of Grace (which they fancy) will renew, comfort, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and ſave them; and ſo do make to themſelves of them, a glorious, but yet a falſe Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let us know, that he that denies Jeſus Chriſt in the Members, is, though not ſo great, yet as true Anti-chriſt, as he that denies Jeſus Chriſt in the Head: And he that denies Chriſt dwelling in our Hearts by Faith, to be, and to be alone, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Redemption to us, as he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies him to be the Power, Wiſdom, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Sum of this Matter is this, that the true Spirits or Prophets do acknowledge, not only that Chriſt, the Son of the living God, is come into that Son of Man, which was born of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, but alſo that Chriſt is come into them, and dwells in them, as in his own true and proper Members.</p>
               <p>And ſo, he that hath Jeſus Chriſt dwelling in his Heart, is a true Prophet; and he that hath not Chriſt dwelling in his Heart, is a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, though his Knowledge and Religion be never ſo high, and glorious, and holy alſo in the Opinion of the World. And this is the chief Sign and Mark, whereby we may know the true Prophets and true Chriſtians, from the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and falſe Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Now if any ſhall ſay, but how ſhall we know whether a Man hath Chriſt dwelling
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008578_0023_102F878A61EBBB28"/>in his Heart or no? And ſo conſequently, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a true or falſe Prophet?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, you ſhall certainly know it, by the Truth of the Word of Chriſt in him, and by the Truth of the Life of Chriſt, in Reference to his Office in the Word.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, the true Prophets are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from the falſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the Truth of the Word of God in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the true Prophets ſpeak the true Word of God, even the Word of Wiſdom, the Word of Righteouſneſs, the Word of Life, the Word of Power, the Word that is able to ſave, which is the true Goſpel Word. For this is the Covenant that God hath made with Chriſt and his Seed, ſaying, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lix. 21. <hi>My Spirit which is upon thee, and my Word which is in thy Mouth, ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seeds Seed, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was perfectly fulfilled in Chriſt; for that Word, which in the Beginning was with God, and was God, was made Fleſh in him, and dwelt in him; and out of that Word Jeſus Chriſt ſpake all that ever he ſpake; his whole Doctrine did flow from that eternal Word which dwelt in him.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt communicated to the Diſciples the ſame Word which he had received, as he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> xvii. 8. <hi>I have given to them the Words that thou gaveſt me</hi> (that is, the word of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Life) <hi>and they have received them, and have known ſurely, that I came out from thee, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008578_0024_102F878BFB11C7C8"/>they have believed that thou didſt ſend me;</hi> and ſo that Word, which they themſelves received by Faith, they alſo held forth to others, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, I <hi>John</hi> i. 4. <hi>That which was from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our Eyes, which we have looked upon, and our Hands have handled, of the Word of Life, declare we unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this alſo <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> gives Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>John</hi> iii. 34. where he ſaith, <hi>He whom God hath ſent ſpeaketh the Words of God,</hi> not the Words of Men, or Angels, but of God; and this is true, both in Chriſt, and in his Seed.</p>
               <p>But now the falſe Prophets ſpeak not the Word of God, for they have it not in their Hearts; but what Word they have in their Hearts, that they ſpeak; and ſo they ſpeak the Words of their own Reaſon, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, or of other Mens, but beyond human Things they do not go, whether they pretend to high Notions on the one Hand, or to ſound orthodox Doctrine on the other Hand.</p>
               <p>Now of this true Chriſtians are to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Notice; becauſe, as the true Word of God is the greateſt Commodity to the Church that can be, and brings the Preſence of Chriſt, and all the Things of Chriſt along with it; ſo the Word of Man is the greateſt Miſchief to the Church that can be; for it brings Anti-chriſt, and his Kingdom, and all his Things along with it. And thus doth vain Philoſophy, and School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity (which is an unlawful mixing of Philoſophy with the outward Letter of the Word) pervert
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008578_0025_102F878F25E31CA8"/>all Things in the Church of carnal and falſe Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the true Prophets ſpeak the true Word of God, ſo alſo they ſpeak it by the true Spirit of God, and not by their own Spirit: And thus did Chriſt, who ſaith of himſelf, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel,</hi> and ſo he ſpake the Word of God by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they had received the Spirit, and then to go forth and preach; becauſe he knew they could not preach God's Word aright, without God's Spirit; and alſo Chriſt ſaith of all the Faithful, that <hi>it is not they that ſpeak, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their Father that ſpeaks in them;</hi> year, and the whole Goſpel is called, the Miniſtration of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now the true Prophets, ſpeaking the Word of God by and in his Spirit, do alſo ſpeak it in the right Senſe, and after the true Mind of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, and of other Believers who had received the Spirit, <hi>We have the Mind of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the falſe Prophets, though they ſpeak the Word of the Letter exactly, and that according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the very Original, and Curioſity of Criticiſms, yet ſpeaking it without the Spirit, they are falſe Prophets before God and his true Church; ſeeing all right Prophecy hath proceeded from the Spirit in all Ages of the World, but eſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly it muſt ſo proceed in the Days of the New-Teſtament, wherein God hath promiſed the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Effuſion of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:008578_0026_102F8794B2B9EA88"/>
And they, ſpeaking the Word of the Letter without the Spirit, do wholly miſtake the Mind of Chriſt in all, and under the outward Letter of the Word of God do only bring in the Mind of Man. And this is one of the greateſt Deluſions, and moſt miſchievous Snares that can be laid in the Church, to bring in the Word of Chriſt without the Mind of Chriſt, yea, to bring in the Word of Chriſt, againſt the Mind of Chriſt, and according to the Mind of Anti-chriſt: This is the effectual Operation of Error, whereby all Hypocrites and falſe Chriſtians are deceived, and that without all Hope of Recovery.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, that the true Prophets bring the true Word, and bring it alſo by the true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and this manifeſts them to be of God; but the falſe, either bring not the true Word, or if they bring the Word in the Letter, yet they bring it without the Spirit, and thus it is manifeſt, they are not of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will object here; if a Man preach the Word in the Letter, even good, ſound and orthodox Doctrine, no Doubt but ſuch a Man is to be heard, and he may do much Good in the Church, though he wants Chriſt's Spirit: This I have heard from very many, who have though they have ſaid ſomething,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But to this I anſwer, That they who want Chriſt's Spirit, which is the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, though they preach the exact Letter of the Word, yet are falſe Prophets, and not to be heard by the Sheep.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:008578_0027_102F8796811BA930"/>
1. Becauſe, under the New-Teſtament, we are not to regard the Letter without the Spirit, but the Spirit as well as the Letter; yea, the Spirit more than the Letter: And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt ſhall deſtroy Anti-chriſt with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Mouth, and the Brightneſs of his coming:</hi> He ſcarce takes any Notice of the Letter, but calls the true Preaching of the Goſpel, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt's Mouth, or the Miniſtration of the Spirit. And therefore the ſpiritual People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not join to that Miniſtry, where the Spirit of Chriſt is wanting, though there be the outward Letter of the Word in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They that preach only the outward Letter of the Word without the true Spirit, they make all Things outward in the Church, and ſo carry the People, with whom they prevail, only to outward Things, to an outward Word, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip, outward Ordinances, outward Church, outward Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas, in the true Kingdom of Chriſt, all Things are inward and ſpiritual, and all the true Religion of Chriſt is written in the Soul and Spirit of Man, by the Spirit of God; and the Believer is the only Book, in which God himſelf writes his New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They who preach the outward Letter of the Word, though never ſo truly, without the Spirit, do (as hath been ſaid) wholly miſtake the Mind of Chriſt in the Word for want of the Spirit, which is the only true and infallible Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of his Mind; and ſo under the outward Letter of the Word, preach their own Mind,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008578_0028_102F879819725010"/>and not Chriſt's Mind; and do make all the Scriptures ſerve their own Turns, even their own wordly Ends and Advantages, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They that preach the outward Letter of the Word without the Spirit, can, with ſuch a Word, both live themſelves in all the inward Evils of corrupted Nature, and allow others to do ſo too. And thus the Goſpel, which, in the Spirit of it, is the Judgment of Sin, is made, in the Letter of it, the Covering for Sin, and the Encourager of it; ſeeing ſuch Men, who have the Letter of the Word in their Mouth, do live, in the inward Corruptions of their Hearts, more ſecurely and quietly than other Men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſt of all, let us know, that whoever doth agree with Chriſt never ſo exactly in the Letter, and yet differs from him in Spirit, is a very Anti-chriſt. And therefore, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in him that was poſſeſſed ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>We know thee who thou art, the holy One of God,</hi> and ſo agreed very exactly with the Goſpel in the Letter, yet Chriſt <hi>forbad them to ſpeak,</hi> becauſe they ſpake not by a right Spirit. And Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Whoever is not with me</hi> (that is, in the Spirit) <hi>is againſt me,</hi> though he have the ſame outward Letter of the Word with him.</p>
               <p>And ſo, as Chriſt builds up his Church by his Spirit through his Word; ſo Anti-chriſt builds up his Church by the Word without the Spirit: And Chriſt's Church and Anti-chriſt's do often differ very little or nothing in Word or Letter, yet do always infinitely differ in Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:008578_0029_102F879C4084F328"/>
Wherefore to conclude, let us know, that that Church that hath the Word, if it wants the Spirit, is Anti-chriſt's Church; and that that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry that uſeth the Word, and wants the Spirit, is Anti-chriſt's Miniſtry; and that all Works, Duties, Prayings, Preaching, Faſting, Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without Chriſt's Spirit, are nothing but the very Kingdom of Anti-chriſt, and the Abomination of Deſolation.</p>
               <p>And ſo I proceed to the ſecond general Rule of Trial, which I propounded, whereby we may diſcern the true Prophets of Chriſt from the falſe Prophets of Anti-chriſt, and that is,</p>
               <p>By the Truth of the Life of Chriſt, in Reference to his Office in the Word.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall give you many Trials, how you may certainly know and diſcern the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Anti-chriſt from the true, humble, and faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, before whom we are all preſent this Day, and before whoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal we ſhall all be judged, he knows, that I ſhall not purpoſely ſpeak any Thing at this Time, either to pleaſe myſelf, or to diſpleaſe you; but I ſhall deſire to ſpeak all out of very Faithfulneſs to him, who <hi>hath remembered me when I was in low Condition, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>

                  <hi>The firſt Sign then, whereby the true Prophets may be diſcerned from the falſe, is this,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the true Prophets are all ſent of God. So was Moſes whom God ſent to the Children of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008578_0030_102F879DD161A560"/>
                  <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and bid him tell them, that <hi>I AM, even the God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>hath ſent him to them;</hi> and he gave him a porportionable Meaſure of his Preſence, to cauſe them to believe it. And Chriſt, a greater Prophet than <hi>Moſes,</hi> even the Head of all the Children of God, ſaid by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> xlviii. 16. <hi>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not ſpoken in ſecret from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and now the Lord and his Spirit hath ſent me.</hi> And every where in the Goſpel, he ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, how <hi>be came not of himſelf, but his Father ſent him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Father ſent Chriſt, ſo Chriſt ſends all his Seed, the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, as is manifeſt, <hi>John</hi> xx. 21. where Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you;</hi> which he ſpake not only touching them, but touching all that ſhould believe in his Name through their Word: And <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith. <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 15. <hi>How ſhall they teach except they be ſend?</hi> So that true Preaching comes from true ſending, and this comes from the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Now I deſire you farther to take Notice, that God hath reckoned the Choice of his Miniſters, one of the weightieſt Things that belong unto his Kingdom; wherefore he would never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruſt of this to any Sort of Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Yea, Chriſt himſelf did not chooſe his Diſciples at his own human Will, but only at the Will of God, and therefore was much in Prayer before he choſe them.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtles themſelves durſt not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they were all met together, chooſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008578_0031_102F87A2051ECE68"/>any one into the Room of <hi>Judas,</hi> but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to Prayer, and deſired the Lord to ſhew whom he had choſen. And <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. the Spirit ſaid, <hi>Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the Work whereunto I have called them.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that he was an Apoſtle, <hi>not of Men, nor by Men, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which Scriptures we may perceive what Care the Lord hath always had, to ſend his own Miniſters himſelf into his own Church, and would have his true Church receive no Miniſters but ſuch as he ſends them.</p>
               <p>And the great and chief Sending into the Church is from God himſelf, as we ſee in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Prophets, and in Chriſt himſelf, the Head of them, and in all the Apoſtles, and in all Believers.</p>
               <p>Now the Proof of a Man's ſending from God is this, to be anointed with the Spirit; as <hi>John</hi> xx. 22. when Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you, he breathed upon them, and ſaid, receive the holy Spirit:</hi> For his Father ſent him only by pouring out his Spirit on him; and he ſends them ſo only; and he that ſaith, <hi>The Unction of the Spirit alone is not ſufficient for the Miniſtry of the New-Teſtament,</hi> he denies Chriſt and his Apoſtles to have been ſufficient Miniſters, and he perverts the Scripture, and ſeduces the People.</p>
               <p>Now the true Teachers, through the pouring forth of the Spirit on them, they do truly know Chriſt himſelf, and the great Myſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008578_0032_102F87A39BDF0280"/>and all the Things that are freely given us of God; and they are alſo filled with Love to their Brothren, and are enabled to confeſs the Truth, and to do thereafter, and to contemn the World, and patiently to ſuffer Rebukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which is a ſufficient Proof of any One's ſending from God.</p>
               <p>And thus the true Prophets are all ſent of God, which is their great Comfort and Support in all Trouble and Difficulties, becauſe <hi>he that ſends them, is ſtill with them. Lo</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I am with you always, to the End of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, on the contrary, the falſe Prophets and Miniſters of Anti-Chriſt are not ſent of God, but are ſent and appointed by Men, and that thro' their own Deſire and Seeking. And of ſuch the Lord complains, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. 21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran; I have not ſpoken to them, yet they propheſied:</hi> But <hi>becauſe I ſent them not, neither commanded them, they ſhall not profit this People at all, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Verſe 32.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Many falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, ſhall ariſe; i. e.</hi> are not ſent of God, but ſhall ariſe of themſelves. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> xx. <hi>Out of yourſelves ſhall Men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe Things, to draw Diſciples after them.</hi> They ariſe of themſelves, they are not ſent of God.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch Teachers as theſe do uſually ſpring up in the Church, through academical Degrees, and eccleſiaſtical Ordination; which two Things have poured forth into the Church whole Swarms of falſe Prophets, and Anti-chriſtian Miniſters,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008578_0033_102F87A531960010"/>never ſent of God, nor anointed of his Spirit, to the irreparable Damage, Prejudice, and Ruin of the People and Nations who have received them, with their falſe and poiſonful Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Wherefore all thoſe Teachers who are not ſent of the Lord and his Spirit, but ariſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and come into the Church in the Strength and Might of their Degrees and Orders, they are all falſe Prophets.</p>

And ſo alſo our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Days of his Fleſh, how bold was he in his Miniſtry, coming in the Name of the Lord, and having his Authority and Doctrine from him! How boldly did he reprove the Scribes and Phariſees, the chief Teachers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church! And what a clear and glorious Confeſſion of the Truth of God, did he hold forth againſt all their Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Contradiction?</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtles, when the Rulers, Elders, and Scribes, and <hi>Annas,</hi> the High Prieſt, and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and all the Kindred of the High Prieſt were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and threatened them, and ſtraitly charged them, to preach no more in that Name, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Whether it be right in the Sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye: For we cannot but ſpeak the Things which we have ſeen and heard,</hi> Acts iv. 19.</p>

But the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (as hath been ſaid) do only take their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Chriſt for what they teach, and are bold in his Name only, to hold it forth: And ſo after they have publiſhed the Word in Faith, in the ſame Faith they leave the Maintenance and defending of it to him alone, whoſe Word it is; and they neither publiſh it for Man's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor ſmother it for Man's forbidding.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thoſe Teachers, who have not their Warrant from Chriſt for their Doctrine, and are not bold in his Name alone, but do derive all their Authority and Encouragement from Men, to ſpeak and act in the Things of God, they are all falſe Prophet s, and Miniſters of Anti-Chriſt.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtles alſo of the Lord, after they had received the Spirit, did go up and down the World, only preaching Jeſus, and Repentance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins in his Name.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul,</hi> a laborious Preacher, through the Grace of God, did renounce and reject all his worldly Learning, and all his human Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments and Excellencies in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and preached nothing but the right Knowledge of Chriſt, and right Faith in him, as he himſelf teſtifies, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying, <hi>What Things were Gain to me, thoſe I counted Loſs for Chriſt; yea doubtleſs, and I count all Things but Loſs for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the Loſs of all Things, and do count them but Dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having

               <p>But, on the contrary, the falſe Teachers preach nothing leſs than Chriſt, and Faith in him: But they chiefly teacher the Law, and moral Doctrine, and Works, or elſe Philoſophical Subtilties and Speculations, which yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath expreſly forbidden, <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 8, ſaying to the Faithful, <hi>Beware leſt any Man ſpoil you thro' Philoſophy and vain Deceit, after the Tradition of Men, after the Elements of the World, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt; for in him dwells the Fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily; and ye are compleat in him, who is the Head of all Principality and Power:</hi> And ſo we need not turn from Chriſt to Philoſophy, that vain Deceit.</p>

               <p>Thus Chriſt taught his Diſciples, out of the Love of God; as he ſaith, <hi>I delight to do thy Will, O my God, yea thy Law is within my Heart;</hi> that is, his Love to God. And alſo out of Love to his Brother; for having loved his own, he loved them to the End; and out of this Love taught them; as he ſaith, <hi>I have called you Friends; for whatſoever I have heard from my Father, I have declared unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as he taught out of Love himſelf, ſo he hath commanded all his Seed to teach one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the ſame Love, and hath given them his Spirit, which is Love, that thereby they might love both him, and their Brethren; and therefore Chriſt (knowing how difficult a Work it was, to feed his Sheep with the right and ſound Doctrine of the Goſpel; and that none could or would perform this, except they loved Chriſt from their very Heart Root) ſaid thrice to <hi>Peter, Peter, doſt thou love me? Doſt thou love me? Doſt thou love me? Then feed my Sheep, my Lambs, my Sheep:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to teach the Goſpel.</hi> And the Fruit of the Spirit, in all Believers, being Love; in this
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008578_0039_102F87BC766D22D0"/>brotherly Love, they ſerve one another in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And as Chriſt himſelf did not ſell his ſpiritual Travel to his Church, for worldly Profit or Gain; no more do his true Seed and Servants; for ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts xx. 33. <hi>I have coveted no Man's Silver, or Gold, or Apparel; yea, yourſelves know, that theſe Hands have miniſtered to my Neceſſity, and to them who were with me:</hi> And 2 Cor. xii. 14. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the third Time I am ready to come to you, I will not be burdenſome to you, for I ſeek not yours, but you.</hi> And Verſe 17. <hi>Did I make a Gain of you, by any of them whom I ſent unto you? Or did</hi> Titus <hi>make a Gain of you? Walked we not both in the ſame Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the true Teachers do not ſeek any temporal Gain or Commodity, from the Hands of Men, by their preaching, but do truly and cheerfully teach out of the Love of Chriſt, and their Brother.</p>
               <p>But, on the contrary, the falſe Teachers, tho' they do not teach the Goſpel (being deſtitute of the Spirit) but vain Philoſophy and human Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines inſtead of it, yet will they live by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and not by the Labour of their Hands, in a lawful Calling; they will have the temporal Goods of the Church, and yet not miniſter the ſpiritual Treaſure of it; and what they do mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter they do it for Reward, as it is written, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> iii. 11. <hi>The Prieſts teach for Hire, and the Prophets divine for Money; and he that putteth not into their Mouths, they even prepare War againſt him.</hi>

And to ſhew they preach for the Love of Gain, they are brought up to the Miniſtry as to a Trade to live by; and they run in this Way, from one Place to another, from a leſſer to a greater Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and where they may gain moſt of this World, there will they be ſure to be: Yea, ſo much are they addicted to their worldly Advantage, that they had rather Chriſt's Kingdom ſhould never be ſet up in the World, nor Anti-chriſt's never be thrown down than ſuffer any Loſs or Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution in their Profit, Power, Dignity, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or in any worldly Thing, whereof they have got the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Wherefore they that teach Chriſt, not for the Love of Chriſt, and their Brother, but for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Gain, and worldly Advantage only, are all of them falſe Teachers, and Miniſters of Anti-chriſt.</p>

So that true Teachers do not preach the Word to win to themſelves Glory in the World, and Praiſe, and Applauſe from Men; but do rather ſeek the Glory of God by their Doctrine, though Hypocrites and carnal People, for this Cauſe do deride and ſcorn them.</p>
               <p>But, on the contrary, the falſe Teachers ſeek above all Things their own Glory by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and to this End,</p>

                  <item>4. To this End alſo, they ſpeak in the Words which Man's Wiſdom teacheth, and ſo mingle Philoſophy with Divinity, and think to credit the Goſpel with Terms of Art, and do ſprinkle their Sermons with <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latin,</hi> as with

               <p>In a Word, they preach all Things in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Spirit to the World, that they by all may get Glory to themſelves, and may be accounted, with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> ſome great Ones.

               <p>The true Preachers and Miniſters of Chriſt, when they are oppoſed, reſiſted, ſlandered and perſecuted for the Word's Sake, they endure it with all Meekneſs, Humility and Patience. Thus Chriſt endured all the Reproaches, Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Revilings, and Perſecutions from the <hi>Jew;</hi> and <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatened not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 23.

Now a curſt Dog, lying on a rich Garment, or ſoft Carpet, at his Eaſe, as long as he may lie ſtill he is very quiet, but if you would remove him from his Place, he ſoon ſnarls and flies at you, and ſhews of what Mettle he is made. So the falſe Teachers, who have gotten a carnal Knowledge of the Word, and have thereby got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Preferment, and great Advantages in the World, they lie quiet on theſe ſoft Things, as long as they may lie ſtill; but if any ſeek by the Word of God to rouze them up from theſe Things, they riſe up like angry Dogs, and bark at them, and rend them, as much as they can or dare.</p>

               <p>Thus did Jeſus Chriſt, as was foretold by <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi> Chap. 1. 5. where Chriſt ſaith by his Spirit, <hi>The Lord hath opened mine Ear, and I was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, neither turned away back; I gave my Back to the Smiters, and my Cheeks to them who plucked off the Hair; I hid not my Face from Shame and Spitting.</hi> And in the Days of his Fleſh, how willingly did he ſeal to the Truth of his New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Doctrine with his Suffering, and ſuffered himſelf to be apprehended by the Hands of Men, and to be crucified, when he could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Legions of Angels for his Succour, if he
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008578_0048_102F87D62983B368"/>had pleaſed, and would not have made uſe of his own Infinite and Almighty Power.</p>
               <p>And this Submiſſion and Willingneſs to ſuffer for the Truth, Chriſt hath commanded all his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>He that will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it; and he that will loſe his Life for my Sake ſhall ſave it:</hi> And <hi>if any Man will be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, let him deny himſelf, take up the Croſs, and follow me:</hi> And again, <hi>I ſend you forth as Sheep among Wolves, and ye ſhall be brought before Kings and Rulers for my Name's Sake,</hi> that is, for the true and ſpiritual Teaching of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now as nothing will procure us more Enmity, than the ſpiritual holding forth of the Goſpel, which will cauſe the worldly Church to caſt out our Name as evil, and to caſt our Perſons out of their Synagogues, yea, and alſo to kill us, when they can get Power; ſo, if we be true Teachers, muſt we be ready and willing to ſuffer all this for Chriſt's Name's Sake.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thoſe Teachers who embrace the Heighth and Honour of this Life, and will not own the Goſpel of Chriſt, farther than they may thereby procure to themſelves Credit, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Profit, and Preferment in World; and to this End, in doubtful and difficult Times, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves ſo ſubtilly, that whatever Party ſhall prevail, they may ſtill ſtand on their Legs, and enjoy their preſent Proſperity and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo are neither hot nor cold, neither truly for the Truth, nor openly againſt the Truth, but ſeek by all ſubtil Means to decline the Croſs of Chriſt. And though in Chriſt himſelf, they
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008578_0049_102F740BC77C5220"/>praiſe his Meanneſs, Plaineſs, Simplicity, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and Croſs, yet they themſelves are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and cannot endure theſe Things for Chriſt's Sake in themſelves, but bend and frame the whole Courſe of their Miniſtry ſo, as they may obtain all good Things from the World, and avoid and eſcape all evil Things from it; theſe all are falſe Prophets, and Miniſters of Anti-chriſt.</p>
               <p>By theſe nine Signs (for I ſhall name no more now) may the true Prophets and Miniſters of Chriſt be manifeſtly diſtinguiſhed and diſcerned from the falſe Ones of Anti-chriſt, by all the true People of God, who have received his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Now let God and his Word be true, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man a Liar.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall make but two Uſes of this Diſcourſe briefly, and ſo conclude for this Time. And the firſt ſhall be to thoſe of you, who are ſpiritual Chriſtians; and the ſecond to the carnal Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> You who are true Believers, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Chriſtians, may judge aright, by what you have heard, of the preſent Clergy, or common Miniſtry of the Nation; and may ſee, by the clear Light of the Word, that they, for the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them, are not true, but falſe Prophets; not the Miniſters of Chriſt, but of Anti-chriſt; not ſent of God, nor anointed by his Spirit, but ordained and appointed by Men, at their own Deſire and Seeking, for worldly Advantage Sake; Men who ſtand and miniſter in the Church, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Strength of their academical Degrees,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:008578_0050_102F8717B87F2A50"/>and eccleſiaſtical Ordination, but do not ſtand and feed the People in the Strength of the Lord, and in the Majeſty of the Name of their God. And this corrupt Miniſtry, or carnal Clergy, have deceived the People and Nations, with a corrupt and carnal Underſtanding of Chriſt, and of the Scriptures, and of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of the Government of his Kingdom, and of all the Things of Chriſt: Yea, they have, under the Name and Pretence of Chriſt, ſet up a Church to Anti-chriſt every where, and do continually miſlead Thouſands of poor Souls, and carry them Captive to Hell, and that under the Colour and Pretence of Religion.</p>
               <p>And this, I ſay, is the great Evil in theſe falſe Teachers, that, under the Name of Chriſt, they fight againſt Chriſt, and under the Name of the Word, they fight againſt the Word, and under the Name of the Church, they fight againſt the Church: And this is a grievous Abomination of Deſolation in the Temple of God, that they who ſhould be the Chief for the Truth, are the Chief againſt it; and that they who ſhould be faithful Witneſſes to the holy Truth of Chriſt, ſhould prove lying Witneſſes againſt it. If a prophane Perſon, or Heathen, ſhould do this, it would be Wickedneſs and Impiety even in them; but this is horrible Abomination, and Anti-chriſtianiſm in the Church of Chriſt; that they, who are come into it as Friends, and have obtained the chief Places in it, ſhould yet, under this Vizard, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very Enemies, and Seducers, and Hinderers of the Word of Chriſt crucified. Wherefore,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008578_0051_102F871D92DF4C80"/>ſaith the Truth againſt ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lv. 12. <hi>It was not an Enemy that reproached me, then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me, that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified himſelf againſt me, for then I would have hid myſelf from him; but it was thou, a Man, mine Equal, my Guide, and my Acquaintance; we took ſweet Counſel together, and walked unto the Houſe of God in Company,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And ſo theſe falſe Teachers are theſe familiar Enemies, who exerciſe all their Hatred under the Pretence of Love, all their Enmity under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Friendſhip, and practiſe all their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs under a Form of Godlineſs; and by this Subtilty have they deceived the World. They will not plainly contradict the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles and Chriſt, in the Letter of it, but will pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſpeak well of it; but yet they are utter Enemies to the true and ſpiritual Meaning of it, both in their Lives and Doctrine: And the more theſe Men make a Shew of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Holineſs, the greater Anti-chriſts they be in the Church.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to you who are true Chriſtians, and have received an Anointing from God, this is the Word and Charge of God, <hi>Come out from among them, my People, and touch not the unclean Thing;</hi> that is, their carnal Doctrine; have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with ſuch Prophets and Miniſters, but remember what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> x. that <hi>his Sheep hear his Voice, and will not hear the Voice of Strangers; for they know the Voice of Strangers.</hi> And if any of you live in any Town or Pariſh, where ſuch falſe Prophets are, though they go
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008578_0052_102F8721B08FA400"/>under the Name of Godly and Orthodox, yet touch not the unclean Things; but know, that it is better for you Believers to aſſemble together among yourſelves, though you be but few, than to communicate with the falſe Prophets in their falſe Ordinances; ſeeing Chriſt hath promiſed his Preſence to his Believers, even where but <hi>two or three meet together in his Name;</hi> yea, he hath ſaid, <hi>If any two of you ſhall agree together to aſk any Thing on Earth, it ſhall be done of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And if you, having theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhall meet together among yourſelves, in the Name and Spirit of Chriſt, in the Uſe of the Word and Prayer of Faith, lo Chriſt himſelf will be with you; and though you be but few, yet are you the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth, and of that very Church, againſt which the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail. And thus much to you ſpiritual Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And now for the carnal Clergy, or falſe Prophets, their Burden is this from the Lord. You have run when you were not ſent; you have ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> when the Lord hath not ſpoken by you; you have grieved the Hearts of the Faithful, and ſtrengthened the Hands of the Wicked; you have been forward to advance the Form of Godlineſs, whilſt you have been bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Enemies to the Power of it; you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Nations, and made them drunk with the Cup of the Wine of your Fornications; you have done more againſt Chriſt and his true Church, and more for Anti-chriſt and his falſe
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:008578_0053_102F87250B55D330"/>Church, than all the People in theſe Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. Wherefore this is the Word of the Lord God to you, throughout all your Quarters, that the Nations ſhall not much longer be deceived by you, nor buy any more of your Merchandize; for your Wine is the Poiſon of Dragons, and the cruel Venom of Aſps; your Doctrine being the Word of Philoſophy, and not of Faith; after the Mind of Man, but contrary to Chriſt's Mind; to ſet up yourſelves, and your own Intereſt, to the Prejudice of Chriſt's Word and People. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how much you have glorified yourſelves, and lived deliciouſly by this Trade, of making Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of the Word of God, ſo much Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sorrow ſhall God give you, and your Plagues ſhall come upon you in a Day, and your Judgment in an Hour; and your Lovers ſhall not be able to help you, nor the Petitioners for you, to uphold you; but God ſhall bring you down wonderfully, by the clear Light of his Word, and his mighty and unreſiſtable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence accompanying it; and the World ſhall tremble and wonder at the Noiſe of your Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal; and the Heavens, and holy Apoſtles, and Prophets, ſhall rejoice over you, when God ſhall avenge their Cauſe upon you. And the Lord will ſave his Flock; and they ſhall be no more a Prey to you, neither ſhall you any more ſerve yourſelves of them. And he will ſet up one Shepherd over them, even Jeſus Chriſt; and he ſhall feed them, and be their Shepherd. And till theſe Things be fully brought to paſs, you ſhall be cloathed with Trembling, when you
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008578_0054_102F872750E64B40"/>ſhall perceive the Lord is riſen up to perform all theſe Things, according to his Word.</p>
               <p>And now for Concluſion, if any of you, or moſt of you, or all of you, are offended at theſe Things, in ſuch Sort, that you cannot contain yourſelves from Anger and bitter Zeal, I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to conſider ſeriouſly, how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more profitable to your eternal Salvation it would be, for you to reſiſt and to refrain from ſuch Evil and unchriſtian Paſſions, and that you would rather (if there be any Hope) return to your own Hearts, and try your Works, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before our holy and righteous Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn truly and ſpeedily to Chriſt from Anti-chriſt, leſt you be inwrapped both in his temporal and eternal Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And thus much was delivered to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity Congregation in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for a Teſtimony againſt them, except they repent.</p>
