            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus it was with the People of <hi>Judah,</hi> they were at preſent in great Proſperity: <hi>Iſa</hi> 2.7. <hi>Their Land is full of Silver and Gold, neither is there any end of their treaſures, their Land is alſo full of Horſes, neither is there any end of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots.</hi> But they carried themſelves very bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: We have an Account in general, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9 <hi>Their tongue and their doings are againſt the Lord to provoke the Eyes of his Glory, the ſhow of their Countenance doth witneſs againſt them, and they declare their Sin as Sodom, and hide it not.</hi> In particular they were guilty of Idolatry, <hi>Chap</hi> 2 <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Their Land is full of.

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001146_0005_0FB08EEDA1FB2860"/>
For the underſtanding of the words,</p>
            <p>Conſider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who he would take away? <hi>A.</hi> In general, Uſefull Men: ſuch as in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Capacities were very Serviceable and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Common-wealth; Men that were an honour to the Land, and capable to advance and promote the Wellfare of it. Some by reaſon of their injoyments, as the <hi>Mighty Men:</hi> ſome by reaſon of their qualifications, as the <hi>Prudent,</hi> the <hi>Artificer,</hi> and the <hi>Oratour:</hi> ſome by reaſon of their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the <hi>Ancient:</hi> ſome by reaſon of the Offices and Stations that they were in, in the Common wealth, as the <hi>Judge,</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> the <hi>Counſellor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How does he threaten to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? <hi>A.</hi> As a Judgment on the Publick Society. There might be anger againſt ſome of them: ſome of them might be taken away in anger againſt themſelves, as <hi>Saul: God took him away in his wrath, Hoſ.</hi> 13 11. Some of them may be taken away in mercy to themſelves: <hi>they are taken away from the Evil to come, Iſa.</hi> 57 1. But here it is threatned as a Publick Calamity; that which enfeebles the Common wealth, and expoſes them to ſorrow. God may take ſuch away by Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, in Battle, by Captivity: he does not
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001146_0006_0FB08EF4C7A1EB20"/>ſay that he will take away all ſuch, but many of them.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>
                  <hi>There is many times a Great Frown in</hi> GODS <hi>taking away thoſe that are Eminently <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefull.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>GOD has many ways to puniſh a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient People; ſometimes he puniſhes them by Wars, by Sickneſſes, by Inundations, by Earthquakes, by Fires, by Blaſtings, by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Diviſion; this is one among the reſt, by the Death of Uſefull men. There may be a great Frown in Gods taking away ſuch Young men, as were hopefull to be men for Publick Service; as when he took away <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi> Son: ſo eſpecially when he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuch as were men of Service: this is not alwayes a Frown, for if God have no Controverſy with his People, yet ſuch muſt dye according to the courſe of Nature; but ordinarily it is a Frown: Uſefull and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable men are a Publick Bleſſing; and it is a Publick Frown when God removes them: as God Frowns upon a People, when he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Health, their Peace, their Wealth;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001146_0007_0FB08EF76AF423B8"/>ſo he does likewiſe when he takes away thoſe that were a means to preſerve their ſpiritual and outward Proſperity: Men that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Uſefull are the Pillars of the Church &amp; the Common-wealth, &amp; it is a great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Society when ſuch are removed. God ſmiles upon a People, when he raiſes up Serviceable men, and he Frowns upon them, when he ſnatches ſuch away: many times it is a token of great anger when ſuch men are removed, and they feel the bitter effects thereof many years after: when their Lives are loſt, the Publick Society has a great loſs: much of the Proſperity of a People is buried in the Graves of Uſeful men. <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Death and <hi>Joſiahs</hi> gave a deadly wound to the People of <hi>Judah,</hi> and was matter of great Mourning, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 35.25. <hi>Jeremiah Lamented for Joſiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe Uſefull men are an Honour to the People. Uſefull men are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Account Honourable. Their Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs does command Reputation: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve reſpect and a good report upon that account. 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 9 6. <hi>He is an honourable man.</hi> 2 King. 5.1. <hi>He was honourable, becauſe by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.</hi> And their honourableneſs does reflect
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001146_0008_0FB08EF902D4C6F8"/>honour upon the People that they belong unto. As vile baſe men are a reproach and diſgrace to the People that they belong unto, men are aſhamed of them; ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and uſefull men are an honour to the place. It was an honour to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that there were ſo many Worthies in the Land in the dayes of <hi>David.</hi> It is a commendation of a People in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: Uſefull men are an honour to all that are related to them. An Uſefull man is an honour to his Parents, to his Children, to his Wife, to the place of his Nativity, to the place where he Lives: Honourable men make the place renowned where they dwell: it is an honour to a People to have choice men for Magiſtrates and for Miniſters; it raiſes the Eſtimation of a People in the Eye of the World. <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppreſsour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</hi> that is, ſuch as ſuppreſs and ſubdue their Enemies. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.5. <hi>Of Sion it ſhall be ſaid, this and that man was born in her.</hi> And when ſuch men are removed the honour of a People is diminiſhed; their Eſtimation and renown does decay and wither away: their honour will ſink becauſe the foundation of it is taken away; thoſe that ſupported it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001146_0009_0FB08EFFDC955A30"/>are removed: So they loſe much of that fame and reſpect that they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Becauſe ſuch men have a great intereſt in the affection of others. Uſeful men diſcover Love: their qualifications are love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and their Service draws forth Love: the Conſciences of other men doe give a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto them, and their hearts are Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated thereby. Partly from the teſtimony of their Conſcience, and partly from a ſence of their own benefit, they have a Love to ſuch men, and cannot but prize them; they love to ſee them, and love to converſe with them. <hi>Job</hi> 29.11, 12. <hi>When the ear heard me then it bleſſed me, and when the eye ſaw me it gave witneſs unto me, becauſe I delivered the poor that cryed, the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him.</hi> 1 Sam. 18.16. <hi>All Iſrael and Judah loved David, becauſe he went out and came in before them.</hi> And becauſe they have an affection to them, it is an affliction to have them removed. If a man have a great affection to his Wife or his Child, it is the greater affliction to have them taken away. People are ſmitten with grief and ſorrow at the Death of ſuch Perſons, their hearts are wounded, their joy is turned into ſorrow, it makes them goe with heavy hearts.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001146_0010_0FB08F012D24FDD8"/>2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>And David Lamented with this Lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Becauſe ſuch men doe procure a great deal of Good and prevent a great deal of Calamity. They are profitable to the Societies that they did belong to. So was <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.16. <hi>They buried him in the City of David among the Kings, becauſe he had done good in Iſrael, both towards God, and towards his houſe:</hi> When ſuch men are Dead People many times want their Service, and ſo are expoſed to a great deal of Calamity, which by their preſence might have been prevented.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some by their Juſtice do a great deal of good. They are careful to deliver them that are innocent. Many men would make a prey of others, and under pretences of Law devour the Eſtates of other men, but while thoſe that are in Authority are men of Juſtice, they will give no countenance to ſuch things. Job 29.15, 16, 17. <hi>I was Eyes to the blind, and Feet was I to the lame, I was a Father to the poor, and the cauſe that I knew not I ſearched out: and I brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the ſpoil out of his teeth.</hi> So
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001146_0011_0FB08F02B8FD3BC0"/>did <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 8.15. <hi>David Entented Judgment and Juſtice to all his people:</hi> So <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> Jer. 22.15. <hi>Did not thy Father do Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Juſtice.</hi> Such men will not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled by affection, bribed by mens Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or frighted with their greatneſs: <hi>Job</hi> 31.34. <hi>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of Families terrifie me, that I kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and went not out of the door.</hi> But after ſuch men are dead, ſometimes inſtead of the Firr-tree comes up the thorn, and inſtead of the mirtle-tree comes up the briar; men get into Place of Power, that prevent Judgment, that incourage thoſe that are wicked. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>Thy ſilver is become droſs, thy wine mixed with water, thy Princes are, rebellions, and companions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards, they judge not the fatherleſs, neither doth the cauſe of the Widow come unto them.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Some by their valour. Leading men, that have been men of valour, have done mighty Service to their Country: they have been inſtruments under God to ſave it out of the hands of Enemies; and to inlarge the Dominions of the Country: Valour inables men to look dangers in the face; makes

That was one thing wherein the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were more happy than other people; they had good Laws preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto them. <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous, as

But good Laws will ſignifie little, if the men that are at Helm, be not fitted for Service. Laws are like a Sword, which if it be kept in a Scabbard will do no Execution The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had very good Laws, Laws given them by God himſelf, yet many times were very miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Laws are like Phyſick, which if it be not adminiſtred, or duly adminiſtred, does no ſervice. Laws as written may do a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good, but as Executed do far more: The Execution of the Law does rectify miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages paſt, and prevent miſcarriages for the time to come. But good Laws will be as a noſe of wax, as the Papiſts ſay of the Scripture, if <hi>Joel</hi> and <hi>Abiah</hi> have the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.3. <hi>They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after lucre, took bribes, and perverted judgment.</hi>

1. Some do it under a notion, that they have ſuch and ſuch Infirmities. But if we grant that they have, (though ſome men count thoſe things faults and infirmities that are none;) yet they may not be deſpiſed. <hi>Humanum eſt Errare,</hi> where ſhall we find men without infirmities? If <hi>David</hi> acted raſhly in the matter of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> muſt he be deſpiſed? If <hi>Aſa</hi> did not take away the high places, muſt he be deſpiſed? If <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> was overſeen in joyning with <hi>Ahab,</hi> muſt he be deſpiſed? If <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> heart were lifted up when the Ambaſſadours came from <hi>Babylon,</hi> muſt he be deſpiſed? If it were a precipitate thing for <hi>Joſiah</hi> to take the field againſt the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> muſt he be deſpiſed? Men at the beſt are but men compaſſed about with infirmities. God honours men though they have infirmities. 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 19 3. <hi>Nevertheleſs there are good things found in thee.</hi> God hears the Prayers of his People, though they have infirmities. <hi>James</hi> 5.17. <hi>Elias was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are, and he Prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth, by the ſpace of three years and ſix months.</hi> Their infirmities are a diſhonour unto them, but they are to be honoured notwithſtanding
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001146_0021_0FB08F281471A868"/>their infirmities: infirmities are blemiſhes, but yet <hi>They</hi> may be praiſe worthy for all them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some do it under a notion that we have plenty of men ſit for choice Service. That we want rather Offices for men than men for Offices: the Country it full of able men. It is very fit that we ſhould take notice of what there is of that nature with thankfulneſs: But indeed many things muſt meet together to make men meet for ſome Offices. He that may do God and his Country good Service, in a lower Station, may be altogether unfit for an higher Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Country runs low enough in men. We have nothing to boaſt of but have cauſe to be humbled before God, that there be ſo few every way accompliſhed for Publick Service; it is a ſmall matter in ſuch a Country as this to make a Profeſſion of Religion. Some that carry pretty well are not like them that went before them. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14 3. <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not like David his Father.</hi> When the foundation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple was laid, the young men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, but the old men wept.</p>

3. Some do it under a notion that they might have been more Serviceable. It is acknowledged that they do a pretty deal of Service; but men deſpiſe them becauſe they had Opportunity and Advantage to have done more. But if the thing be true, yet they are to be honoured on the account of what they have done: if they had had more zeal and induſtry and of a Publick Spirit, it had been better: yet poſſibly they have been great bleſſings: if through miſtake they did not rectify ſome abuſes, if tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did prevail with them, to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent than they ſhould, yet they are not to be deſpiſed. Where is the man that might not have done more good, than he has done? Neither <hi>Aſa's</hi> nor <hi>Jehoſhaphats,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Reformation were ſo perfect as <hi>Joſiahs,</hi> yet they were men greatly to be honoured.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some do it under a notion that they were Ancient. They were grown old, and had leſs activity than before, that their Judgment and Memory began to fail them. But we find in Scripture the <hi>Ancient and the Honourable</hi> joyned together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.15. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men are to be honoured on the account
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001146_0023_0FB08F2B26882E78"/>of what they have done. <hi>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of Righteouſneſs, Prov.</hi> 16.31. Ancient men are to be honoured upon the account of their Prudence and Experience; the <hi>Prudent and the Ancient</hi> are joyned together in the Text. <hi>Job</hi> 12.12. <hi>With the Ancient is Wiſdom.</hi> The Ancient men that ſtood before <hi>Solomon,</hi> might be thought timerous and inclining to dotage by <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> but it would have been well for him, if he had followed their advice: They were fitter to give counſel than he was to receive it.</p>

               <p>That God is removing Serviceable man from among us.

1. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That God has removed one that has been along while Serviceable. That has been improved about Publick Service for above <hi>Fifty Years:</hi> he has been Serviceable unto the Country in general, and in ſpecial among our ſelves. He hath had the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal management of our Military Affairs, and our Civil Affairs: and laboured much in the ſetling of moſt of our Plantations, has managed things with Induſtry, Prudence and Moderation. He hath been careful in time of War, and as there has been occaſion, he has been a Peace Maker among us, and helpfull in compoſing of differences: he has diſcountenanced Rude and Vicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, bearing his Teſtimony againſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be feared that we ſhall feel the ſorrowful effects of his removal a long while. Some times when Parents dye, Children don't at preſent ſo much feel the want of them, as they do afterwards. We may have occaſion afterwards to remember with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that we had ſuch an One among us: Though we have other Uſeful men, yet there may ariſe ſuch Caſes wherein there may be great need of his conduct and help. He was honourable and had great influence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001146_0025_0FB08F35F08D1B90"/>upon men in Authority abroad, and upon the People at home, and had more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by far, than any other among us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This comes in Conjunction with other Sorrows. We are under an expectation of Trouble from Enemies; and are under the heavy Hand of God, in the Diſeaſes that prevail in the Land. The Afflictions of our principal Town are very great, many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are Mourning over their Dead. God is pleading his Controverſy with us in that Terrible Mortality, and in ſuch a day as this, God has added this Affliction to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate our Sorrow; if it had come alone, it had been heavy, but now we have one wave and billow upon another. Our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are like <hi>Jobs,</hi> one comes upon the neck of another. There was great anger before, but God ſees cauſe to make this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it: Our Cup was bitter before, this makes it more bitter: if it had come in a time of Proſperity, it had been ſad, but being in a time of Adverſity, it is more ſad. It is the manner of God many times to comfort his People in their Affliction, but he is adding to the grief of them that were wounded before.</p>
