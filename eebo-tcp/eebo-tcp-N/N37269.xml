            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ABOUT the latter end of the month of March, or the beginning of April of the year 1782, the weſtern indians began to make incurſions upon the frontier of Ohio, Waſhington, Youghagany and Weſtmoreland counties, which has been their conſtant practice ever ſince the <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="2 letters">

by unavoidable accident were to be replaced by horſes taken in the enemy's country.</p>
            <p>The time appointed for the rendezvous, or general meeting of the volunteers, was fixed to be on the 20th May, and the place, the old Mingoe town on the weſt ſide of the river Ohio, about forty miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Fort Pitt by land, and I think about 75 by water.</p>
            <p>Col. Crawford was ſolicited by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral voice of theſe weſtern counties and diſtricts to command the expedition. He accordingly ſet out as volunteer and came to Fort Pitt two days before the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the aſſembling of the men. As there was no ſurgeon yet appointed to go with the expedition, Col. Crawford begged the favour of Gen. Irvine to permit me to accompany him, (my conſent having been previouſly aſked) to which the General a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed provided Col. Gibſon did not object.</p>
            <p>Having obtained permiſſion of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel I left Fort Pitton Tueſday, May 1ſt, &amp; the next day about one in the afternoon arrived at the Mingoe bottom. The volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers had not all croſſed the river until Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning the 24th then they diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:048810_0004_10268503A7BF81B0"/>
themſelves into eighteen companies, chooſing their captains by vote.</p>
            <p>There were choſen alſo, one Col. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, four field and one brigade-major.</p>
            <p>There were four hundred and ſixty five who voted.</p>
            <p>We began our march of Saturday May 25th, making almoſt a due weſt courſe, and and on the 4th, day reached the old Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian town upon the river Muſkingum, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 60 miles from the river Ohio. Some of the men having loſt their horſes on the night preceding returned home. Tueſday the 28th in the evening, Major Brenton, and Captain Bean, went ſome diſtance from camp to reconnoitre: Having gone about one quarter of a mile they ſaw two India is up on whom they fired, &amp; then returned to camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This was the firſt place in which we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as we underſtood afterwards. On Thurſday the 4th, of June, which was the eleventh day of our march, about one o'clock we came to the ſpot where the town of Sanduſky formerly ſtood: the inhabitants had moved 18 miles lower down the creek, near the lower Sanduſky; but as neither our guides nor any that were with us, had known any thing of their removal we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:048810_0005_1026850547A98C40"/>
to conjecture that there were no Indian towns nearer than the lower Sanduſky, which was at leaſt 40 miles diſtant.</p>
            <p>However, after refreſhing our horſes, we advanced on in ſearch of ſome of their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements but had ſcarcely got the diſtance of three or four miles from the old town when a number of our men expreſſed their deſire to return, ſome of them alledging they had only five day's proviſion: upon which the field officers and Captains, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, in council, to proceed that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and no longer. Previous to the calling of this council, a ſmall party of light horſe had been ſent forward to reconnoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here remark, by the way, that there are a great many extenſive plains in that country; the woods in general grow very thin, free from bruſh and underwood; ſo that light horſe-men may advance a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable diſtance before an army without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much expoſed to the enemy.</p>
            <p>Juſt as the council ended, an expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the above mentioned party of light horſe with intelligence, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>that they had been about three miles in front, and had ſeen a large body of Indians running
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:048810_0006_102685B75933ACE8"/>
towards them.—In a ſhort time we ſaw the reſt of the light horſe, who joined us, and having gone one mile further met a number of Indians who had partly gotten poſſeſion of a piece of woods before us, whilſt they were in the plains; but our men alighting from their horſes and ruſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods, ſoon obliged them to retreat from the place.</p>
            <p>The enemy being by this time reinforced, flanked to the right, and part of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our rear, quickly made the action more ſerious. The firing continued very warm on both ſides from four o'clock until the duſk of the evening: each party main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its ground. Next morning about ſix o'clock ſome guns were diſcharged at the diſtance of two or three hundred yards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which continued till day, doing little or no execution on either ſide.</p>
            <p>The field officers then aſſembled and a greed as the enemy were every moment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, &amp; we had already a number wounded, to retreat that night. The whole body was to form into three lines, keeping the wounded in the centre.</p>
            <p>We had four killed &amp; twenty three wounded, of the latter, ſeven very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:048810_0007_102685B9A1DD4BD8"/>
on which account as many biers were got ready to carry them; moſt of the reſt were ſlightly wounded, none ſo bad but they could ride on horſe-back. After dark the officers went on the out poſts, and brought in all the men as expeditiouſly as they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſt as the troops were about to form, ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral guns were fired by the enemy, upon which ſome of our men ſpoke our &amp; ſaid, our intention was diſcovered by the Indians who were ſiting alarm guns. Upon which ſome in front hurried off, &amp; the reſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed, leaving the ſeven men that were dangerouſly wounded, ſome of whom however got off on horſeback, by means of ſome good friends who waited for, and aſſiſted them.</p>
            <p>We had not got a quarter of a mile from the field of action, when I heard Col. Crawford calling for his ſon John Crawford his ſON-in-law Maj. Harriſon, Maj Roſe and William Crawford, his nephews, upon which I came up and told him I believed they were before us—He aſked was that the Docter? I told him it was; he then replied they were not in front, and begged of me not to leave him—I promiſed him I would not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:048810_0008_102685BB5E78FAC8"/>
We then waited &amp; continued calling for theſe men till the troops had paſſed us.</p>
            <p>The Col. told me his horſe had almoſt given out, that he could not keep up with the troops, and wiſhed ſome of his friends to remain with him: he then exclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the militia for riding off in ſuch an irregular manner, and leaving ſome of the wounded behind, contrary to his orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Preſently there came two men riding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, one of them an old man, the other a lad: we enquired if they had ſeen any of the above perſons? they anſwered they had not.</p>
            <p>By this time there was a very hot firing before us, and as we judged, near where, our main body muſt have been. Our courſe was then nearly ſouth-weſt, but changing it, we went north about two miles, the two men remaining in company with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves, to be now out of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's lines, we took an eaſt courſe, taking care to keep at the diſtance of fifteen or twenty yards apart, and directing ourſelves by the north ſtar.</p>
            <p>The old man often lagged behind, and when this was the caſe never failed to call for us to halt for him. When we were near
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:048810_0009_102685BEEBC5CB98"/>
the Sanduſky Creek he fell one hundred yards behind and bawled out, as uſual, for us to halt. While we were preparing to repri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand him for making a noiſe, I heard an Indian holloe, as I thouht 150 yards from the man, and partly behind him; and after this we did not hear the man call again, neither did he ever come upto us any more. It was now paſt midnight, and about day-break Col. Crawford's and the young man's horſes gave out, and they left them.</p>
            <p>We purſued our journey eaſt ward, and about two o'clock fell in with Capt. Biggs, who had carried Lieut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſhly from the fiield of action who had been dangerouſly wounded. We then went on about the ſpace of an hour, when a heavy rain coming on, we concluded it was beſt to encamp, as we were encumbered with the wounded officer.</p>
            <p>We then barked four or five trees, made an encampment and a fire in which place we remained that night. Next morning we again proſecuted our journey, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone about three miles, found a deer which had been recently killed. The meat was ſliced from the bones and bundled up in the ſkin, with a tomahawk lying by it. We carried all with us and in advancing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:048810_0010_102685C08A0E91D8"/>
one mile further, eſpying the ſmoke of a fire. We then gave the wounded officer into the charge of the young man, deſiring him to ſtay behind whilſt the Colonel, the Captain, and myſelf, walked up as cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we could toward the fire. When we came to it, we concluded from ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſome of our people had encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there the preceding night. We then went about roaſting the veniſon, and when juſt about to march obſerved one of our men coming upon our tracks He ſeemed at firſt very ſhy, but having called to him he came up and told us he was the perſon who killed the deer, but upon hearing us come up, was afraid of Indians, hid in a thicket and made off. Upon this we gave him ſome bread and roaſted veniſon and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all together on our journey: about two o'clock we came upon the paths by which we had gone out. <hi>C</hi>apt. Biggs and myſelf did not think it ſafe to keep the road. but the <hi>C</hi>olonel ſaid the <hi>I</hi>ndians would not follow the troops farther than the plains, which we were conſiderably paſt. As the wounded of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer rode <hi>C</hi>apt. Biggs' horſe <hi>I</hi> let the <hi>C</hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mine, the <hi>C</hi>olonel and myſelf went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:048810_0011_102685C2EA97EA58"/>
one hundred yards in front, the <hi>C</hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the wonded officer in the centre, and the two young men behind. After we had travelled about one mile and a half, ſeveral <hi>I</hi>ndians ſtarted up within fifteen or twenty ſteps of the <hi>C</hi>olonel and me. As we at firſt diſcovered only three <hi>I</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately got behind a large black oak, made ready my piece and raiſed it up to take ſight, when the <hi>C</hi>olonel called to me twice not to fire: upon that one of the <hi>I</hi>ndians ran up to the colonel and took him by the hand.</p>
            <p>They were Delaware <hi>I</hi>ndians of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genim tribe. <hi>C</hi>aptain. Biggs fired amongſt them but did no execution; they then told us to call theſe people &amp; make them come, elſe they would go and kill them; which the <hi>C</hi>olonel did but they four got off and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for that time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>C</hi>olonel and <hi>I</hi> were taken to the <hi>I</hi>ndian camp, which was about half a mile from the place where, we were captured.</p>
            <p>On Sunday evening five Delawares who had poſted themſelves at ſome diſtance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the road, brought back to the camp, where we lay, <hi>C</hi>aptain Biggs and Lieutenant Aſhley's ſcalps with an Indian ſcalp which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:048810_0012_102685C69A10F170"/>
Captain Biggs had taken in the field of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They alſo brought in Biggs' horſe and mine, they told us the other two men got away from them.</p>
            <p>Monday morning the tenth of June, we were paraded to march to Sanduſky, about 33 miles diſtant: they had eleven priſoners of us and four ſcalps, the <hi>I</hi>ndians being ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteen in number. Col. <hi>C</hi>rawford was ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y deſirous to ſee a certain Simeon Girty, who lived among the <hi>I</hi>ndians, &amp; was on that account permitted to go to town the ſame night, with two warriors to guard him have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orders at the ſame time to paſs by the place where the <hi>C</hi>olonel had turned out his horſe that they might if poſſible, find him.</p>
            <p>The reſt of us were taken as far as the old town, which was within eight miles of the new.</p>
            <p>Tueſday morning, the 11th, <hi>C</hi>ol. <hi>C</hi>rawford was brought out on purpoſe to be marched in with the other priſoners. <hi>I</hi> aſked the <hi>C</hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel if he had ſeen Mr. Girty? he told me he had, and that Girty had promiſed to do every thing in his power for him, but that the <hi>I</hi>ndians were very much enraged againſt the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:048810_0013_102684DDAD6C47D8"/>
particularly Capt. Pipe, one of the Chiefs He likewiſe told me that Girty had informed him that his ſon-in-law, Col. Harriſon and his Nephew William Crawford, were made priſoners by the Shawaneſe, but had been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. This Capt. Pipe had come from the towns about an hour before Col. Crawford, and had painted all the priſoner's faces black.</p>
            <p>As he was painting me he told me I ſhould go to the Shawaneſe towns and ſee my friends.</p>
            <p>When the Col. arrived he painted him black alſo, told him he was glad to ſee him and that he would have him ſhaved when he came to ſee his friends at the Wyandot town. When we marched the Colonel and I were kept back be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Pipe and Wyngenim, the two Deleware chiefs, the other nine priſoners were ſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with another party of Indians. As we went a long we ſaw four of the priſoners lying by the path tomabawked and ſcalped, ſome of them were at the diſtance of half a mile from each other When we arrived within half a mile of the place where the Colonel was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we overtook the five priſoners that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alive: The Indians had cauſed them to ſit down on the ground, as they did, alſo the Col. and me at ſome diſtance from them, I was there given in charge to an Indian fellow to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Shawaneſe towns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:048810_0014_102685CB40213BD0"/>
In the place where we were now made to ſit down there was a number of ſquaws and boys who fell on the five priſoners tomahawked them. There was a certain John M'Kinley a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the priſoners, formerly an officer in the 13th, Virginia regiment, whoſe head an old ſquaw cut off, and the Indians kicked it about upon the ground. The young Indian fellows came often where the Colonel and I were and daſhed the ſcalps in our faces. We were then conducted along toward the place where the Colonel was afterwards executed: When we came within about half a mile of the place, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Girty met us, with ſeveral Indians on horſeback: He ſpoke to the Colonel, but as I was about one hundred and fifty yards behind could not hear what paſſed between them.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every Indian we met ſtruck us either with ſticks or their fiſts. Girty waited till I was brought up, and aſked was that Doctor?—I told him, yes, and went towards him reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out my hand, but he bid me begone, and called me a dam'd raſcal; upon which the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low who had me in charge pulled me along.</p>
            <p>Girty rode up after me and told me I was to go to the Shawaneſe towns.</p>
            <p>When we were come to the fire the Colonel was ſtripped naked, ordered to ſit down by the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:048810_0015_102685CE4A522A88"/>
fire, and then they beat him with ſticks and their fiſts. Preſently after I was treated in the ſame manner. They then tied a rope to the foot of a poſt about fifteen feet high, bound the Colonels hands behind his back and faſtened the rope to the ligature between his wriſts.</p>
            <p>The rope was long enough either to ſit down or walk round the poſt once or twice and return the ſame way. The Colonel then called to Girty and aſked if they intended to burn him? Girty anſwered yes. The Colonel ſaid he would take it patiently. Upon this Capt. Pipe a Delaware Chief, made a ſpeech to the Indians <abbr>viz.</abbr> about thirty or forty men, ſixty or ſeventy ſquaws and boys.</p>
            <p>When the ſpeech was finiſhed they all yelled a hedious and hearty aſſent to what had been ſaid. The Indian men then took up their guns and ſhot powder into the Colonel's body, from his feet as far up as his neck. I think not leſs than ſeventy loads were diſcharged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his naked body. They then crowded about him, and to the beſt of my obſervation, cut off his ears: when the throng had diſperſed a little I ſaw the blood running from both ſides of his head in conſequence thereof.</p>
            <p>The fire was about ſix or ſeven yards from the poſt to which the Colonel was tied: it was made
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:048810_0016_102685D17667D758"/>
of ſmall hickory poles, burnt quite through in the middle, each end of the poles remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix feet in length. Three or four Indians by turns would take up, individually, one of theſe burning pieces of wood and apply it to his naked body, already burned black with powder. Theſe tomentors preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on every ſide of him, ſo that which ever way he ran round the poſt they met him with the burning faggots and poles. Some of the ſquaws look broad boards upon which they would put a quantity of burning coals and hot embers, and throw on him, ſo that in a ſhort time he had nothing but coals of fire and hot aſhes to walk upon. In the midſt of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme tortures he called to Simeon Girty and begged of him to ſhoot him: But Girty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no anſwer he called to him again. Girty then by way of deriſion, told the Colonel he had no gun, at the ſame time turning about to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian who was behind him, laughed heartily and by all his geſtures ſeemed delighted at the horrid ſcene.</p>
            <p>Girty then came up to me and bade me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death. He ſaid, however, I was not to die at that place, but to be burnt at the Shawaneſe towns. He ſwore by G—d I need not expect to eſcape death, but ſhould ſuffer it in all its extremities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:048810_0017_102685D516AC1F78"/>
He then obſerved that ſome priſoners had given him to underſtand that if our people had him they would not hurt him; for his part, he ſaid, he did not believe it, but deſired to know my opinion of the matter; but being at that time in great anguiſh and diſtreſs for the torments the Colonel was ſuffering before my eyes, as well as the expectation of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the ſame fate in two days. I made lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no anſwer. He expreſſed a great deal of ill will for Col. Gibſon, and ſaid he was one of his greateſt enemies, and more to the ſame purpoſe, to all which I paid very little attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Col. Crawford at this period of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, beſought the Almighty to have mercy on his ſoul, ſpoke very low, and bore his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the moſt manly fortitude. He continued in all the extremities of pain for an hour &amp; three quarters or two hours longer, as near as I can judge, when at laſt being almoſt ſpent he lay down on his belly: They then ſcalp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him &amp; repeatedly threw the ſcalp in my face, te ling me "that was my great Captain."—An old ſquaw (whoſe appearance every way anſwered the ideas people entertain of the devil) got a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ard, took a parcel of coals &amp; aſhes &amp; laid them on his back and head after he had
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:048810_0018_102685D7451AA018"/>
been ſcalped: He then raiſed himſelf upon his feet and began to walk round the poſt: They next put a burning ſtick to him as uſual, but he ſeemed more inſenſible of pain than before.</p>
            <p>The Indian fellow who had me in charge, now took me away to Capt. Pipe's houſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three quarters of a mile from the place of the Colonel's execution. I was bound all night and thus prevented from ſeeing the laſt of the horrid ſpectacle. Next morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing June 12th, the Indian untied me, painted me black, and we ſet off for the S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>waneſe town, which he told me was ſomewhat leſs than forty miles from that place. We ſoon came to the ſpot where the Colonel was burnt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was partly in our way; I ſaw his bones <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ying amongſt the remains of the fire, almoſt burnt to aſhes, I ſuppoſe after he was dead the had laid his body on the fire.</p>
            <p>The Indian told me, that was my Big Captain and gave the ſcalp halloo. He was on horſeback and drove me before him.</p>
            <p>I pretended to this Indian I was ignorant of the death I was to die at the Shawaneſe town, affected as cheerful a countenance as poſſible and aſked him if we were not to live togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as brothers in one houſe when we ſhould get to the town? He ſeemed well pleaſed, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:048810_0019_102685D8DFC68968"/>
ſaid, yes. He then aſked me if I could make a wigwam? I told him I could—he then ſeemed more friendly—we went that day as near as I can judge about 25 miles, the courſe partly ſouth weſt—The Indian told me we ſhould next day come to the town the ſun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a direction, pointing nearly ſouth.</p>
            <p>At night when we went to reſt I attempted very often to unite myſelf, but the Indian was Extremely vigilent and ſcarce ever ſhut his eyes that night. About day break he got up and untied me: He next began to mend up the fire, and as the gnats were troubleſome I aſked him if I ſhould make a ſmoak behind him? he ſaid, yes, I then took the end of a dogwood <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which had been burnt down to about eighteen inches in length: It was the longeſt ſtick I could find, yet too ſmall for the purpoſe I had in view: then I picked up another ſmaller ſtick and taking a coal of fire between them went behind him: then turning ſuddenly about I ſtruck him on the head with all the force I was maſter of; which ſo ſtunned him that he fell forwards with both his hands into the fire, but ſeeing him recover and get up, I ſeized his gun while he ran off howling in a moſt fearful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner—I followed him with a determination to ſhoot him down, but pulling back the cock of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:048810_0020_102685DB16160D80"/>
the gun with great violence I believe I broke the main ſpring. I purſued him, however a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty yards ſtill endeavouring to fire the gun, but could not; then going back to the fire I took his blanket, a pair of new mokkiſons, his hoppes, powder horn, bullet bag, (together with the gun) and marched off, directing my courſe toward the five o'clock mark; about half an hour before ſunſet I came to the plains which I think are about sixteen miles wide. I laid me down in a thicket till dark, and then by the aſſiſtance of the north ſtar made my way through them and got into the woods before morning. I proceeded on the next day about noon croſſed the paths by which our troops had none out: Theſe paths are nearly eaſt and weſt but I went due north all that afternoon with a view to avoid the enemy.</p>
            <p>In the evening I began to be very faint, and no wonder; I had been ſix days a priſoner; the laſt two days of which I had eat nothing, and but very little the firſt three or four: There were wild gooſeberries in abundance in the woods, but being unripe required maſtication, which at that time I was not able to perform on account of a blow received from an Indian on the jaw with the back of a tomahawk: There was a weed that grew plentifully in that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:048810_0021_102685DCB2FE1B90"/>
place, the juice of which I knew to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and nouriſhing; I gathered a bundle of the ſame, took up my lodging under a large ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beach tree and having ſucked plentifully of the juice, went to ſleep. Next day I made a due eaſt courſe which I generally kept the reſt of my journey.</p>
            <p>I often imagined my gun was only wood bound and tried every method I could deviſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrew the lock but never could effect it having no knife nor any thing ſitting for the purpoſe; I had now the ſatisfaction to find my jaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mend and in four or five days could chew any vegetable proper for nouriſhment, but finding my gun only a uſeleſs burden left her in the wilderneſs. I had no apparatus for making fire to ſleep by ſo that I could get but little reſt for the gnats and muſquetoes; there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great many ſwamps in the beach ridge which occaſioned me very often to lie wet:—This ridge through which I travelled is about twenty miles broad, the ground in general very there are, however, very few ſprings, yet wells might eaſily be dug in all parts of that ridge; the timber on it is very lofty, but it is no eaſy matter to make a ſtrait courſe through the ſame the moſs growing as high upon the ſouth ſide
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:048810_0022_102685E07A3179E8"/>
of the trees as on the north. There are a great many white oaks, aſh and hickory trees that grow among the beach timber; there are likewiſe ſome places on the ridge, perhaps for three or four continued miles where there is little or no beach, and in ſuch ſpots, black, white oak, aſh, and hickory abound. Sugar trees grow there alſo to a very great bulk: The ſoil is remarkably good, the ground a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uneven, with ſome ſmall rivulets and a few ſprings. When I got out of the beach ridge and near the river Muſkingum the lands were more broken but equally as rich; abounding with brooks and ſprings of water: There are alſo ſeveral ſmall creeks that empty into that riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the bed of which is more than a mile wide in many oaks, walnut, hickory and ſugar trees in the greateſt abundance. In all parts of the country through which I came the game was very plenty, <abbr>viz.</abbr> deer, turkies and pheaſants. I likewiſe ſaw a great many veſtiges of bears and and ſome elks.</p>
            <p>I croſſed the river Muſkingum about three or four miles below Fort Laurence, and croſſing all the paths aimed for the Ohio river. All his time my food was gooſeberries, young net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the juice of herbs, a few ſervice berries,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:048810_0023_102685E374CAA600"/>
and ſome May apples, likewiſe, two young blackbirds and a turripine which I devoured raw. When my food ſat heavy on my ſtomach I uſed to eat a little wild ginger which put all to rights.</p>
            <p>I came upon Ohio river about five miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Fort M'Intoſh in the evening of the 21ſt, day after I had made my eſcape, and on the 22d, about ſeven o'clock in the morning, being the 4th, day of July, arrived ſafe, though very much fatigued, at the Fort.</p>

            <head>A SHORT MEMOIR OF THE WITHIN MENTIONED COL. CRAWFORD.</head>
            <p>COL. CRAWFORD, was about 50 years of age, had been an old warrior a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſavages. He diſtinguiſhed himſelf early as a volunteer in the laſt war, and was taken notice of by Col. (now Gen) Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who procured for him the Commiſſion of Enſign. As a Partiſan he ſhowed himſelf very active, and was greatly ſucceſsful: He took ſeveral Indian towns, and did great ſervice in ſcouting, patrolling and defending the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. At the commencement of this war he raiſed a regiment in the back country by his own exertions; He had the Commiſſion of Col. in the Continental army, and acted brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on ſeveral occaſions in the years '76, '77, and at other times. He held his Commiſſion at the time he took command of the militia, in the aforeſaid expedition againſt the Indians; moſt probably he had it with him when he was taken: He was a man of good judgment ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good nature, great humanity and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his hoſpitality to ſtrangers; no man therefore could be more regretted than the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and amiable Crawford.</p>
