            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Humbly to own one dreadful fault of his:</l>
                  <l>A fault, in modern Authors not uncommon,</l>
                  <l>It is,—now don't angry—He's—<hi>a woman.</hi>

                  <l>The Play, perhaps, has many things amiſs:</l>
                  <l>Well, let us then reduce the point to this,</l>

Did not he marry the woman he loved, and has he not, at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a large family, by whom he is beloved? And is he not, therefore, with all his poverty, much happier than I? He has often told me, when I have reproached him with his indiſcreet marriage, "that in his wife he poſſeſſed kingdoms!" Do you ſuppoſe I will give any part of my fortune to a man who enjoys ſuch extenſive domains? No: —let him preſerve his territories, and I will keep my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſtate for my own uſe.</p>

                     <p>Very true; you had it from your infancy. I have heard your mother ſay you were always fooliſhly tender-hearted, and never ſhowed one of thoſe diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating paſſions of envy, hatred, or revenge, to which all her other children were liable.</p>

                     <speaker>Harmony.</speaker>
                     <p>No: ſince I can remember, I have felt the moſt unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures. I even proteſt to you, dear Madam, that, as I walk along ſtreets of this large metropolis, ſo warm is my heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards every perſon who paſſes me, that I long to ſay, "How do you do?" and "I am glad to ſee you," to them all.

                     <p>Nay, 'tis truth: and I ſincerely lament that human beings ſhould be ſuch ſtrangers to one another as we are. We live in the ſame ſtreet, without knowing one another's neceſſities; and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church, at coffee-houſes, play houſes, and all public places, without ever ſpeaking a ſingle word, or nodding "Good bye!" though tis a hundred chances to ten we never ſee one another again.</p>

                     <p>Let me tell you, kinſman, all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended philanthropy renders you ridiculous.—There is not a fraud, a theft, or hardly any vice committed, that you do not take the criminal's part, ſhake your head, and cry, "Proviſions are ſo ſcarce!" And no longer ago than laſt Lord-mayor's day, when you were told that Mr. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ravenous was ill with an indigeſtion, you endeavoured to ſoften the matter, by exclaiming, "Proviſions are ſo ſcarce!"—But, above all, I condemn the falſe humanity, which induces you to ſay many things in converſation which deſerve to ſtigmatize you with the character of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027154_0010_0fd58f63019f0618"/>conſcience never does: for it is by this very failing that I have frequently made the bittereſt enemies friends—Juſt by ſaying a few harmleſs ſentences, which, though a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of falſehood and deceit, yet, being ſoothing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the perſon offended, I have immediately inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with lenity and forgiveneſs; and then, by only repeating the ſelf-ſame ſentences to his opponent, I have known hearts cold and cloſed to each other, warmed and expanded, as every human creature's ought to be.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir Robert, to Solus.</speaker>
                     <p>I tell you, Sir, ſhe is hideous. And then ſhe was grown ſo inſufferably peeviſh.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Solus.</speaker>
                     <p>I never ſaw her out of temper.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. Solus, it is very uncivil of you to praiſe her before my face. Lady Ramble, at the time I parted with her, had every poſſible fault both of mind and perſon, and ſo I made love to other women in her preſence; told her bluntly that I was tired of her; that <q>I was very ſorry to make her uneaſy, but that I could not love her any longer.</q>
—And was not that frank and open?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Solus.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh! that I had but ſuch a wife as ſhe was!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>I muſt own I loved her myſelf when ſhe was young.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Solus.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you call her old?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>In years I am certainly older than ſhe; but the difference of ſex makes her a great deal older than I am. For inſtance, Mr. Solus, you have often lamented not being married in your youth; but if you had, what would you have now done with an old wife, a woman of your own age?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Solus.</speaker>
                     <p>Loved and cheriſhed her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>What, in ſpite of her loſs of beauty?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Solus.</speaker>
                     <p>When ſhe had loſt her beauty, moſt likely I ſhould have loſt my eye ſight, and have been blind to the wane of her charms.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Placid anxiouſly.</speaker>
                     <p>But, Sir Robert, you were explaining to me—Mr. Solus, give me leave to ſpeak to Sir Robert
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027154_0018_0fd58f72b4de5ce0"/>—I feel myſelf particularly intereſted on this ſubject.— And, Sir, you were explaining to me—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>Very true: where did I leave off? Oh! at my ill uſage of my lady Ramble. Yes, I did uſe her very ill, and yet ſhe loved me. Many a time, when ſhe has ſaid to me, "Sir Robert, I deteſt your principles, your manners, and even your perſon," often, at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I have ſeen a little ſparkle of a wiſh peep out at the corner of one eye, that has called to me, "Oh! Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, how I long to make it up with you!"</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Solus, to Mr. Placid.</speaker>
                     <p>Do not you wiſh that your wife had ſuch a little ſparkle at the corner of one of her eyes?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert, to Mr. Placid.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, do you wiſh to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Placid.</speaker>
                     <p>I have no ſuch proſpect. Mrs. Placid is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and I was married in England.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>But if you have an unconquerable deſire to part, a ſeparate maintenance will anſwer nearly the ſame end—for if your lady and you will only lay down the plan of ſeparation, and agree—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Placid.</speaker>
                     <p>But, unfortunately, we never do agree!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>Then ſpeak of parting as a thing you dread worſe than death; and make it your daily prayer to her, that ſhe will never think of going from you—She will determine upon it directly.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Placid.</speaker>
                     <p>I thank you; I'm very much obliged to you; I thank you a thouſand times.</p>

                     <p>Yes, I have ſtudied the art of teaſing a wife; and there is nothing vexes her ſo much as laughing at her. Can you laugh, Mr. Placid?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Placid.</speaker>
                     <p>I don't know whether I can; I have not laughed ſince I married —But I thank you, Sir, for your inſtructions—I ſincerely thank you.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Irwin.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Sir; but I find ſome of my countrymen changed. I fancy them leſs warm, leſs friendly than they were; and it is that which, perhaps, has this effect upon me.</p>

                     <p>And I aſſure you, that inſtead of being grown more gloomy, I am even more gay than I was ſeven years ago; for then, I was upon the point of matrimony —but now, I am juſt relieved from its cares.</p>

I forgot to mention ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral heavy incumbrances, which you will perceive are great drawbacks on my fortune.—As my wife ſued for the divorce, I have her fortune to return; I have alſo two ſiſters to portion off—a circumſtance I totally forgot.

I have heard that thoſe unfortunate parents left an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant behind when they went abroad, and that they lament him as loſt. Will you ſatisfy my curioſity, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you ſought and found him out?</p>

                     <p>Do you ſuppoſe I ſearched for him? No;—he was forced upon me. A woman followed me, about eight years ago, in the fields adjoining to my country ſeat, with a half ſtarved boy in her hand, and aſked my charity for my grand child: the impreſſion of the word, made me turn round involuntarily; and caſting my eyes upon him, I was rejoiced, not to find a feature of his mother's in all his face; and I began to feel ſomething like pity for him. In ſhort, he caught ſuch faſt hold by one of my fingers, that I aſked him careleſsly "if he would go home and live with me?" On which, he anſwered me ſo willingly "Yes," I took him at his word.</p>

                     <p>Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy for the ſpleen. I have known a Gentleman at a feaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an affront, diſguiſe his rage, ſtep home, vent it all upon his wife, return to his companions, and be as good company as if nothing had happened.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                     <p>But even the neceſſary expences of a wife ſhould alarm you.</p>

                     <speaker>Solus.</speaker>
                     <p>I can then retrench ſome of my own. Oh!
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027154_0044_0fd58faa426c3570"/>my dear Sir, a married man has ſo many delightful privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges to what a bachelor has!—An old Lady will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her daughters to you in a diſhabille—"it does not ſignify, my dears, it's a married man"—One Lady will ſuffer you to draw on her glove—"Never mind, it's a married man"—Another will permit you to pull on her ſlipper; a third will even take you into her bed-chamber —"Pſhaw, it's <hi>nothing</hi> but a married man."</p>

                     <p>I am not very well at preſent; I have the head-ache; and, if ever a wife can be of comfort to her huſband, it muſt be when he is indiſpoſed.

                     <p>That, I cannot fend in. But tell him, Sir, I am the afflicted wife of a man, who for ſome weeks paſt has given many fatal proofs of a diſordered mind. In one of theſe fits of phrenzy, he held an inſtrument of death, meant for his own deſtruction, to the breaſt of your Lord (who by accident that moment paſſed,) and took from him, what he vainly hoped might preſerve his own life, and relieve the wants of his family. But his paroxyſm over, he ſhrunk from what he had done, and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken, into a ſervant's hands to be returned to its lawful owner. The man admitted to this confidence, betrayed his truſt, and inſtead of giving up what was ſo ſacredly delivered to him, ſecreted it; and, to obtain the promiſed reward, came to this houſe, but to inform againſt the wretched of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; who now, only reſting on your Lord's clemency, can eſcape the direful fate he has incurred.</p>
