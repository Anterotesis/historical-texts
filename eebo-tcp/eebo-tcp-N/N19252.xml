            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I beg you would permit me, to make use of a small part of a page, of your intended inaugural publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the <hi>PERSIMMON TREE,</hi> and the <hi>Analysis</hi> of <hi>astringent vegetables,</hi> as the vehicle of my acknowledgements, of the great pleasure I derived, from witnessing the zeal and industry, with which you conducted the experiments and studies, that have led you to the valuable discoveries, contained in your dissertation.</p>
            <p>I hope your success, in those experiments, will animate you to direct your inquiries into other branches of Chemistry and Medicine, and that your eminence and usefulness in life, may be equal to the ability and integrity with which you have discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your duty to your</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THERE are three things, says a celebrated writer, which are sufficient to render the best discourse, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and uninteresting; the difficulty of the subject, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of saying something, and the anxiety of saying it well.</p>
            <p>Called before the tribunal of the public, under these circumstances, I feel the force of this observation in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner.</p>
            <p>I have chosen the Persimmon tree for an inaugural dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation, on the one hand, merely to avoid a thread-bare worn out subject, and on the other, that I might have an opportunity of saying something on a tree, of which, little more is known than the name.</p>
            <p>The indulgent reader will make every possible allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, especially when he considers, that this thesis is the production of one, who is as yet, a Tyro in Chemistry.</p>

            <p>LINNAEUS has placed the Persimmon tree, among the Polygamia Dioecia, and describes it in the following manner in his Genera Plantarum.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Filaments</hi> are eight, bristly, short and lightly inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the receptacle. The <hi>Antherae</hi> are oblong and effaete.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germen</hi> is roundish. The <hi>Style</hi> one, half four-cleft, permanent and longer than the stamina. The <hi>Stigmas</hi> are obtuse and two-cleft.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pericarpium</hi> is a globous berry, large, eight-cell'd, and sitting on the large spreading calyx.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seeds</hi> are solitary, roundish, compressed, and very hard.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:025055_0006_0FCDB82E3679ADC0"/>The <hi>Corolla</hi> consists of one petal, pitcher-shape, coriace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, four cornered and four-cleft: the divisions roundish and revolute.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Filaments</hi> are eight, very short and inserted in the receptacle. The <hi>Antherae</hi> are double, long and acute; the interior shortest.</p>

               <p>The <hi>species</hi> with us but one.</p>
               <p>The DIOSPYROS VIRGINIANA, <hi>American Prune, Date Plum</hi> or <hi>Persimmon tree,</hi> is of a rapid growth, rises from fourteen to twenty five feet in height, and bears fruit in a few years after it is planted.</p>
               <p>It grows in Pennsylvania, New-Jersey, New-York, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, in moist clayey ground, in swamps, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the banks of rivers.</p>
               <p>A number of short branches are sent out from the body of the tree, garnished with entire, oblong, pointed leaves; the blossoms are produced in April, growing along the sides of the branches, on very short foot-stalks, making but little appearance, and are succeeded by large globular or oblong fruit, of different sizes on different trees <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Marshall's Arbustum Americanum, and Catesby's his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Carolina,</hi> vol. 2<hi>nd.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The wood of the tree has a firm, close grain, burns well, and its ashes yield a large proportion of salts. The bark of the tree possesses a considerable degree of astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025055_0007_0FCDB834393C82F8"/>
the leaves more than the bark, the bark more than the heart of the tree, and the unripe fruit is one of the most powerful astringents, in the vegetable kingdom.</p>
               <p>The trunk of the tree does not exceed ten feet, the fruit contains four flat stones, which when split in two, Mr. Catesby says, exhibits the tree in embryo, with its stem or trunk, and two <hi>folia seminalia</hi> in a more conspicuous manner, than in any other seed he has ever met with.</p>
               <p>A fine transparent gum, of a light brown color, insipid to the taste, readily soluble in water, exudes from the body of the tree.</p>
               <p>A premium of twenty pounds sterling, was offered by a society in London, for the promotion of arts and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, for a quantity of this gum, not less than fifty pounds, and a premium of ten pounds, for the next great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est quantity, not less than twenty five pounds.</p>
               <p>The expressed juice of the unripe fruit, being a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a singular nature, was subjected to the following experiments.</p>

               <head>REMARKS ON THE EXPERIMENTS.</head>
               <p>From the first of these experiments, it appears, that the juice of the Persimmon, contains the same acid, as all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringent vegetables; and from the second, we find it may be employed, as a nice test, for detecting the presence of iron, in mineral waters. In the third, it decomposed the iron, separating its principle of inflammability. In the fifth, we find a large quantity, of a transparent, brown, astringent gummy substance produced, which from some of the succeeding experiments, appears to be a gum-resin, with a proportion of excrementitious matter. The resin is a mild substance, generally containing a small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the acid, and may be separated from the gum, by precipitating the basis of the astringent, by the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025055_0013_0FCDB840A9B4DD58"/>
or volatile alkali, filtering the solution, and adding the marine or vitriolic acids. The gum is composed of the gallic acid, and the astringent basis, which is earth of alum.</p>
               <p>The property of forming a saline gum, with the earth of alum, is not peculiar to the gallic acid. The distilled acid of sugar, according to Schrickel, and the acid of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, have the same effect on that earth. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Keir's Chemical Dictionary, article, acid of tartar and sugar.</hi>
                  </note> A gum resin appears to exist in almost every vegetable, which has the property of striking black, with the solutions of iron, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in the degree of solubility, in different menstrua, and in the proportion of gum and resin. It constitutes the astringent and bitter quality in peruvian bark, it may be extracted from the leaves and bark of the Persimmon, galls yield it to a watery menstruum, in the proportion of four drachms to the ounce, and it may be obtained, in considerable quantities, from the common pig-nut.</p>
               <p>Morveau supposes the acid in astringents, is formed of this resin and pure air. The twelfth experiment clearly confutes this opinion, for the resin is there seen, in large transparent globules, when the iron, the ponderous earth, and the mercury were precipitated by the acid.</p>
               <p>To succeed in this experiment, with galls, and other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringents, it is necessary to have a strong infusion of them, for it does not take place, after the resin has been
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025055_0014_0FCDB84278E85C00"/>
extracted by one or two infusions, altho' the astringency remains.</p>
               <p>The precipitate formed, by adding the alkalies, to vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table astringents, has been mistaken by some authors for the astringent principle. In Keir's chemical Dictionary, and in the last edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a number of observations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be seen, relating to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. It is there said, when redissolved in water, it blackened a solution of vitriol but faintly, and in no other manner, that what arose, from a small quantity of acid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, which is proved it contains by distilling it. The author of these observations has been mistaken, and it is not a difficult matter, to point out in what manner he has been deceived. The astringent taste arose from a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of acid, which he acknowledges it contains; its solubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in water, arose from the same cause, for after it is seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times washed, and the water filtered, it does not black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a solution of vitriol, but when diffused in water, and added to a solution of that salt, the color is immediately changed, for its solubility in water, like alum and the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous phosphat of urine, is owing to a superabundant acid.</p>
               <p>When spread with a feather, over an ancient, decayed writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it restored the legibility of the letters. Various methods have been recommended, by different authors, for this purpose; among others, the distilled liquor of galls, in Caneparius's collection de atramentis, and the phlogistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alkali, by Dr. Blagden, in the Philosophical transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the year 1787. The unripe juice of the Persim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025055_0015_0FCDB846D24CF790"/>
possesses two advantages over these fluids; it is a more powerful test for detecting the presence of iron, and forms a gummy resinous coat over the letters, defending them for ever, against the action of air and moisture.</p>
               <p>The matter formed by the junction of the astringent juice and steel filings, and the precipitated faecul<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r green vitriol, possess the same properties.</p>
               <p>The twelfth, and following experiments, naturally lead us to say a few <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> on the changes which take place, in the precipitates of iron, by the vegetable astringents.</p>
               <p>On this subject, Messieurs Macquer, Monnet, Gianotti and the academicians of Dijon, have been particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. The two former, and the greater part of chemists, consider the precipitate of ink, to be united with a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the gall-nut, in an oily state. Mr. Gianotti thought, that the iron was united with the astringent principle; and that it was in the state of a neutral salt. The gentlemen of the academy of Dijon, suppose the astringents direct their action to the vitriolic acid, and precipitate the iron pure.</p>
               <p>My experiments have induced me, to draw a different conclusion, from those gentlemen. I have clearly proved, that a neutral salt exists readily formed in astringent vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, composed of a peculiar acid and the earth of alum, independent of a resin, which most of them contain.</p>
               <p>In the making of ink then, a double elective attraction takes place; the gallic acid unites with the iron of the green vitriol, while the vitriolic acid unites with the earth
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025055_0016_0FCDB847C0B59C30"/>
of alum. In an acid solution of green vitriol, no precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate happens, because the vitriolic acid dissolves the iron, as fast as it is precipitated; but, if a sufficient quantity of an alkali is added, to saturate the vitriolic acid, the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate remains suspended in the liquor; still continue to add the alkali, and you saturate both the gallic and vitriolic <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the iron is precipitated, of a dirty brown color.</p>
               <p>This theory <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> out the necessity of having a vitriol, exactly saturated with acid, in the making of ink; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of adding a small quantity of the vegetable alkali or steel filings, to the common ink powder of the shops, and the improper practice which some people have, of using vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar as a menstruum, to extract its virtues.</p>
               <p>It shows the propriety of Mr. Clegg's proposal, for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vegetable alkali, as a substitute for verdigrise in the black dye, for which he received a silver medal and ten guineas, from a society instituted in London, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of arts and manufactures, in the year 1783.</p>
               <p>It accounts for the phaenomena, which happened in a number of experiments, made by Drs. Skeete and Irwin, in which magnesia, lime, chalk and the alkalies were tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated with peruvian bark, and added to a solution of green vitriol; and which Irwin accounted for, by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the presence of fixed air.</p>
               <p>The fallacy, of triturating astringent gum resins, with different substances, and adding them to a solution of green vitriol, and making the intensity of the color struck, a proof of the strength of the solvent power, is here pointed out.</p>
               <p>It explains the reason, why in the precipitates of iron
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025055_0017_0FCDB8495B057330"/>
by the nut-gall, the coalition of particles is successive, and remains suspended in the fluid, and why in the uva ursi, the pig-nut, and the Persimmon, they concrete together, in large particles, and fall to the bottom of the vessel. In the first case, the resin being contained in a small quantity, and united to a portion of the acid, is readily soluble in water; in the second case, the resin is contained in a large proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is insoluble in water.</p>
               <p>It likewise explains to us the cause of the increased blackness of ink, in the common practice which school boys have of adding chalk, lime, &amp;c. to that fluid.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of astringents, serves as a key to many of the experiments of Dr. Percival, and accounts for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which acids neutralize astringents; by destroying the affinity between the gallic acid, and the earth of alum.</p>
               <p>In short, it simplifies the Materia Medica, it is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esting addition to chemistry, and in future it is probable, the whole catalogue of astringents will yield to one or two of the most powerful, and the author queries, whether even the peruvian bark, will not give place, to the more powerful combination, of galls and gentian, or the Persimmon and centaury.</p>
               <p>The acid of galls, forming an ink with green vitriol, may be offered as an objection to this theory, and it may be asked, why does not the vitriolic acid, in this case, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the iron? The answer to this question is easy, the vitriolic acid is too weak to act on the iron, and an ink made in this manner, though at first of a deep black color, yet is not durable.</p>

                  <p>Without entering into a disquisition, concerning the proximate cause, of an intermitting fever, suffice it to say, simple astringents, or astringents combined with bitters, are the remedies generally used, in the cure of the disease.</p>
                  <p>Galls, gum kinoe, oak bark, and the roots of cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophillata have all been employed with success.</p>

                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:025055_0019_0FCDB850ACC712E0"/>About the beginning of this century, says Dr. Cullen, the galls had get a reputation for the cure of intermittents; and it was pointed out as a proper object of attention to the Academy of Sciences, who accordingly appointed Mr. Poupart to inquire into the matter. His report amounts to this, that in many cases the galls cured the intermittents; but that they failed also in many cases, in which the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian bark proved successful.</p>
                  <p>This, with due deference to superior authority, cannot invalidate the efficacy of astringents, in intermitting fevers. How often does the bark succeed, when mixed with wine, or when joined with aromatics, or saline stimulants, when bark itself had no effect? How frequently does it succeed after bleeding, when pounds of it had been taken before to no purpose? How often do mild bitters succeed, when the whole catalogue of the more powerful, have been employed with no advantage? <note n="*" place="bottom">

These medicines possess no specific power, the bark or any other astringent and bitter, given in small doses, or after proper evacuations, would have been equally efficacious.

                  <p>The active principles of the bark, consist in a gum and resin, or in an astringent and bitter; in the combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, these principles are united; those who

                  <head>IN THE TANNING OF LEATHER.</head>
                  <p>The greater the quantity of resin contained in any vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table astringent, the greater the ease with which leather may be impregnated with it, and its greater degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solubility in water afterwards, so much the more valuable is it, in this important branch of manufactures.</p>
                  <p>The use of tanning, says Dr. Macbride, is to prevent the leather from rotting, and to render it impervious to water. Any astringent vegetable substance, is powerful enough to accomplish the first purpose, but to render the leather impervious to water, requires one containing a large proportion of gummy resinous matter.</p>
                  <p>The superiority of oak bark over other astringents, is owing to this property. The famous essence of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is no more than an extract made by infusion, and was first proposed as a substitute for oak bark, in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir delivered to the Bath Society, in the year 1773.</p>
                  <p>The unripe juice of the Persimmon, provided it could be obtained in sufficient quantities, and for a price which would not greatly enhance the value of leather, must be preferable to oak bark, for reasons evident to every chemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal mind.</p>
                  <p>Allowing every tree to produce four bushels of fruit, though Mr. Bartram says, he has seen some which produce six, and suppose three hundred of these trees cultivated; the quantity of gum resin which would be produced, would
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025055_0028_0FCDB866D577E920"/>
be 1800 pounds, as I have ascertained by experiment, computing six pounds to a tree. The quantity of juice would be several hundred gallons, which might be kept in barrels 'till wanted for use.</p>
                  <p>North Carolina is the only state, in which the Persim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is cultivated; it is a common practice there to ingraft it on the apple, by which means the rapidity of its growth is greatly increased.</p>
                  <p>When we oppose the cleanliness of the process, if the Persimmon could be used, the strength of the astringent, the small number of hands required, the small capital to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and little labour requisite to carry on the business, the trifling piece of ground which a tanyard would occupy, the value of the leather and shortness of time necessary to finish it: to the large capital at present required, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hands employed, the quantity of labour, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense loads of bark, the annual expence of a horse and price of instruments to grind it, and to the length of time necessary to finish the leather, we may conclude, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is well worthy the attention of some philosophical tanner.</p>

                  <head>AS AN INGREDIENT IN THE BLACK DYE.</head>
                  <p>The black dye in common use, is no more than an ink, made by adding a vegetable astringent to a solution of green vitriol, altho' realgar, antimony, litharge, arsenic, orpiment and other substances have been added to the ingredients.</p>
                  <p>In the Swedish transactions for the year 1753, a fine black is said to be dyed, with the leaves of the uva ursi,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025055_0029_0FCDB868CD8618E0"/>
the black matter concretes together in large particles, which is supposed to be of great advantage to the black dye, as the largeness of the colouring particles, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete in the pores of the cloth, may render them more fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, consequently, less of the colouring matter is wasted in the liquor. To this cause, says Dr. Lewis, may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted a quality of the uva ursi dye, mentioned by the Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish author, that the cloth is cleaner, than after the other black dyes, or requires less washing to free it from the loose color.</p>
                  <p>The juice of the Persimmon, precipitates iron in the same manner as the uva ursi, in large particles, which fall to the bottom of the vessel. I have dyed silk with an ink made of this substance, which was as black, and bore washing as well, as that dyed with galls, logwood, and fifty other ingredients.</p>
                  <p>It is astonishing to think, an exorbitant price is still paid for galls and logwood, when bushels of a substitute superior to either, may be had for the trouble of carrying them away.</p>

                  <p>The great defect in an ink, made from the juice of the Persimmon, is, that the precipitated iron, concretes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in large particles, and falls to the bottom of the vessel; this takes place in a greater or less degree, in every preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate of iron, by a vegetable astringent. In some inks this circumstance may be prevented by the addition of gum arabic, and the coloring matter kept suspended in

the fluid; I have attempted it in vain, in ink made from the Persimmon, the letters always appearing as if written with charcoal diffused in water. An ink has likewise been made from the precipitated iron mixed with water, and kept suspended by the addition of gum arabic; when made in this manner, tho' it is durable, yet the letters may be washed off from the paper as easily as if written with any black powder diffused in water.</p>
                  <p>In the latter end of October, and in November, the astringent gum of the Persimmon, is converted into a sweet nutritious substance, which remains on the trees 'till January, and serves as food to squirrels, rabbits, racoons, and other animals.</p>
                  <p>The manner in which this change is produced, would lead to an inquiry, as curious as it would be useful. It appears to be a process, analogous to a mortification in the extremities of the human body, and brought on by the same cause. An extinction of life, from a languid circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, caused by the bebilitating power of cold. In what manner this quality acts, in producing a decomposition, is difficult to determine: the constituent principles appear not to be changed, they are only modified; the gum resin is principally composed of acid, oil, earth and water: the ripe fruit contains the same principles, and even when changed into a vinous liquor and distilled, the composition is still acid, oil, and water <note n="*" place="bottom">
