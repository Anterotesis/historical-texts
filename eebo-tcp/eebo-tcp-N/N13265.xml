            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>I. <hi>INTRODUCTION:</hi> Containing a true State of the Matters judged upon by the late <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation,</hi> from their Riſe until laid before that venerable Body.</head>
               <p>FROM the time of my firſt ſettling with the people in <hi>Weſt-Stafford,</hi> (which was October 31, 1764) until the year 1778, I lived as happily with them as any Miniſter upon the Continent with his people, perhaps: I loved the people, and to ſerve their beſt intereſt in public and private, in ſickneſs and health, was my delightful employ; while I received, in return, many teſtimonies of their cordial and ſincere regard to me, and for the truth's ſake which I preached unto them; which, in many inſtances, appeared to have a good effect upon them: On which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I had reaſon to rejoice that I had not
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016775_0005_0F9E23E7E7A70FE0"/>
run in vain, nor laboured in vain among them.</p>
               <p>In 1778 my ſalary, which according to agreement was ſixty pounds lawful money annually, by the depreciation of Continental money, was become almoſt nothing; ſo that I found myſelf obliged to aſk for ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to be made me. In March 1778, a meeting of the ſociety was called to ſee if they would afford me any help. At this time thoſe who were betruſted with the prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the ſociety were chiefly ſtrangers, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to reſide in the place, and by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering themſelves popular had got into places of truſt: An error this in the people which I would caution all other ſocieties againſt. The Committee oppoſed any thing's being done for me in a pariſh way; that which they chiefly urged, was that it would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the poor, &amp;c.—The ſociety, which had been uſed to peace before, ſeemed much ſurpriſed to ſee a fire kindled; and to put out the ſame, a number of the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants propoſed to me, at the time of the meeting, to accept of a ſubſcription for that year, to which I conſented in caſe it were adequate; to bring this about they deſired an adjournment of the meeting, which was granted. At the adjourned meeting I ſignified my acceptance of what was ſubſcribed, and ſo the difficulty ſeemed to ſubſide for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016775_0006_0F9E23E8950FB558"/>
Nevertheleſs I could often hear of the Committee's telling one and another, that it was unreaſonable to allow me any more than the nominal ſum, and whatever they did more was over and above their contract with me; that they were under no obligation to do it, and the like. Towards the cloſe of this year, the Committee, without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by me, came to my houſe and told me, they underſtood that I was uneaſy with my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary and wanted ſome help from the people; and as there would be buſineſs enough on the annual meeting without that, they thought it beſt, if I was willing, to have a meeting called on purpoſe to ſettle the matter relative to my ſalary. I told them I was willing if they tho't beſt, and had mentioned it to one of them ſome time before, that I had thoughts of deſiring an interview with the Committee; they then aſked me, what my requeſt was? I told them that they knew the whole affair as well as I, a bare ſupport was all I aſked for; I was willing to bear an equal part of the burdens of the preſent day, and would give up one quarter of my ſalary, if the pariſh would make the reſt good, giving me forty-five pounds as good as it uſed to be. One of them, upon this, aſked me how I would have the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn? I told him that it was not my buſineſs to make warnings, they knowing the affair, were quite able to do that. Another
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016775_0007_0F9E23E960CB10B8"/>
ſpoke and ſaid, we muſt warn the ſociety to come together, to ſee what addition they would make to the ſalary. I told them I thought it not proper to talk of addition to the ſalary, when I offered to give up one quarter of it. They told me that ſixty pounds was ſixty pounds, and if the ſociety paid that, they fulfilled their agreement with me, and if they allowed me any more it would be by way of addition. I aſked them, if they thought ſixty pounds Continental money was equivalent to the ſociety's agreement with me? They told me they thought it was: and two of them ſaid they ſhould never hold up their hands for my having any more, and added that they believed that the greater part of the pariſh was of their minds: The other ſaid, it did not belong to them to determine the matter, the pariſh might do as they ſaw fit. I told them that if the ſociety was of their minds, I ſhould be glad to know it, that I might know what to do, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſired a meeting; they therefore warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a meeting to ſee what the ſociety would <hi>add</hi> to my ſalary. I wrote to the ſociety, which was read in the meeting, ſhewing them that I did not want an addition, but was willing to give up a quarter part, as I had told the Committee: The event was that the ſociety refuſed to act upon the warning. The annual meeting ſoon came; the ſociety dropped theſe

men, and put in a new Committee; at which they appeared extremely offended both with me and the people: And now they began to fault my preaching, and to form a party in the pariſh. No ſtone was left unturned to diſaffect all they could influence towards my preaching; and whatever I ſaid in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic was perverted and condemned as heretical and damnable. One of them left the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. A few days after, being at my houſe, I aſked him the reaſon of his conduct in withdrawing from communion? He told me it was owing to his being offended with me and the church: I aſked what we had done to offend him? He told me that I preached doctrines he thought were falſe, and the Church received them. I told him he was wrong in leaving the communion until he had given me and the church notice of his uneaſineſs and endeavoured to ſet us right, if wrong; and would never be juſtified in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he had, and read to him ſome paſſages in Cambridge Platform, which he profeſſed to like, and which condemned ſuch practice. He then told me he had done nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advice from a neighbouring <hi>Clergyman,</hi> who told him he could not be blamed for leaving the communion when he pleaſed. I diſcourſed with him two ſeveral times, and laboured to convince him of his error; but all was in vain, he ſupported himſelf upon

In June laſt the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> ſet at my houſe, a few days before which <hi>Solomon Bixby</hi> brought a paper to me containing ten <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>charge</hi> againſt my doctrines, which he ſaid he intended to lay before the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> deſiring me to read the ſame, and ſay whether I owned them or not; I read them, and obſerved to him that they were generally falſe as they lay in the charge, and not one of them expreſſed as I had expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf upon thoſe matters: He then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to draw a complaint myſelf, that I would be willing to own, as he depended upon me for proof; I told him, I was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do it, but had not time then. The Aſſociation met, and he appeared and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his complaint as he had ſhown it me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without any ſigners but himſelf, though in behalf of others: Upon the <hi>Aſſociation</hi>'s inſiſting that the others referred to ſhould ſubſcribe ſaid complaint with him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured three others, viz. <hi>Samuel Fuller, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah Alden,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Ellis.</hi> The <hi>Aſſociation</hi> aſked me whether I owned the

charge? I told them that in general it was wrong, but that there were ſome things ſo near the truth, that I thought it would be diſhonourable to deny them. I was then deſired to point out what I owned; I did ſo, which were four of the articles. The <hi>Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> then went into the conſideration of what ſhould be done; I told them that I ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they had no cognizance of the caſe—one of the members told me I was miſtaken, and added, "I had a <hi>hint</hi> of this, and therefore put the Platform in my pocket," and taking it out read a paſſage about hereſy, &amp;c.—I told him I had not the ſame notions of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy that he had: Another replied, <hi>"why all error is hereſy:"</hi> I then concluded to leave them to proceed as they pleaſed without making any oppoſition at that time. They ſoon reſolved upon a committee to meet on future time to confer on matters, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſame to me; I told them that as I had been publicly accuſed, I choſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend myſelf in public, ſhould therefore chooſe that the <hi>Conſociation</hi> be convoked if they judged the matter cognizable by them; but that was declined: I then told them that I would not converſe with the committee, but if they deſired it, would ſend them, in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a defence of what I owned of ſaid charge. Accordingly the Committee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet at the Rev. Mr. <hi>Perry</hi>'s, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember

               <p>AS ſoon as the Conſociation was opened I deſired, and with great difficulty at length obtained, leave to read them a paper, in which I denied their juriſdiction and right to judge on articles of faith, or make a creed for me; reminded them that the divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure had been always teſtified againſt

               <p>I then obſerved to Conſociation, that ſuch luſt for power and domination, as but too evidently appeared in them, would illy ſuit ſuch a free air as we breathed in this country; and that they unhappily came into exiſtence too late for the exerciſe of ſpiritual tyranny: And then retired, aſſuring Conſociation of my readineſs to wait on them at any time, if treated with civility, as a brother and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</p>

ſcandalous immorality; nor did I ever imagine that you was warranted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Connecticut churches to deny Chriſtian fellowſhip on any other accounts. Your Platform, if I can underſtand it, gives you no ſuch right, but forbids any ſuch thing. Confeſſion of faith, chap. xxi. ſect. 2. Preface p. 6. This right of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deciſion, both you and your Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form acknowledge. Now Chriſt hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given individuals, nor churches, any right or privilege, the conſcientious uſe of which will unavoidably ſubject them to the inconveniences and hardſhips attending a denial of Chriſtian fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: For then it would follow, that a man, by his fidelity to Chriſt, would, by Chriſt's rules, be debarred the communion of Chriſtians! Indeed we ſhall never act right, nor according to the mind of Chriſt in theſe matters, until we determine not to withdraw communion from any individual, or Church, except they either believe or act contrary to expreſs ſcripture, <hi>i. e.</hi> are heretical or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral.

might, warrantably enough give our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tell our ſenſe of the ſcriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in ſaid doctrines and tenets: But when we ſay, we will not read, pray, preach or commune at Chriſt's table with thoſe who differ from us in the interpretation of implicit or doubtful ſcriptures, we go on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden ground, and treat our fellow men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly.<note n="*" place="bottom">I would obſerve further upon this anſwer to my firſt queſtion, that it is really no anſwer at all. My queſtion is, 'Have you any authority to judge concerning doctrines, reſpecting their agreement or diſagreement with the goſpel, that we have not?' '<hi>Anſwer.</hi> You, as paſtor and church, have a ſole right to judge for yourſelves what doctrines agree with the goſpel?' Is this an anſwer to the queſtion?

               <p n="1">1ſt. For your firſt ground of authority. Does this 'endearing relation you ſpeak of; or this care and watchfulneſs implied in it,' give one paſtor a right to decide for another in matters of faith, or not? That it does, is neither ſelf-evident, nor allowed by all men. Here you will allow me to wait for proof. If it does not give any right to decide in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, then I cannot ſee the pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its being mentioned in this manner. The grand queſtion is yet undecided.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:016775_0022_0F9E23FC79A57A10"/>2dly. Is the 'duty required,' an exerciſe of a right in one paſtor to decide in articles of faith for another? The grand thing in queſtion is yet undecided.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The things which are eſſential to Chriſtian communion and fellowſhip are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left to be decided by man's judgment, or they are decided by Chriſt, either expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or by indubitable conſequences of what is expreſſed. If theſe eſſentials of Chriſtian communion be left to be decided by human judgment, then one man hath as good a right to judge what and how many they are, as any other man. And if every man hath an equal right, &amp;c. then no man hath any right to impoſe his judgment concerning theſe eſſentials, &amp;c. on any other man: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the right any one man hath to impoſe his judgment on another, ſuppoſes this other to have no right to judge for himſelf. Then alſo no public body of men have a right to impoſe their judgment, concerning the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtian communion on any other public body, or on any individual: Becauſe the impoſition deſtroys the idea of a right in the public body, or the individual impoſed upon, to judge in this caſe, contrary to the ſuppoſition. The right any public body has to impoſe their judgment, is certainly made up of the <hi>ſum total</hi> of their individual rights. If no individual therefore has any right to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016775_0023_0F9E23FD8AE43928"/>
his judgment on any man, then no public body hath: For ever ſo many cyphers will not amount to a <hi>ſum.</hi> By this it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably evident that the eſſentials of church-communion are not left to be decided by men. If theſe eſſentials, &amp;c. are decided and determined by Chriſt, whether it be expreſsly or by the indubitable conſequences of what is expreſſed; the matter is plain, and mankind are not ſubjected to any of thoſe great inconveniences attending the various and differing deciſions of fallible men.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. To this reply ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> The doctrines taught by thoſe who went from <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Antioch</hi> did not concern the eſſentials of Chriſtian communion, at that time, nor of ſalvation, <hi>Acts,</hi> xv. 11, 21. <hi>Burkitt</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> on the 21ſt verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> No withdrawing of communion was ſo much as dreamed of by either ſide in this diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> If the doctrines taught by thoſe men had regarded the eſſentials of religion, the council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had ſufficient authority to decide upon them; verſe 28. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees were of divine authority, dictated and directed by the Holy Ghoſt. When the Conſociation, now convened in this place will be pleaſed to ſhow their authority to preface their reſult with theſe words, "It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us," I ſhall
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016775_0024_0F9E23FD938D7670"/>
readily acknowledge the pertinency of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for their convention and procedure; until then I muſt view it altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: And do really judge the Conſociation would view it ſo too, had they ſcriptures to mention that were pertinent to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Hart,</hi> in his remarks on a late Pamplet wrote by M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

practice of ſitting and judging with you in ſimilar caſes, ſince I have no remembrance that a <hi>ſimilar caſe</hi> ever came under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Conſociation ſince I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a member: For other matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides religious opinions and articles of faith, have ever been under conſideration when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have attended Conſociation, ſo far as I am able to recollect.</p>
               <p>As to the article in the adminiſtration of church diſcipline you refer to, if the article has reſpect to caſes of <hi>hereſy</hi> and <hi>ſcandal,</hi> we object not: But would obſerve that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe for which it is cited. If it has regard to religious ſentiments and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, we utterly diſclaim it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it at once annihilates the right of private judgment; erects an infallible tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal on earth; and gives men liberty to uſurp Chriſt's throne. <hi>Second.</hi> It would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the compilers of the Platform in a groſs contradiction; ſee Confeſſion of Faith, chap. 21. Sect. 2d. As to the third article to which you refer, reſpecting caſes of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, &amp;c. I would aſk, How is this to your purpoſe? Do you ſuppoſe it is a ſcandal, a ſhame and diſgrace, for a man to believe for himſelf? <hi>i. e.</hi> a cenſurable evil? Is one man's differing from another in his creed, a ſcandalous thing, and does it render him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Chriſtian communion? This cannot
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016775_0026_0F9E23FF1801BC98"/>
be: For then we ſhould all, in this reſpect, be ſcandalous creatures; ſince, perhaps, it would be impoſſible to find two men who believed juſt alike in religious matters. Yet, if we grant that two men might thus agree, they might nevertheleſs differ from a third man, which would be a ſhame to them. Further, the worthy compilers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith did not look upon it ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for a man to be allowed liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and right of private judgment; ſee Confeſſion of Faith, Chap. xxi. Sect. 2d. Hence you ſee the Platform is not a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer in your ſervice, but draughted. By this the Gentlemen of the Conſociation may be ſenſible how they have miſinterpreted our venerable anceſtors, the compilers of the Platform.</p>
               <p>You are ſo far from taking up the words <hi>require</hi> and <hi>judge,</hi> that what you obſerve is rather an avowal of your right and authority to uſe and apply them in the form you have done. But be intreated, Gentlemen, to give yourſelves time for reflection. The term <hi>require</hi> imports authority the requirer has over the required. Now I aſk, Who gave you this pre-eminence in point of authority? From what ſource did it derive? Is it 'from Heaven, or of men?' If from Heaven, it is in the Bible; and if in the Bible, pray point me to the grant and form of inveſtiture. If

               <p>I include both terms, as the authority in exerciſe both in requiring and judging muſt be the ſame.</p>

               <p>WHEN Conſociation were together in the meeting-houſe, the firſt day of their ſeſſions, Nov. 2d, 1779, and had heard the paper read by the Rev. <hi>Iſaac Foſter,</hi> containing his denial of their juriſdiction, &amp;c. the Rev. <hi>Dan Foſter,</hi> a member of Conſociation, entered his proteſtation againſt the deſign and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of Conſociation, and deſired liberty to offer his reaſons for ſaid proteſtation <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly,</hi>

For this reaſon, among others, the paper is now made public.

               <p>As an evidence, yea, a demonſtration of the negative of this queſtion, let it be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the buſineſs of creed-making never did any good in the church, never promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the truth, or ſuppreſſed <hi>hereſy;</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, without exception, had the contrary effect.</p>
               <p>Some of the peculiar tenets of <hi>Arius</hi> were eſteemed by the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> and ſome part of the Chriſtian church, perhaps, heretical and dangerous. Upon this <hi>letters miſſive</hi> were iſſued out by the <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi> of the firſt general eccleſiaſtick council, <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to the biſhops of the ſeveral provinces of the empire, to meet at <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> A.

Accordingly great numbers of the biſhops convened together at time and place, with great <hi>punctuality, gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>ſolemnity!</hi> The fulſom encomiums given this auguſt and venerable aſſembly of biſhops, preſbyters, deacons, &amp;c. by ſome partial hiſtorians of the court-party of that day, I ſhall never undertake to repeat: But only to enquire what good this convention did, and whether they ſuppreſſed the <hi>Arian hereſy,</hi> and prevented the riſing of others, or not? And I know not that I can do this better than by reciting the words of Preſident <hi>Dickiſon</hi> concerning this council, as I find him quoted. "The ſynod of <hi>Nice</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed impoſe ſubſcriptions; but what was the conſequence, but horrible ſchiſms, convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and confuſions, until the church was crumbled into parts and parties, each uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably anathematizing one another?

was the church infeſted with ſuch a ſwarm of <hi>hereticks</hi> and <hi>hereſies,</hi> as ſprang from that corrupt fountain of impoſition and ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Whence one council was convened after another, to draw up new creeds, and impoſe new ſubſcriptions, until almoſt every article of Chriſtianity was both condemned and eſtabliſhed. This was the mark ſet by providence upon the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this kind, that was ever impoſed in the world; and this the defence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation that followed from it. The churches of <hi>New-England</hi> have all continued from their firſt foundation non-ſubſcribers; and yet retain their firſt faith and love. From all this I think, it naturally follows, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is not neceſſary for the being, or well-being of the church; unleſs hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies

are neceſſary to that end." Thus far the judicious and learned Preſident concerning the conſequences of creed-making and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription practiſed by this venerable council.

                     <p>The council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the firſt oecumenical or general council, condemned the religious tenets and ſentiments of <hi>Arius,</hi> A. D. 325. Prodigious trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles immediately aroſe. Some held with the council, others with <hi>Arius.</hi> A. D. 330, <hi>Arius</hi> was recalled from baniſhment by <hi>Conſtantine the Great;</hi> and the ſevere laws againſt him were repealed. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> one of the moſt violent againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> in the <hi>Nicene</hi> council, was, in his turn, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Gaul,</hi> A.

Council was aſſembled after council, council againſt council, and their jarring and contradictory decrees ſpread perplexity and confuſion throughout the whole Chriſtian world. Conſtans was aſſaſſinated, A. D. 350. A great part of the weſtern empire, particularly <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> fell ſoon into the hands of his brother Conſtantius. This change was extremely unfavourable to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents to the decrees of the council of <hi>Nice.</hi> This Emperor's attachment to the Arians induced him to involve their adverſaries in countleſs troubles and miſeries.

Theſe troubles however ended with the death of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who fell in a battle againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> A. D. 378.

In this long and ſhocking conteſt between the <hi>Niceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and Arians, it will be difficult to determine which party moſt exceeded the bounds of probity, charity and moderation. The members of the Arian ſect were wretchedly torn into factions, which regarded each other with the bittereſt averſion. The ancient writers make mention of theſe under the names of Semi-Arians, Euſebians, Aetians, Eunomians, Acacians, Pſathyrians and others.—The Arian controverſy produced new ſects, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the indiſcreet lengths to which the contending parties puſhed their reſpective opinions.

Then Macedonius, biſhop of Conſtantinople, aroſe, who was ſent into exile by the influence of the Eunomians, by the council of Conſtantinople, A. D. 381, which is commonly called the ſecond general or oecumenical council. A great number of other ſects aroſe in about 70 or 80 years after the firſt Nicene council, though of leſs note than thoſe mentioned above; all owing their riſe to the corrupt and abominable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſubſcription, ſet on foot by that council.</p>
                     <p>Early in the 5th cent. A.

The Emperor was not ſo forward for perſecuting men on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their religious tenets as theſe <hi>holy fathers;</hi> and therefore only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a fire to be impoſed on thoſe of that ſect, that would not return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſom of the church. But it ſeems his humanity and lenient temper were put to too ſevere a teſt by a ſecond deputation ſent from thoſe <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and imitators of the mesk and lowly Jeſus,</hi> aſſembled at Carthage, A. D. 407, importuning him, that the laws made in 405, entitled <hi>acts of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> might be put in force and more ſtrictly executed againſt the Donatiſts. Though this faction of the Donatiſts was much broken by theſe reiterated ſhocks; yet it mightily revived again, after the death of Stiticho, who was put to death by the order of Honorius. The gentleneſs and humanity of Honorius got the better of his prejudices again, and in 409, he publiſhed a law in favour of <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> and prohibited all compulſion in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. But this law was not of long continuance. What could be the reaſon of its diſcontinuance? It was certainly founded upon the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt principles of reaſon, policy and religion, and calculated to promote the univerſal good both of church and ſtate. The anſwer is obvious, and the reaſon of its abolition moſt apparent.

The Donatiſts appealed to the Emperor, but to no purpoſe. This ſhock almoſt ruined the ſect for a time. The Donatiſts however recovered their former liberty and tranquility, by means of men of more refined ſentiments of honour, generoſity, humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religion than the catholic biſhops of that day; viz, the Vandals, a barbarous and ſavage nation of the north, who, under Genſeric invaded and took the province of Africa from the Romans. But ſo ſoon as the Arians had found a ſecure retreat among the barbarous Goths, Suevi, Heruli, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Burgundians, and had obtained a little power, they perſecuted the Nicenians to as great a decree of ſeverity and inhumanity, as they had been perſecuted by them. Genſeric, and Hunerie his ſon, the kings of thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations, pulled down the churches of thoſe who held the divinity of Chriſt, ſent their biſhops into exile, maimed and tortured multitudes that were firm in adherence to their creed. And juſtified their proceedings by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which were ſet them by the Chriſtian emperors and biſhops!—Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after this aroſe the ſect of the Neſtorians, formed by Neſtorius, a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, biſhop of Conſtantinople, and a diſciple of the celebrated Theodore of Mopſueſtia. The council of Nice had not decreed any thing concerning the manner or effect of the union of two natures in the ſaviour. Hence the biſhops and doctors had, for about 100 years, expreſſed themſelves as they pleaſed, concerning theſe things. In 428, Anaſtaſius declaimed vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt giving <hi>Mary</hi> the title, <hi>mother of God,</hi> and ſaid ſhe ought to be called <hi>mother of Chriſt.</hi> Neſtorius warmly eſpouſed the ſentiment, and hence the ſect—Cyril, of the ſee of Alexandria, took fire, conſulted with Celeſtine biſhop of Rome, aſſembled a council at Alexandria, A. D. 430, and hurled no leſs than 12 anethemas at the head of Neſtorius. <hi>Here is a controverſy now between two biſhops, of the firſt dignity, about a matter too, not of greater importance than the</hi> tithing of mint, aniſe and cumin; <hi>yet it was carried on without reaſon, moderation, juſtice, religion, or even the leaſt ſhadow of humanity; becauſe they would not tolerate each other in different ſentiments!</hi> After Cyril and Neſtorius had reciprocally excommunicated each other, and exaſperated each other's ſpirits to the utmoſt, a council was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Theodoſius the younger, A. D. 431, to be held at Epheſus, <hi>which was the third oecumenical council.</hi> In this council Cyril preſided, though a party concerned, and an avowed enemy of Neſtorius!! Neſtorius objected againſt the proceedings of the council, as irregular and unjuſt; but, his remonſtrances being without effect, he refuſed to comply with the ſummons that called him before the council. Cyril, the moderator, puſhed on matters with a lawleſs violence, and Neſtorius was judged without being heard; and, in the abſence of a great number of biſhops who belonged to the council, he was compared to the traitor Judas, charged with blaſphemy againſt the divine Majeſty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his epiſcopal dignity, and ſent into exile, where he finiſhed his days. The tranſactions of this council, ſays the hiſtorian, will appear to the candid and equitable reader in the moſt unfavourable light, as full of low ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, contrary to all the rules of juſtice, and even deſtitute of the leaſt air of common decency. <hi>May God grant that none of our poſterity may ever have occaſion to read the ſimilar tranſactions of an eccleſiaſtick council in America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> This Epheſian council, as might be well expected, inſtead of healing divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, did but inflame them more and more, and almoſt deſtroyed all hope of reſtoring concord and tranquillity in the church. John of Antioch, and the other eaſtern biſhops, for whoſe arrival Cyril had refuſed to wait, met at Epheſus, and pronounced againſt him and Memnon the biſhop of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who was his creature, as ſevere a ſentence at they had thundered againſt Neſtorius. Hence aroſe a new and obſtinate diſſention between Cyril and the Orientals, with John the biſhop of Antioch at their head.

A violent averſion to the Neſtorian tenets led many into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extreme. This was the caſe with the famous Eutychus, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Eutychians. Who about A. D. 448, was ordered to renounce his error, by the council aſſembled by Flavianus at Conſtantinople. He obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed to comply with the decrees of the council, and appealed to a general council. In conſequence of which, the Emperor Theodoſius aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled an <hi>oecumenical council</hi> at Epheſus, A. D. 449, at the head of which he placed Dioſcorus biſhop of Alexandria, ſucceſſor to Cyril, and a very faithful imitator of his pride, arrogance and fury, and a declared enemy to the biſhop of Conſtantinople.

The remedies however applied by this council, to heal the wounds of a torn and divided church, proved really worſe than the diſeaſe. Troubles infinite immediately aroſe.

This decree repeated and confirmed all that had been enacted in the councils of Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus, and Chalcedon, againſt the Arians, Neſtorians, and Eutychians. There were bitter complaints againſt the Henoticon, as injurious to the honour and authority of the moſt holy council of Chalcedon. Hence aroſe new conteſts and new diviſions, not leſs deplorable than thoſe which the decree of the union was deſigned to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. It produced new and endleſs conteſts both among the Eutychians and the partiſans of the council of Chalcedon. The doctrines of Pelagius were condemned in a council at Carthage, A. D. 412. This controverſy was refered by Coeleſtius and Pelagius to the deciſion of Zoſimus the Roman Pontiff, who was raiſed to that ſee, A. D. 417. He decided in favour of the monks, and declared them ſound in the ſaith. The African biſhops, with Auguſtin at their head, perſiſted in their ſentence. Zoſimus yielded to the perſeverance of the Africans, changed his mind, and condemned, with the utmoſt ſeverity, Pelagius and Coeleſtius, whom he had honoured with his approbation, and covered with his protection!

                     <p>A fifth oecumenical council was convoked at Conſtantinople, by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Juſtinian, A. D. 553. In this council the emperor gained his point, and had both the doctrines of Origen and the three chapters condemned. This council, inſtead of healing matters by their decrees, made them much worſe, and gave riſe to ſuch diviſions in the church, as could only be healed by length of time. Many ſeparated themſelves from the communion of the Pope, on this occaſion, and carried their diſſentions to a tedious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive length.</p>
                     <p>The ancient ſects remained and were ſtill in the church in the ſeventh century, and inſtead of being ſuppreſſed by the great number of councils of the three proceeding centuries, they were really increaſed and prodigiouſly multiplied thereby.</p>
                     <p>Though the Greek church was already torn aſunder by the moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diviſions, yet its calamities were far from being at an end. A new ſect aroſe, 630, under the reign of Heraclius, which ſhortly excited ſuch violent commotions, as engaged the eaſtern and weſtern churches to unite their forces in order to its extinction. Heraclius having converſed with one Paul, a man of great credit and influence among the Armenian Monophyſites, and with Athanaſius the biſhop of that ſect; iſſued an edict, A. D. 630, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the doctrine of <hi>one will,</hi> and <hi>one operation</hi> in Chriſt. Cyrus, who had been promoted by the emperor to the ſee of Alexandria, aſſembled a council, and got the doctrines of Monothelitiſm, introduced by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's edict, confirmed. This new modification of the doctrine of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Chalcedon, had the deſired effect upon the Monothelites, and induced great numbers of them to return into the boſom of the church. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this promiſing appearance, there preſently ſucceeded the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tumults. Sophronius a monk of Paleſtine, who was preſent at the council at Alexandria aſſembled by Cyrus, in 633, had violently oppoſed the decree of that council confirming the doctrine <hi>of one will.</hi> His oppoſition, though treated by the council with contempt, became formidable the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year. When raiſed to the patriarchal ſee of Jeruſalem, he ſummoned a council in which the Monothelites were condemned as <hi>hereticks,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the Eutychian errors. Sergius the patriarch of Conſtantinople inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Honorius, and determined that Pontiff in favour of Monothelitiſm. Hence aroſe thoſe obſtinate conteſts which rent the church into two ſects, and the ſtate into two factions. To put an end to theſe factions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, Heraclius iſſued out, in 639, the famous edict compoſed by Sergius, called the <hi>ectheſis,</hi> or expoſition of the faith; in which all controverſies upon the queſtion, <hi>whether there was one or two operations in Chriſt,</hi> were ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited. A number of the eaſtern biſhops aſſented to this edict. In the weſt the caſe was quite different. John, the 4th Roman Pontiff of that name, aſſembled a council at Rome in 639, in which the <hi>ectheſis</hi> was rejected, and the Monothelites condemned. Nor was this all; for in the progreſs of this conteſt, a new edict named <hi>the type,</hi> or <hi>formulary,</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the year 648, by the emperor Conſtans, by the advice of Paul of Conſtantinople; by which the <hi>ectheſis</hi> was ſuppreſſed. But this did not give content. Martin, biſhop of Rome, in a council aſſembled at Rome, A. D. 649, conſiſting of 105 biſhops, condemned both the <hi>ectheſis</hi> and the <hi>type;</hi> and thundered out the moſt dreadful anathemas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, for ſeveral years, this unhappy controverſy ſeemes to be extinguiſhed; but it was a lurking flame, which ſpread ſecretly, and gave the more conſiderate reaſon to dread new combuſtions, both in church and ſtate. To prevent theſe Conſtantine Pogonatus, the ſon of Conſtans, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the advice of Agatho the Roman Pontiff, ſummoned the 6th ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or oecumenical council, A. D. 680, in which be permitted the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites and pope Honorius himſelf to be ſolemnly condemned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Roman legates, who repreſented Agatho in that aſſembly, and confirmed the ſentence pronounced by the council by the ſanction of penal laws, enacted againſt ſuch as pretended to oppoſe it. The Monothelites however continued in the church down to the 12th century. As the two laſt councils had decreed nothing concerning eccleſiaſtick diſcipline, nor religious ceremonies; to ſupply this defect, a new aſſembly of biſhops was held pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it to the order of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

D. 692, and was called <hi>Quiniſextum,</hi> being conſidered by the Greeks as a ſupplement to the 5th and 6th general or oecumenical councils.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have looked through the hiſtory of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries, and the ſeven oecumenical councils; all of which, except the laſt, were convened to <hi>judge</hi> of articles of faith, make creeds, form confeſſionals, determine the ſenſe of ſcripture, require ſubſcriptions, and terminate religious controverſies. The conſequences of all theſe <hi>general councils,</hi> and of every other council which met for the ſame purpoſes, for 400 years, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and invariably the ſame, viz the multiplication of errors, the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of tumults, ſtrifes, diviſions, wrath, emulations, ſchiſms, convulſions, factions, and a long and nameleſs train of the moſt deſtructive evils and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to the Chriſtian church. Not a ſingle heretick was ever reclaimed, not an error ſuppreſſed, nor one good conſequence ever produced, by any one, or by all theſe eccleſiaſtick councils during 400 years. And if we ſhould trace down the hiſtory of the church to the preſent century, we ſhall find the ſame conſequences always and invariably following all eccleſiaſtick councils, which have ever been holden, to <hi>judge</hi> of articles of faith, make creeds, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare religious tenets with creeds already made, impoſe ſubſcriptions, condemn errors, excommunicate or reclaim hereticks, &amp;c. And, as human nature is the ſame in all ages, we have the greateſt reaſon to expect the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences will follow all councils that ſhall ever, through divine ſufference, be convened for theſe purpoſes, ſo long as time ſhall endure. For it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon, to the will of Heaven, to all the principles of human liberty and that right which the Deity himſelf hath granted to all mankind, to ſearch, examine and judge for themſelves in all matters of religion, that an eccleſiaſtick council ſhould ever meet for ſuch purpoſes as above. Indeed it is ſurpriſing and greatly aſtoniſhing, that any eccleſiaſtick council ſhould be guilty of ſuch bold and daring preſumption as to meet for the purpoſes of judging upon articles of faith, making creeds, impoſing ſubſcriptions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning whom they ſhall be pleaſed to call erroneous, <hi>withdrawing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> &amp;c. after more than 1400 years ſad and awful experience of the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, abominable, deſtructive and God-provoking conſequences of ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices!

                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:016775_0044_0F9E241B0E758DA8"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of the <hi>heretick, "he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and ſinneth, being condemned of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</hi> And what he here ſays of him is perfectly conſiſtent with what hath been ſaid above concerning an <hi>heretick.</hi> The Bible is the only rule of faith a Chriſtian church hath adopted; an individual in that church, whether preacher or hearer, it matters not, hath formed certain opinions, not <hi>expreſſly</hi> contained in the Bible, and inſiſts upon it thas his brethren ſhall ſubſcribe them. In ſo doing he ſubverts the foundation on which the church was built, he greatly ſinneth and is condemned of himſelf; for he ſubſcribed the Bible as the <hi>only</hi> rule of Chriſtian faith, and now will ſubſtitute ſomething elſe, as the rule of his faith, his own dogmas and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The learned and judicious critick, Mr. Poole, gives the ſame meaning to the words <hi>hereſy</hi> and <hi>heretick,</hi> as is above given. Says he, <hi>"Eſt ergo hic hereticus, is qui per opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem,

               <p n="2">II. Let us enquire what is the duty of Chriſtians concerning an heretick? And when an <hi>heretick</hi> appears in the church, all Chriſtians, who ſubſcribe the Bible as their <hi>only</hi> rule of faith, are bound to avoid him, to turn away from him, and to refuſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all free and familiar converſation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with him. They may and ought to treat him very much in the ſame manner they would treat an excommunicate. St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not ſay excommunicate, but reject him, <hi>paraitou, paſs by him, neglect him;</hi> for this good reaſon, that he hath excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated himſelf, by ſubverting the foundation of church communion and fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>And this treatment of the <hi>heretick</hi> is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſentiment of the learned critick before quoted. Says he, <hi>"Non ampliùs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte ad colloquium, ſed averſare; in externa eccleſiae congregatione manere nec patere; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica dum reſipiſcat; notam illi inure ut bomini qui cenſurae eccleſiae ſubjacet, &amp; ſube omnes familiare ejus conſortium fugere."</hi>

               <p>Now we have a fair and ready reply to the queſtions before put. 1. Muſt we not

endeavour to exterminate hereſy? Reject, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it? 2. Can we with a good conſcience permit men to profeſs or preach hereſy? In a church that adopts the Bible as her <hi>only</hi> rule of faith, if a man either profeſs or preach that ſhe ought to adopt ſomething elſe; for inſtance, ſeveral notions and tenets he has formed, in addition to the Bible, as her rule of faith; the church muſt admoniſh him a firſt and ſecond time; if he ſtill perſiſt in profeſſing or preaching his hereſy, the church muſt refuſe, reject and avoid him. 3. How ſhall we prevent the growth and prevalence of <hi>hereſy,</hi> any otherwiſe than by bringing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, termed <hi>heretical,</hi> to ſome teſt or ſtandard of orthodoxy? St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, an <hi>heretick</hi> is <hi>"condemned of himſelf:"</hi> If ſo, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there can be no neceſſity for bringing his opinions to any teſt or ſtandard of ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>In proof of which I have already obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no eccleſiaſtick council of any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that hath ever been in the Chriſtian church, hath ever done any good, hath ever promoted truth, or ſuppreſſed error; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the contrary; when ever they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to judge of doctrines for others, or
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:016775_0050_0F9E241F53222D98"/>
to make creeds and formulas for the churches.</p>
               <p>The truth of this propoſition is alſo a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and neceſſary inference from the three propoſitions juſt premiſed.</p>
               <p>The New Teſtament every where ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes all men, both preachers and hearers, <hi>ſole</hi> judges, for themſelves, with regard to the truth and falſhood of doctrines of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their agreement and repugnancy to the unerring ſtandard.</p>
               <p>Now, to anſwer the queſtion put, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is not ſuch a thing as falſhood, or falſe doctrine, ſhort of <hi>hereſy,</hi> which is not to be endured in our churches?</p>
               <p>I doubt not the poſſibility of a man's preaching falſe doctrines; doctrines not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained either explicitly or implicitly in the Bible; yea, it may be granted poſſible, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that a man may preach things contrary to what is thus contained in the Bible: Not contrary to what is <hi>expreſſly</hi> contained in the the Bible, but contrary to what may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in implied. Now, if a man preach nothing contrary to any <hi>expreſs</hi> propoſition of the Bible, though he may often deliver things repugnant to what is implied therein; yet, ſo long as his church, the people of his charge, are eaſy under his miniſtry, and do not diſcern the repugnancy of his doctrines to the Bible; no man, or body of men, no eccleſiaſtick council, of whatever name, have
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:016775_0051_0F9E2423DB8C5670"/>
any divine right to diſturb this worſhipping aſſembly of Chriſtians, by any of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, opinions or decrees whatſoever; for the reaſons above given, viz. that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath a <hi>ſole</hi> right of judging, for himſelf, with regard to the truth or falſhood of his doctrines, and their agreement or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the unerring ſtandard: And that his hearers have alſo a <hi>ſole</hi> right of judging, for themſelves, with regard to the truth or falſhood of the doctrines they hear, and their agreement or diſagreement with the unerring ſtandard.</p>
               <p>I have put the caſe now as favourably as poſſible on the ſide of thoſe who hold the <hi>popiſh tenet</hi> above with reference to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of eccleſiaſtick councils. For it hath been generally the caſe, that a man charged with preaching falſe doctrine, and things diſagreeing with the implications of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; hath been <hi>guilty</hi> of delivering ſome things contrary to <hi>long preſcription,</hi> and <hi>hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creeds and confeſſionals,</hi> made by men, and unjuſtly and injuriouſly impoſed on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! And I greatly fear, yea, I know, if au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick hiſtory does not lie, that both preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and profeſſors of religion have oftner been perſecuted, proſcribed, impriſoned, deprived and ſlain, for preaching and profeſſing doctrines and opinions contrary to <hi>ſacred creeds</hi> and <hi>confeſſions of faith,</hi> and the <hi>eſtabliſhed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> than for contradicting any thing implied
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:016775_0052_0F9E242543455760"/>
in the Bible! Witneſs the cruelties and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſufferings of that part of Chriſt's church which fled into the wilderneſs, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhelter themſelves in the low countries and vales of <hi>Piedmont</hi>—of the <hi>Wickliffites</hi> in <hi>England</hi>—the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>—the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Puritans,</hi> our pious and illuſtrious anceſtors, in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and numberleſs others, in all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Were theſe worthies always perſecuted and tormented to death, becauſe they departed from the <hi>Bible-creed</hi> in their preaching and profeſſions! Pride, ambition, luſt of power, inſtigating men to practiſe upon that <hi>exploded popiſh maxim,</hi> were the formal cauſe of the ſufferings and deaths of theſe faithful witneſſes of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who, long ſince, wear bright, glorious and unfading crowns, in the kingdom of <hi>his</hi> father and <hi>their</hi> father.</p>
               <p>When the caſe is really ſuch in any church or worſhipping aſſembly of Chriſtians, that they univerſally, or very generally, diſapprove of, and are diſguſted with, the doctrines and tenets of their preacher, as judging them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with reaſon, and repugnant to the word of God; I know not of any power on earth that has a right to oblige that church, or worſhipping aſſembly (after they have taken all reaſonable pains rightly to inform their own judgments, like the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> of old, by ſearching the ſcriptures) ſtill to live

under his adminiſtrations. But yet no ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick council hath any buſineſs here; ſo far at leaſt as the matter relates to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and doctrines preached and heard in this church. If an eccleſiaſtick council be called in by the church and people in this ſituation, <hi>purely</hi> to adviſe as to the expediency or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency of diſmiſſing the paſtor; I have not ſo much to object againſt it: Though I confeſs I know not that even this meaſure is warrantable, from any thing that is either expreſſed or implied in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Put the caſe, that a very few individuals in a church, or worſhipping aſſembly of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are diſſatisfied with ſome particular te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and doctrines of the preacher; whilſt however the paſtor and nine tenths of the church and people are agreed and ſatisfied as to theſe tenets and doctrines. Neither the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nor majority of the people, pretend to impoſe ſubſcription to theſe obnoxious tenets, as they are called, on the minority, or any individual. Neither of theſe tenets is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcripture, nor <hi>expreſſed</hi> in the ſcripture, and therefore not eſſential to church-communion and ſalvation; nor neceſſary to be believed by any Chriſtian, nor denied. For every thing eſſential to church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſalvation is <hi>expreſſed</hi> in the Bible; and every thing neceſſary to be denied and rejected by a Chriſtian man is contrary to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:016775_0054_0F9E242618C199C8"/>
ſcripture. This is evident upon the leaſt reflection, for certainly a good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God deſigns the preſent peace and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs of mankind: He would not therefore leave things ſo in his word, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule of the Chriſtian's faith, as to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the preſent peace, much leſs the future happineſs of mankind: But if every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be received or rejected by the Chriſtian man, were not <hi>expreſſed</hi> in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or plainly and indubitably contrary to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> ſcripture; both the preſent peace and future happineſs of men would be endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for ſcarce two men can be found who agree in their interpretations of implicit or doubtful ſcriptures, or in any articles or points of doctrine neither expreſſed in the Bible, nor indubitably contrary to what is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: Therefore we may depend upon it, that the ſpirit of God hath <hi>expreſſed,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained <hi>expreſſly,</hi> every neceſſary article of the Chriſtian creed. Therefore the tenets and doctrines complained of, are not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of religion. However, repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made to the Aſſociation of theſe obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tenets; the Aſſociation take pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves in the matter, and adviſe to the convention of the Conſociation to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> on the premiſes. The preacher is deſired and even <hi>required</hi> to appear before this venerable body of <hi>clergymen</hi> and <hi>laies,</hi> to

                  <hi>anſwer to charges</hi> exhibited againſt him, for <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>holding</hi> ſuch dangerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines!</p>
               <p>Now, Is not all this mighty ſtir perfectly right? What will the poor criminal preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do? And what will this auguſt aſſembly of divines and philoſophers do?</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the queſtion, Is not all this ſtir per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly right? I reply, This convention of Conſociation is, in my humble opinion, wrong, miſtaken, unadviſed, anti-ſcriptural, and oppreſſive.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>This convention is to hear and <hi>judge</hi> upon articles of faith, and they have, according to the ſuppoſition above, <hi>required</hi> the accuſed to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, to <hi>anſwer to articles of charge,</hi> concerning <hi>doctrines</hi> and <hi>religious opinions.</hi> Hence it is apparent this venerable body imagine they have ſome authority in theſe matters. And in truth they really have ſome authority, or they have abuſed two plain Engliſh words, <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>require;</hi> both which words immediately convey to the minds of all, who hear or ſee them, whether they be ſimple or learned, the idea of authority. But if this body claim authority, they muſt neceſſarily claim <hi>infallibility;</hi> becauſe, if they are not endued with infallibility, they will lead thoſe into error, moſt likely, on whom they impoſe their <hi>authoritative judgment.</hi> "This claim of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority," ſays the Diſſenting Gentleman, "is an invaſion of the divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and in the language of the Holy Ghoſt, a ſitting in the temple of God, ſhewing itſelf that it is God. It is a claim of <hi>honour</hi> as due to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor, <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>fallible</hi> men, which belongs only to the omniſcient and infallible God, and to Chriſt the ſole lawgiver and king in the church. It is the very root of Antichriſtianiſm; the prop upon which the whole ſyſtem of popery reſts; it came from the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thither it directly leads." p. 232.</p>
                     <p>The celebrated Mr. <hi>Prior</hi> ſays of ſuch boaſted authority, "Oh! the <hi>tragedies</hi> this uſurped <hi>authority</hi> has acted in the world!

Is it a breach of charity to ſuppoſe, that if Dr. <hi>Hare</hi>'s qualifications were to be required in each member of our Conſociations, before they ſhould be admitted to judge, that five tenths of their number would be generally excluded? I preſume that if theſe qualifications were to be read at the opening of the ſeſſions, and thoſe only were to ſtay behind as judges, who were thus qualified, the number of judges would be extremely ſmall. Yet, according to preſent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, all who come are admitted to judge, without exception! Muſt we be borne in hand that this is a divine conſtitution! did it deſcend from Heaven, and proceed from a God of infinite wiſdom and unbounded goodneſs! has it met with the approbation of that immortal lover of man, <hi>Jeſus</hi> our dear and bleſſed <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who, to plant religion in our dark benighted world, clothed himſelf in humanity, lived, preached, ſuffered, bled and died amongſt men!

               <p>ALTHOUGH I repeatedly requeſted a copy of the reſult of Conſociation at <hi>Weſt-Stafford,</hi> before they left the ground, and was as often promiſed one as ſoon as it could be prepared; yet after waiting about a month, and when I had almoſt concluded the Gentlemen had forgot their promiſe, or made it with ſome mental reſervation, I received, very much worn and defaced, a <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> indorſed on the back in the following words, "<hi>A copy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of</hi> Conſociation <hi>at</hi> Weſt-Stafford, <hi>Nov.</hi> 2, 1779."

I then looked to ſee who were of the <hi>Conſociation,</hi> at what <hi>time,</hi> and in what <hi>place</hi> they held their ſeſſion, and found no place, time nor perſon; I then looked to ſee who was the <hi>Complainant,</hi> what the <hi>complaint,</hi> who the Defendant and

where reſiding, in fine who the <hi>parties</hi> were that appeared to implead each other, and found no <hi>body</hi> and <hi>nothing.</hi> I am obliged therefore to call it the copy of a Reſult or Report of a certain <hi>anonymous Committee,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, as ſuch by the two men before named, and muſt ſtill wait that their promiſe of a copy be accompliſhed, while I repeat my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a true, full, and properly atteſted copy, not of the Report of a nameleſs <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> but of <hi>Conſociation,</hi> that identical <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation</hi> that ſet in judgment upon my creed laſt fall, at <hi>Weſt-Stafford.</hi>

                           <p>"ART. I. That Children are not born with ſinful and vicious natures, and that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s ſin and guilt is not imputed or convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his poſterity, but Children are born in the image of God, objects of his favour and without deſert of puniſhment. This article owned and defended by Mr. <hi>Foſter. Voted</hi> dangerous and contrary to goſpel, according to charge. The <hi>Conſociation</hi> diſapprove of it for the following reaſon. The word of God is full and expreſs in aſſerting that men are born into the world with corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:016775_0064_0F9E2432DB30E830"/>
natures, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 5, ſpeaking of the wickedneſs of man, it is ſaid, <hi>the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one," Job</hi> xiv. 4, and <hi>John</hi> iii. 6. <hi>"That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh," Eph.</hi> ii. 3. <hi>"and were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture children of wrath, even as others."</hi> And that man derives a corrupt nature from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is abundantly plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 3. And <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſon in his own likeneſs after his image, not after the image of God, in which we read man was firſt made, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 27, <hi>"God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him;"</hi> but in his own fallen likeneſs. <hi>Pſalm</hi> li. 5, <hi>"Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive me." Rom.</hi> v. 12, and on, <hi>"there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men for that all have ſinned."</hi> And 18, <hi>"therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation."</hi> And 19. <hi>"by one man's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience many were made ſinners."</hi> If children are not polluted, why then are they baptized? Why neceſſary to be regenerated for the enjoyment of God? Thus evident it is to every candid and impartial mind that man is born into the world with a ſinful nature, not in the moral image of God, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not free from guilt or deſert of puniſhment.</p>

                           <p>ART. III. That obedience is the only condition in the covenant of grace. Owned and defended by Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> and as explained in his defence and printed works, was by the council voted dangerous. <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 5, 6. <hi>"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs"—"Even as David deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works."</hi> In theſe words the bleſſings of the covenant of grace are expreſſly ſuſpended on faith, but they could not be if obedience in diſtinction from faith were the only condition. It is certain without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord, and the goſpel contains the moſt weighty arguments to univerſal obedience: But this obedience is the fruit of an union with Chriſt, and it can no more exiſt without this union than a branch ſevered from the vine can bear fruit. <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 5. and xi. 6.</p>
                           <p>ART. IV. That we have a natural and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power to do all that the goſpel requireth of us. Owned and defended. Voted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural and dangerous according to charge. Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> wholly explodes the diſtinction between natural and moral power as fooliſh and ridiculous, and in his defence aſſerts that
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:016775_0066_0F9E24360A84BFC0"/>
we have all power neceſſary to do what the goſpel requires of us in order to inherit its bleſſings. That God doth not require na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impoſſibilities of men we are as full in aſſerting as he can be, but at the ſame time, muſt believe that man's inability to holineſs is ſuch as fully to juſtify thoſe words of our ſaviour, <hi>John,</hi> vi. 44. <hi>"No man can come unto me except the father which hath ſent me draw him."</hi> And of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7. <hi>"The carnal mind is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."</hi>—Should we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that man hath full power to do all the Goſpel requires of him, in every ſenſe in which he may be ſaid to poſſeſs it, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we muſt then admit a principle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him naturally, in his fallen ſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God, or elſe utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the force of moral obligation—For to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the rule of duty to the blaſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved heart, is to make it what we pleaſe, and it is entirely repugnant to all our notions of the perfections of the deity, that he ſhould give his rational creatures ſuch mutable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable laws, for his laws are all like himſelf holy, juſt, and good immutably.</p>
                           <p>ART. V. That our good works are the matter of our juſtification at the Redeemer's bar. Owned and defended. Voted unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and dangerous. This article, Mr. <hi>Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> profeſſes openly to defend, but to us it
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:016775_0067_0F9E243693CBCF60"/>
appears directly oppoſite to, and ſubverſive of the goſpel method of ſalvation. No doctrine is more plainly and frequently taught, as a foundation principle in the holy ſcripture, than that the believer's juſtification before God, is wholly on account of Chriſt's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 28. A man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law,—and 20 <hi>"By the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight." Titus</hi> iii. 7. <hi>"That being juſtified by his grace we ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life." Rom.</hi> v. 19. <hi>"So by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous."</hi> Can any thing be more evident from theſe and ſimilar texts than that the matter of our juſtification before God, is not our own perſonal defective obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the all-perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, and received by faith alone. This righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the ſole and excluſive ground of our pardon and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, and juſtification at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's bar, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 4. <hi>"For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth."</hi>—Saints in glory are deſcribed as having their robes made white in the blood of the lamb. <hi>Rev.</hi> vii. 14. "Theſe <hi>are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.</hi> If our works are the matter of our juſtification at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:016775_0068_0F9E243768D2CE40"/>
bar, it is difficult to ſay for what purpoſe Chriſt died, or how be is mediator between God and man.</p>
                           <p>ART. VI. That Chriſt's righteouſneſs is not ſufficient for our acceptance with God, that being a legal righteouſneſs, but we muſt have a goſpel righteouſneſs for which we ſhall be accepted. Voted, proved according to charge. For the reaſons we refer to the texts cited under the preceeding article.</p>
                           <p>ART. VII. That the doctrine of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and perſonal election is not known in the word of God. Proved according to charge. It is proved in the opinion of the Conſociation that Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> explodes the idea of perſonal election, particularly in a ſermon delivered at the ordination of his ſon <hi>Daniel,</hi> pages p. 50 and 51. This doctrine is plainly and fully taught in divine Revelation. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 11. <hi>"In whom alſo we have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an inheritance being predeſtinated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will."</hi> And 4, 5. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world; having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Jeſus Chriſt. Rom.</hi> viii. 29. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate—moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>ART. VIII. That Chriſt died for the whole world in this ſenſe, that one as much
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:016775_0069_0F9E243828CC03F8"/>
as another is alike given to Chriſt. This Article is proved according to charge in the judgment of this Council, in the ſermon Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> preached at Mr. <hi>Joel Foſter</hi>'s or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.—This Conſociation doubt not of the ſufficiency of the merits of the ſaviour for the whole world: But it will not hence follow that Chriſt died for all intentionally alike, or that one as much as another is given to Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> xvii. 9. <hi>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine</hi>— and 20, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone but for them alſo who ſhall believe on me, through their word. John</hi> vi. 37. <hi>All that the father giveth me ſhall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> If Chriſt died for all, as much for one as another, then if all do not actually participate of the benefits of his death, and at laſt arrive to Heaven, his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intention muſt be fruſtrated.</p>
                           <p>ART. IX. That the righteous man who is pardoned and juſtified and has the promiſe of life, may fall from his righteouſneſs and finally periſh. Not ſufficiently proved.</p>
                           <p>ART. X. That the Bible is badly tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much of it, and in one place an error in the original.</p>
                           <p>As to this article, the Conſociation are of opinion that Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> only meant that there were errors in ſome Hebrew copies.</p>

               <p>As the reader has the report before him, I think it needleſs to repeat the articles in the following ſtrictures.</p>
               <p>ART. I. &amp;c.—Voted dangerous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to goſpel, according to charge, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved for the following reaſon: 'The word of God, ſay they, is full and expreſs in aſſerting that men are born into the world with corrupt and depraved natures.'—Very confidently ſaid, but where are theſe <hi>full</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcriptures to be found in the word of God? Why, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 5, is one; ſpeaking of the wickedneſs of man, it is ſaid, <hi>the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the thoughts of his heart are only evil
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:016775_0071_0F9E243A31E963B8"/>
continually.</hi>—But what would they infer from theſe words? Was the wickedneſs of the antediluvian world referred to in <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 5, their natural corruption and depravity? If it was then this natural corruption is not univerſal, ſince <hi>Noah</hi> muſt be excepted who was a juſt man, perfect in his generations and walked with God, ſee the 9th verſe: Or was this wickedneſs an evidence of their natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? If ſo, then by parity of reaſon <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was naturally, or as he came into exiſtence, corrupt, for he eat the forbidden fruit; and the angels, at leaſt many of them, were created vicious beings, for they revolted from the <hi>Almighty:</hi> Or, does the evidence of the natural corruption of the human race depend upon the univerſality of the corruption and depravity of mankind referred to? Then certainly <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved; for, when they only were exiſtent, mankind were ſurely univerſally depraved and that without any exception; whereas there was one man righteous in the age referred to. Hence it is very apparent that the corruption of mankind in the age referred to, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>natural</hi> corruption <hi>itſelf,</hi> nor an <hi>evidence</hi> of it. It is the unhappineſs of ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that they aſcribe to human nature ſimply as exiſting, what belongs to it only as men have corrupted it by a long courſe of continued impiety: Thus they make all men
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:016775_0072_0F9E243ADD21CB50"/>
children of wrath by nature, from the Apoſtle's words to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ii. 2, 3. which evidently relate to their former ſtate of Heatheniſm, when they lived in groſs idolatry and under the government of the prince of darkneſs, as the context plainly ſhows. Is it a juſt and concluſive method of reaſoning, to argue from the ſtate of human nature, when corrupted by actual ſins and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, to its ſtate and condition as it comes into exiſtence? Becauſe human nature is capable of being viciated, and is in fact viciated, by perſonal wickedneſs, therefore it is vicious as it proceeds from the finiſhing hands of its maker? Becauſe the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of a moral wicked agent are evil, therefore the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of one who is not a moral agent, <hi>viz.</hi> an infant, are evil? Becauſe the ſcriptures inform of a man, or number of men, who by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued courſe of wickedneſs, had contracted fixed habits of villainy to that degree that all their thoughts and imaginations were evil, ſhall we take this to be a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcripture aſſertion that men are born into the world vicious and depraved? If a man in a long courſe of open impiety, is finally left of God to commit murder, and dies on a gibbet, is this an indubitable evidence that he was born into the world a wicked wretch, with a murderous diſpoſition? It ſeems ſo, or <hi>Gen.</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:016775_0073_0F9E243BE9948BE8"/>
vi. 5. would never have been cited in proof of the ſtate of mankind by nature, or as they came into the world. If ſuch reaſoning is not to be allowed, then the text cited is not to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The next ſcripture cited by the committee as <hi>expreſſly</hi> aſſerting that man is born into the world with a corrupt and vicious nature, is <hi>Job</hi> xiv. 4, <hi>'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.'</hi> Let the reader only turn his attention to the preceeding verſes of the chapter, and he will find that the cleanneſs and uncleanneſs referred to in the words as they ſtand connected with the context, have no reference at all to moral evil, but only and ſimply to the ſhortneſs, vanity and afflictions of the preſent life— that we are liable to many evils in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate; our days are few and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, we are cut down like a flower, and flee as a ſhadow. As parents are frail and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſo they propagate a frail and mortal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for nothing can be more perfect than its original: This is <hi>Job</hi>'s reaſoning, and the evident deſign of the words: How then is native corruption and viciouſneſs expreſsly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in theſe words, when they have no manner of relation to any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>full</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcripture for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural depravity uſed by the <hi>Committee,</hi> is <hi>John</hi> iii. 6. <hi>'That which is born of the Fleſh
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:016775_0074_0F9E243C93093AE0"/>
is Fleſh.'</hi> i. e. that which is born in the ſenſe <hi>you Nicodemus</hi> ſpeak of, is but a mere man conſtituted of body and ſoul, or the mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and powers of a man in their natural ſtate, and ſo not fit for the viſion of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not holy; therefore our ſaviour informs him that a different birth was neceſſary in order to qualify for the kingdom of God, viz. a ſpiritual one: But not a word is there here about original depravity, or that we are born vicious.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcripture is <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 3. which we have mentioned already to have reference to a ſtate of heatheniſm, and needs nothing further ſaid upon it.</p>
               <p>The committee proceed—"That man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives a corrupt nature from <hi>Adam</hi> is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 3. And <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat a ſon in his own likeneſs, after his image; not after the image of God, in which we read man was firſt made, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 27, <hi>'God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him,'</hi> but in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted fallen likeneſs." Powerful reaſoning! <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſon in his likeneſs, and what would they infer from this? So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour orders of creatures, according to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſtabliſhment, beget their young in their likeneſs: Is this an evidence of natural viciouſneſs? No more, I fancy, is intended by the words, than that <hi>Adam,</hi> as a worker,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:016775_0075_0F9E243EAF4B50A8"/>
together with God, begat an human reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, and therefore in his likeneſs; <hi>i. e.</hi> he begat a man like himſelf, having the ſame nature that God had given him. That it has no reference to the qualities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities of <hi>Adam</hi>'s mind, or his ſon's, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, unleſs minds are propagated as bodies are, by natural generation, and <hi>Adam</hi> was the father of <hi>Seth</hi>'s ſpirit, as he was of his fleſh: And if this be the caſe, I ſee not why one moral quality may not be propagated as well as another; holineſs as well as ſin, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as well as vice; for viciouſneſs is no more of the eſſence of the mind than virtue. If then minds are propagated in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as bodies are the qualities of theſe minds are in like manner propagated, for they are not to be ſeparated in any given inſtance; by conſequence an holy mind will propagate an holy mind, and <hi>vice verſa:</hi> In the ſame manner that a vicious moral quality may be propogated, in the ſame manner a virtuous moral quality may be propogated. If this reaſoning be not good, let the fallacy be ſhewn. But the truth is, moral viciouſneſs has its ſeat in the mind, and the Almighty is the direct and immediate author of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, and therefore ſtiled in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the father of our ſpirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 9.<note n="*" place="bottom">That God is the direct and immediate author of the human mind is a propoſition I ſhall at preſent take for granted; when the truth of it is called in queſtion and diſputed, I ſtand ready to prove it.</note>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:016775_0076_0F9E243FC90B9CE0"/>
and ſaid to form the ſpirit of man within him, <hi>Zech.</hi> xii. 1. Hence if <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſon had any vicious qualities in his mind connate with the exiſtence of it, God placed them there, from whom his mind immediately derived, which makes the pure and holy God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and prime ſource of all the wickedneſs that ever exiſted among the human race: But, <hi>'are not my ways equal?'</hi> ſaith the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. May <hi>he</hi> defend us from ſuch a <hi>blaſphemous imputation!</hi>—I would here juſt obſerve that the word <hi>own,</hi> which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appear to place the ſtreſs of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 3, upon, is not in the original, but ſupplied by the tranſlators, and the text ought to be read thus—<hi>'And A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam begat in his likeneſs, in his image:'</hi> To make it therefore an emphatical word is quite unjuſtifiable.</p>
               <p>From what has already been obſerved, is not this conſequence unavoidable, <hi>viz.</hi> that mankind are not corrupt and vicious as they come into the world? It is capable, I think of demonſtration that whatever viciouſneſs there is in the human mind, as it comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exiſtence, muſt proceed from God equally with the mind itſelf. Does it not appear vain then for any man to reaſon from thoſe words <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 3, to prove derived viciouſneſs, when agreeable to ſuch reaſoning this viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt derive immediately from the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:016775_0077_0F9E244062E5A3B8"/>
deity? Further, are theſe Gentlemen of the Committee abſolutely certain that <hi>Adam,</hi> when he begat <hi>Seth,</hi> was not a convert, a truly religious and holy man? He was now 130 years old, and had lived nearly as long under the goſpel diſpenſation; if he ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the goſpel and became a virtuous man, as has been always believed in the church, it is in the higheſt degree probable he was now a virtuous and godly man. And if moral pravity may be propagated by natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the Committee ſuppoſe, why not moral virtue alſo? And if moral virtue may be thus propagated, why is it not quite as likely <hi>Seth</hi> was born virtuous as vicious? I think it lies upon the Committee to make it evident that virtue cannot be propagated as well as depravity; or that <hi>Adam,</hi> when he begat <hi>Seth,</hi> was not a virtuous man. Until then I muſt look upon the argument from this text, in favour of the natural viciouſneſs of mankind, as abſolutely inconcluſive and prodigiouſly uncharitable.</p>
               <p>If the Gentlemen I oppoſe will avow the opinion, that minds are capable of diviſion and multiplication, and therefore, like the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal part, are propagated by natural generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they might give a better account of their derived viciouſneſs; although in this caſe to impute guilt to the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them on account of this derived viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:016775_0078_0F9E24411FD5B438"/>
would be unjuſt and unequal, ſince it was by virtue of no act or choice of theirs— to which they had never given their aſſent or conſent.</p>
               <p>The next ſcripture they have ſeen fit to produce as <hi>expreſs</hi> proof of our being born vicious, is <hi>Pſalm</hi> li. 5. <hi>'I was ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.'</hi> The words, agreeable to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ought to be rendered—<hi>'I was born in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother nurſe, or nouriſh me,'</hi> which words have no reference, I conceive, to his ſimple formation in his mother's womb, but import no more than that he was a great ſinner, early went aſtray, and had contracted ſtrong habits of vice. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of guiding the widow from his mother's womb, <hi>Job</hi> xxxi. 18. The wicked are ſaid to go aſtray from the womb, as ſoon as born, ſpeaking lies, <hi>Pſalm</hi> lviii. 3, and the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> is called a tranſgreſſor from the womb, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xlviii. 8. Theſe ſcriptures are of like import with the words of the Pſalmiſt under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and intend no more than that they did theſe things very early, as ſoon as capable; not that <hi>Job</hi> guided the widow, the wicked went aſtray, and the Jews tranſgreſſed as ſoon as born, even in an infant ſtate, for this was utterly impoſſible. If we take the words in the literal ſenſe of our tranſlation, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>David</hi> chargeth his ſin and wickedneſs,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:016775_0079_0F9E2441E53E7068"/>
not upon himſelf, but upon ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for, it will be granted on all hands, he did not ſhape and conceive himſelf: Who then ſhaped him? Anſwer, God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxix. 73, and <hi>Job</hi> xxxi. 15. <hi>That God made us,</hi> is an unanſwerable reply to all reaſonings from ſuch ſcriptures as theſe, or any other, to prove natural viciouſneſs, and is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable evidence that they are groſſly miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and abuſed, while ſtrained to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize ſuch a <hi>blaſphemous ſentiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next ſcriptures advanced as being <hi>expreſs</hi> in the caſe of derived viciouſneſs, are "<hi>Rom.</hi> v. 12. <hi>Wherefore as by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned</hi>—and 18, <hi>therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation</hi>—and 19, <hi>by one man's diſobedience many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>" The Committee mean to prove from <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 12, that man derives a corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Adam, i. e.</hi> a nature morally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or vicious—'<hi>Wherefore by</hi> one <hi>man, ſin entered into the world:</hi>' Here the Apoſtle affirms that ſin entered into the world by <hi>one</hi> man, <hi>i. e.</hi> Adam. <hi>'And death by ſin.'</hi> What ſin? Whoſe ſin? Evidently <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, his <hi>one</hi> ſin of eating the forbidden fruit. <hi>'And ſo death paſſed upon all men."</hi> That is, by the <hi>one</hi> ſin of the <hi>one</hi> man <hi>Adam,</hi> the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race became mortal. <hi>'For that all
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:016775_0080_0F9E24429F62A718"/>
have ſinned.'</hi> How is this? Does the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here affirm, that <hi>all</hi> men have ſinned, contradiſtinguiſhing ſin from ſuffering? This would be to contradict himſelf in the ſame verſe. He had juſt affirmed, that <hi>one</hi> man ſinned, and that death came upon all for, or in conſequence, of that <hi>one</hi> ſin: Now to make him affirm in the laſt clauſe, that <hi>all</hi> have ſinned, would make him palpably contradict himſelf. Further, it would not then be by <hi>one</hi> ſin 'that death hath paſſed upon all men;' but by <hi>many</hi> ſins, even the ſins of all men, directly repugnant to the expreſs words of the inſpired writer. That mortality came into the world, and paſſed upon all men, by <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>one</hi> ſin, is proved from the text: But that mankind derive a corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Adam</hi> is not <hi>expreſſed</hi> in the text moſt certainly; nor can it be inferred from any expreſſion in the text, with the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of probability, except the laſt clauſe: And that the Apoſtle doth not mean to be literally underſtood in this clauſe, is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly evident, unleſs he contradicts himſelf, which we may not ſuppoſe. He evidently means <hi>ſuffering</hi> by the word <hi>ſin, ſuffered</hi> by <hi>ſinned,</hi> as is very uſual in the ſacred writings. Further that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not mean to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that all mankind ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from this, that he affirms all are liable to death, on account of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, which
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:016775_0081_0F9E2443ABE74DB8"/>
he would not have done, had he meant that all mankind had ſinned, and ſo became liable to death on account of their own ſin; which they would have been, had they all ſinned in <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <p>As to verſes, 18th and 19th, cited by the Committee, I ſhall obſerve nothing upon them, the above being a full reply to any thing they can gather from thoſe verſes to prove what they undertook to eſtabliſh from <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſcripture,</hi> viz. that man derives a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature from <hi>Adam;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Committee then proceed to propound two queſtions, viz.</p>
               <p n="1">I. If children are not polluted why then are they baptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Baptiſm is a ſeal of the covenant, the badge of Chriſt's diſciples; and infants are baptized, to diſtinguiſh them from the world as ſuch, by divide order: And not to waſh away original ſin as the Papiſts dream.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Why neceſſary that infants be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for the enjoyment of God?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Thus after miſinterpreting and miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the above ſcriptures, and propounding two queſtions; as if conſcious of victory and that truth was with them, they cloſe their obſervations upon this firſt article in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words—"Thus EVIDENT it

If they mean by <hi>expreſs ſcriptures,</hi> ſuch texts as are to be found <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> whether they have any reference or not to the matter to be proved by them, it may be confeſſed their propoſition is proveable from <hi>expreſs ſcripture;</hi> for there are a great number of texts <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> that have no manner of reference to ſuch a propoſition; though but very few that have leſs reference to it, than thoſe cited by the Committee, as <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcriptures in proof of it. If they mean by <hi>expreſs ſcriptures,</hi> that the words of a propoſition proved as theirs is, by <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcriptures, may be all found, lying in different parts of the Bible, and ſo muſt be picked by partial citations, and brought together, in order to form the propoſition; I acknowledge this propoſition may be proved by <hi>expreſs ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> for all the words of the propoſition above are undoubtedly to be found ſomewhere in the Bible. And one would think the laſt is the meaning the Committee put to the words <hi>expreſs ſcripture,</hi> becauſe they have made at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to prove their propoſition by partial citations from the ſcriptures.

Again, it is evident that thoſe who make ſuch a blundering buſineſs of proving their own creed, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divinely authoriſed to make creeds for others, or to judge and condemn others creeds.

of goſpel obedience, equally with repentence, or any other religious exerciſe whatever, and declared to be ſuch in the ſacred pages, ſee <hi>John</hi> vi. 29, <hi>'Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, this is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.'</hi> And 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 23, <hi>'And this is his commandment, that ye ſhould believe on the name of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt."</hi> When I ſay obedience is the only condition, &amp;c. I do, and ever did, include faith as an act of obedience equal with any exerciſe whatever, either of mind or body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the firſt act in the ſeries; for I never ſuppoſed that men would obey the goſpel while their minds did not aſſent to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel as true, and from God. The Committee ſeem to ſuppoſe that the bleſſings of the new covenant are ſuſpended on faith, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from obedience, and would father this diſtinction on St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the words by them cited; but this is an evident pervertion of his obvious ſenſe and meaning: The plain deſign of the Apoſtle in this chapter is to convince the Jews that they had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to glory, or exalt themſelves above the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:016775_0090_0F9E244D23A4C568"/>
Gentiles, now in the time of the goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deſcended from <hi>Abraham:</hi> But how does he do this? Why firſt, by ſhewing them that their father <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith, and ſo had not whereof to glory, ſince he received righteouſneſs as a gift, and not a debt by obedience to the legal diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Secondly, Becauſe neither they of the circumciſion, nor they who had the law, but they only who had faith were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the promiſe was made. Therefore the bleſſing of juſtification was intended for the Gentiles, and beſtowed on them, as well as on the Jews, and upon the ſame ground. The oppoſition therefore the Apoſtle makes between faith and work, in the 5th and 6th verſes, is not an oppoſition between faith and work in obedience to the goſpel of Chriſt, as the Committee would feign have it; but between faith and work in obedience to the Jewiſh law, to which the Jews were ſurprizingly attached, and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to which they looked for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and life. To impute righteouſneſs in the 6th verſe, and not to impute ſin in the 8th, intend the ſame thing, as <hi>Locke</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, the Apoſtle in theſe two verſes uſing theſe two expreſſions as equivalent; which import no more than that God does not reckon, or put ſin to the account of any one. By thus miſtaking the deſign and meaning of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:016775_0091_0F9E244DD62ADDA0"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe verſes, the Gentlemen have unhappily ran into the error that we are juſtified by a faith diſtinct from, and no part of goſpel obedience; and this unlucky miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take was the only reaſon why they fell out with the article, and voted it dangerous. I could wiſh this Committee would give us a deſcription of their faith as contradiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from goſpel obedience, that we might know what it is, and how it looks; for I freely confeſs I can obtain no idea of ſuch a faith, nor in any meaſure determine what it is the likeneſs of.</p>
               <p>After obſerving that holineſs is neceſſary to happineſs, and that the goſpel contains the moſt weighty arguments to univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they obſerve, "That this obedience is the fruit of an union with Chriſt, and it can no more exiſt without this union, than the branch ſevered from the vine can bear fruit," and cite <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 5, and xi. 6. What theſe two verſes are cited for, it is utterly beyond me to diſcover, unleſs cited with an "how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are to be underſtood"—as a text of ſcripture is cited by the Rev.

with Chriſt are antecedent to obedience, or any good influence goſpel motives can have upon the human mind: Therefore believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is no act of obedience, though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duty: Therefore thoſe weighty goſpel arguments to univerſal obedience are motives to none but thoſe who are united to Chriſt: Therefore the unregenerate, with reſpect to religion and eternity, are not free agents: Therefore the goſpel is of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them.

               <p>ART IV. &amp;c. Owned and defended: Voted unſcriptural and dangerous according to charge. My defence, it ſeems, was their only evidence; but let me aſk this Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, did I ever own and defend the above ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the words in which it ſtands? This you have aſſerted in your condemnatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port although what you aſſert is utterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the truth, and openly abuſive: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you had my defence in your hands, or at command; in which defence I maintain the propoſition, not in the words of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which you have had the boldneſs to ſay I owned and defended, but in the words following—"That we have all power <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to do what the goſpel requires of us <hi>in order</hi> to our <hi>taking benefit thereby,</hi> is what I affirm." Theſe words convey a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent idea from the words of the article, and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:016775_0093_0F9E244F68A29E50"/>
import no more than that '<hi>God is not an hard maſter,</hi> reaping <hi>where he has not</hi> ſowed, <hi>and</hi> gathering <hi>where he has not</hi> ſtrewed.' <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. 24. The only ſentiment I meant to maintain in the above ſentence out of my defence, in my public diſcourſes, and private converſation, was and is ſimply this, that the father of mercies does not require any of his creatures to exerciſe a power they have not, or perform an impoſſibility as a condition of his favour, or of their taking benefit by Chriſt's goſpel; and if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, or any other man, will avow the contrary, they alone muſt bear the ſin and ſhame of it; as, if I have any conſiſtent ideas of the divine character, it would be a moſt vile reflection upon the equity and goodneſs of the great parent of men and angels, and a reproach to the benevolence of the ſaviour, and the deſign of his goſpel.—The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee proceed; "Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plodes the diſtinction between natural and moral power as fooliſh and ridiculous, and in his defence <hi>expreſſly</hi> aſſerts that we have all power <hi>neceſſary</hi> to do what the goſpel requires of us, in order to <hi>inherit</hi> its bleſſings." I ſaid, 'we have all power neceſſary to do what the Goſpel requires of us in order to our <hi>taking benefit thereby:</hi>' Theſe are my words <hi>verbatim</hi> as they ſtand in my defence. Now are theſe words, <hi>in order to inherit its bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:016775_0094_0F9E248FE5C2F630"/>
an <hi>expreſs</hi> repetition of theſe words, <hi>in order to our taking benefit thereby?</hi> It is evidently the caſe that theſe gentlemen have ſtruck up a new meaning to the words <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> and <hi>expreſſly;</hi> this I had much rather ſuppoſe, than to imagine they meant to tell lies. The diſtinction between natural and moral power, as underſtood, applied, and defended by ſome modern continental writers, whereby they have groſſly injured the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character, and even made the holy God the author of all wickedneſs, I diſclaim: If any divine is pleaſed to call the power and exerciſes of the mind, moral power and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exerciſes; and the power and exerciſes of the body natural; and will make and apply this diſtinction in ſuch a manner as not to bear hard upon the moral character of the deity, I am not diſpoſed to contend about words: But this I maintain, that whatever defect, either in mind or body, we brought into the world with us, and is coeval with our exiſtence, is properly a natural defect. If there be an <hi>inability</hi> to holineſs, and a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing propenſity</hi> to ſin in the <hi>very nature</hi> of man as <hi>exiſting,</hi> ſo that he <hi>cannot</hi> will, nor <hi>act</hi> otherwiſe, until a <hi>phyſical</hi> exertion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power upon his mind; I think this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability,</hi> and this <hi>propenſity,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> reſulting herefrom, is, to all <hi>intents</hi> and <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, natural,</hi> as it ſprings from his <hi>nature</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:016775_0095_0F9E249096C7ECA8"/>
and the <hi>very condition</hi> of his <hi>being.</hi> And as we are but the <hi>paſſive recipients</hi> of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, with all its endowments and qualities, comes from the <hi>finiſhing hands</hi> of its <hi>divine author;</hi> ſo theſe two conſequences, I think, will <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> follow, viz. 1. That <hi>human nature</hi> in every man as he comes into the world, is not poſſeſſed of <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>hateful</hi> qualities. 2. That God requires <hi>no more</hi> of us than the <hi>nature</hi> he has given us will enable us to perform. Therefore to ſay, we have a <hi>natural</hi> ability to do <hi>all</hi> the goſpel requires of us in order to our taking benefit thereby, but not a <hi>moral;</hi> that a <hi>natural</hi> inability excuſes, but a <hi>moral</hi> does not, is, I humbly conceive, evidently impertinent, and, which is much more, an inſult upon the divine wiſdom, juſtice and goodneſs; and not only ſo, but it is, I fancy, making a diſtinction between the powers of nature, that the bible knows nothing about. If the <hi>man,</hi> as an <hi>intelligent, accountable creature of God,</hi> is unable to perform a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing, let his inability be what you pleaſe, and give it what name you pleaſe, I would aſk, Firſt, Whether God requires the man to do this thing as a condition of his favour and grace, and will puniſh him eternally for not doing the thing, while he does not grant him power ſufficient to overcome the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be met with in the doing of it?
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:016775_0096_0F9E2491D83E38F8"/>
Second, Whether an avowal of the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive does not involve in it this propoſition, viz. That the Almighty has ſuſpended his favour and grace upon an impoſſible conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inflicts a penalty upon the non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this impoſſible condition? And Third, Whether this is not a groſs reflection upon the divine character, by making God an hard maſter, reaping where he has not ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Committee diſclaim the notion of God's requiring natural impoſſibilities as they are pleaſed to call them, yet ſeem to ſuppoſe that God requires impoſſibilities in ſome ſenſe, or other, for they go on to ſay—"But at the ſame time, muſt believe that man's inability to holineſs is ſuch as fully to juſtify thoſe words of our ſaviour, <hi>John</hi> vi. 44, <hi>'No man can come unto me, except the father which hath ſent me draw him.'</hi> And of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7, <hi>'The carnal mind is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."</hi> But are <hi>impoſſibilities</hi> required of us in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe ſcriptures? Far otherwiſe, I think: It is true, we cannot come to Chriſt in the ſenſe of our ſaviour's words, without the drawing of the father; and it is as true we are not required to, without and ſeparate from this drawing: We are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn, we can be workers together with God, and neither more nor leſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:016775_0097_0F9E24924870F320"/>
of us in this affair: How then does the thing required exceed the ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? As to the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> every body, I ſuppoſe, will grant that a carnal fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind, that is in purſuit of the things of the fleſh, is not ſubject to God's law, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cannot be remaining ſo; ſo our ſaviour informs us, that <hi>'no man can ſerve two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;'</hi> but what is all this to the purpoſe? Becauſe a man cannot convert himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine help; becauſe a carnal fleſhly mind is not, and remaining ſuch, cannot be ſubject to God's laws, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve two maſters: Does it therefore follow, Firſt, That ſuch ſcriptures are a <hi>proof</hi> of the diſtinction between natural and moral power, as the <hi>Committee</hi> would <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> it? Second, That man is <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unable</hi> to do what the goſpel requires in order <hi>partake</hi> of its <hi>benefits?</hi> And Third, That God <hi>requires impoſſibilities</hi> of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as a <hi>condition</hi> of the beſtowment of his <hi>grace?</hi> It is <hi>ſurprizing</hi> that men ſhould uſe Bible and reaſon in this manner!</p>
               <p>But they proceed—"Should we admit that man hath full power to do all that the goſpel requires of him, in every ſenſe in which he might be ſaid to poſſeſs it, we conceive we muſt then admit a principle of holineſs in him naturally, in his fallen ſtate, contrary to the word of God, or utterly deny the force of

no <hi>man</hi> can be juſtified in his ſight.

in this manner; men who look upon themſelves divinely authoriſed to be the judges of other people's creeds, and to juſtify or condemn them at pleaſure?

1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 7. <hi>'He that doeth righteouſneſs is righteous even as he is righteous.'</hi> Which words I wiſh may be particularly noticed by the reader, and eſpecially by the Committee, who, to maintain their ſtrange, anti-ſcriptural notion of our being pardoned and juſtified both here and hereafter <hi>wholly, ſolely</hi> and <hi>excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> have been guilty of vilifying and ſpeaking evil of the very righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of in thoſe words; which they, I hope, will reflect on with a great degree of ſhame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction. Agreeable to all the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have in the ſacred pages, of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn tranſactions of the laſt day, when all the ſons of men are to be tried at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's bar for eternity, the final ſentence, fixing the doom of every one, will paſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deeds done here in the body: Thoſe who obey the goſpel are finally juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and acquitted; thoſe who diſobey it are condemned; while not one word is ſpoken about our intereſt in the righteouſneſs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or its imputation (which is inconſiſtent with the nature of things) being the matter of our final acquittal: And indeed the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the righteouſneſs of another is the <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>excluſive</hi> ground of our final ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification at the redeemer's bar, is directly ſubverſive of the divine moral government; if this be the caſe, how can the moral gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

and righteous judge of the world have any regard to perſonal merit and demerit in diſtributing rewards and puniſhments among his creatures? And by conſequence, how can he have any regard to moral worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, though a particular regard to perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal merit and deme it, to moral worth and excellency, are inſeparable from the idea of the moral government, and a ſtate of trial? This is to ſubvert not only <hi>revealed religion,</hi> but <hi>natural religion</hi> alſo, and to <hi>demoliſh</hi> at <hi>one blow</hi> the <hi>whole government</hi> of the <hi>deity,</hi> whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral.</hi> For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with others that might be mentioned, I am ſtill conſtrained to believe, with Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that our works in obedience or diſobedience to the goſpel will be the ground of the divine procedure at the great day, and according to which our final ſtate will be determined; eſpecially as the goſpel is God's rule of government at preſent with reſpect to all thoſe under the light of it; for I cannot perſuade myſelf to believe that God, whoſe rules of government are perfect regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and right, will have one rule of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and another and different rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and final retribution. As to the reaſons you have offered, and the ſcriptures you have adduced in ſupport of the negative, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me utterly inconcluſive, and nothing to the purpoſe; and it is ſurpriſing to me, as
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:016775_0112_0F9E2E50DF559758"/>
well as to many others, that you ſhould, with ſuch a preremptory air, pronounce the article <hi>unſcriptural</hi> and <hi>dangerous, oppoſite to,</hi> and <hi>ſubverſive</hi> of, the <hi>goſpel method</hi> of <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> upon ſuch ſlight evidence, which in reality is no evidence at all! But what lengths will not indiſcreet zeal and bigotry carry men! If you have heavier artillery to bring up, pray exhibit it—let the truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; I engage for myſelf to yield to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, and appear on the ſide of the truth as it is in Jeſus, though I mean not to be dragooned into a creed, or out of one. With me it is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of man's judgment; he who judgeth me is the Lord.</p>
               <p>ART. VI. &amp;c. Voted, proved according to charge: "For the reaſons, ſay they, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the texts cited under the preceeding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle." For the reaſons of what, pray? For the reaſons why Chriſt righteouſneſs is not ſufficient, &amp;c. Do they mean to deviate into truth by avowing the article? Or are we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the texts cited under the preceeding article for the reaſons why it is voted proved according to charge? But perhaps they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to vote the article <hi>unſcriptural</hi> and <hi>dangerous according to charge,</hi> agreeable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſuage in this caſe; but it ſlipped their minds through a multiplicity of creed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſineſs: Or perhaps it was <hi>lapſus pennoe</hi>

of the ſcribes; or perhaps — However, if they ſuppoſe the article contrary to <hi>expreſs</hi> ſcripture as the others are, I would propound this ſimple queſtion, viz. Whether the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs are deſigned to ſave people in their ſins? But as it is entirely uncertain what the Committee's deſign was, we can do no more than <hi>for the reaſons</hi> to refer the reader to our obſervations upon their defence of the negative of the preceeding article, and wait until the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is removed from this part of their report by another oracular reſponſe.</p>
               <p>ART. VII. &amp;c. Proved by vote. "It is proved in the opinion of the Conſociation that Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> explodes the idea of perſonal election, particularly in a Sermon delivered at the ordination of his ſon <hi>Daniel,</hi> pages 50 and 51." The words referred to in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are as follows; "Did I believe and teach, as ſome do, that God from all eternity elected to glory by an abſolute decree, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of men, whom he foreſaw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, appointed his ſon to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake their redemption, who was to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy juſtice, merit glory, and make them phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically mete for it, leaving the reſt under the dreadful decree of reprobation, to treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, without poſſibility of help," &amp;c. In this view of the decrees, I did, do ſtill, and ever ſhall explode

them, while I believe there is a God, and that his ways are equal: And it is in this view of them the committee muſt avow them, if they would oppoſe me.</p>
               <p>As to the article as it lies in the report of the Committee, it was known I denied it. They go on to ſay: "This doctrine," (<hi>i. e.</hi> the doctrine of election as repreſented in the above citation out of my ſermon, for it is in that ſenſe they avow the doctrine) "is <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> taught in <hi>divine revelation</hi>"!! What! is it <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> taught in <hi>divine revelation</hi> that God from all eternity elected to glory, by an <hi>abſolute</hi> decree, a certain number of men in ſuch a manner as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a leaving the reſt under the dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobation, to periſh without poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of help?

It is ſtrange there cannot be the words <hi>predeſtinated, choſen, elect, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. in a text of ſcripture, but it is at once taken as proof of a perſonal, eternal, abſolute election, whether they have reference to any ſuch thing or not. In truth the notion is abſolutely without Bible and reaſon. For further ſatisfaction I refer to my reply to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Buckminſter,</hi> where the affair of the decrees is treated more at large.</p>
               <p>ART. VIII. &amp;c. "This article, ſay they, is proved according to charge in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this council in the ſermon Mr. <hi>Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> preached at Mr. <hi>Joel Foſter</hi>'s ordination,"
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:016775_0116_0F9E2E5391FB4968"/>
and then proceed; "This Conſociation doubt not the ſufficiency of the merits of the ſaviour for the whole world; but it will not hence follow that Chriſt died for all intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alike, or that one as much as another is given to Chriſt." To ſay that the merits of Chriſt are ſufficient for the redemption and ſalvation of the whole world, yet that it was the divine purpoſe that but a remnant ſhould be redeemed and ſaved; and therefore the benefits of our Lord's ſalutary paſſion, in the divine counſel and deſign, and in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, are reſtrained to this remnant, appears to me inconſiſtent with the diffuſive goodneſs and beneficence of the father and friend of men, and not coincident with the character God has ſeen fit to aſſume in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the human race; as a God who tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no pleaſure in the death of him who dieth; who would have all men be ſaved, &amp;c. and is in effect to ſay, that Chriſt died no more for the non-elect, or thoſe who, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, are not ſaved, than for the devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who are reſerved in chains, &amp;c. It leaves thoſe for whom he did not die, under an impoſſibility of pardon and ſalvation; faith in Chriſt muſt be reſtrained to thoſe for whom he intentionall died, the reſt having nothing to believe reſpecting Chriſt, unleſs that his death was ſufficient for their pardon and happineſs, which is only to believe that God
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:016775_0117_0F9E2E54890FCB30"/>
could have ſaved them if he would; and what comfort would it be to a condemned male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to know, that his prince could have pardoned and ſaved him, a price ſufficient therefor having been paid, but he would not? The Committee proceed to cite <hi>"John</hi> xvii. 9, 20. <hi>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine. Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on me through their word." 'I pray for them: I pray not for the world,'</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> "I now offer up my prayer particularly for my Apoſtles who are deſigned for ſo great a work as preaching the goſpel of the kingdom to both Jews and Gentiles, and therefore will ſtand in need of ſpecial divine aſſiſtance and ſupport; but I do not now intercede for the world in general:" Though at other times we find him praying for the world both Jews and Gentiles; yea, even for his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and murderers, <hi>"Father forgive them for they know not what they do."</hi> "The ſphere of his beneficence extended back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the foundation of the world, and reaches forward to the laſt conflagration; ſo that nothing, which is capable of being ſaved, is <hi>hid from the heat thereof.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſaviour of all ages, from the firſt birth of time to its laſt period; the father of mankind, from the riſing up of the ſun, to

But how debaſing and diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the views of thoſe who would confine the redemption and interceſſion of Chriſt to a ſmall remnant of the human race! As to <hi>John</hi> vi. 37, the phraſe <hi>to be given of the father</hi> does not ſignify the actual faith of thoſe who are thus given, but only their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and qualifications to believe, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convicted by the wonderful works our ſaviour wrought, that he was the true Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, and embracing him as ſuch, laying aſide their prejudices and carnal affections, which obſtructed their coming to him; and by being perſuaded of the truth, deſign and importance of the goſpel and therefore receive and attend upon the duties of it: And all are given to Chriſt, who thus receive him and his goſpel; but it is left with them whether they will be influenced by theſe means or
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:016775_0119_0F9E2E55CE39B940"/>
not, no force being put upon their minds, or their liberty of choice in the leaſt infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> informs us, the <hi>Manichees</hi> made uſe of theſe words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy man's free will; and therefore this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and others, obſerve, in oppoſition to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <hi>no more</hi> by the <hi>giving</hi> of the father, "but his revelation from above to a ſoul diſpoſed to receive it." But what is this to the purpoſe of <hi>particular redemption?</hi> They conclude with the following remarkable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; "If Chriſt died for all, as much for one as another, then if all do not actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the benefits of his death and at laſt arrive to heaven, his purpoſe and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be fruſtrated." Chriſt's intention to die for all is one thing; his intention to ſave all is another thing; what I maintain is, that Chriſt, of ſet purpoſe and deſign gave himſelf a ranſom for all, and taſted death for every man, and therefore that his redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is equally extended with the race of man; and this his intention to die for all was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; but his intention to ſave all, or any, is not abſolute, but conditional; univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and univerſal redemption are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, the former I deny, the latter I maintain. If the reaſoning of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee is founded upon Chriſt's intention to die for all, it will ſtand thus; If it was Chriſt's
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:016775_0120_0F9E2E568BBDF370"/>
intention to die for all, and all are not ſaved, this his intention muſt be fruſtrated; but all are not ſaved—<hi>Ergo,</hi> The ſophiſtry is minifeſt. If they refer to Chriſt's intention to ſave all, their reaſoning is very foreign to the purpoſe, and effects not the truth of what I maintain.</p>
               <p>The two laſt Articles, it ſeems, they got over without much difficulty.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of the report of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee is in the following words and ſtyle— "Therefore <hi>we</hi> think ourſelves <hi>holden</hi> in <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> on this occaſion, to <hi>bear our open</hi> teſtimony againſt the abovementioned doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines held and taught by Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>not only contrary</hi> to the <hi>goſpel,</hi> and of <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency,</hi> but <hi>ſome</hi> of them <hi>at leaſt even ſubverſive</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian inſtitution,</hi> and to ſay that <hi>we</hi> cannot but <hi>look</hi> upon theſe <hi>errors perſiſted in,</hi> as <hi>utterly unqualifying</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtian miniſtry;</hi> and therefore that <hi>we</hi> cannot in <hi>conſcience hold communion with the paſtor who perſiſteth in them.</hi>"</p>

            <p>WHEN I received a citation, ſigned, <hi>Theodore Hinſdale, Charles Backus,</hi> &amp;c. informing of the approach of your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable body to <hi>judge</hi> upon articles of faith held and taught by me, and <hi>requiring</hi> me to make my appearance, as a criminal, at your bar, to anſwer to charges, &amp;c.—I was well convinced, from the <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>aſſuming ſtyle</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of your <hi>mandatory</hi> citation, what I muſt expect as the iſſue of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitory proceedings: Your firſt public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Houſe of God at Stafford, and the temper and ſpirit which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in every ſtep of your conduct, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged a raſh concluſion, and the event has fully juſtified my previous apprehenſions. But ſuffer me, with the freedom of a Chriſtian,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:016775_0124_0F9E2E5BCF453DA0"/>
to expoſtulate with you; is not the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the only lawgiver and king in his church, to whoſe authority and command, as to things of religion, Chriſtians are bound to ſubmit? Are not the ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſtament the only ſtandard of religious truth? Has not every free and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable creature full and undiſturbed right to ſearch the ſcriptures, judge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for himſelf? Is religion any further praiſe-worthy than it is matter of choice? Are not theſe the principles which our firſt reformers aſſerted with ſo good effect againſt the arbitrary claims of the Romiſh church? And are they not the very baſis and only ſupport of the reformation? Granting theſe principles, and they muſt be granted, or the reformation from popery is evidently ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, is it not palpably inconſiſtent with them all, to imagine that Chriſt has given to any man, or body of men, authority in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religious faith, to whoſe decrees, in point of doctrine, Chriſtians are obliged, and ought to ſubmit? Is not the very claim of ſuch authority equally and the ſame thing with a claim to infallibility? Has God given to any man, or body of men, authority in matters of faith, to whom he has not given infallibility? Then he has given to a man, or body of men, authority to lead men into error, a right to ſeduce and deceive: But let
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:016775_0125_0F9E2E5C8F2161F0"/>
it be granted, at preſent and for argument ſake, that there is, and will always continue to be, a body of men upon earth, to whom Chriſt has given authority to decide in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religious faith, and to whoſe deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Chriſtians are ſubject, and ought to ſubmit; I aſk, Where ſhall we find this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of men? Is it the Pope with his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; or the king of <hi>England</hi> with his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? Is it the Archbiſhop with his Biſhops; or the Biſhop of every dioceſe with his Dean and Chapter attending? Is it a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery or Synod; Aſſociation or Conſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it an eccleſiaſtical council, or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church? Is it any, or all of theſe? If all have this authority, then, by virtue of authority derived from Chriſt, Chriſtianity may be made one thing in one country, and another thing in another country; in <hi>England</hi> it will be Epiſcopal; in <hi>Scotland</hi> a Preſbyterian; in <hi>France</hi> a Popiſh; and in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> it will wear a Calviniſtick form: But is Chriſt divided? Is this the unity of his kingdom? Is all this genuine Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Then a man's religion muſt change with his change of climate, and this according to the will of Chriſt; then our ſeparation from the church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a ſchiſmatical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the authority of Chriſt in his church. But if this authority does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide equally in all theſe different bodies of
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:016775_0126_0F9E2E5DB8750890"/>
men, Which in particular has the only right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful claim to it? Is it a Conſociation in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> conſtituted of Elders and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Then I aſk, Where is the divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for ſuch a body in the goſpel, and where the charter veſting them with this high power? To what things and how far does this authority extend? Is it limited or unlimited? But I forbear—It never will be pretended that a <hi>Connecticut</hi> Conſociation is of divine inſtitution, or is conſtituted and veſted with authority, in matters of faith, by a charter from Heaven: It is intirely a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical inſtitution, and <hi>Saybrook</hi> Platform is its charter: Whatever authority therefore is claimed and exerciſed by this body of men, by virtue of their inſtitution and charter, is an authority not known in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by conſequence is a bold uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's prerogative, and a ſtepping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his throne who is the only lawgiver and king in the church; and every exerciſe of ſuch authority is in fact ſpiritual tyranny, and to be diſclaimed by all who would ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Jeſus Chriſt has made them free. If Chriſt is the only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and king in Zion; if the holy ſcriptures are the only ſtandard of religious truth; if every free and accountable creature has full and undiſturbed right to ſearch the ſcriptures and judge for himſelf in all religious matters:
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:016775_0127_0F9E2E5E16068108"/>
and if religion is no further praiſe-worthy than it is matter of choice; if theſe things are ſo, can it be ſuppoſed that Chriſt has given others authority to diſturb, cenſure and perſecute Chriſtians in the exerciſe of this right, a right which Chriſt himſelf gave, and commanded the exerciſe of it? God forbid! And if Chriſtians in common have this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, much more the Embaſſadors of Chriſt who are forbid to teach for doctrines the commands of men, but on the contrary are bound by office to teach the people all things whatſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> has commanded them; to deliver the whole counſel of God; and to take heed to the miniſtry they have received of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that they fulfil it. By viewing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as only lawgiver, king and judge; by making the ſcriptures of truth his only rule of faith and practice; by uſing that liberty in the purſuit of divine knowledge which God has given him as a man, a Chriſtian and a diſpenſer of the word of life; by preaching his own candid and impartial interpretations of ſcripture to the people of his charge, and when ſolemnly obliged hereto by his commiſſion, as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt, and accountable to him as ſupreme paſtor; by theſe things does the faithful preacher juſtly expoſe himſelf to be judged, condemned, and excommunicated by his fellow ſervants, merely becauſe he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:016775_0128_0F9E2E5F37D25820"/>
from them in his interpretations of ſcripture, and does he expoſe himſelf to all theſe evils agreeable to the laws and rules of Chriſt's kingdom? Dare any preſume this! To whom, pray, is an Embaſſador accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but to the authority that commiſſions him as ſuch?—With reſpect to the doctrines you have ſeen fit to condemn, though you had no right or authority from Chriſt ſo to do, I would expoſtulate with you—How is the opinion that mankind come into the world morally vicious and depraved, under the wrath and curſe of God, and expoſed to damnation conſiſtent with the expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the holy Bible, that God is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our ſpirits; formeth the ſpirit of of man within him; faſhions us in the the womb; that his hands make and faſhion us? Why will you make God the author of all wickedneſs? How can you believe that God is ſlow to anger and abundant in goodneſs, when he makes a creature ſuch as it is, and then is angry even to wrath with the creature for being as it is? How can you ſuppoſe that obedience is not the only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the covenant of grace, when we read expreſſly in the Bible that Chriſt <hi>'being made perfect, became the author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him'?</hi> And that <hi>'he who doeth righteouſneſs is righteous'?</hi> How can you entertain the opinion that men
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:016775_0129_0F9E2E5FCCBEC588"/>
have not both natural and moral power (if you are pleaſed to make this diſtinction) to do all that the goſpel requires of them in order to their taking benefit thereby, when you hereby make the bleſſed God ſuſpend the beſtowment of ſaving benefits upon an impoſſible condition, and then eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally puniſh his creatures for non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; though God is ſaid to be long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, not willing that any ſhould periſh? Is not this to make God an hard maſter, reaping where he has not ſowed, and finally puniſh his creatures for nothing? How can you ſuppoſe that our good works are not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our juſtification at the redeemer's bar, when obedience and diſobedience are made the expreſs conditions of our final juſtification and condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 7, and on—and when our works are made the only ſubject of enquiry at the great day, and when it is ſaid that God will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>works?</hi>—How can you believe the doctrine of perſonal abſolute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal election to everlaſting life; that this election includes but a remnant of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, while the reſt are paſſed by in God's eternal purpoſe and counſel, and left to periſh without poſſibility of happineſs, which, in other words, is to ſay, that God made the far greater part of men on purpoſe to damn them; I ſay, how can you embrace
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:016775_0130_0F9E2E604B71DAF8"/>
ſuch an opinion, when the Bible expreſſly informs you that God hath no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xviii. 23, 31? What ſincerity can there be in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral offers of goſpel bleſſings, and all the means and methods of God with men, to allure them to himſelf and happineſs? I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you, Gentlemen, that I look upon this doctrine reproachful to the divine character, and ſo long as I believe that God's <hi>tender</hi> mercies are over <hi>all</hi> the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>his hands,</hi> ſo long I ſhall continue to <hi>reject</hi> and <hi>deteſt</hi> ſuch a doctrine.—How can you avow the notion of particular redemption when the Bible expreſſly informs you that Chriſt died for all in general, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 10; for every man in particular, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 9—that he died for the whole world without exception, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 2.—without exception of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 6.—without exception of enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 10, and without exception of thoſe who periſh, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> ii. 1? How can men be ſaid to render themſelves worthy of ſorer puniſhment for rejecting Chriſt and goſpel grace, when, agreeable to this doctrine, Chriſt never died for them, goſpel grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was purchaſed for, nor deſigned to be conferred upon them? May I be ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a more ſevere puniſhment for rejecting a favour that was never deſigned for me?

            <p>THE liberty we plead for, and have a right to expect, is not licentiouſneſs, nor a liberty to laugh at and abuſe a divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but the principle of equal, impartial liberty to all peaceable members of the civil ſtate, both preachers and hearers, to ſearch and examine the ſacred ſcriptures, and to believe, profeſs and preach thoſe tenets and doctrines, which appear to them to be agreeable to the ſcriptures, and to reject, with entire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect impunity, any, or all thoſe tenets and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, by whomſoever they are received or taught, as do not appear to them to be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>This notion of liberty was the very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon which the glorious Proteſtant refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from <hi>Popery</hi> began, proceeded and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:016775_0135_0F9E2E66D3A5BD48"/>
was finally effected. This is the very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of religious liberty, for which the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant non-conformiſts, our illuſtrious anceſtors in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> contended unto blood, before and during the reigns of the Stuart family: For the enjoyment of this liberty they left their native country, croſſed the Atlantic, and came into <hi>America:</hi> And this is the great and good principle upon which all <hi>New-England</hi> churches were firſt ſettled, and upon which they flouriſhed for a great number of years. But alas! whither are we their children going! Surely with long and diſmal ſtrides we are returning again to <hi>Rome!</hi> For only take away liberty of free enquiry, and free profeſſion, in matters of religion and the worſhip of the deity, and <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> is inſtantly given up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and <hi>popery</hi> inevitably introduced.

And will you, my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, freely and without a ſtruggle, give up that which is your very baſis as Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, your birth-right privilege as reaſonable, accountable creatures, your divine ornament and glory as Chriſtian profeſſors! Will you become bound to believe as this or the other confeſſion of faith directs, as this or the other eccleſiaſtick council ſhall decree, as this or

the other miniſter teaches you, though in direct contradiction to the clear dictates of your conſciences, regulated by the word of God! Will you reſign your faith, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and your religion into the hands of any man, or body of men, and delegate them to think, reaſon, judge and believe for you? Will you alſo appear before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Chriſt, the king of Zion, and your eternal judge, by your delegates too? And will they warrant your ſafe appearance there? If not, ſurely it is unſafe for you to betruſt them now with your faith, your religion, and your conſciences! I fancy I behold a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of horror, indignation and contempt in your very countenances, upon reading theſe queries; to think that a bare motion ſhould be made for you to reſign every thing ſacred and important to you on earth, and every thing dear and felicitating in a bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality! Your ſouls recoil at the naked thought of ſuch horrid ſuicide, and ſo much ingratitude and impiety to the incarnate God, your ſaviour, who hath made you free! And perhaps you are almoſt offended with me for ſuggeſting ſuch thoughts to you. But reflect one minute on what you have read above. An eccleſiaſtick council, gravely met, upon the invitation, not of a paſtor or church, but of three or four diſaffected individuals, to <hi>judge of articles of faith and doctrines of

Herein you plainly ſee, and with your own eyes, the ſacred liberty of conſcience violated, the divine right of private judgment denied, proteſtantiſm overthrown, infallibility implicitly claimed, a wide door opened for the introduction of popery, and the prerogative of Chriſt, the only lawgiver in Zion, boldly aſſumed! Look again and again upon the doings of that council; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and weigh them well. Open your eyes, rouſe up your attention, get yourſelves quite awake; and do not ſuffer yourſelves to be lulled to ſleep by that vain and fallacious cry, <hi>the church is in danger,</hi> from falſe and corrupt doctrines entering into her. This has always been the cry of <hi>lazy, idle drones,</hi> who never will be at the pains of thinking out of the beaten tract, but receive their faith and religion, as they do their eſtates, from the laſt will and teſtament of thoſe who went before them. Thoſe that never did, and never will, bring any new thing out of their treaſure, <hi>'as the good ſcribe always

And, when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and argument fail, ſuch men will aſſume that armour which hath long been proved, and cry <hi>hereſy, hereſy, the church is in danger!</hi> and this always does the job with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unwary?

               <pb n="142" facs="unknown:016775_0141_0F9E2E6E92060380"/>We ought conſtantly to endeavour to make progreſs in Chriſtian knowledge, as well as all other excellent attainments; and never be content with what is already known, or was known 200 years ago. That excellent and generous ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> to his congregation in <hi>Holland,</hi> juſt as a part of them were embarking for <hi>America,</hi> ought never to be forgotten by true proteſtants. Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> kept a day of faſting and prayer with his church, and addreſſed them as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, "Brethren, we are now quickly to part from one another, and whether I may ever live to ſee your faces on earth any more, the God of Heaven only knows; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord has appointed that or no, I charge you before God and his bleſſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that you follow me no farther than you have ſeen me follow the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If God reveal any thing to you, by any other inſtrument of his, be as ready to receive it as ever you was to receive any truth by my miniſtry; for I am verily perſuaded, the Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of his holy word. For my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and will go at preſent no farther than the inſtruments of their reformation. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> cannot be drawn to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what <hi>Luther</hi> ſaw; whatever part of

his will our God has revealed to <hi>Calvin,</hi> they will rather die than embrace it; and the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> you ſee, ſtick faſt where they were left by that great man of God, who yet ſaw not all things. This is a miſery much to be lamented, for though they were burning and ſhining lights in their times, yet they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated not into the whole counſel of God, but were they now living, would be as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to embrace farther light as that which they firſt received. I beſeech you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is an article of your church covenant, that <hi>you be ready to receive whatever truth ſhall be made known to you from the written word of God.</hi> Remember that, and every other article of your ſacred covenant. But I muſt herewithal exhort you to take heed what you receive as truth, examine it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it and compare it with other ſcriptures of truth, before you receive it; for it is not poſſible the chriſtian world ſhould come ſo lately out of ſuch thick antichriſtian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that perfection of knowledge ſhould break forth at once." NEAL'S <hi>Hiſtory of Puritans,</hi> vol. I. p. 490, 491.</p>
            <p>A true proteſtant was this great and good man. How firmly did he believe the right all chriſtians have to ſearch the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſee and judge for themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject whatever they ſhall judge to be agreeable or diſagreeable thereto! How
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:016775_0143_0F9E2E70283165F0"/>
would his indignation have been kindled to have ſeen the proceedings of the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation at <hi>Weſt-Stafford!</hi> and to have read their bold and arrogant reſult.</p>
            <p>Let us endeavour to obtain the ſpirit of proteſtants, to aſſert and vindicate our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as men, as reaſonable accountable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and above all as chriſtians; and, in ſpite of all the daring, haughty, aſſuming, popiſh claims of any man, or body of men, let us ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free.</p>

               <hi>POSTSCRIPT;</hi> Containing ſome Circumſtances that attended the <hi>PROCEEDINGS</hi> of <hi>CONSOCIATION,</hi> at <hi>Weſt-Stafford,</hi> November <hi>2, 1779.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOVEMBER 2d, P. M. the venerable body proceeded to the houſe of public worſhip, and, after prayer, the complaint was read by one of the ſcribes of council, and likewiſe the defence of the four articles, &amp;c. Upon which the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bliſs,</hi> a member of Conſociation, aroſe, and began an impertinent harangue, which appeared evidently deſigned to miſlead and impoſe upon the aſſembly, which was very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. The accuſed paſtor repeatedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and requeſted liberty to read a paper he had in his hand, and obtained it finally with great difficulty, being told by ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Conſociation that <hi>Mr. Bliſs</hi> was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the aggrieved, and <hi>muſt</hi> not be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bliſs</hi> himſelf ſpake and ſaid, "We did not come here, Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> to hear you read papers, we came to judge." As the Conſociation returned from the meeting-houſe to the council chamber, two of the members went into the houſe of the Rev. <hi>Iſaac Foſter,</hi> and then and there, of their own accord, ſaid, that, at the deſire of the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:016775_0145_0F9E2E718CD56E50"/>
complainants, <hi>Mr. Bliſs</hi> was <hi>voted Advocate</hi> for them by Conſociation, and likewiſe that <hi>Conſociation, for that reaſon, voted,</hi> that he <hi>ſhould not</hi> be <hi>judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 3d of November, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation were in the meeting-houſe, and a large aſſembly of people collected, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bliſs,</hi> abovementioned, as was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice in that place, was inveighing with the utmoſt bitterneſs againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines taught and received in the church at <hi>Weſt-Stafford,</hi> as falſe, heretical, &amp;c. &amp;c. The oldeſt ſcribe of Conſociation ſpake and ſaid, "I do not know but it ought to be known by this congregation, that Mr. <hi>Bliſs</hi> is choſen by this council—" Here Mr. <hi>Bliſs</hi> broke in immediately, and in a lower tone ſaid, "That is not to be told;" upon which the ſcribe ceaſed to ſpeak further upon the matter. On the return of Conſociation this day alſo, another and different member of their body called in at Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi>'s and made the ſame declaration concerning Mr. <hi>Bliſs,</hi> that the others made the day before.</p>
            <p>Here follows a complaint exhibited to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation by a number of men, members of the church in <hi>Weſt-Stafford.</hi>

                  <p>THIS may certify that the Rev. Mr. Bliſs has not undertaken the office of advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the complainants againſt the Rev. <hi>Iſaac Foſter,</hi> nor can with truth be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo by any; true it is the complainants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the council that Mr. Bliſs might aſſiſt them in that character; the council gave liberty that he might, and ſome of the members of council thence miſtakenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he had undertaken; hence aroſe your miſtake: But the truth is, he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely decline the office, and accordingly has not been conſidered by the council in that character.</p>

               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>This may be affirmed without heſitation, that the Rev. Mr. Bliſs acted the part of an advocate in public during the whole time of the reſidence of Conſociation in <hi>Weſt-Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and a moſt cenſorious, unchriſtian, and even inhuman part too; and what the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple complained of, or at leaſt one thing they complained of, was, that Mr. Bliſs ſhould act
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:016775_0148_0F9E2E77F52F2490"/>
ſuch a part, and appear in ſuch a character in public, and yet deny, or at leaſt refuſe to own his advocacy for the complainants. If he was advocate they thought the public ſhould have known it; if he was not, it appeared to them very aſtoniſhing, that a judge ſhould be ſuffered to act ſuch a part, publickly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the cauſe, and that in the moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, virulent terms. The reply to their complaint informed them, that although it was deſired by the complainants that Mr. Bliſs might aſſiſt them in the character of advocate, and that he had liberty ſo to do from the council; yet he declined the office, and accordingly was not conſidered in that character by Conſociation. But how does all this conſiſt with the public and private voice of <hi>many members</hi> of <hi>their own body, the oldeſt ſcribe in particular,</hi> unitedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that this Mr. Bliſs was <hi>advocate for the aggrieved,</hi> that <hi>he was voted advocate by Conſociation,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. all which can be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially proved whenever there is need of it? Further, if Mr. Bliſs declined the office, why did he then publickly execute the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? Why was he ſuffered to do ſo by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation? And why was this given as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by ſeveral aged members of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in particular by the oldeſt ſcribe, why Mr. Bliſs muſt not be interrupted, viz. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was advocate for the aggrieved?
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:016775_0149_0F9E2E78558E3040"/>
Mr. Bliſs was either advocate, or judge, or both, or neither, if he was advocate, and we rather think he was, from the foregoing teſtimonies, and that this was what the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſcribe was proceeding to acquaint the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly with, when broke in upon by Mr. Bliſs as related before; if this was the caſe, why all theſe contradictions? If he was judge, his public behaviour was inſufferable upon any principles whatever. If he was both, it is a new thing under the ſun, to make an attorney and judge of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and upon the ſame caſe. If the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation conſidered Mr. Bliſs in no character, we are perfectly willing he ſhould ſtand for a cypher: But perhaps all theſe ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions may be perfectly reconciled by this one conſideration, viz. that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>advocate for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as he declared himſelf to be in public; but if he did really act in this character, we think he ought to have executed the office, at leaſt, with ſome degree of <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, on November 4th, when Conſociation were in the meeting houſe, they promiſed the aſſembly that they ſhould have timely notice when their reſult would be publiſhed. Nov. 5th a lecture preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holy communion was preached 3 o'clock, P. M. After lecture ſeveral perſons
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:016775_0150_0F9E2E7913E58950"/>
repaired to the place where Conſociation ſat, to enquire whether they were like to come to the meeting-houſe that day, and were told by ſome of the members of Conſociation that they could not publiſh their reſult that night, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or they had not accompliſhed their buſineſs; upon which the people went home: Soon after which it was reſolved by Conſociation, or at leaſt by ſome of them, to repair to the meeting-houſe that evening, and read their reſult; and being told that the people were gone home, ſome of them replied, that is nothing to us, they might have ſtaid if they would, we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay our buſineſs for the people—according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about ſun-down they came to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, read their reſult, and then repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their quarters.</p>
            <p>All the above circumſtances attending the proceedings of Conſociation at <hi>Weſt-Stafford</hi> appeared in public, and when occaſion ſhall require, may be ſubſtantially authenticated by great numbers of eye and ear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> SINCE the late Conſociation at <hi>Weſt-Stafford</hi> undertook to juſtify their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure by quotations from Saybrook agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is meet ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> remarks ſhould be made upon theſe quotations. Among the articles for the adminiſtration of Church
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:016775_0151_0F9E2E79D0BABED0"/>
diſcipline, Art. 3, is the firſt cited by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation in the following words, "That all caſes of ſcandal that ſhall fall out within the circuit of any of the aforeſaid Conſociations, ſhall be brought to a council of the elders and alſo meſſengers of the churches within ſaid circuit." It will doubtleſs be obſerved by the reader that the Conſociation was conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the expreſs purpoſe of <hi>judging upon doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines ſaid to be falſe and dangerous,</hi> &amp;c. and that they cited this article to prove they had a right to convene for this purpoſe. But perhaps Conſociation meant to found their right upon the ſcriptures referred to in the article. The firſt ſcripture cited under the article, is 3. John ix 10. <hi>"I wrote unto the Church: But Diotrephes, who loveth to have pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Therefore if I come. I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating againſt us with malicious words; and not content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, neither doth he himſelf receive the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and forbiddeth them that would, and caſteth them out of the church."</hi> Becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> complained of ſome diſingenuous and unfriendly conduct of one <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the North Conſociation in <hi>Hartford</hi> county had a right to convene at Weſt-Stafford, to judge upon falſe and dangerous doctrines!

Hence every one ſees that if the Conſociation meant to found their right upon the ſcriptures cited under this article, that right was indiſputably proved; for I know no better right than that founded on the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!!—The other article cited by Conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the 5th, in theſe words, "That when any caſe is orderly brought before any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the churches, it ſhall there be heard and determined, which ſhall be a final iſſue, and all parties therein concerned, ſhall ſit down, and be determined thereby." The reader will bear in mind, that the caſe brought before the venerable Conſociation at <hi>Weſt-Stafford</hi> was denied to be orderly before that body; and that they cite this article to prove that ſaid caſe was cognizable, and finally to be determined by them. Now as the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle itſelf does not <hi>expreſſly</hi> ſay, that falſe and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:016775_0155_0F9E2E81354AF5A8"/>
dangerous doctrines are a caſe that may be orderly brought before a Conſociation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in the other article, they doubtleſs meant that the ſcriptures here cited proved this. The firſt ſcripture is <hi>Acts</hi> xv. but as no verſe in particular is quoted we cannot ſay any thing in reply. The next ſcripture is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 5. <hi>"To deliver ſuch an one unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan for the deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus."</hi> Becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> directed the church at <hi>Corinth</hi> to deliver to Satan the man who had been guilty of ſuch groſs fornication as to marry his father's wife, therefore the charge of preaching falſe and dangerous doctrines was orderly brought before the North Conſociation in <hi>Hartford</hi> county, Nov. 2, 1779!

iii. 15. <hi>"Let us therefore, as many as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, be thus minded: And if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even that unto you."</hi> Becauſe St. Paul exhorted the chriſtians at <hi>Philippi,</hi> who were ſufficiently grounded in the firſt principles of chriſtianity, to go on to perfection; and encouraged thoſe who were not, that God would teach and inſtruct them; therefore the charge of falſe and dangerous doctrines lay ſcripturally before Conſociation at <hi>Weſt Stafford,</hi> and muſt be finally determined by them! The next ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pertinent to the purpoſe, is <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 2, 3. <hi>"For one believeth that he may eat all things, another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath received him."</hi> Becauſe St. Paul would have chriſtians act according to their own inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I BEG leave to make the following repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, viz When I was ordained in the miniſtry at <hi>Windſor,</hi> I objected againſt adopting Saybrook Platform as a model of church-diſcipline. But never did I dream of ſuch an interpretation of that book, as ſhould warrant any <hi>eccleſiaſtick council</hi> in judging upon articles of <hi>faith,</hi> for any preacher, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, or church of chriſtians on earth, until the affair of Mr. Sage at Weſt-Simſbury. And I doubt not it will be eaſily recollected by a number of gentlemen of the Conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who were <hi>then</hi> preſent, that I then made very great oppoſition to any deciſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation in Mr. Sage's disfavour, on account of his <hi>doctrines</hi> or <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>faith;</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was of his opinion in every article, but becauſe I conſidered Conſociation as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no authority to judge upon <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="unknown:016775_0159_0F9E2E839B2B8160"/>
to his diſadvantage, or the diſadvantage of any man, or body of men, on earth, either from Platform or the word of God. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I am conſcientiuoſly of the ſame mind ſtill. And from the recent experience I have had of what I imagine to be a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation of Saybrook Platform, I take this opportunity to ſignify my abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of that book, as the <hi>rule</hi> of my <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>manners,</hi> ſo far as it can poſſibly be interpreted to ſignify a right in any man, or body of men on earth, to judge upon <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> not <hi>heretical,</hi> to the leaſt diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of any preacher, profeſſor, or church of Chriſt on earth. And alſo ſo far as ſaid book gives <hi>authority</hi> to any eccleſiaſtick council, of whatever name, to <hi>decide</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally determine</hi> any cauſe whatſoever, ſo that all parties ſhall be obliged to ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. If a matter of difficulty ariſeth in any church, or between any paſtor and church, I doubt not of the <hi>expediency</hi> of aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counſel and advice of neighbouring paſtors and churches; and, in this caſe, an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick council have right to give their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, counſel and advice; but no <hi>authority,</hi> in my opinion, to enforce any <hi>judgment or deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of theirs upon, paſtor or church. If the paſtor and church, or whatever parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, do mutually agree to abide the reſult of council; the council have, in this caſe, the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:016775_0160_0F9E2E844D5C0370"/>
ſame right to give their opinion, &amp;c. as though no ſuch agreement had taken place; and this opinion of theirs is now become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive; not on account or any <hi>authority</hi> in the council to make it ſo, but becauſe of the mutual agreement of the <hi>parties concerned,</hi> that it ſhall be ſo.</p>
                  <p>My church and people, ſo far as I am acquainted, are perfectly of my mind, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expreſſed, with regard to the authority of eccleſiaſtick councils, both as to articles of faith and doctrines of religion, and all other matters cognizable by ſuch councils.</p>

            <p>The reaſons of the above RENUNCIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION follow.</p>
            <p>CHRIST Jeſus hath given each individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in his church, a right to <hi>judge</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to the interpretation of the holy ſcriptures, and to receive as articles of their faith, or reject whatever <hi>they</hi> ſhall <hi>judge</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable or repugnant to the Bible. For proof, <hi>Mat.</hi> xx. 25, 26. xxiii. 8, 9. <hi>But he ye not called Rabbi: For one is your maſter, even Chriſt; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father, upon the earth; for
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:016775_0161_0F9E2E857A37AFC0"/>
one is your father, which is in Heaven. Mark</hi> x. 42, 43, 44. <hi>John</hi> v. 39. <hi>Search the ſcriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life. And they are they that teſtify of me. Acts</hi> xvii. 11, 12. <hi>Theſe were more noble than thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they ſearched the ſcriptures daily, whether theſe things were ſo. Therefore many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, &amp;c. Rom</hi> xiv. 1—12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 5. <hi>That your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God. Gal.</hi> i. 6—10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 3. <hi>Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being enſamples to the Flock.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 1. <hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit; but try the ſpirits, whether they be of God; becauſe many falſe prophets are gone out into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreeable to the mind of Chriſt that every profeſſor of his religion, whether preacher or hearer, ſhould exerciſe this <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right.</hi> For it cannot be ſuppoſed that Chriſt ſhould give Chriſtians a right he would not be willing they ſhould uſe.</p>
            <p>It is alſo agreeable to the mind of Chriſt, that chriſtians, whilſt they conſcientiouſly exerciſe this <hi>ſacred right of private judgment,</hi> ſhould be <hi>unmoleſted</hi> and <hi>undiſturbed, and not ſubject to any diſadvantages</hi> whatſoever, on account of any <hi>differing opinions or ſentiments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which may poſſibly reſult from the exerciſe of this <hi>common right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="unknown:016775_0162_0F9E2E8631379048"/>Therefore no man, or body of men, act according to the mind of Chriſt, when they give the leaſt moleſtation or diſturbance to any chriſtians, whether preachers or hearers; or ſubject them to the leaſt diſadvantage, on account of any of their different interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſacred ſcriptures, opinions or ſentiments whatſoever.</p>
            <p>If theſe two laſt propoſitions were not true, then chriſtians might, according to the mind of Chriſt, be ſubjected to moleſtation and diſturbance, and to many and great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, even whilſt they were acting conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly according to the mind of Chriſt; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing a right which he had given them; and indeed <hi>for this very conduct</hi> of theirs! which never will be admitted by any friend to <hi>revealed religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To withdraw chriſtian communion and fellowſhip from any chriſtian preacher or profeſſor, or from any church of Chriſt, on account of differing opinions or ſentiments in religion, is to ſubject that preacher, profeſſor, or church of Chriſt, from whom chriſtian communion and fellowſhip is withdrawn, to many and great diſadvantages; it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of all thoſe advantages, whatever they may be, which reſult from chriſtian communion and fellowſhip. Therefore the undeniable and unavoidable inference from the whole argument is this, That it is not
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:016775_0163_0F9E2E891BEE5848"/>
agreeable to the mind of Chriſt, that any man, or body of men on earth, or any eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick council, of whatever name or <hi>boaſted authority,</hi> ſhould withdraw chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip from any chriſtian preacher, profeſſor or church, on account of differing opinions and ſentiments in religion.</p>
            <p>Again, as the Bible is the chriſtian's <hi>only rule of faith,</hi> and as all chriſtians have the <hi>ſacred right</hi> above ſpoken of; no individual chriſtian, whether preacher or hearer, has a right to impoſe ſubſcription to any propoſition of religion, not <hi>expreſſly</hi> contained in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on any other individual chriſtian, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preacher or hearer: For as far as any ſuch right of impoſition takes place, ſo far the right of private judgment is deſtroyed. A right in <hi>A</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> for himſelf, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject any propoſition in religion, not <hi>expreſſed</hi> in the Bible, according to the reſult of his own judgment; and a right in B to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſubſcription to any propoſition, or any number of propoſitions in religion, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly contained in the Bible, on A, cannot poſſibly conſiſt together. A's right is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undeniably proved above, and indeed is indiſputable among all true proteſtants; B, therefore, undoubtedly has no ſuch right of impoſition. But if B has no right of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on A, then he has no right to deprive A of any privilege or advantage whatſoever,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:016775_0164_0F9E2E8A77DBBA78"/>
becauſe he differs from him, though ever ſo much, in his belief of any propoſitions not expreſſed in the Bible. If B therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws communion from A, becauſe A's creed is not the ſame with B's, he does what is abſolutely wrong and injurious; he aſſumes to himſelf a right to judge for A, and in ſo doing denies A's right to judge for himſelf, contrary to what is generally acknowledged, and hath been demonſtrated above. But if B has no ſuch right of impoſition and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, &amp;c. as above, then B, C, D, E, F and G, when met together in council, have no right of impoſition on A, or to deprive him of any the leaſt privilege or advantage what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, becauſe he differs from them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſentiments, and will not renounce his own and ſubſcribe their creed, or any human creed that can be named, that is not compoſed in the expreſs words of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, For the whole right of B, C, D, &amp;c. when met in council, is certainly made up of the <hi>ſum total</hi> of their individual rights. B has no more right in council, than he had in his ſingle capacity; in which ſingle capacity he hath juſt been proved to have none at all. But B has as much right as C, or D, or any other member of the council; which is none at all. When met together therefore in council, though it ſhould be with all <hi>conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gravity and ſolemnity,</hi> and the greateſt
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:016775_0165_0F9E2E8B729FCB08"/>
               <hi>parade</hi> and air of <hi>clerical authority,</hi> they have no right to impoſe on A, require him to renounce his <hi>own,</hi> or ſubſcribe <hi>their</hi> creed; or to deprive him of any privilege whatſoever, becauſe he differs from them in the articles of his faith, and will not renounce them and come over to their ſide, but inſiſts upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying and uſing that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made him free. For when met in council, the rights of B, C, D, E, F and G, are brought into one ſum, <hi>and ſix times nothing is nothing!</hi> and this is the <hi>ſum total</hi> of the council's right: For ever ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cyphers will not amount to a ſum. A very limited <hi>authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, let us view this withdrawing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in a point of light a little different from the foregoing. B inſiſts upon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing communion from A, becauſe A preaches or profeſſes falſe and dangerous doctrines. A declares what he preaches or profeſſes, to be the ſincere dictates of his judgment, regulated by reaſon and the Bible. B declares the ſame as to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and articles of faith. Both A and B have collected their tenets from the ſame ſources, reaſon and the Bible; and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the ſame <hi>right</hi> of private judgment. A is perfectly willing B ſhould enjoy all the liberty <hi>he</hi> does; and is not diſpoſed to give him the leaſt diſturbance or moleſtation
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:016775_0166_0F9E2E8BCD7EBA28"/>
imaginable; but really deſirous he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the privileges of chriſtian ſociety. A is willing to ſubſcribe the bible as his <hi>only rule of faith;</hi> nor does he preach or hold any one propoſition contrary or repugnant to any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> propoſition of the bible. The whole difference between A and B lies in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent interpretations of the holy ſcriptures. But after all their mutual pains and labour to accommodate differences of ſentiment, they are each of the ſame opinion as before. A ſtill retains however his tolerant diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards B, and is as willing now as ever that he ſhould enjoy his own opinions in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed quiet. <hi>B</hi> is diſſatisfied and will not exerciſe charity and toleration with reſpect to <hi>A,</hi> but inſiſts upon withdrawing communion from him, and depriving him of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of chriſtian ſociety and fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>The queſtion now is, whether <hi>B</hi> does not treat <hi>A</hi> injuriouſly and deny him the right of private judgment? I am inclined to take the affirmative of this queſtion, which may be clearly demonſtrated thus; <hi>B</hi> can have no right to withdraw chriſtian communion and fellowſhip from <hi>A,</hi> but on ſuppoſition of <hi>A</hi>'s having acted wrongs and contrary to the clear dictates or Chriſt's religion; and if <hi>B</hi> has no right to withdraw communion from <hi>A,</hi> then in doing it he hath treated him injuriouſly, and denied him the right of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:016775_0167_0F9E2E8C8F945F70"/>
Theſe things will be conceeded by everyone. Now <hi>A</hi>'s wrong and antichriſtian conduct hath been this, that he hath careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impartially ſearched the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conſequently embraced certain te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and ſentiments in religion, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>A</hi> hath acted wrong and contrary to the clear dictates of Chriſt's religion in ſo doing, then it is certainly wrong and contrary to the clear dictates of Chriſt's religion, that <hi>A</hi> ſhould ſearch and examine the bible, and form his own religions creed according to the reſult of his own judgment: and if ſo, A hath no right of private judgment; which was one thing to be proved. <hi>B</hi> hath then certainly denied A's right of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which he had no right to do: and therefore he hath treated <hi>A</hi> injuriouſly; which was the other thing to be proved. So that <hi>B</hi> cannot withdraw communion from A, on account of A's religious ſentiments, as being ever ſo different from his own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treating him injuriouſly, and denying him the right of private judgment.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>B</hi> may perhaps ſay, I do not mean to deny A's right of private judgment: I only claim the ſame right to judge for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which I willingly allow A to enjoy; <hi>i. e.</hi> a right to judge whether I may, or may
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:016775_0168_0F9E2E8DA1C975B8"/>
not conſiſtently hold communion with <hi>A.</hi> I pretend not to judge for <hi>A,</hi> or to deny the right he hath to judge for himſelf; as to all the articles of his faith.</p>
            <p>I know this is <hi>B</hi>'s only ſubterfuge: But it is a mean, ſorry ſhift, make the beſt of it!</p>
            <p>The fallacy of this obſervation of <hi>B,</hi> is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. It is apparently fallacious, from what hath been ſaid above. I intreat <hi>B</hi> to advert to this one conſideration, viz If he has no right to withdraw communion from <hi>A,</hi> on account of any differing ſentiments in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters, he certainly has no right to judge he has. For no man has a right to judge wrong, Beſides, <hi>B</hi> takes the thing to be proved for granted, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw communion from <hi>A</hi> on account of differing ſentiments in religion. That he may not, I have endeavoured to demonſtrate above. But further yet, we may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the abſurdity of any ſuch right in <hi>B,</hi> if we only conſider that <hi>B</hi> has no right to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw communion from <hi>A,</hi> that <hi>A</hi> hath not to withdraw communion from <hi>B,</hi> on account of differing ſentiments in religion: For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>B</hi> differs as much from <hi>A,</hi> as <hi>A</hi> doth from <hi>B,</hi> in his religious creed. So that <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> have equal right to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, on account of difference of ſentiment.</p>
            <p>But what ſhocking abſurdity is here! and what notorious impeachment of the wiſdom
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:016775_0169_0F9E2E8E15F765D8"/>
and goodneſs of Jeſus Chriſt the head of the church! Muſt the bleſſed Jeſus, that moſt warm and ſincere friend of mankind, who, influenced by his unparallelled love to the church, gave his own life a ſacrifice for her! Muſt <hi>he,</hi> who is the wiſdom as well as power of God, be ſuppoſed to have left things in ſuch ſtate in his church, that two chriſtians, or two churches, ſhould in their turns, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate and be excommunicated by each other, and alternately denied the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of chriſtian ſociety and fellowſhip! and this too for their fidelity and firm attachment to <hi>him</hi> as their <hi>Lord and maſter,</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious adherence to thoſe rights which <hi>he himſelf</hi> hath been pleaſed to grant them! Far be it! God forbid any ſuch bold and impious impeachment of the wiſdom and goodneſs of our divine redeemer.</p>
            <p>This and other conſequences, however ſhocking and blaſphemous they may appear, cannot poſſibly be avoided, upon the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that one church, or one chriſtian, hath a right to withdraw communion from another church, or chriſtian, on account of differing ſentiments in religion.</p>
            <p>Indeed the idea of withdrawing commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on account of different ſentiments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is abhorrent from reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, as well as from the bible; and contrary to the principles of the reformation
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:016775_0170_0F9E2E9138E47FB8"/>
from popery: And thoſe who withdraw communion on account of difference in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſentiments, cannot poſſibly juſtify the reformation from popery, in any conſiſtence with their conduct. Withdrawing commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in <hi>America,</hi> ſignifies the ſame thing with dragooning, beheading, or burning in popiſh countries; is practiſed upon the ſame principles, and to be juſtified by the ſame reaſons: And the genius of the civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this country, is the only thing which prevents thoſe who withdraw commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from others, on account of differing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in religion, from impriſoning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, depriving and burning them.</p>
            <p>An <hi>heretick</hi> is indeed to be rejected; but not on account of any ſentiments in religion which he holds, as differing from thoſe of other men; but becauſe he breaks off from the communion of a chriſtian church, that will not ſubſcribe certain tenets he hath form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the rule of her faith; which tenets and opinions are not <hi>expreſſed</hi> in her adopted rule of faith, the bible. Except the <hi>heretick</hi> and immoral chriſtian, there is no character that is to be denied chriſtian communion and fellowſhip, according to any laws of Chriſt I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>If a man ſubſcribes and adopts the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Teſtament as his <hi>only</hi> rule of faith and practice—if he, to all
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:016775_0171_0F9E2E930EDA75B0"/>
appearance, fears God and works righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—is a peaceable and quiet member of the family, the church and the ſtate, though he adopts ſentiments and opinions in religion ever ſo different from thoſe of ſome other man, ſome church, or many churches, from ſome eccleſiaſtick council, or from all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick councils that ever have been, or ever will be, ſo long as time endures, if theſe tenets and opinions are not contrary to <hi>clear, indubitable, expreſs ſcripture,</hi> no man, no church, no eccleſiaſtick council have any right, in my humble opinion, to withdraw communion from that man, or to ſubject him to the leaſt conceivable inconvenience or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, on account of theſe differing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and opinions. Nor can any thing of this kind be done, by men uninſpired, without great injury and cruel injuſtice to the man, and a palpable denial of the right of private judgment in matters of religion; without daring and preſumtuous boldneſs, pride and arrogance, and the moſt ſhocking imputations upon the wiſdom and goodneſs of the wiſeſt and moſt beneficent perſonage in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe!</p>
            <p>That adopting the bible and ſubſcribing the holy ſcriptures as the <hi>only</hi> rule of faith and practice is ſufficient, and all that ought ever to be required of any man, whether preacher or profeſſor, in order to chriſtian
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:016775_0172_0F9E2E93F671FD00"/>
fellowſhip and communion, is evident from the ſcriptures themſelves. 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they are of God: becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the ſpirit of God: every ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is of God: and every ſpirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is not of God.</hi> Here the apoſtle is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions to a chriſtian church, how they ought to treat thoſe who pretended to be preachers of religion. And he tells the church how they might come to a ſafe and happy deciſion with reference to their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and treatment of ſuch pretenders, viz. by bringing them to a ſure point of trial and religious teſt; whether they did, or did not, confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt was come in the fleſh. If they confeſſed this they were to be received, if not, rejected. For to confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is, in effect, to confeſs that the ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſtament are the word of God. For, if Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, theſe ſcriptures are certainly the word of God: And, if theſe ſcriptures are the word of God, then certainly Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh. So that to confeſs either, is, in effect, the ſame thing. And to confeſs this, was, in St. <hi>John</hi>'s day, ſufficient to chriſtian fellowſhip and
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:016775_0173_0F9E2E9419574E00"/>
communion. The world was not ſo wiſe and ſagacious then as it hath been ſince. It hath often been the caſe, ſince St. <hi>John</hi>'s day, that men could not be heard as prophets, nor received to chriſtian communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, upon their confeſſion that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, or ſubſcription to the Old and New Teſtament as their <hi>only rule of faith.</hi> But in order to be qualified for the pulpit or communion table, men have been, and ſtill are, obliged to ſubſcribe long liſts of articles of faith, and certain creeds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionals, catechiſms, &amp;c. And by theſe means men become <hi>ſound and orthodox di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, ſtaunch Calviniſts;</hi> and, I may add, <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant fools!</hi> But I deſire to thank God, I was never dubbed a Calviniſt, or orthodox in this way! and I would be thankful for that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace,</hi> that hath ever withheld my hand from ſubſcribing any <hi>creed, confeſſion of faith, or catechiſm,</hi> or any thing elſe of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man compoſition, as the rule of my faith or manners!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed ſurpriſing men ſhould have the preſumption and effrontery to demand any thing but ſubſcription to the bible, as a neceſſary prerequiſite to preaching the goſpel, or communing at the table of our Lord. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s obſervation upon this buſineſs of ſubſcription to human creeds, &amp;c. is worthy of ſpecial notice in this place. Says he,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:016775_0174_0F9E2E94CCD483F0"/>
"For when they have determined the holy ſcriptures to be the only foundation of faith, they nevertheleſs lay down certain propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as fundamental, which are not in the ſcriptures; and becauſe others will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thoſe additional opinions of theirs, nor build upon them as if they were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and fundamental, they therefore make a ſeparation in the church, either by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from the others, or expelling the others from them. Nor does it ſignify any thing for them to ſay that their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ſymbols are agreeable to ſcripture, and to the analogy of faith. For if they be conceived in the expreſs words of ſcripture, there can be no queſtion about them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe are acknowledged by all chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be of divine inſpiration, and therefore fundamental. But if they ſay, that the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they require to be profeſſed, are conſequences deduced from the ſcripture, it is undoubtedly well done of them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and profeſs ſuch things as ſeem unto them ſo agreeable to the rule of faith; but it would be very ill done to obtrude thoſe things upon others, to whom they do not ſeem to be the indubitable doctrines of the ſcripture. For I do not think there is any man arrived to that degree of madneſs, as that he dare give out his conſequences and interpretations of ſcripture as divine inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:016775_0175_0F9E2E959C785098"/>
and compare the articles of faith he has framed according to his own fancy with the authority of the ſcripture. I know there are ſome propoſitions ſo evidently agreeable to ſcripture, that no body can deny them to be drawn from thence; but about thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no difference. This only I ſay, that however clearly we may think this or the other doctrine to be deduced from ſcripture, we ought not therefore to impoſe it upon others, as a neceſſary article of faith, becauſe we believe it to be agreeable to the rule of faith; unleſs we would be content alſo that other doctrines ſhould be impoſed upon us in like manner; and that we ſhould be compelled to receive all the different and contradictory opinions of <hi>Lutherans, Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Remonſtrants, Anabaptiſts,</hi> other ſects, which the contrivers of ſymboles, ſyſtems and confeſſions are accuſtomed to deliver to their followers as genuine and neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from the holy ſcripture.</p>
            <p>"I cannot but wonder at the extravagant arrogance of thoſe men who think that they themſelves can explain things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more clearly than the <hi>holy ghoſt,</hi> the infinite and eternal wiſdom of God." Thus far Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Letter concerning toleration, p. 75, 76. I am willing to profeſs myſelf of the ſame mind with this great and good man now quoted, as to this unreaſonable
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:016775_0176_0F9E2E9659B102D8"/>
and odious buſineſs of making and ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing human creeds and confeſſions.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenting Gentleman, ſays, p. 307, 308, "The <hi>holy ſcriptures</hi> your Lordſhip, and all proteſtant divines, acknowledge to be a <hi>perfect rule of faith:</hi> In them all needful and important doctrines are <hi>ſo plainly</hi> reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in <hi>words</hi> dictated by the <hi>holy ghoſt,</hi> that no <hi>ſincere</hi> perſon can poſſibly miſtake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, ſo as dangerouſly to err. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, therefore, to theſe ſcriptures, is all that the intereſt of <hi>truth</hi> and of <hi>religion</hi> does require. Now, ſhould any man upon earth, or any body of men, take upon them to draw up articles or formulas of faith, in words <hi>different</hi> from the holy ſcriptures, and to propoſe them as a <hi>rule of faith,</hi> or a <hi>teſt of truth</hi> to others; what, my Lord, is the real nature, or the proper language of ſuch an action? Is it not plainly this; that he thinks himſelf able to define the doctrines of <hi>revelation</hi> in apter and more proper terms than thoſe of the <hi>holy ghoſt?</hi> Does he not in effect ſay, that the great truths of religion, as they ſtand revealed in the ſcriptures (in words which not <hi>man's wiſdom,</hi> but which the wiſdom of God dictated) are not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and clearly expreſſed as <hi>man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> (yea, as his own wiſdom) is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them? And is not this, my Lord, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtuouſly to ſet himſelf up as a <hi>corrector</hi> of
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:016775_0177_0F9E2E97295DEB88"/>
the holy ghoſt? To declare himſelf capable of <hi>mending</hi> the revelation! and to profeſs himſelf <hi>authoriſed</hi> to dictate to the faith of others, and to interpret the ſcriptures for them!"</p>
            <p>I frankly confeſs I ſee not why the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſubſcription to any <hi>articles of faith,</hi> framed by men, and not conceived in the words of ſcripture, as a neceſſary prerequiſite of chriſtian or miniſterial communion and fellowſhip, is not an high, implicit impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God. The holy ghoſt hath certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the articles of chriſtian faith, ſo far as he thought neceſſary for all the purpoſes of chriſtian ſociety in this world, and eternal happineſs in the world to come. Both the goodneſs and wiſdom of God would prompt him to do this: Yea, he hath expreſſly told us he hath done it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16, 17. Now for men to frame certain tenets and propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in religion, according to their own fancy, not conceiving them in any expreſſions of holy ſcriptures, and impoſe them on others, <hi>as articles of faith,</hi> and require ſubſcription to them, as neceſſary to chriſtian communion and fellowſhip in this world, or happineſs in the next; is certainly to do and require more, in order to chriſtian communion in this world, and happineſs in the next, than the wiſdom and goodneſs of God have ever
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:016775_0178_0F9E2E97CAAFA050"/>
moved him to do and require for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Either what is done in this buſineſs of creed-making and ſubſcription by men, is not at all neceſſary for chriſtian communion here, or happineſs hereafter; or elſe the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of God have not done all that is neceſſary for theſe purpoſes in the ſacred ſcriptures. If what men have done, and yet continue to do in this buſineſs of creeds and ſubſcriptions, be unneceſſary for the purpoſes mentioned above; then, why are creeds compoſed, and ſubſcription to them required? If this buſineſs of creed-making and ſubſcription be neceſſary; why hath not the wiſdom of God diſcerned this neceſſity? And why hath not his goodneſs excited him to provide ſome effectual remedy againſt the wretched conſequences of leaving this buſineſs of creed-making to men? For I make no doubt God hath a ſufficient capacity to frame a creed that would be leſs exceptionable and more generally ſubſcribed by chriſtians, and with far greater ſatisfaction, than any creed that hath ever been compoſed by men's hands. And I imagine ſuch a divine creed, written with the finger of God, though it ſhould be <hi>impoſed,</hi> and ſubſcription to it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, would not occaſion ſuch general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs among chriſtians, nor be attended with ſo much complaint and cry of <hi>religious tyranny,</hi> nor be followed with ſuch deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:016775_0179_0F9E2E9B6C3AE428"/>
and pernicious conſequences, as have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken place upon the impoſition of all human creeds without exception.</p>
            <p>God himſelf teſtified, in an awful manner, his high diſpleaſure at the impoſition of the firſt human creed; that made and impoſed by the <hi>Nicene council,</hi> A. D. 325. And it cannot be ſhewn from eccleſiaſtick hiſtory that one good conſequence ever follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the impoſition of a creed made by men, and not conceived in the expreſſions of holy ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>But though it be thus demonſtrably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon and common ſenſe, contrary to the ſcriptures, and an high blaſphemous impeachment of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, that men ſhould make and impoſe creeds, confeſſions of faith, catechiſms, &amp;c. yet creed-mongers will have ſomething to plead in favour of this buſineſs of creed-making: And I expect nothing more, than that, in conſequence of my attempts to ſet at naught this craft, I ſhall hear a mighty cry, ſimilar, it may be, to that St. <hi>Paul</hi> heard at <hi>Athens,</hi> occaſioned by his ſetting at naught the craft of the ſilverſmiths, who made ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines for <hi>Diana.</hi> I fancy the buſineſs of creed making is not quite ſo gainful, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in proteſtant countries, as was the craft of making ſhrines for <hi>Diana;</hi> yet as it is ſo ſweet and gratifying to men of haughty,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:016775_0180_0F9E2E9D6E397730"/>
proud, aſſuming, arrogant ſpirits, to be dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of other men's creeds and confeſſions; ſuch men may be as much incenſed when this buſineſs is ſpoken againſt, as were the ſilverſmiths of old, when <hi>Diana</hi> was ſpoken againſt.</p>
            <p>But what will the ſticklers for human creeds and confeſſions ſay? They will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly object that, if men ſubſcribe only the holy ſcriptures, then preachers, profeſſors and churches may preſently grow corrupt, pervert the ſcriptures to patronize their errors, degenerate from the faith, &amp;c. &amp;c. Juſt as if the ſame men who would corrupt the word of God, would not alſo corrupt a creed or confeſſion made by men! The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Gentleman ſays on this matter, "Will it be ſaid—But crafty and corrupt men pervert the words of the <hi>holy ghoſt,</hi> and ſk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een dangerous errors under ſcriptural forms. Let it be ſaid: And will not crafty and corrupt men as eaſily pervert, and as lightly violate and break through all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and forms which <hi>human ſkill</hi> can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, or <hi>human prudence</hi> preſcribe? Does not the plaineſt reaſon and nature of the thing ſpeak, that thus it will be? Has not the experience of <hi>fourteen hundred</hi> years put it beyond all doubt? Will any articles or forms of doctrine prove a fence againſt a man of an inſincere and corrupt heart, or
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:016775_0181_0F9E2E9E529E0590"/>
keep him out of the church? No: He will ever ſwim with the ſtream; he will declare or ſubſcribe any thing, as his worldly intereſt directs. No, my Lord, it is men of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> only, your Lordſhip well knows, that can poſſibly be affected here: It is men of <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>conſcience</hi> only, that theſe ſubſcriptions are ever capable of keeping out of the church: So that, if rightly conſidered, it is not in their nature to be the leaſt guard againſt error, nor the leaſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to truth. And when withal it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, how in all ages of the church they have been moſt miſchievouſly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſeveral parties of <hi>chriſtians,</hi> as they alternately prevailed! What wrecks they have made of conſcience! What ſacrifices of integrity to human ignorance and pride! What engines they have proved in the hands of the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, to torture and oppreſs good men, and to exalt and aggrandize the bad!—Scarce any thing can be more amazing, than that a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo notoriouſly prepoſterous and abſurd; a meaſure ſo directly tending to bring <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> into the church, and to keep integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſcience out; ſhould ever have been patronized, and even vehemently urged, by men, unqueſtionably both wiſe and good." p. 308, 309.</p>
            <p>A little attention to eccleſiaſtick hiſtory
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:016775_0182_0F9E2E9EC51DF790"/>
will convince any impartial enquirer after truth, that all the endeavours that ever have been made, either by individuals or by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and ſynods, to effect a <hi>uniformity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſentiment in religious matters,</hi> in the church of Chriſt, have been, not only vain and fruitleſs, but attended with the moſt baneful and pernicious conſequences. Where it can be ſhewn that a ſingle error hath ever been ſuppreſſed by framing and impoſing creeds and confeſſions of faith, it may eaſily be ſhewn, that an hundred have received their riſe and propagation <hi>by theſe very means.</hi> And as it conſtantly and invariably hath been the caſe in the church, that hatred, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, emulations and hereſies have followed the endeavours of of creed mongers and confeſſion-makers, to bring about a <hi>uniformity in religious opinions and ſentiments</hi> in the chriſtian church, ſo we have all the reaſon in the world to believe, that theſe ſad and diſmal conſequences will ever follow ſuch endeavours. Men do not look alike, nor ſpeak, nor write alike: And juſt as vain and ſleeveleſs a buſineſs would it be, in my opinion, for any man, or body of men, to undertake to effect a <hi>uniformity of viſages, manner of ſpeaking, and hand-writing</hi> amongſt mankind, as to effect a <hi>uniformity in religious tenets and ſentiment.</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can effect the former, may perhaps ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:016775_0183_0F9E2E9F4BA673D0"/>
the latter. Why then ſuch a mighty cry about <hi>orthodoxy</hi> in religion? We never hear of an <hi>orthodox</hi> face, an <hi>orthodox</hi> manner of ſpeaking or writing amongſt mankind. "It is great pity," ſays the author of Remarks upon Preſident Clap's Hiſtory, &amp;c. "as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is our diſtinguiſhing mark as chriſtians, that we exerciſe it much leſs in religion, than in the common affairs of life. Agreeable to which, ſays an author, I do not believe that there are two men upon earth who think exactly alike upon every ſubject; and yet our differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent taſtes in meat, drink, building and dreſs make not the leaſt difference in human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; nor is it likely that they ever will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we eſtabliſh by law, and tack preferments to one particular mode of eating, drinking, building and dreſſing; then indeed we may expect to ſee the eſtabliſhed orthodox <hi>maſon, cook</hi> and <hi>taylor,</hi> very zealous and loud for conformity and penalties: But at preſent ten men, in ten different ſuits, can dine together upon ten different diſhes; and give ten dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinions upon one piece of painting of architecture, without breaking friendſhip and good humour: If indeed they be drunk with wine or zeal, they will be apt to fight about the church, or ſomething elſe: But why men in their ſenſes ſhould clamour and quarrel at their neighbour's particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, any more than at his particular palate,

no reaſon can be aſſigned, but the deluſions of prieſtcraft, operating upon its genuine iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, bigotry."—p. 56, 57.</p>
            <p>So long as mankind are of different ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuſes and diſpoſitions of ſoul; are differently educated in families, in publick or private ſchools; go into different tracts of reading and thinking; and ſhall agree to hold it as an <hi>unalienable right, ſacred from the deity,</hi> that they may ſearch, examine and judge for themſelves in all matters of religion; they will moſt certainly differ from one another in their religious tenets and ſentiments.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Saybrook</hi> Platform gives a right to any eccleſiaſtick council to decide and finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any cauſe whatſoever, I diſſent from it for this reaſon, viz. that, as there is no inſtitution, precept or example of any eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick council in the New Teſtament; ſo the whole authority of ſuch a council muſt be derived from its conſtituents, <hi>the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;</hi> and therefore ſuch a council can have no authority but what is given them to decide any cauſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Thus much I think proper to offer, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as a vindication of my renunciation of <hi>Saybrook</hi> Platform, ſo far as I view it as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the <hi>holy ſcriptures,</hi> either in its doctrines or diſcipline. But as I have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that <hi>that</hi> book is not ſo criminal, as that the judgment of an eccleſiaſtick council

upon articles of faith, or doctrines of religion to the leaſt conceivable prejudice or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of any preacher, profeſſor or church, can be built upon it, or vindicated from it; I mean now to ſhew that the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or our worthy anceſtors, the compilers of that book, were perfectly the ſame with thoſe I have attempted to vindicate in theſe papers. In the preface to their Confeſſion or Faith, they ſay, p. 5, 6, "This Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith we offer as our firm perſuaſion, well and fully grounded upon the <hi>holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and commend the ſame unto all, and particularly to the people of our colony, to be examined, accepted and conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained." How is this? Did theſe good men mean to impoſe their confeſſion of faith upon the people of Connecticut, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to require their ſubſcription? Let them anſwer for themſelves. "We do not aſſume to ourſelves, that any thing be taken upon truſt from us, but commend to our people theſe following counſels."</p>
            <p n="1">I. "That you be immoveably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably agreed in the only ſufficient and invariable rule of religion, which is the holy ſcripture, the fixed canon, incapable of addition or diminution."</p>
            <p n="2">II. "That you be determined by this rule in the whole of religion. That your faith be right and divine, the word of God
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:016775_0186_0F9E2EA1DC566500"/>
muſt be the foundation of it, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the word the reaſon of it."</p>
            <p n="3">III. "That you be well grounded in the firm truths of religion. We have willingly taken pains to add the holy ſcriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every point or faith contained in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion doth depend, and is borne up by, and commend the ſame to your diligent peruſal, that you be eſtabliſhed in the truth, and your <hi>faith reſt upon its proper baſis, the word of God.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Again, p. 8. "That having applied the rule of holy ſcripture to all the articles of this Confeſſion, and found the ſame, <hi>upon trial,</hi> the unchangeable and eternal truths of God: you remember and hold them faſt, contend earneſtly for them as the faith once delivered to the Saints."</p>
            <p>Again, in their Confeſſion of Faith itſelf, Art. X. "The ſupreme <hi>judge</hi> by which all <hi>controverſies</hi> of religion are to be <hi>determined,</hi> and all <hi>decrees</hi> of <hi>councils, opinions</hi> of <hi>ancient writers, doctrines</hi> of men and private ſpirits, are to be <hi>examined,</hi> and in whoſe ſentence we are to reſt, can be no other but the holy ſcripture delivered by the ſpirit; into which ſcripture ſo delivered our faith is finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved."</p>
            <p>I now willingly leave it to the world to judge, whether the compilers of <hi>Saybrook</hi> Platform, did not firmly believe that all
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:016775_0187_0F9E2EA59E6F4668"/>
chriſtians were happy in the enjoyment of the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>unalienable right</hi> to ſearch the <hi>holy ſcriptures;</hi> and to receive or reject whatever opinions and ſentiments they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed agreeable or repugnant to that unerring ſtandard: And conſequently that no man, or body of men, had <hi>authority</hi> to frame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of faith and impoſe them on others.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being undeniable, how any man, or body of men, ſhould preſume to judge for others, as to <hi>articles of faith</hi> and <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of religion,</hi> and to cenſure and condemn their fellow chriſtians, on account of their differing <hi>ſentiments</hi> and <hi>opinions,</hi> as to the <hi>interpretation</hi> of <hi>holy ſcriptures;</hi> and even <hi>withdraw communion</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip</hi> from thoſe who differ from them, and deny them many of the advantages of chriſtian ſociety; or even any advantages whatſoever; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at the ſame time a warrant for this conduct from <hi>Saybrook Platform,</hi> and, what is more ſhocking yet, from the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> muſt be reſolved either into their ſhameful miſinterpretation of the Platform and New Teſtament both; or their bold and daring preſumption, pride, arrogance, and itch for dominion over others conſciences.</p>
            <p>It is a ſhame and ſcandal to thoſe who conduct in this unreaſonable and unſcriptural manner, if not to religion itſelf, that it ſhould
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:016775_0188_0F9E2EA6F21BD1E0"/>
be <hi>'told in Gath, or publiſhed in the ſtreets of Aſkelon:'</hi> For <hi>'the daughters of the Philiſtines will rejoice, the daughters of the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed will triumph:'</hi> The enemies of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſion will blaſpheme, when they ſhall behold chriſtians crumbling into parts and factions, condemning and anathematizing one another, excommunicating and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and alternately depriving and being deprived of the advantages of chriſtian ſociety and communion: Becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tolerate one another in ſearching and examining the ſacred canon, and believing or rejecting what they ſhall judge agreeable or repugnant to it!</p>
            <p>I will conclude what I ſhall offer on this ſubject with that very remarkable paragraph of the renowned <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> which, I fancy, no true proteſtant will read or hear, but with great ſatisfaction, eſpecially when they conſider that it is the language of a great man, converted from popery by his diligent ſearch of the <hi>ſacred ſcriptures.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to a writer of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he thus ſpeaks in vindication of the proteſtant cauſe, "Know then, Sir, that when I ſay the religion of proteſtants is in truth to be preferred before yours; as on the one ſide, I do not underſtand by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or any other private man amongſt you; nor
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:016775_0189_0F9E2EA800627ED8"/>
the doctrine of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> or of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or of any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular company or ſociety amongſt you; but that wherein you all agree, or profeſs to agree, the doctrine of the council of <hi>Trent;</hi> ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly on the other ſide, by the religion of proteſtants, I do not underſtand the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Melancthon,</hi> nor the confeſſion of <hi>Augſburgh</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor the catechiſm of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> nor the articles of the church of <hi>England;</hi> no, nor the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of proteſtant creeds and confeſſions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all ſubſcribe with one accord, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted perfect rule of their faith and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that is, the bible. The bible, I ſay, the bible only, is the religion of proteſtants, whatſoever elſe they believe beſides it: And the plain, irrefragable, and indubitable conſequences of it, well may they hold as matters of opinion, but as matters of ſaith and religion, neither can they with coherence to their own grounds believe it themſelves, nor require the belief of it of others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moſt high and ſchiſmatical preſumption. I, for my part, after a long, and (as I verily believe and hope) impartial ſearch of the true way to eternal happineſs, do profeſs plainly that I cannot find any reſt for the ſole of my foot, but upon this rock only. I ſee plainly, and with mine own eyes, that there
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:016775_0190_0F9E2EA86E38FA30"/>
are popes againſt popes, councils againſt councils, ſome fathers againſt others, the ſame fathers againſt themſelves, a conſent of fathers of one age, againſt a conſent of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of another age, the church of one age againſt the church of another age. Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive interpretations of ſcripture are pretended; but there are few or none to be found. No tradition but only of ſcripture can derive it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the fountain, but may be plainly proved to be brought in, in ſuch an age after Chriſt, or that in ſuch an age it was not. In a word, there is no ſufficient certainty but of ſcripture only, for any conſidering man to build upon. This, therefore, and this only, I have reaſon to believe, this I will profeſs, according to this I will live, and for this, if there be occaſion, I will not only willingly, but gladly, looſe my life; though I ſhould be ſorry that Chriſtians ſhould take it from me. Propoſe me any thing out of this book, and require whether I believe or no, and ſeem it never ſo incomprehenſible to human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will ſubſcribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no demonſtration can be ſtronger than this, God hath ſaid ſo, therefore it is true. In other things, I will take no man's liberty of judging from him, neither ſhall any man take mine from me. I will think no man the worſe man, nor the worſe chriſtian, I will love no man the leſs, for differing in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:016775_0191_0F9E2EA90CA5FDC8"/>
from me; and what meaſure I mete to others, I expect from them again. I am fully aſſured that God does not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men ought not, to require any more of any man than this: To believe the <hi>ſcripture</hi> to be God's word, to endeavour to find the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it." <hi>Hiſtory of Religion,</hi> p. 55, 56, 57.</p>
