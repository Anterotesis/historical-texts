            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS is an action of aſſumpſit, brought by Louis LeGuen againſt Gouver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur &amp; Kemble, for their negligence and miſconduct as his factors or agents.—The cauſe was tried at the bar of the ſupreme court in the city of New-York, in October laſt, when a ſpecial verdict was found and damages aſſeſſed at dolls. 119,30266/100—In January term laſt the ſupreme court gave judgment for the plff. Louis LeGuen. To reverſe which judgment the ſaid G. &amp; K. have brought a writ of error.</p>
            <p>The declaration and plea may be ſeen at large in the <hi>printed</hi> copies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which have been delivered—Of the facts found by the ſpecial verdict, the following are preſumed to be thoſe which are eſſential to the deciſion of the cauſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. LeGuen finding the ſaid G. &amp; K. evaſive and diſobliging in their conduct, and beginning to apprehend that they wiſhed to embarraſs him in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his property; in order to obtain an explicit avowal of their intentions <note place="margin">Page 23.</note> wrote to them on the 30th May, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring

to the preceding diſagreement with reſpect to the means to be taken to inſure payment for the cotton and indigo—He directs them to inſiſt, 1ſt, on that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſale which requires <hi>that the property ſhould be completely covered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</hi> (the inſurance being then deficient by 7,367 dollars) 2d, That they ſhould give no order for the diſpoſal of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of the cargo without his knowledge and conſent, that he might avail himſelf of the 4th article in the contract, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the proceeds in Havre or Hamburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, but on the ſame day, an interview was had between LeGuen and G. &amp; K.—Mr. LeGuen repeated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> contained in his letter, aſked an abſtract of their account <hi>that he might ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it to their entire ſatisfaction and diſcharge,</hi> and demanded a copy of the contract and an authorization to receive his money in Europe, repreſented to them that the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> was ſpecially liable for the payments of the money due to him,</hi> and ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be burthened either with the <hi>freight money</hi> or <hi>premium of inſurance;</hi> and page

59 of the printed ſpecial verdict, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that by the cuſtoms of Normandy, which province includes Havre de Grace, the vendor has a lien for the purchaſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on goods ſold until again ſold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and that LeGuen might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a removal of the goods from thence, if there was danger of loſs. The ſaid G. and K. nevertheleſs diſregarded all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and injunctions of Mr. LeGuen, and even in his preſence <hi>encouraged the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to depart</hi> with the ſhip White-Fox, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> to diſpoſe of the cargo <hi>as they pleaſed</hi>—and that the ſaid Gomez actually ſailed with the ſaid cargo in the ſhip White-Fox on the following day.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> On the 6th June Mr. LeGuen having received no anſwer to his letter of the 30th May, no one of his requeſts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands having been complied with, nor any account furniſhed to him; he writes again to G. and K repeating his former demands, urging the loſſes and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to which he was expoſed by their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> conduct; <hi>that they had even refuſed to name an agent in Europe to take care of his</hi>

               <hi>property,</hi> offers yet to co-operate with them, and propoſes to join with them in taking legal advice as to the ſteps to be purſued.</p>
            <p>To which G. and K. reply, by a letter of the ſame date, encloſing their account <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> whereby they claim a balance of £.6256 2<abbr>s</abbr> 6<abbr>d</abbr>, alledging that they are reſponſible for the charter money in £.3733:6:8 and refuſing to give him any authorization until they ſhould be paid this imaginary balance, and ſecured for this voluntary guarantee.</p>
            <p>In the ſame letter they intimate, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Mr. LeGuen's imagination is diſturbed with idle anxieties, that he had no cauſe for alarm, for that Gomez, Lopez and Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>era are men of good characters and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reſponſibility, and that they (G. and K.) are diſpoſed to treat the ſaid Gomez and Co. with delicacy throughout.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> On the 15th June, Mr. LeGuen writes again to G. and K.—and after expreſſing his chagrin that they have never given him any ſpecific reply nor made him a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic propoſition, he infers that they are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined at all events to retain his whole property until the winding up of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Gomez and Co.</hi> That they wantonly deprive him of the benefit of the election to receive his money in Europe and defeat all his projects—He proteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this conduct, and demands for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> laſt time that they forthwith <hi>furniſh him with an authenticated copy of the contract of ſale, and a competent authorization to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at the port of diſcharge whatever ſum ſhall remain of the proceeds of the goods ſold to Gomez and Co.—after firſt deducting and</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In a letter of the 2d Jan.

The jury have alſo found, that on the 6 June, '95, the ſaid LeGuen was indebted to G. and K. in £4795 6 3; that they had in their hands a cuſtom houſe deben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the property of the ſaid Louis, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Auguſt following, for £.4834 15, <hi>which would leave a balance of</hi> £.39 8 10, <hi>due to the ſaid L. LeGuen;</hi> but the jury <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> farther ſay that G. and K. were entitled to a commiſſion of £60 8 10, on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benture, which would leave due to G. and K. <hi>twenty-one pounds and three pence,</hi> on the general balance of their account—That G. and K. received the amount of the debenture when it became due, and that the bonds which they entered into at the cuſtom-houſe were cancelled on the 1 April '96.</p>
            <p>That G. and K. did not, at any time previous to the 1 Dec. '95, elect to receive the proceeds of the cotton and indigo in Europe—but did on the 22 Dec. elect to receive them in Hamburgh, and on the 2 Jan. '96, elect to receive them in London.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:048502_0016_10258B12A18A74D0"/>
That the reſult of a careful examination of the facts found by the verdict is, that the advances and reſponſibilities of G. and K. for Mr. LeGuen, which they make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for detaining from him ſo large a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, are reducible, the advances to the above trifling ſum of <hi>twenty-one pounds and three pence,</hi> and the reſponſibilities to the bond given to the cuſtom-houſe for <hi>twelve thouſand and eighty-ſix dollars and eighty-ſeven cents,</hi> which was ſure to be cancelled upon producing evidence of the landing of the goods abroad. Nevertheleſs, Gouver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur &amp; Kemble had then actually received commiſſions to the amount of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeven hundred and eighty-two dollars and five cents.</p>
            <p>That it does not appear from any thing contained in the ſpecial verdict, nor is it to be inferred from any thing <hi>even offered to be proven,</hi> that G. and K. will be loſers; but conſidering <hi>the monſtrous benefit ariſing from the uſe of ſo large a ſum of money</hi>—conſidering that they have at length ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in placing the property in the hands of their friends, Smith and Atkinſon, of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:048502_0017_10258B18430890C8"/>
London—conſidering that, in the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, Gomez &amp; Co. are, as alledged by G. and K. men of property and reſponſibility—conſidering alſo, that a recovery in this action by LeGuen, will veſt the notes and property in Gouverneur and Kemble; it is fairly to be preſumed, that they have ſeen and known how <hi>to ſecure not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification, but profit by their miſconduct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LeGuen nevertheleſs very naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to look to the reſponſibility of Gouverneur and Kemble, rather than to the proceeds of the goods, however ſufficient they might be, becauſe he knew the aſſertion of his right to them, would ſubject them to ſequeſtration by the Britiſh government, in conſequence of his character of <hi>Alien—Enemy.</hi>

THE COUNSEL for Louis LeGuen will urge and maintain,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every contract made by a factor for the ſale of goods is for the benefit of his principal, and forms a contract between the principal and the purchaſer, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contract made by a factor for <hi>his own benefit</hi> with the property of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, is a violation of his duty and a fraud againſt the principal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That every factor is bound generally to obey the orders of his principal, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to uſe his endeavors to carry into effect any contract by him made for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his principal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That therefore, if a contract ſhould ſtipulate an advantage to depend on an election to be made, that election being itſelf a priviledge or benefit, is to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed for the principal and is ſubject to his controul and direction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That in the preſent caſe, the right of election to receive the purchaſe money
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:048502_0020_10258B1E153A95E8"/>
in Europe, was a right which G. and K. ought to have exerciſed for the benefit of their principal, according to his direction and requeſt, eſpecially as he was thereby to <hi>receive a premium or advance of price of five per cent, equal to</hi> 612031/100 <hi>dollars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That this poſition and inference are the more obvious in the preſent caſe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the factors could neither have ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated nor exerciſed ſuch a right without the conſent of their principal—Becauſe, the contract was made by the <hi>intervention and expreſs direction</hi> of LeGuen—Becauſe, <hi>it was his avowed object to transfer his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to France,</hi> of which country he was a native and citizen—becauſe at Havre deGrace, to which port the ſhip was bound, he would have had a lien on the property which would have enabled him to have taken precautions important to his ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and becauſe it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that all theſe advantages could be defeated at the mere pleaſure of the factors and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the direction of the principal.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:048502_0021_10258B20F6EDE7A8"/>
6. That the acknowledged lien which a factor has on the property entruſted to him for his advances and reſponſibilities can form no objection to the demand of LeGuen in the preſent caſe, becauſe,</p>
            <p>That lien like every other right is liable to be modified or aboliſhed by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the parties either expreſs or implied—</p>
            <p>That it is not in its nature local, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on the place of payment;</p>
            <p>That G. and K. by becoming parties to a contract for the benefit of LeGuen, co<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aining a right of election to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in foreign parts the monies to ariſe from the proceeds, virtually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to give effect to this right and to exerciſe his lien at the place of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—</p>
            <p>That if payment had been poſitively ſtipulated at Havre or Hamburgh, no doubt could have ariſen but that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſerving enough to cover their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:048502_0022_10258B22807007B0"/>
advances and reſponſibilities, they would have been obliged to pay the overplus <hi>there</hi> to LeGuen; and in ſuch caſe, to have contended that they would have had a right <hi>to bring back the whole amount of the ſales to New-York at his expenſe and riſk,</hi> to cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er themſelves for a ſum which might not amount to one <hi>thouſandth</hi> part of it, would be an abſurdity too glaring to be endured—that a right of election to receive in a foreign port, brings the matter to the ſame iſſue—when that election was made, the foreign port became the place of payment, and <hi>there</hi> only could the lien of the factors be exerciſed.</p>
            <p>That it is an invariable maxim in law, that he who agrees to an <hi>end</hi> agrees to the MEANS. G. and K. might have refuſed to enter into the contract on ſuch terms, but having aſſented, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing executed the contract, they were bound not to impede the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:048502_0023_10258B2568C1DE50"/>
That G. and K. could have given the authority required of them by LeGuen, in ſo ſpecial a form and with ſuch co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an agent named by themſelves, as would have ſecured to them the full bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their <hi>lieu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly it will be demonſtrated that <hi>upon the conſtruction contended for by G. and K. they and their agents may keep the whole property in their hands forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With reſpect to the meaſure and amount of damages, for the reſpondent, it will be contended,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the rules of law preſcribe the meaſure of damages in all caſes in which they are not merely contingent—Thus in promiſſory notes and other liquidated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the legal intereſt—on foreign bills 20 per cent—on inland bills 5 per cent; without any enquiry into the ſpecial dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which the party may have actually ſuſtained. Thus in actions of trover, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:048502_0024_10258B29CB5BDA28"/>
ſlight the damage, the party is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to pay the whole value of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of which he hath made an improper uſe—Thus finally, in every caſe of a factor or truſtee, the damages are invariably the whole value of the property which may have been affected by his neglect or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct; as in a caſe of acknowledged au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if a factor be inſtructed to ſell at a credit of 30 days and he ſell at a credit of 31, <hi>he is inſtantly liable for the value of the whole,</hi> although the purchaſer prove inſolvent within the thirty days; becauſe a violation of his duty relating <hi>to the whole</hi>—If he had ſold <hi>a part</hi> only, he would in like manner have been liable for <hi>that part.</hi> So if a truſtee be directed to put out mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey on real property and lend it on perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſecurity, however competent, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly anſwerable perſonally for the whole. No enquiry is made or would be allowed as to the actual or probable damage ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: the factor and the truſtee are deemed to have taken the reſponſibility upon themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:048502_0025_10258B2B7560E6D8"/>
2. That the application of this obvious principle is peculiarly neceſſary in the preſent caſe, becauſe of the impoſſibility of aſcertaining or calculating the events which may have affected the views and intereſt of the parties—that if LeGuen ſhould prove on the one part that he could have made half a million of dollars by the receipt of his money in Havre; and by his preſence in aiding the ſales, could have alſo enſured a profit to Gomez and Co.—and G. and K. on the other part ſhould prove that they had reaſon to believe that a better market could be had at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; a court ought to pronounce, as has been done by the ſupreme court, that all ſuch <hi>proof</hi> would be irrelevant and could tend only to introduce confuſion and uncertainty; the only object of enquiry being, have G. and K. neglected or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the orders of their principal—if ſo, does their neglect or miſconduct relate to the whole or a part only of the property;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:048502_0026_10258B2FD6C99E40"/>
if to the whole they are liable for the whole, if to a part for that part only. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>guiſh or mitigate the damages, but that the price in the ſale was fraudulent—that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty had been loſt before the default— that the principal had releaſed the whole or part, or had been wholly or partially compenſated—<hi>neither of which points was in any ſort attempted to be proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That a default which gives a right of action, neceſſarily carries with it the rule of compenſation or damages, as an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and which cannot therefore in any degree depend on future events and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That as the default in the preſent inſtance related to the whole property, and defeated the eſſential part of the ſale, G. and K. thereby ſubſtituted themſelves to the purchaſers, and took upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the riſk of future contingencies: That the amount for which the property ſold is the proper and only ſtandard of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue

            <p n="5">5. That in the caſes mentioned under the firſt head, and in many others, the law fixes the rule of damages, which will regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and controul the verdict of a jury—That when the parties agree the value, this value is the rule—That where an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, by his aſſumption or default, puts himſelf in the place of another with whom he has ſettled the value, the value ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſhall govern as againſt him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That conſequently the amount for which the goods were ſold to Gomez, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez and Rivera, together with five per cent for receiving in Europe, is the <hi>principal ſum</hi> for which G. and K. became liable for their default.</p>
            <p>The foregoing general propoſitions will be illuſtrated by arguments and analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, which it is hoped will fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That this poſition and inference are the more obvious in the preſent caſe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the factors could neither have ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated nor exerciſed ſuch a right without the conſent of their principal—Becauſe, the contract was made by the <hi>intervention and expreſs direction</hi> of LeGuen—Becauſe, <hi>it was his avowed object to transfer his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to France,</hi> of which country he was a native and citizen—becauſe at Havre deGrace, to which port the ſhip was bound, he would have had a lien on the property which would have enabled him to have taken precautions important to his ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and becauſe it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that all theſe advantages could be defeated at the mere pleaſure of the factors and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the direction of the principal.</p>

That G. and K. could have given the authority required of them by LeGuen, in ſo ſpecial a form and with ſuch co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an agent named by themſelves, as would have ſecured to them the full bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their <hi>lien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With reſpect to the meaſure and amount of damages, for the reſpondent, it will be contended,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the rules of law preſcribe the meaſure of damages in all caſes in which they are not merely contingent—Thus in promiſſory notes and other liquidated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the legal intereſt—on foreign bills 20 per cent—on inland bills 5 per cent; without any enquiry into the ſpecial dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which the party may have actually ſuſtained. Thus in actions of trover, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſlight the damage, the party is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to pay the whole value of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of which he hath made an improper uſe—Thus finally, in every caſe of a factor or truſtee, the damages are invariably the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:048502_0050_10258B63D57360F8"/>
whole value of the property which may have been affected by his neglect or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct; as in a caſe of acknowledged au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if a factor be inſtructed to ſell at a credit of 30 days and he ſell at a credit of 31, <hi>he is inſtantly liable for the value of the whole,</hi> although the purchaſer prove inſolvent within the thirty days; becauſe a violation of his duty relating <hi>to the whole</hi>—If he had ſold a <hi>part</hi> only, he would in like manner have been liable for <hi>that part.</hi> So if a truſtee be directed to put out mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey on real property and lend it on perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſecurity, however competent, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly anſwerable perſonally for the whole. No enquiry is made or would be allowed as to the actual or probable damage ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: the factor and the truſtee are deemed to have taken the reſponſibility upon themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the application of this obvious principle is peculiarly neceſſary in the preſent caſe, becauſe of the impoſſibility of aſcertaining or calculating the events
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:048502_0051_10258B655BE50D60"/>
which may have affected the views and intereſt of the parties—that if LeGuen ſhould prove on the one part that he could have made half a million of dollars by the receipt of his money in Havre; and by his preſence in aiding the ſales, could have alſo enſured a profit to Gomez and Co.— and G. and K. on the other part ſhould prove that they had reaſon to believe that a better market could be had at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; a court ought to pronounce, as has been done by the ſupreme court, that all ſuch <hi>proof</hi> would be irrelevant and could tend only to introduce confuſion and uncertainty; the only object of enquiry being, have G. and K. neglected or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the orders of their principal—if ſo, does their neglect or miſconduct relate to the whole or a part only of the property; if to the whole they are liable for the whole, if to a part for that part only. No other evidence was admiſſible to extinguiſhing or mitigate the damages, but that the price in the ſale was fraudulent—that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:048502_0052_10258CD3B4E50BD0"/>
had been loſt before the default—that the principal had releaſed the whole or part, or had been wholly or partially compenſated—<hi>neither of which points was in any ſort attempted to be proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That a default which gives a right of action, neceſſarily carries with it the rule of compenſation or damages, as an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and which cannot therefore in any degree depend on future events and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That as the default in the preſent inſtance related to the whole property, and defeated the eſſential part of the ſale, G. and K. thereby ſubſtituted themſelves to the purchaſers, and took upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the riſk of future contingencies: That the amount for which the property ſold is the proper and only ſtandard of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and of damages, and that on any other principle there could be <hi>no rule</hi> of damage in the preſent caſe; the events which took place ſubſequently to the default offering
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:048502_0053_10258CD577322080"/>
only a field for vague and unlimited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That in the caſes mentioned under the firſt head, and in many others, the law fixes the rule of damages, which will regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and controul the verdict of a jury—That when, the parties agree the value, this value is the rule—That where an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, by his aſſumption or default, puts himſelf in the place of another with whom he has ſettled the value, the value ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſhall govern as againſt him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That conſequently the amount for which the goods were ſold to Gomez, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez and Rivera, together with five per cent for receiving in Europe, is the <hi>principal ſum</hi> for which G. and K. became liable for their default.</p>
            <p>The foregoing general propoſitions will be illuſtrated by arguments and analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, which it is hoped will fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their ſoundneſs, and the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the judgment of the ſupreme court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:048502_0054_10258CD864DA0D30"/>
The little objections in point of form, with which G. and K. may attempt to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs the cauſe, would not be worthy of notice in this ſtate of the buſineſs, even if they could be anticipated. They will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, be diſpoſed of in the courſe of the argument.</p>
