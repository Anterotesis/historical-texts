            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Seeſt thou how Faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MANY have imagined that the apoſtles, Paul and James, differed in ſentiment about juſtifying faith; becauſe the one ſays, A man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law; and the other ſays, By works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only. But if we duly attend to the occaſion and ſcope of their writings, it will pull down all ſuch imaginations. For Paul was called to lay the foundation of Chriſtianity, among nations who were ſtrangers to revelation, and to the hope of the goſpel; which hope is built upon the pure mercy of God, as revealed in his Son, and not upon any doings of the creature. And to fix theſe ideas in the mind is of infinite import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to every child of Adam. But after Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity had become honorable among men, many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to believe in Chriſt, who neglected obedience to his laws, and imagined that true faith and holy works could be ſeparated. Therefore James was inſpired to write unto the twelve tribes who were ſcattered abroad, and to call them to rejoice in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023140_0005_0FBC7F9943C7ED10"/>divers temptations which they fell into, to try their faith and patience, in proſperity or adverſity, in view of the crown of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them who love him. But he warns them againſt ever ſaying that God <hi>enticed</hi> any into ſin; for all ſin proceeds from the <hi>luſts of men.</hi> And to guard againſt all error, he ſays, Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we ſhould be a kind of firſt-fruits of his creatures. James i. 1—18. So that James held to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the entire depravity of human nature, and to regeneration and ſalvation by the ſovereign grace of God, as much as Paul did. There was a ſweet harmony between them; as will more fully appear, if we conſider the nature of faith, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of it upon human conduct, and how it is made perfect by works.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is faith? In the common affairs of life, faith is as eaſily underſtood at any word in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but in religion, all arts have been made uſe of to render it as obſcure and uncertain as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. When it reſpects a report or teſtimony, faith is receiving what is reported or teſtified for truth; and when it relates to promiſes and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, it is verity and punctuality in the promifer, and truſt and confidence in him or them to whom the promiſes are made. And an impartial and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual execution of the laws, and ſubmiſſion and obedience thereto, is the faith of government. But how little of it is now ſeen in the world. When the Son of God was manifeſted in the fleſh, his ſervants ſaid, Who hath believed our report? Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing, by the word
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023140_0006_0FBC7F9B4E5EE0F8"/>of God. Rom. x. 16, 17. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal, that God is true; for he whom God hath ſent ſpeaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. John iii. 33—36. We are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe, to the ſaving of the ſoul. Now faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen were not made of things which do appear. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witneſs, that he was righteous, God teſtifying of his gifts; and by it he being dead, yet ſpeaketh. Heb. x. 39. xi. 1—4. But Cain ſlew his brother, becauſe his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 1 John iii. 12. And all that dwell upon the earth worſhip the beaſt, who received his power from the devil, whoſe names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world. Rev. xiii. 4—8. From whence we may ſee the infinite importance of the obedience of faith.</p>
            <p>Which leads us,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the influence of faith upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conduct. When God called Abraham out of Chaldea, he revealed to him, that a great nation ſhould ſpring from him, who ſhould inherit the land of Canaan, out of whom ſhould come the king Meſſiah, in whom all the families of the earth ſhould
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023140_0007_0FBC7F9C6D64A6B8"/>be bleſſed. And Abraham believed in the Lord, and he accounted it to him for righteouſneſs. Yet after the promiſed child of Abraham was born, and had obtained a great ſhare in his affections, God ſaw fit to try his faith, by ſaying, Take now thy ſon, thine only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which I ſhall tell thee of. And Abraham was all obedience to the command, until God releaſed him from the execution thereof, and ſaid, Now know I that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me. Gen. xii. 3. xv. 6. xxii. 1—12. But how could Abraham believe that a great nation, and the king Meſſiah, could ſpring from that ſon, if he was ſacrificed upon the altar? Anſwer, He accounted that God was able to raiſe him up, even from the dead; from whence alſo he received him in a figure. Heb. xi. 19. Seeſt thou how faith wrought with his works. He believed that God was always to be obeyed; and that the iron gates of death could not hinder the fulfilment of his promiſes. God gave him that ſon, when he and Sarah were as good as dead; therefore nothing was too hard to do, nor any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour too great to expect, in the way of obedience. Fear and love were united in his ſoul, which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had been divided by the fall; and faith, hope and love, raiſed his heavenly mind above all the obſtacles that fleſhly reaſonings, or infernal temptations could caſt in his way. And they who are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham, and heirs according to the promiſe. Gal. iii. 7, 29. The believer views all the precepts of God to be true, and therefore to be obeyed; all his promiſes to be true, therefore he ſhall be ſupported; and he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023140_0008_0FBC7F9DB5C66738"/>views eternal things as real and near, therefore to be regarded without delay. The ſerpent deceived our mother Eve, by repreſenting the law of God as unreaſonable, and the penalty of it as falſe; and by the ſame arts, the minds of many profeſſed Chriſtians have been <hi>corrupted</hi> from the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> that is in Chriſt. 2 Cor. xi. 3. By inventing a <hi>duplicity</hi> of meanings to the holy ſcriptures, men have <hi>corrupted</hi> themſelves more than brute beaſts, who know and obey their owners. Jude 4—10. Iſai. i. 2, 3. Yea, they are two-fold more the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hell than the Jews were, who were a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vipers. Matt. xxiii. 15, 33. For the Jews have a fixed regard for the law of Moſes, and for the land of Canaan, where they yet hope for an earthly kingdom; but proſelytes to revelation, who are not born again, have no fixed rule of conduct, nor any country that can ſet any bounds to their pride and love of money, which is the root of all evil. 1 Tim. vi. 3—10. But true believers underſtand our Lord, when he ſays, He that hath my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him. John xiv. 21. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous. 1 John v. 3. We therefore come,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conſider how faith is made perfect by works. An inſpired apoſtle ſays, Whoſoever is born of God, overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 1 John v. 4. As a living child, he grows in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. 2 Peter iii .18. For the path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023140_0009_0FBC7FA0AF88EE18"/>and more unto the perfect day. Prov. iv. 18. They who have the knowledge of the truth, yet form many wrong concluſions therefrom, which are corrected and removed by exerciſe and experience. Rebekah believed that her ſon Jacob was heir to the peculiar promiſe of God to their family; but her miſtaken apprehenſions cauſed her to move Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob to deceive his father, in order to get the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as if God needed any ſuch methods to help him out with his promiſe. So far from it, that ſhe and her ſon brought themſelves into great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities thereby. And when Jacob was returning from a twenty years exile, none of his inventions could help him; therefore he ſaid, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Iſaac, the Lord who ſaidſt unto me, Return unto thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of all the truth, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant; for with my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the hand of Eſau; for I fear him, leſt he will come and ſmite me, and the mother with the children. He pleaded the promiſe of God, in the way of obedience to his precepts, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he obtained the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>A prince of the ſtrong God.</hi> Gen. xxxii. 9—28. In reference to which, Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</hi> John i. 47. And Paul ſays, In Jeſus Chriſt neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a <hi>new creature.</hi> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the <hi>Iſrael of God.</hi> Gal. vi. 15, 16. Faith carried the mind of Moſes above all the allurements of Pharaoh's court, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023140_0010_0FBC7FA7C28D9850"/>above its terrors too; though Egypt was then the richeſt, and the moſt powerful kingdom in all the world. Yet Moſes choſe to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures in Egypt; for he had reſpect unto the recompence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. By faith he forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as ſeeing him who is inviſible. Through faith he kept the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and the ſprinkling of blood, leſt he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the firſtborn, ſhould touch them. Heb. xi. 24—28. Thus by works is faith made perfect. The believer <hi>grows</hi> up to the ſtature of a <hi>perfect</hi> man in Chriſt Jeſus. Eph. iv. 13. Even ſo as to put away <hi>childiſh things.</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 10, 11. Alſo by works the perfection of faith is <hi>made manifeſt.</hi> For Peter ſaid, Let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath <hi>made</hi> that ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt. Acts ii. 36. That is, He hath <hi>declared</hi> him to be the Son of God with power. Rom. i. 4. True faith is a growing principle, and by its exerciſe the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is made known, and believers let their light ſhine before men, that they may ſee their good works, and glorify their heavenly Father. Matt. v. 16. And though all evildoers hate the light, yet they will be conſtrained to glorify God in the day of viſitation. 1 Peter ii. 12. And this view of the obedience of faith may teach us many leſſons of great importance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may teach us the unreaſonableneſs of all the objections of men, againſt the doctrine of ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign grace in Jeſus Chriſt. Many have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that the belief of free and certain ſalvation in him, makes men careleſs about their conduct in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023140_0011_0FBC7FAC00E9AC50"/>the world, and very injurious to true morality. Yea, not a few have ſaid, "If I believed that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, I would gratify my luſts as much as I pleaſed; and if I believed that my good works could not procure the fayour of God, and eternal life, I would not do them." But ſuch language may well remind us of the words of Solomon, who ſays, When he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wiſdom faileth him, and he ſaith to every one that he is a fool. Eccl. x. 3. For ſuch men ſhew plainly, that they love themſelves above God and their neighbours; and that the only reſtraint upon their luſts is fear of puniſhment, or ſome other ſelfiſh end. And therefore, under high pretences to <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> they often deal with <hi>revelation,</hi> as crafty poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians do with bills which are propoſed for laws; namely, to endeavour to ſpy faults therein, and propoſe amendments, in order that ſuch laws may be rejected at laſt. But before men even venture to <hi>ſpeak evil of the things which they know not,</hi> let them reaſon about things which they do know, according to the above principles. Let one of them come out and ſay, "I have a very loving and faithful wife; and I keep her ſo by often threatening to divorce or forſake her; and I have no way to keep her in good order, but by ever holding her in <hi>ſuſpenſe</hi> about my unſhaken love to her. I have alſo a family of obedient children, and they are kept ſo by <hi>terror,</hi> and by always hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in <hi>doubt</hi> about ever enjoying my inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance." If men could not deceive others about their ſouls, any more than ſuch reaſonings would do about their bodies and families, they could not ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's ſake, as many do. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus i. 10, 11. God ſaid, Two ſhall be one fleſh;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023140_0012_0FBC7FAD78CBAC40"/>but he that is joined unto the Lord is one ſpirit. 1 Cor. vi. 16, 17. And the believer ſays to Chriſt, Set me as a ſeal upon thine heart, as a ſeal upon thine arm; for love is ſtrong as death, jealouſy is cruel as the grave. Cant. viii. 6.— How cruel then are all teachers, who repreſent aſſurance of the eternal love of God to the ſoul, as that which would make it careleſs about obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him! God ſays, I have made a covenant with my choſen, I have ſworn unto David my ſervant.—If his children forſake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes; nevertheleſs, my loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail; my covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Pſalm lxxxix. 3, 30—34. Beloved, now are we the ſons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know, that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure. 1 John iii. 2, 3. Therefore all men who imagine that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of our being the children of God, and heirs of eternal life, is injurious to the cauſe of holineſs, or of human happineſs, have not that exerciſe of faith which he requires. And this may teach us,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſon why all ſin is included in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. For our Lord ſays, Every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God. The Comforter will reprove the world of ſin, and of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023140_0013_0FBC7FAEF9487590"/>righteouſneſs, and of judgment: of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me. John iii. 20, 21. xvi. 7—9. Jews and Gentiles are all under ſin. God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. Rom. iii. 9. xi. 32. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus; and if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe. Gal. iii. 28, 29. The covenant of circumciſion made a great difference between Jews and Greeks, bond and free, males and females; but the Goſpel removes all theſe diſtinctions, and opens a door for each ſinner to come to God through his Son; and all who do ſo are equally <hi>heirs of promiſe.</hi> Heb. vi. 17, 18. But the main of the natural children of Abraham, loved their lands, their oxen, and their wives, above the Son of God, and his Goſpel feaſt; and therefore he ſaid, None of thoſe men which were bidden, ſhall taſte of my ſupper.—So likewiſe, whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, <hi>he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> Luke xiv. 15—27, 33. But men have been ſo far from believing this truth, that multitudes have imagined that they were made diſciples of Chriſt, and heirs of the promiſes of the Goſpel, without their own knowledge or choice. And they do not now believe, that intemperance will bite like a ſerpent, and ſting like an adder; nor that uncleanneſs is like lying down in the ocean, or upon the top of a maſt. No, nor that the getting of treaſures by a lying tongue, is a vanity toſſed to and fro of them who ſeek death. Prov. xxi. 6. xxiii. 31—35. Inſtead of believing the word of truth, they bend their tongues like their bow for lies; but they are not valiant for the truth upon
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023140_0014_0FBC7FB4F533DF80"/>the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, ſaith the Lord.—They have taught their tongue to ſpeak lies, and weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to commit iniquity. Jer. ix. 3, 5. Much uſe is made of the maxim, "Of two evils chuſe the leaſt;" but how is it applied? There is the evil of <hi>ſin,</hi> and the evil of <hi>affliction;</hi> the one is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; the other affects ſelf; and how often does ſelf prevail? Wealth, health, and friendſhip, are the deareſt things in this world. Job ſpake well of God under the moſt ſurprizing loſs of the two former of theſe; but when friendſhip failed him, and rather increaſed his ſorrows, he curſed the day of his birth. And after he had wearied himſelf and others, in vindicating his character, Elihu ſaid to him, Take heed, regard not <hi>iniquity;</hi> for this haſt thou choſen rather than <hi>affliction.</hi> And God brought him to ſay, I abhor <hi>myſelf,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in duſt and aſhes. Job xxxvi. 21. xlii. 6. And they who lived by faith, choſe to endure cruel mockings, ſcourgings, impriſonment, and death, rather than accept of deliverance in any ſinful way. Heb. xi. 35—38. And from hence we may ſee,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The infinite importance of a <hi>ſeparation</hi> of the church of Chriſt from the world. He ſays, Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs? and what communion hath light with darkneſs? and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth, with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023140_0015_0FBC7FB687C85710"/>unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore theſe promiſes (dearly beloved) let us cleanſe ourſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God. 2 Cor. vi. 14—18. vii. 1. Multitudes have been deceived with the pretence, that we are only required to ſeparate from open infidels and idolators. But the Jews are more firm believers in revelation, and greater enemies to open idolatry, than any other men are, who are not born again. And the church of Rome are open idolators, and yet are as firm believers in revelation as any natural men are. It is alſo a certain fact, that putting baptiſm before a perſonal profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, and holding a ſucceſſive power in miniſters to adminiſter it, came from the church of Rome. She is the <hi>mother of harlots,</hi> and all churches who go after any <hi>lovers</hi> but Chriſt, for a temporal living, are guilty of <hi>playing the harlot.</hi> When the prieſts in Iſrael did ſo, God ſaid, As troops of <hi>robbers</hi> wait for a man, ſo the company of prieſts <hi>murder</hi> in the way by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for they commit <hi>lewdneſs.</hi> Hoſea ii. 5. vi. 9. Chriſt is the only <hi>door</hi> into his church, and all teachers who do not come in by faith in him, are <hi>thieves</hi> and <hi>robbers.</hi> John x. 1—10. Suffering is unavoidable, in this ſinful world; but the command is, Let none of you ſuffer as a <hi>murderer,</hi> or as a <hi>thief,</hi> or as an evildoer, or as a <hi>buſybody</hi> in other men's matters: Yet if any man ſuffer as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> let him not be aſhamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. 1 Peter iv. 15, 16. The word which is here tranſlated <hi>buſybody,</hi> means an <hi>overſeer,</hi> and it is ſometimes tranſlated <hi>biſhop.</hi> Therefore, after a glorious revival of religion in our land, fifty years
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023140_0016_0FBC7FB8A167F4C8"/>ago, the miniſters, both in the Maſſachuſetts and in Connecticut, took the firſt of theſe verſes to prove that it was one "of the greateſt crimes," for any miniſter to preach the Goſpel within any pariſh where another miniſter was ſettled, without his conſent. They called it, "doing the office of a <hi>biſhop</hi> in another's dioceſe."<note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy's Thoughts, 1743, p. 42, 43. Newhaven Conſociation againſt Robbins, 1748, p. 43. My hiſtory, vol. 2, p. 153, 182.</note> From whence the church of England took encouragement, that they ſhould get their religious ſcheme eſtabliſhed in America; and they purſued the <hi>bloody</hi> deſign, until they forced us into a ſeparation from them. Yet many miniſters in America, who received their power to be ſupported <hi>by force,</hi> in the name of the king of Great-Britain, hold that power over the people to this day. They have exhorted rulers and people to venture their eternal all upon the truth of Chriſtianity, while themſelves refuſe to truſt it for a worldly living. And this deceit and cruelty is made uſe of by many, to require their miniſters to go a warfare at their own charges; and if miniſters inculcate the laws of Chriſt for their ſupport, artful men will ruin their characters, if poſſible. Yea, as Chriſt was crucified between two thieves, even ſo is his cauſe now dealt with. All the villainies that have ever been acted under the name of Chriſtianity, are caſt as a reproach upon the pure laws of Chriſt; while the hypocriſy and infidelity of multitudes is recurred to, as a reaſon for continuing the uſe of force to ſupport religious miniſters. God ſays, A good name is rather to be choſen than great riches, and loving favour rather than ſilver and gold. Prov. xxii. 1. Now all the country are engaged to detect, and to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023140_0017_0FBC7FB9A79C3A70"/>hang men who rob others of ſilver or gold; while multitudes will try every deceitful art to rob all of their good name, who fear and obey God above man. And when they have robbed them of their good name, they can alſo force away their money, for the ſupport of deceitful teachers, and for other evil purpoſes. <hi>Stealing</hi> the <hi>words of God,</hi> is the worſt kind of theft. Jer. xxiii. 30. This is done by claiming the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God, without obeying his <hi>precepts.</hi> The Jews who did ſo, were guilty of <hi>ſtealing, adultery,</hi> and <hi>ſacrileges.</hi> Rom. ii. 21, 22. And how full is the world of theſe evils in our day! Multitudes claim the promiſe of God to Abraham, without doing the works of Abraham. For God ſaid, I know him, that he will command his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to <hi>do juſtice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him. Gen. xviii. 19. <hi>He will,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall,</hi> was the language of his firſt covenant with Abraham and his ſeed; and <hi>I will,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall,</hi> is the language of his ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them; and he took away the firſt that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond. Heb. viii. 10, 13. x. 9. And this may teach us,</p>
            <p n="4">4. What the ſeparation is, which believers are required to maintain. It is not any <hi>carnal diviſion</hi> among mankind. So far from it, that the word of God ſays, Recompenſe to no man evil for evil. Provide things <hi>honeſt</hi> in the ſight of all men. If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with all men. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. Mark them which <hi>cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.</hi> For they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023140_0018_0FBC7FBC34248E78"/>
               <hi>own belly;</hi> and by good words and fair ſpeeches <hi>deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> Rom. xii. 17, 18. xiii. 8. xvi. 17, 18. Their <hi>god is their belly,</hi> their glory is in their ſhame, who <hi>mind earthly things.</hi> Phil. iii. 19. Theſe be they who <hi>ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſenſual, having not the Spirit.</hi> Jude 19. <hi>Covetouſneſs is idolatry.</hi> Col. iii. 5. And when our Lord ſent his Goſpel into the wide field of the world, he knew that many would profeſs to believe in him, who would appear by their <hi>fruits</hi> to be children of the devil; and alſo, that when the ſword came into the hands of his ſervants, they would incline to uſe it, to root up ſuch tares. But he ſaid, Nay; leſt while ye gather up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harveſt. Mat. xiii. 24—30, 37—43. This he ſays of the world, while he ſays to his church, I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat.—Put away from among yourſelves that wicked perſon. 1 Cor. v. 11—13. But by <hi>confounding</hi> church and world together, which is myſtery Babylon, all theſe characters have been lawgivers and judges for the church of Chriſt. And now, <hi>truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and equity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter.</hi> And the nations are rejoicing at the proſpect of enjoying the honours and profits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without being tormented with fears of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment. Rev. xi. 7—10. But God will yet repay fury to his enemies, and recompenſe to the ISLANDS. And he ſays to the <hi>Redeemer in Zion, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023140_0019_0FBC7FBE4189C4B0"/>out of the mouth of thy ſeed's ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and forever.</hi> Iſai. lix. 14—21. And from hence an inſpired apoſtle proves, that the Jews will again be ingrafted into the church, by the word and Spirit of God, which will be <hi>life from the dead.</hi> Rom. xi. 15—27. Which ſcripture hath been often brought to prove, that the <hi>natural</hi> off-ſpring of Chriſtians are taken into the <hi>covenant of grace</hi> with them, without their own knowledge or choice; and alſo that ſouls who are truly convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may yet <hi>fall from grace</hi> received, and periſh forever. And innumerable evils have proceeded from the practice of ſetting every believer in the place of Abraham, inſtead of viewing him as an eminent type of Jeſus Chriſt, the great head of the church. For Abraham had no right to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any perſon who was not born in his houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had bought him as a <hi>ſervant</hi> with money. And his ſeed were to deſtroy all the inhabitants of Canaan, when their iniquity was <hi>full.</hi> Gen. xv. 16. xvii. 13, 14. And as Chriſtian privileges are much greater than the Jews enjoyed, the nations who have profeſſed the name of Chriſtianity, have claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a right to ſeize upon the lands of the heathen, and to deſtroy or enſlave all men, as far as they could extend their ſword. They have denied that God ever repealed his covenant with Abraham. Whereas circumciſion was the ſhedding of human <hi>blood.</hi> And after Chriſt had purchaſed his people with his own <hi>blood,</hi> he ſaid, Circumciſion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commandments of God. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the <hi>ſervants</hi> of men. 1 Cor. vii. 19, 23. Which is a full repeal of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>circumciſion,</hi> as he calls his covenant with Abraham. Acts vii. 8. Infant baptiſm never was
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023140_0020_0FBC7FBF7306E590"/>a commandment of God; but it is a wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of men, whereby they have held his church in bondage. His ſaints are his only temple here below; and becauſe the Jews rejected the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of Chriſt, God choſe their deluſions, and brought their fears upon them. Iſai. lxvi. 1—4. Acts vii. 48—53. They ſaid, If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans ſhall come and take away both our place and nation. Yet when a Roman governour would not condemn him for blaſphemy, they accuſed him of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſaid, If thou let this man go, thou art not Ceſar's friend.—We have no king but Ceſar. John xi. 48, xix. 12, 15. And Ceſar came and burnt their temple, and deſtroyed their nation, in a moſt terrible manner. They ſaid, Crucify him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him; and the Romans crucified a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Jews. The cauſe of their rage againſt Chriſt and his diſciples, was the reſtraint which light and truth laid upon their conſciences. But God ſaid, Why do the heathen rage, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagine a vain thing? the kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the rulers take counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt the Lord, and againſt his <hi>Anointed,</hi> ſaying, Let us break their <hi>bands</hi> aſunder, and caſt away their <hi>cords</hi> from us. Pſalm ii. 1—3. Upon which the diſciples lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and ſaid, Lord, thou art God which haſt made Heaven and earth, and the ſea, and all that in them is; who by the mouth of thy ſervant David haſt ſaid, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? the kings of the earth ſtood up, and the rulers were gathered together againſt the Lord, and againſt his <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For of a truth againſt thy holy child Jeſus, whom thou haſt <hi>anointed,</hi> both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023140_0021_0FBC7FC19F6CD0A8"/>with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſrael were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done. Acts iv. 24—28. Theſe things were all determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before by God, and yet were wickedly acted by men; which two things are now generally denied through the world. But let us learn,</p>
            <p n="5">5. How God is fulfilling his word, in the late events of his providence. After the Jews returned from Babylon, and began to build the temple at Jeruſalem, ſome of their old men wept, becauſe it appeared as nothing in their eyes, in compariſon with Solomon's temple. But God ſaid unto them, According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, ſo <hi>my Spirit</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with you, fear ye not: for thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the Heavens and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land; and I will ſhake all nations, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. Hag. ii. 5—7. And accordingly, the Son of God came into the ſecond temple, and taught as no man ever did before. And after he had given himſelf a ſacrifice for our ſins, he aſcended to Heaven, and gave the <hi>Holy Ghoſt and fire,</hi> whereby three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls were <hi>born in a day.</hi> And all who were thus born, in every country, <hi>As lively ſtones, were built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I pet. ii. 5. He is our only High Prieſt; and every one of his children are a holy prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who may come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. Heb. iv. 15, 16. The mercy-ſeat was placed upon the ark, in which the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023140_0022_0FBC7FC28CD2C2B8"/>law of God was kept whole. Deut. x. 5. And he ſaid, There I will meet with thee, and I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with thee from above the mercy-ſeat, from between the two cherubims, which are upon the ark of the teſtimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Iſrael. Exod. xxv. 22. Therefore after Chriſt had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to Heaven, and given the Holy Spirit to his church, the apoſtle of the Gentiles ſaid, See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven: whoſe voice then ſhook the earth; but now he hath promiſed, ſaying, Yet once more I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo Heaven. And this word, yet once more, ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things which are made, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a conſuming fire. Heb. xii. 25—29.</p>
            <p>His fire of truth and love, removed the national conſtitution of the Hebrew church, which was from Heaven, and it ſhook down all earthly kingdoms. And though the Gentiles introduced national ſchemes of religion, whereby the holy city of God hath been trodden under foot, ever ſince the beaſt aroſe out of the bottomleſs pit; yet when the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enth angel ſhall ſound his trumpet, great voices will be heard in Heaven, ſaying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign forever and ever.—And the temple of God was opened in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023140_0023_0FBC7FC6533C4160"/>Heaven, and there was ſeen in his temple the ark of his teſtament; and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. Rev. x. 7. xi. 2, 15—19. Then it will be ſeen, that the only way of <hi>mercy for ſinners,</hi> is by faith in Chriſt, in whom the two tables of the law are kept whole. For on the two command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of loving God with all our powers, and loving our neighbours as ourſelves, hang all the law and the prophets. Matt. xxii. 36—40. This is that good part, which ſhall not be taken away from any who chooſe this law of love. Luke x. 25—28, 42. It is the circumciſion of the heart, which delivers us from dogs, evil workers, and the conciſion. Rom. ii. 29. Phil. iii. 2, 3. It is the change which God requires of us, and which he hath promiſed to work in us. He ſaid to the church of Iſrael, Circumciſe the foreſkin of your heart, and be no more ſtiff-necked. And when they were ſcattered among all nations, he ſaid, The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy ſoul, that thou mayeſt live.—The word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it. Deut. x. 16. xxx. 6—14. If any man have not the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> he is none of his.—For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.—For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation.—Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful diſputations. Rom. viii. 9. x. 4, 10. xiv. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt any man ſpoil you through philoſophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023140_0024_0FBC7FC7BA04FB48"/>for in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily; and ye are <hi>complete</hi> in him, which is the HEAD of all principality and power. In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt; buried with him in baptiſm, wherein alſo you are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead. Col. ii. 8—12.</p>
            <p>Yet in the ſecond and third centuries, philoſophy and vain deceit, carried teachers into the practice of ſetting up themſelves as prieſts, in diſtinction from the brethren; and of ſetting up ſome teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers above others, under the name of biſhops; with an imagination that they could regenerate perſons by baptizing of them. And in the fourth century Conſtantine adopted this corrupt ſcheme, as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of ſtate-policy. And in writing to each biſhop, he ſtyled him, "Your holineſs." Which was ſo pleaſing to them, that one of them went and delivered a long oration in the preſence of Conſtantine, in the thirtieth year of his reign, wherein he ſaid, "His empire reſembleth the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial empire, ſo that lifting up his eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he governeth his ſubjects in this inferior em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, according to the pattern and form of the heavenly empire. For law, which is king of all, hath preſcribed a Monarchy to be a government moſt ſuitable to a prince and people. For a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy doth exceed all other kinds of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths and manners of government; for that government is various which conſiſteth in an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, or a government of men equal in riches and dignity; alſo a Democracy, or government of the people, which is oppoſed to a Monarchy, is rather a ſeditious confuſion than a government."
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023140_0025_0FBC7FC9557B9E58"/>Yet he was never baptized until near his death; and then they ſaid, "Conſtantine was the firſt of all the Emperors that was <hi>regenerated</hi> by the <hi>new birth</hi> of baptiſm, and that was ſigned with the ſign of the <hi>croſs.</hi>" And when they buried him they ſaid, "The prieſts and people, with tears and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, prayed unto God for the Emperor's ſoul."<note n="*" place="bottom">Euſebius's Life of Conſtantine; Lodon edition, 1663, p. 29, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>From whence we may ſee, that enmity againſt a free government of the people, calling miniſters prieſts, baptiſm regeneration, uſing the ſign of the croſs, and praying for the dead, were all as early as the uſe of ſecular force to ſupport Chriſtian miniſters. And by removing the ſeat of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to Conſtantinople, and dividing it among his three ſons, Conſtantine made way for the biſhop of Rome to exalt himſelf above all men upon earth, and above the God of Heaven, who can never vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate his promiſe or oath, or entice any into ſin. 2 Theſſ. ii. 3—12. And on May 4, 1493, the year after America was firſt diſcovered, the Pope gave it to the crown of Spain. And though he ſoon after received a <hi>deadly wound,</hi> by the <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> yet that deadly wound was healed. Rev. xiii. 1—5, 11—18. For the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> beaſt hath carried blood and ſlavery round the world, in gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and gallant ſhips, as far as the firſt beaſt ever did. And the two beaſts of Britain and Spain, agreed laſt fall to divide the lands and trade of the heathen, on the other ſide of the world, between them. Yet the <hi>ſpiritual tyranny,</hi> which came from Rome and England, is continued in ſeveral of the United States of America. For when the freemen of the Maſſachuſetts elected Delegates to frame a new conſtitution of government for us, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023140_0026_0FBC7FCB22B400B0"/>the majority in each corporation to force the reſt to ſupport ſuch religious teachers as they were pleaſed to chooſe. And to juſtify it, they ſaid, "As the happineſs of a people, and the good order and preſervation of civil government, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as theſe cannot be generally diffuſed through a community, but by the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and of public inſtructions in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, religion, and morality: therefore, to promote their happineſs, and to ſecure the good order and preſervation of their government, the people of this Commonwealth have a right to inveſt their legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature with power to authoriſe and require, and the legiſlature ſhall, from time to time, authoriſe and require the ſeveral towns, pariſhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ſocieties, to make ſuitable proviſion, at their own expenſe, for the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and for the maintenance of public <hi>proteſtant</hi> teachers of piety, religion, and morality, in all caſes where ſuch proviſion ſhall not be made voluntarily." But they ſet up the miniſters of <hi>congregational</hi> churches, as the only miniſters who ſhould be overſeers of the Univerſity at Cambridge. And both of theſe names were excluded from being a teſt of our civil rulers; but each of them muſt ſay, "I believe the Chriſtian religion, and have a firm perſuaſion of its truth," when he enters into his office. If Roman catholics will ſay theſe words, they may be lawgivers and judges for us about the worſhip of God. And in 1782, the doctrine of <hi>purgatory</hi> was publiſhed in Boſton. In 1783, the Preſident of the Univerſity in Connecticut ſaid to their legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "<hi>Dominion</hi> is founded in <hi>property;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides where that is, whether in the hands of the few
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023140_0027_0FBC7FCE68B9D3B8"/>or many.—The <hi>congregational</hi> and <hi>preſbyterian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, however hitherto deſpiſed, will, by the bleſſing of Heaven, continue to hold the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt figure in America; and, notwithſtanding all the fruitleſs labours and exertions to proſelyte us to other communions, become more numerous than the whole collective body of our fellow <hi>proteſtants</hi> in Europe."<note n="†" place="bottom">Election Sermon at Hartford, May 8, 1783, p. 8, 73.</note> And on March 23, 1786, the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of the Maſſachuſetts made a law, which gives each inhabitant the power of voting in town affairs, who pays two thirds more in one tax, than a poll tax. And it ſays, "That the freeholders, and other inhabitants in each reſpective town, qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified as aforeſaid, at the annual meeting, for the choice of town officers, or at any other town meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regularly warned, may grant and vote ſuch ſums of money, as they ſhall judge neceſſary for the ſettlement, maintenance and ſupport of the miniſtry, ſchools, the poor, and other neceſſary charges, ariſing within the ſame town; to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed upon the polls and property within the ſame, as by law provided."</p>
            <p>Here the majority of voters in each town are empowered to compel the reſt to ſupport ſuch teachers as they are pleaſed to chooſe, without any regard to the faith of the Goſpel. Indeed they are to be <hi>proteſtant</hi> teachers. But this name orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated in Germany, twelve years after Luther began the reformation there; and above twenty thouſand men were hired from thence, to aſſiſt the <hi>proteſtants</hi> in Britain, in their late <hi>bloody</hi> attempt to enſlave America. And the <hi>congregational</hi> name was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented at Boſton, where they hanged four perſons, an hundred and thirty years ago, for oppoſing their <hi>cruel</hi> ſcheme. And our conſtitution ſays, "No
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023140_0028_0FBC7FCF40DA4300"/>ſubordination of any one ſect or denomination to another, ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law." And the men who framed it, ſaid to the people, on March 2, 1780, "Your Delegates did not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves veſted with power to ſet up one denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians above another; for Religion muſt at all times be a matter between God and individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals." So that the above law is a violation of a foundation principle of our government, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the nature of religion. And <hi>honeſt</hi> people, in our various towns, are daily expoſed to the ſpoiling of goods or impriſonment, for refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undermine our government, and to violate their allegiance to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For he is the only <hi>lawgiver for his church;</hi> and <hi>every ſoul who will not hear him, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people.</hi> Acts iii. 22, 23. He was ſo far from giving any countenance to his church, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the work of civil rulers, that when one deſired him to ſpeak to his brother to divide the inheritance with him, Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</hi> He knew that the way to avoid the <hi>leaven of hypocriſy,</hi> was to keep the government of his church diſtinct from the world. Luke xii. 1—14. Murder and lying came from the devil. John viii. 44. And from him came the power which has been claimed, by the churches of Rome and England, to <hi>divide</hi> the lands and trade of America between them. Neither can the putting of baptiſm before a perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith in Chriſt, and ſupporting religious miniſters by the ſword of the magiſtrate, be traced up to any better ſource. The covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion yoked believers and unbelievers together in the church of Iſrael, until Chriſt came and ſhed his blood for us. But the covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023140_0029_0FBC7FD0B6210670"/>and the covenant of grace, are as diſtinct in their nature, as Hagar and Sarah were in their condition, or as Sinai and Zion are in their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The <hi>children</hi> of the firſt were <hi>born after the fleſh,</hi> while the <hi>children</hi> of the ſecond are <hi>born after the Spirit;</hi> and <hi>the promiſe</hi> is to the children of the free woman. And Paul ſays, Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the <hi>yoke of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.—A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</hi> Gal. iv. 21—31. v. 1, 9.</p>
            <p>And this country is now ſo much leavened with hypocriſy, that our wiſeſt men have excluded all religious teſts from the government of theſe Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States. And when great oppoſition was made thereto at Boſton, three years ago, a noted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational miniſter ſaid, "The great object of <hi>religion</hi> being God ſupreme, and the ſeat of religion in man being the heart or conſcience, that is, the reaſon God has given us, employed on our <hi>moral</hi> actions, in their moſt important conſequences, as related to the tribunal of God, hence I infer, that God alone is the God of the conſcience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, attempts to erect human tribunals for the conſciences of men, are <hi>impious</hi> encroachments upon the prerogatives of God." All religious teſts, impoſed by men, are againſt <hi>piety, religion,</hi> and <hi>morality.</hi> Yet the ſame miniſter had ſaid to our legiſlature, near ten years before, "Let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of religion once be broken down, as they <hi>infallibly</hi> would be by leaving the ſubject of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip to the humours of the multitude, and we might well defy all human wiſdom and power to ſupport and preſerve order and government in the ſtate." But as his <hi>infallibility</hi> has failed him, it is hoped that our civil rulers will ſoon leave the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023140_0030_0FBC7FD230FD5608"/>government of the church to the laws and Spirit of Chriſt, and not believe any teachers, who will not <hi>truſt</hi> him for a temporal living. For Jeſus ſays, <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words;</hi> and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. John xiv. 23. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God-ſpeed; for he that biddeth him God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeed, is partaker of his evil deeds. 2 John 10, 11. Faithfulneſs in miniſters and people to each other, and to avoid deceivers, are ever matters between God and individuals, as much as faith in Chriſt is for eternal ſalvation. AND LET GOD BE TRUE, BUT EVERY MAN A LIAR.</p>
