            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Novelty</hi> of <hi>Novelties</hi> examined, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Sermon now before us is certainly a paragon of the kind. Its equal, in all reſpects, has perhaps never yet appeared in any language ſince that unhappy epocha, the confuſion of tongues.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince we are by divine authority commanded to prove all things, before we venture to imbibe any of thoſe drops the author propoſes to impart, we ſhall not ſcruple to bring his water to the criterion of truth, nor make any apology for ſeriouſly trying it by the infallible ſtandard of verity, the Word of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have been taught not to believe every ſpirit. This watch-word puts us on our guard, and makes us cautious, leſt the potion offered, not flowing from the ocean of love, nor ſpringing from the fountain of life, but rather from ſome ſtygian lake, ſhould deceive us; and, inſtead of refreſhing our ſouls, or exhilerating our ſpirits, by its peſtiferous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity infect our conſtitutions, if not poiſon us to death!</p>
            <p>UPON peruſal, this diſcourſe is found to be a compoſition of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Divinity.</hi> There are alſo a few ſketches of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Logic</hi> intermixed. The whole being embelliſhed with many ſublime phraſes, and inforced with the ſtrongeſt expreſſions of <hi>aſſurance.</hi> It is the two principal parts that ſhall be now taken into conſideration.</p>
            <p>AFTER a ſhort introduction, and brief elucidation of the general plan, we are preſented with a conciſe hiſtory of the old creation. The narration is truly curious; and the project not a little amuſing. Every page reflects the author in a ſtrong light, and ſhews him to be a perſon of extraordinary invention. But, yet, alas! there is one material blemiſh,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017740_0004_0FA26A09520772B0"/>
which, as a muddy ſtream, runs quite through his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. This ſingle flaw, like a dead fly, corrupts the whole box of ointment, and cauſes it to emit a nauſeous ſavour. The misfortune is, it does not in ſeveral particulars at all accord with the three firſt chapters of Geneſis. So that it is plain either the ancient Prophet, or the modern Preacher, erred in viſion, and ſtumbled in judgment, when deſcribing this ſtupendous production of Almighty Power.</p>
            <p>MOSES, indeed, gives us no account of either the creation or fall of angels. Nor has any other inſpired writer left a word on record relating to their formation. But Mr. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter has ſupplied this defect. He ſays, <q>they were created out of nature, which was at firſt pure, tranſparent, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, ſubſtantiality,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THIS, ſurely, is a late revelation, and newly come out of the mint. But whether it may be allowed to paſs as current coin, or ought to be condemned as a counterfeit, ſhall be left to more ſkilful judges to determine. However, this may be affirmed, it needs an expoſitor of profound erudition, being much harder to underſtand than the darkeſt viſion or moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe myſtery contained even in the apocalypſe of St. John. But let us attend to the event.</p>
            <p>WE are told in the ſame page, <q>That one of theſe angels, <hi>Lucifer</hi> by name, ſeeking to enter into the firſt properties of life, &amp;c. fell, with all his legions (who in number were one third of the celeſtial hoſt) into the dark center of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And thus we account for the earth being without form, and void, and darkneſs covering the deep.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now MOSES ſeems to intimate, that this formleſs maſs was the original ſubſtance of the afterward viſible world. That the ſucceeding operations of Omnipotence were only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this primogenious matter into juſt order and regularity. And that, after this work was compleated, Infinite Wiſdom, paſſing his verdict upon the whole amazing ſyſtem, pronounced it good, yea, very good. But, if theſe apoſtate ſpirits had gained ſo early a poſſeſſion of nature, while as yet it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a rude and indigeſted chaos, it ſeems ſtrange that any good ſhould ever come out of ſuch a Nazareth! An Apoſtle aſſures us, that the rebel angels were caſt down to hell. And according to our author, this horrible pit was nothing elſe but
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017740_0005_0FA26A0964C807E8"/>
the dark center of nature. If ſo, we might have expected to hear that the world, and all it contained, was bad, yea, very bad, from its firſt appearance, ſeeing it was made out of ſuch infernal particles, ſuch luciferized ingredients. Upon this hypotheſis, he might have ſpared all his labour to prove a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral redemption from hell. For, in reality, there neither is now, nor ever was ſuch a place ſince man was brought into exiſtence. No! no! The diſmal tartarean priſon was illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated on the firſt day of the creation, and by the ſeventh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally demoliſhed; or rather turned into a ſplendid and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent palace. How much to be regretted is it, that thoſe malicious troubleſome ſpirits were not converted at the ſame time! eſpecially as it is to be their happy lot at laſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Wincheſter's doctrine! For 'tis plain they have not only entered into our world ſince it was firſt made, but into the very hearts of all its inhabitants; and are evidently, this day, driving multitudes of them, like the ſwine in the goſpel, down the ſteep and ſlippery declivities of vanity and deluſion, into the great ſea of eternal wrath, into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs gulf of everlaſting perdition! And they are likely,—likely did I ſay? nay, without repentance, they will aſſuredly periſh in the great waters! But as this world, and all its inhabitants, were created without fault, and made perfect in their ſeveral kinds, we are fully perſuaded that Satan had no poſſeſſion of nor dominion over any of them, until he had ſeduced our <hi>Firſt Parents</hi> into diſobedience, and brought them into the ſame condemnation with himſelf.</p>
            <p>IN the book of Geneſis we are informed, that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Paradiſe was ſituated in and extended no farther than one particular ſpot, viz. the eaſt of Eden. But in the <hi>Sermon</hi> we are certified, that this Paradiſe covered <q>the whole earth; hid the curſe, which was already broke out in it; and brought forth its proper fruit. But while the good and evil were at ſtrife, the <hi>Divine Artificer</hi> joining his power to the firſt property of the deſire, it became an Almighty <hi>Fiat,</hi> which prevented any more wrath and darkneſs to be introduced into nature. And to effect this benign and ſalutary tranſmutation, <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> brooding on the face of the deep, baptiſed the ſame with <hi>light</hi>; that the heavenly properties might be awakened, or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017740_0006_0FA26A0A46F232C0"/>IT ſeems, by this account, the whole creation (the inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate parts not excepted) was conceived in iniquity, born in ſin, and under a horrible malediction from the very womb! So that there was a neceſſity of dipping it into ſome ocean of light (for no river would be ſufficient) that by this celeſtial immerſion it might be waſhed of its native filth, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from its original pollution. And which is yet more, that the Angels might be prevented for the future from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing any more <hi>wrath</hi> or <hi>darkneſs</hi> into nature.</p>
            <p>How well would it be for the chriſtian world, if their water-baptiſm had ſuch beneficial effects on the ſubjects of that holy ordinance! But it is not, alas! it is not ſo. Yet, if Moſes may be depended on, this deſign proved abortive, and was ſoon fruſtrated. For Adam and Eve were not yet formed. And after this the ſerpent prevailed with them to eat the forbidden fruit, and thereby introduced, if poſſible, a ſtill greater cloud of wrath and darkneſs into nature. For hereupon we find them both turned out of the happy <hi>garden,</hi> and the very ground curſed for their ſakes. Nor has it to this day been delivered from that bondage of corruption in which it was then involved.</p>
            <p>So that this is altogether a very gloomy repreſentation of the affair. But what the author means by theſe phraſes, viz. The firſt property of the deſire; This congealing the whole into ſolid bodies, &amp;c. is a midnight ſhade too thick for my penetration. 'Tis all palpable obſcurity! groſs darkneſs, without a ray of light! Such unintelligible jargon may ſerve to amuſe the vulgar, and ſet the populace a ſtaring, who are moſtly fond of what they cannot underſtand, but can afford no ſatisfaction to people of diſcernment.</p>
            <p>MOSES tells us, in his plain way, That <hi>God</hi> formed man out of the <hi>duſt,</hi> and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life. By this account we naturally conclude, that the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real part of the human frame was produced out of the earth, and the ſoul immediately created out of no pre-exiſtent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by the <hi>divine afflation</hi> infuſed and united to the body. But Mr. Wincheſter ſays, <q>the whole man was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the three principles, viz. <hi>fire, water,</hi> and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple called the third, viz. of this lower world, or nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT what this third principle was we are not told. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017740_0007_0FA26A0ADD219C70"/>
it was ſome occult and nameleſs element! Nor is it eaſy to conjecture what it might be, unleſs it was that ſtrange, complex ghoſt, the <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi> which Lucifer had irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and ſtirred up in nature. But if ſo, ſurely man was not created in the image of <hi>God,</hi> but rather in the image of the Devil. No wonder then that he ſo readily hearkened to that degraded ſeraphim.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the ſacred hiſtory, we uſed to conceive that Adam was no more than a man when firſt brought into being. That he was in a ſolitary ſtate. And that the woman was formed ſome time afterwards. And that to this end <hi>God</hi> cauſed a deep ſleep to fall upon Adam, during which he took a rib out of his body, of which he made a creature of ſomewhat different ſhape and quality, who was appointed to be the future companion of his life. But in the <hi>Sermon</hi> we are given to underſtand, that Adam was primarily of the commune of two genders: that is, he was <q>both male and female at once.</q> 
               <hi>Monſtrum horrendum!</hi> What an odd idea of our venerable progenitor does this deſcription convey! *******! Mr. Wincheſter tells us, <q>that Adam was lulled aſleep by the power of luſt, which ſhews his defection was begun, to prevent the completion of which, <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the woman from him.</q> But Moſes ſhews us very clearly that Eve began to luſt in the firſt place, and at the ſerpent's inſtigation ſwallowed the interdicted <hi>bait</hi>; and then allured her huſband into the ſame tranſgreſſion. Whereas, agreeable to the Sermon, Adam fell a luſting, and was led aſtray by the force of inherent concupiſcence, before the woman had any apparent exiſtence; unleſs he will ſay the female luſted in him before her ſeparation, which would not be good logic, except ſhe was that third principle of which he ſo often ſpeaks, and to which he attributes ſome unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable wonders.</p>
            <p>THE forbidden tree, by the ſcripture, appears to have been planted at the ſame time with the reſt, and to have been placed in the midſt of the famous garden. But the Sermon might induce us to ſuppoſe, that it ſprung up by ſome ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous power of vegetation. Where this pernicious tree ſtood is not told us; but it looks as if it germinated in Adam's fleſh, and budded, and flowered, and fructified, and brought forth its mortiferous fruit in the man's own breaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017740_0008_0FA26A0BB3A659E0"/>IF that was the caſe, pray how came the woman to have acceſs to its fatal branches? How came ſhe to behold the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? For it ſeems they were pleaſant to her eyes. This is, perhaps, an harder queſtion than any the Queen of Sheba propoſed to King Solomon, when ſhe paid him that celebrated viſit. Though the royal Philoſopher readily anſwered all the queries ſhe offered, yet in my opinion this one would have brought him to his <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> notwithſtanding his peerleſs wiſdom and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>THE inſpired writer mentions no conſort that Adam ever had, but one, and calls them, the man and his wife. But our author certifies, that he was firſt <q>joined to the pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of <hi>divine wiſdom,</hi> who was the wife of his youth.</q> In purſuance of this, our mother Eve muſt have been his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond bride. What pity it is, that he has not completed this part of his hiſtory! Why has he not told us what number of children Adam had by this miraculous woman? How many of each ſex were born to them, as pledges of their conjugal endearment? And what became of the whole progeny at laſt? &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. For it is likely they all died, or were ſome how extinct, before Moſes wrote the book of Geneſis. And perhaps he never heard that there had been ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sed pudet hoec opprobria!</hi> I grow weary of animadverting on ſuch myſtick whimſies. Great part of his hiſtory is quite fabulous; and ſome of it perfect puerility. It puts me in mind of Ovid's Metamorphoſes; though the mythology of the Pagan Poet is much more rational than that of this Chriſtian Preacher. Such enthuſiaſtic reveries, ſuch prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blunders, and miſconſtructions, and abſurdities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, are too tedious for patience itſelf to dwell upon. Indeed, they expoſe themſelves; and to an intelligent reader require no confutation. We ſhall therefore diſmiſs the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical; and proceed to conſider the doctrinal part of this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>UPON inſpection, we find the latter affords no better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment than the former. The author's ſcheme of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity differs as far fron the goſpel of Chriſt, as his account of the creation does from the hiſtory of Moſes.</p>
            <p>THE profeſſed ſcope of our author is, to prove an univerſal
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017740_0009_0FA26A0C54DE6458"/>
redemption, or the final reſtoration of all things. So that not only the whole human race, but even the fallen angels likewiſe (though he did not think proper to aſſert it, perhaps out of modeſty) ſhall, after certain revolutions of time, be fully manumitted from their infernal confinement, and be enfranchiſed into all the immunities of the bleſſed. This is his moſt delightful theme. This the minion of his affection. This the favourite, the darling, on which he doats. But how he defends it ſhall be our preſent enquiry.</p>
            <p>IN the ſermon it is obſerved, that <q>the glorious <hi>Deity</hi> can have but one will toward all his creatures, which always continues the ſame, and alters not through the fall of any of them.</q> But the goſpel very poſitively aſſerts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Therein we are aſſured, that it is not the will of God that ſome perſons ſhould periſh in any ſenſe of the word, and that he is willing to make his power known in the deſtruction of others.</p>
            <p>That there is, that there can be but one power of volition in the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> is readily granted; but that this power cannot, or that it does not act variouſly, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral objects with whom it is concerned, is utterly denied. For was that the caſe, all rational creatures muſt of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be equally happy, or equally miſerable, both during time and throughout eternity. But we daily ſee a very wide difference in the circumſtances of nations and countries, and families, as well as of individuals in this world. And we are abundantly certified in the goſpel, that their ſtations hereafter, according to their ſeveral characters, will vary juſt as much as the joys of <hi>Heaven</hi> and the torments of <hi>Hell</hi> are contrary one to the other. The bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> without any doubt, wills the felicity of <hi>all</hi> men, on condition of their perſevering obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his injunctions, and conſtant compliance with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He will aſſuredly reward his faithful ſervants with peculiar tokens of his approbation, and he will as certainly make all irreclaimable offenders ſenſible of his diſpleaſure, by puniſhing them in a juſt proportion to the ſeveral aggravations of their crimes. The ſame munificent hand that imparts a royal diadem to one perſon, may ſmite another to death. This ſimilitude is pregnant to the purpoſe, and needs no illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Nor do theſe diſcriminating acts of retribution
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017740_0010_0FA26A0F20447B98"/>
cauſe the lead variation in the righteous <hi>Judge.</hi> No, he is the very ſame ſtill, without any ſhadow of turning. The change is only in his creatures. Their perdition is not of <hi>God.</hi> Their rueful cataſtrophe is the effect of their wilful rebellion. Their eternal damnation is their own voluntary option, and the juſt wages of their conduct. So that this aſſertion of Mr. Wincheſter's is either nothing to his purpoſe, or elſe a very dangerous miſtake. If he means that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will,</hi> conſidered as an attribute, is but one, it can have no relation to his doctrine, and is no more to his purpoſe, than if he had emphatically declared <hi>there is but one God.</hi>— But if he means that this <hi>Will</hi> does never act in a different manner, as aforeſaid, it contradicts the whole tenor of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and is as oppoſite to the goſpel revelation, as the moſt arrant falſhood is to the plaineſt truth that was ever publiſhed to the world.</p>
            <p>WE are told in the ſame page, That <q>
                  <hi>fury, wrath,</hi> or <hi>anger,</hi> can never dwell in the fountain of <hi>love.</hi>
               </q>—Yet every one that reads the holy Scriptures muſt ſurely know, that all theſe are very frequently attributed to the <hi>Supreme Being.</hi> We find him threatening the wicked, if they repent not, that his <hi>fury</hi> ſhall come upon them as an unquenchable <hi>fire</hi>; that his anger is poured out as an overwhelming inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, we are often aſſured; and that his wrath is revealed from heaven againſt all the ungodly without diſtinction, is a ſolemn declaration recorded in the <hi>goſpel</hi> itſelf. But what ſignifies quoting particular paſſages in confirmation of this point. It ſhines conſpicuouſly through the whole book, and to prove it is as unneceſſary, as lighting a taper to ſhew the ſun at noon-day. It is true, fury in <hi>God</hi> is not a turbulent paſſion, as it is in fallen creatures, and is only aſcribed to him by a figure. Yet it ſhews us, that he will deal with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible ſinners as the moſt choleric and incenſed Potentate would with the vileſt of traitors; <hi>i. e.</hi> condemn them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law, and order their execution without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence or mitigation of the ſentence. The anger of the Almighty is no anxious commotion or perturbation of mind. No! It is nothing but the ſedate, deliberate, undiſturbed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his <hi>Word.</hi> Is it therefore the leſs to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Not at all. Nay, this renders it infinitely more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017740_0011_0FA26A1094982010"/>
than the united reſentment of all creatures together! The wrath of <hi>God,</hi> being the cool, diſpaſſionate performance of his immutable decrees, is unutterably fearful! is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably terrible! and to deny that fury, in any ſenſe, dwells in the <hi>Deity,</hi> is a contradiction to his revealed will, and a diſhonour to his <hi>holy name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WAS ſome favourite Miniſter of State not only to proclaim it with his tongue, but publiſh in print, that his royal maſter was of ſo tender a complexion, and ſo eminent for clemency, that it was impoſſible to provoke him to wrath, or to rouſe his indignation, inſomuch that the moſt inſolent and flagitious malefactor had nothing to fear from him: His ſubjects might renounce their allegiance, take up the arms of rebellion, and even attempt to dethrone their lawful Sovereign, and yet not as much as doubt of eſcaping with impunity. For he never did, nor ever would condemn any man to death, however criminal his deportment might be. Who ſees not that every perſon endued with common ſenſe muſt either believe this to be a falſe aſperſion caſt upon the King, a lying report invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve ſome ſiniſter end of this haughty and malignant Courtier, or that the Monarch was altogether unfit to fill a throne, and ſhamefully unqualified to ſway the ſceptre of Majeſty? The application is eaſy. Mr. Wincheſter calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and profeſſes to be an Ambaſſador of <hi>God.</hi> But he has ſent his Sermon abroad, in which he aſſures every reader, that in the <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>love</hi> is neither <hi>fury,</hi> or <hi>wrath,</hi> or <hi>anger,</hi> for him to fear. And what is the native tendency of ſuch a doctrine? Is it not directly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to lull wretched mortals into the deepeſt ſlumbers of carnal ſecurity? To make them believe that God has little or no regard for the honor of his government, and will never ariſe to aſſert his dominion, vindicate the equity of his law, or maintain his own authority? Inſtead of a curb to reſtrain their vicious propenſities, will it not ſerve as a ſharp pointed ſpur, exciting them to run precipitately, and without controul, into all the crooked paths of licentiouſneſs? To encourage obdurate wretches, like thoſe complained of by the Prophet, <q>to turn (notwithſtanding all amicable and compaſſionate attempts to reclaim them) every one to his own way, as the horſe ruſhes into the battle?</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017740_0012_0FA26A11A57D9860"/>THE <hi>deity,</hi> if we will believe his goſpel, claims the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and even glories in the right of recompence: <q>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine; I will repay, ſaith the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </q> And St. Paul tells us, that <q>knowing the terror of the <hi>Lord,</hi> both he and his brethren perſuaded men.</q> But Mr. Wincheſter, it ſeems, knows of no ſuch thing. Nay, he poſitively declares, and aſſerts it without the leaſt heſitation or circumlocution, that neither <hi>fury,</hi> or <hi>wrath,</hi> or <hi>anger,</hi> can dwell in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>love.</hi> Upon this plan, men may gratify all their ſenſual inclinations, run into the wildeſt exceſs of riot, and perpetrate the moſt heinous enormities, without the leaſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being ever called to an account for their miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. For if the caſe be ſo, 'tis needleſs to prove a general redemption from hell. No, certainly! there never was, nor ever will be a ſingle perſon doomed either to that or any other puniſhment at all. If this is not depriving mankind of the ſtrongeſt barrier againſt vice, and removing one of the moſt cogent motives to religion and virtue, then ſome poor chriſtians are incapable of diſcerning between black and white. This is goſpel indeed! <hi>good news</hi> with a witneſs! Was this brilliant notion univerſally embraced, what ſhocking effects may we not ſuppoſe would naturally follow thereupon? As corrupt as our world is at preſent, 'tis doubtleſs a heaven, in compariſon of what it would ſoon become! What depravity of manners! What deteſtable villainies, would quickly burſt out from this invenomed ſource of every abomination! In a word, the old proverb is by experience ſtill found to be a true one: All that glitters is not gold. This ſparkling piece of ore, when weighed in the ſacred ballances, proves abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly too light for our reception. Neither will it bear the touchſtone of <hi>truth.</hi> It is therefore deſervedly rejected.</p>
            <p>CONCERNING Adam's probation, we are notified, <q>that his trial was not arbitrarily impoſed upon him by <hi>God,</hi> neither was the tree of knowledge planted in the garden on purpoſe to tempt him, as is commonly ſuppoſed.</q> But if ſo, may it not be enquired, what this ſtrange <hi>tree</hi> was planted at all for? What purpoſe could it anſwer? Adam, we read, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not to eat of it on pain of <hi>death.</hi> And pray what could be the deſign of this prohibition, unleſs it was to tempt him, or to try his obedience, which is but the ſame thing? The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017740_0013_0FA26A1259D44630"/>
allows that Adam was in a ſtate of trial. But what was there to try him by, if this tree be excluded from that deſign? We read of no other injunction laid upon him, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual abſtinence from the fruit thereof. It follows, therefore, that it was appointed for no other end but to tempt, or prove, or try him, call it which you will. And it is alſo manifeſt that his trial was impoſed upon him arbitrarily by <hi>God,</hi> or as an abſolute Sovereign, who is reſponſible to none of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor under any obligation to give an account of his matters to men or angels. <q>He doth according to his will, in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>GOD indeed tempts none of us to evil: Yet he may, and often does do ſo for our good. It would have been infinitely to the advantage of our firſt parents, had they ſuffered this temptation without erring as they did. They would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in due time, have been confirmed in their original recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. They would very probably have received ſignal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, ſome peculiar evidences of their Maker's regard. But we may be ſure they would have had the raviſhing conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tranſmitting righteouſneſs, and purity, and life, and conſummate felicity to all their yet unborn poſterity. So that it was evidently an act of perfect goodneſs, and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour in <hi>God,</hi> to vouchſafe them ſuch a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of advancing their own happineſs, and that of their offspring to all ſucceeding generations. To be brief This poſition of Mr. Wincheſter's cannot be found in the catalogue of orthodox doctrines. It does not harmonize with divine revelation. It does not at all correſpond with the goſpel of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therein we are aſſured, that it was by one man's diſobedience many, <hi>i. e.</hi> all his poſterity, were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And who was this man but Adam? He was conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our federal head, or repreſentative in the firſt covenant. And as he broke it, his ſin is very juſtly imputed unto us. So that in Adam all die. But we are told of no ſin he committed ſave only this one, his eating the forbidden fruit. Which proves to a demonſtration, that the aforeſaid <hi>tree</hi> was actually planted in the garden to tempt, or try him, as was already obſerved. What his deſign, in denying the arbitrary impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Adam's trial, is difficult to conceive; unleſs this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017740_0014_0FA26A1322B07E40"/>
was contrived to batter down the precious doctrine of <hi>God</hi>'s ſupreme Sovereignty. For Adam, ſurely, might have been tried with a flower, or herb, or any other tree, had it been the good pleaſure of his Maker to have ordered it ſo. The Council of the moſt high ſhall ſtand, whatever cavils wretched mortals may raiſe againſt him, or his diſpenſations. But according to this Sermon, Adam was tried, and yet not tried. He was tempted, and not tempted. He fell, yet there was nothing to hold him up, nor any thing to throw him down. Neither good nor evil ſpirit had the leaſt hand in the tragedy. Into what monſtrous inconſiſtencies! into what ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid rhapſodies will men run, when once they begin to ſwerve from the truth, and are turned unto <hi>Fables</hi>!</p>
            <p>THE author affirms, that the <q>promiſe in his text was no ſooner revealed to the parents of mankind, but it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately took effect. The ſeed of the woman was inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly planted in their breaſts as a ſpark of the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> from which moment <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s incarnation and man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration was begun. That the ſame <hi>ſeed</hi> is derived unto and dwells in all their poſterity, as an <hi>inſpoken ſeed</hi> of the woman. And that it is of this immortal <hi>ſeed</hi> that we muſt be born again, in order to our entering the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. That this promiſe took a ſalutary effect on both Adam and Eve, ſome time after its promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is indeed commonly ſuppoſed. Yet 'tis at moſt but a probable conjecture. It is not in any man's power to prove that it did ſo. How then could he aſſert it with ſuch a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophory of aſſurance? But it ſeems Mr. <hi>Wincheſter</hi> thought ſo, and his opinion is ſufficient authority to ratify and eſtabliſh any article whatever.</p>
            <p>BUT that this divine <hi>ſeed</hi> is propagated by ordinary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to all, or to any of their poſterity, doth not yet appear. Nay, it is as contrary to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the rotund apex of a muſhroom is to the blooming foliage of a tulip. The Apoſtle aſſures us, that in human fleſh, as far as unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, there "dwells no good thing." That while uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, all men are without <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And that not <hi>Chriſt</hi> but <hi>Satan,</hi> works in the children of diſobedience, &amp;c. Now how this can be conſonant to the inherency of that feed, which he declares is really <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the reader is left to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017740_0015_0FA26A1430C92E78"/>IN confirmation of this ſtrange doctrine, Mr. <hi>Wincheſter</hi> quotes two texts of Scripture, viz. St. John, i. 9. and I. John, iv. 3. As to the firſt of theſe citations, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt's deſign in that whole chapter was to prove our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Divinity,</hi> which was even then ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by one <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and his followers, who maintained that he was no more than a meer man. And this he does by many nervous and irrefragable arguments, among which this is not the leaſt, that our <hi>Lord</hi> was in reality no leſs a <hi>perſon</hi> than the <hi>Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophoos,</hi> or true <hi>Light,</hi> which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. That is, he is the <hi>Creator</hi> as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of mankind. The almighty <hi>author</hi> of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reaſon, and conſcicence, and every other faculty that human nature is endowed with, and by which we are dignified, and diſtinguiſhed from the beaſts of the field, &amp;c. Although he is the <hi>light</hi> only of the <hi>regenerate,</hi> by ſpiritual illumination.</p>
            <p>As to the other text, the Apoſtle is evidently proving our <hi>Lord</hi>'s humanity againſt one <hi>Cerdon</hi> and his adherents, who denied his <hi>humanity:</hi> Contending that he only appeared in the ſhape of a man, and aſſumed but the ſhadow of a body. Wherefore St. John declares that ſuch teachers, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s actual incarnation, or real aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our nature, were not of <hi>God, i. e.</hi> were not ſent by his authority to preach the <hi>goſpel,</hi> but were in truth the inſtruments of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Theſe ſcriptures, therefore, are no more to his purpoſe, than if he had quoted the two firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the firſt book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> to prove that <hi>George</hi> the third was or is the rightful King of <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Japan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT our Lord comes into the ſouls of all true believers, and dwells in their hearts by his ſpirit, is very readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He is in them the hope of <hi>glory.</hi> But that he is even in their fleſh, ſo that it may be called his incarnation, is utterly diſowned. How much leſs is he in all mankind in that, or any other proper acceptation of the word! For were it ſo, there would be juſt as many incarnate <hi>Deities</hi> as there ever were or ſhall be men and women in the world. Shocking! to avow that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is incarnatively dwelling in every diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute profligate, in every abandoned reprobate! what epithet does this deſerve! what appellation ſhall be given it! name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs may it remain!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:017740_0016_0FA26A1493DFEFB8"/>BUT, he ſays, <q>Chriſt called the Phariſees to behold that the Kingdom of <hi>God</hi> was within them: Luke xvii. 20. and if in them, who are elſwhere called Serpents, &amp;c. &amp;c. then certainly in all mankind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is true, the queſtion that occaſioned this diſcourſe was propoſed by the Phariſees. But that our Lord directed his anſwer to them is not ſo certain.—It ſeems more likely that our Saviour, turning or pointing to his Diſciples, addreſſed this inſtruction unto them, in whom, no doubt, his kingdom of grace was erected.—Or if he ſpoke to thoſe wicked men, he could mean no more than that their long expected Meſſiah was really come, being no other but himſelf, who was now in their country, and preſent among them, cauſing the joyful ſound of his goſpel, that melody of Zion, to ring in their ears. So that it was in vain to look any farther, for ſalvation was not to be found in any other. And that our <hi>Lord</hi> could not intend to intimate that either the grace, or ſpirit, or ſeed of <hi>God,</hi> was in them, is evident. For at another time, he told the ſame kind of people, and perhaps the ſame perſons, I know you, that you have not the love of <hi>God</hi> in you. But according to this author, not only the love of <hi>God,</hi> but he himſelf was in theſe whited ſepulchres, theſe deteſtable hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, though they were daily plotting his death, and hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thirſting for his blood. They were, as <hi>Jeſus</hi> well knew, implacable enemies both to truth and virtue. And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them entirely evil, for he very clearly ſaw through the diſguiſe, and plainly perceived that they covered their hatred with lying lips. While they pretended to the higheſt degree of ſanctity, the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> eſteemed them the worſt of men, and the vileſt of ſinners. And yet, according to our <hi>ſermon,</hi> he declared they had in them the ſeed of all good. He muſt be a connoiſſeur in the rules of <hi>logic,</hi> who can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe things to <hi>reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this head, we are preſented with the peculiar character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> true miniſters. They take him for their only pattern, and make his ſermons the ſole model of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <q>He directed man to the ſeed of the woman, which is within, and ſo do they. But all <hi>deceivers</hi> take another way, &amp;c.</q> Yet we do not find that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever once mentioned ſuch a direction in the whole courſe of his miniſtry. Read
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017740_0017_0FA26A1847AF3190"/>
the hiſtory of his life and death. He never as much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this ſeed, nor ſpeaks a ſingle word about it, in any of his ſermons, or parables, or private diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>NOR did his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> at any time give this direction to their hearers or readers. There is not in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> one expreſſion that can be conſtrued to that import, without a manifeſt perverſion of the ſacred text. The conſtant ſcope of the inſpired writers, inſtead of directing men to ſomething within them, is to urge them to a ſpeedy renunciation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a believing application to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who now ſitteth on the right hand of <hi>God,</hi> not in their hearts, but in the higheſt Heaven. The effrontery of this man muſt be great indeed, when he ſo raſhly condemns the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and at leaſt a great majority of their faithful ſucceſſors, as a malignant junto of <hi>impoſtors</hi> and <hi>deceivers</hi> of mankind. Certainly he was not in the ſpirit of meekneſs, as he pretends elſewhere, when he ſhot this random dart, when he hurl'd this ſurly, malapert, virulent invective againſt the generation of the <hi>Righteous.</hi> But <hi>(aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus)</hi> it is a rare ſteed that never ſtumbles. However, we ſhall claim the <hi>liberty</hi> of judging for ourſelves; and profeſs to believe there have been and ſtill are a goodly number of miniſters, and of different denominations too, who will be accepted at the <hi>laſt day,</hi> as faithful ſervants of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſincere <hi>lovers</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, though they never as much as thought of directing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this <hi>inſpoken ſeed,</hi> of which we can find no account in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which, bleſſed be <hi>God!</hi> are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, though ELHANAN WINCHEST, had never exiſted.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>divine ſeed,</hi> we are informed, <q>is the only beginning and poſſibility of a new life. Unleſs the means of <hi>grace</hi> can reach that <hi>hidden ſpark,</hi> they can do us no good, any more than the ſun, &amp;c. could cauſe a flint to vegetate. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can riſe up but according to the poſſibilities of <hi>nature. Nay, God</hi> himſelf could not raiſe us up in an arbitrary manner, without this <hi>ſeed</hi> to work upon, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. <hi>There</hi> is nothing arbitrary: All is natural throughout the whole proceſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF the caſe be ſo, 'tis a little ſtrange how our <hi>firſt parents</hi> came to be raiſed? 'Tis plain this <hi>ſeed</hi> could not be ſown in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017740_0018_0FA26A18597D5C30"/>
them till at leaſt ſome time after their fall. And why may it not be diſſeminated in the hearts of their children at any age, though it was not born with them? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? Our regeneration in Scripture is called a <hi>new creature</hi>; or, as it may be rendered, a <hi>new creation.</hi> Now to create, every body muſt know, is a producing ſome ſubſtance out of no pre-exiſtent matter; or making ſome being out of nothing. But agreeable to this sermon, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is but blowing the hidden ſpark into a flame, or raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latent ſeed to a ſtalk, which is but a reſurrection at moſt; nor can it be called a creation in any ſenſe whatever, When <hi>God Almighty</hi> bleſſes men with his ſaving grace, he puts his ſpirit within them, which was not there before. And the ſame Agent puts his laws of faith and love into their hearts, to both which, in their natural eſtate, they are all of them without exception utter ſtrangers. St. Paul, when delineating that great change, gives us this beautiful deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: <hi>God,</hi> who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts, to <hi>give</hi> the light of the knowledge of the glory of <hi>God,</hi> in the face of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE the Apoſtle evidently alludes to the firſt creation. The primitive chaos was covered with total darkneſs until <hi>God</hi> ſaid let there be light. So is the heart of every man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is not only a dark region, but darkneſs itſelf. Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the abſtract. And thus it remains until the <hi>new cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> commences. Then the ſame irreſiſtible <hi>power,</hi> that gave light to the natural world, beſtows it alſo on the ſpiritual world, the before abſolutely blind, dark and ignorant ſoul of man. A glorious ray from the <hi>Sun</hi> of righteouſneſs enters the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and with amazing effulgence irradiates the mind: Even as the terraqueous globe was illuminated in a moment, when the divine fiat was uttered. Truly, the earth in its original form was an apt emblem of our native depravity, and the light which was immediately communicated is a lively image of God's grace freely imparted, and which alone effects our <hi>new birth</hi> and converſion. Was there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing arbitrary in the firſt creation? Did this material world ſpring up only according to the poſſibilities of nature? Did it, with all its ſtupendous phoenomena, ariſe as a ſtalk out
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017740_0019_0FA26A19979CE048"/>
of ſome pre-exiſtent ſeed? No ſurely! Unleſs we hold that the ſubſtance of all viable things was from eternity, as it is reported the old Peripatetic Philoſophers really did. Neither does the new creation proceed from any principle hid in a man's breaſt before, but is produced out of nothing, juſt as the old creation was. Therefore the ſermon, in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar alſo, differs very widely from the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The author, in the mean while, gives us to know the cauſe why all are not regenerated. And this he illuſtrates by an elegant ſimilitude: <q>If the ſeed is covered with ſtones, or rocks, or mountains, the ſun cannot reach it: Even ſo, all are not brought to the divine life, becauſe of the oppoſitions made to it, and obſtructions that hinder it.</q> But does not Mr. Wincheſter know, that there is a very great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between corporeal and ſpiritual things? Though we take compariſons from the former to aſſiſt our conceptions, yet we never expert them fully to repreſent the latter; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their vaſtly ſuperior excellency. It is true, the great ruler of the day cannot pierce through rocks, &amp;c. to quicken the grain that is concealed beneath them: But is almighty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as impotent as the creature he has made? Can <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> operate with no more energy than a lifeleſs luminary, all whoſe ſplendours were kindled with his breath? Is he not able to raiſe up children unto Abraham out of the ſtones? Are not the rocks thrown down by him? And do not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual hills bow, and the everlaſting mountains melt at his touch, and flow down at his preſence? God can overcome all oppoſition, and remove every obſtruction juſt when he pleaſes; for he worketh all things according to the counſel of his <hi>own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is true, men can and always do withſtand this good work. And it is certain that ſome of them have reſiſted the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſo wilfully, and ſo long, till <hi>God</hi> has given them up as incurable patients, and ſworn in his wrath ye ſhall not enter into my reſt. Theſe are ſmitten with judicial blindneſs, and their converſion becomes impoſſible, as the ſcriptures clearly teſtify; and that becauſe it is inconſiſtent with the truth of <hi>God</hi> to give them his ſaving grace afterwards. Therefore, where people were quite hardened in unbelief, our Lord could not do many mighty works as man, becauſe he had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017740_0020_0FA26A19D9B74080"/>
to heal ſuch obſtinate deſpiſers of his ſalvation. This alſo made him ſay, that it was hard for ſuch as had riches to enter into the kingdom of God. Becauſe ſuch, who truſt in riches, as it is explained in another place, do certainly reject all the means of ſalvation; and while they continue to do ſo, it is not only difficult but impoſſible for them to receive <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or be made partakers of his benefits. Yet with <hi>God</hi> nothing is impoſſible. When he reſolves to convert a ſinner, no impediment whatever can hinder his deſign. No obſtacle has force ſufficient to prevent the certain execution of his ſovereign purpoſe. He ſpeaks, and it is done. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and it ſtands faſt for ever.</p>
            <p>HAVING paved his way with the poliſhed ſtones of error thus far, our author comes at laſt to a more particular conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his main point, <hi>the glorious doctrine of the final reſtoration of all things.</hi> This his moſt beloved ſentiment, he ſuppoſes, naturally follows from his preceding obſervations. But the miſery is, it does neither follow from ſcripture, or reaſon, or the common ſenſe of mankind. He ſays it has been for a long time greatly clouded over with <hi>antichriſtian darkneſs.</hi> If ſo, it is a pity this cloud was ever diſperſed. Even the ſhades of night may ſometimes prove advantageous to men. It may hide ſeveral loathſome objects from their eyes. And if antichriſtian darkneſs ſerved for a long ſeaſon, as he tells us, to cover ſuch a putrid maſs of hereſy, and conceal it from the chriſtian world, it was indeed a benefit, inſtead of an injury.</p>
            <p>BUT, by his leave, this doctrine was never as much as once heard of, until Antichriſt had ſtirred up abundance of wrath and darkneſs in the primitive church, as he aſſures us Lucifer did formerly in the profound center of nature. We have no account of it during the two firſt centuries. This notion of a general redemption from Hell was firſt broached by one <hi>Origen,</hi> who lived in the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> two hundred and thirty. With this, the ſame man held many other monſtrous opinions, which were afterwards propagated by his followers, who, after his name, were called Origeniſts. Theſe prevailed and infeſted the church until the ſixth century, when they were condemned in general council, and Origen's books on ſuch ſubjects cenſured as dangerous, and forbidden to be read. Of this Origen it is reported, that he was endowed with a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017740_0021_0FA26A1AA5FE8448"/>
memory ſo tenacious, that he could readily repeat the whole Bible by heart. I have alſo heard the ſame thing of Mr. Wincheſter; and probably they were born under the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. However that may be, the ſaid Origen does not appear to have been any great artiſt in conſtruing the ſcriptures. For he, underſtanding our Saviour's words, <q>there be ſome who have made themſelves <hi>Eunuchs</hi> for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake,</q> in a literal ſenſe, thereupon laid violent hands on his own virility, and cruelly emaſculated himſelf. Juſt as if our <hi>Lord</hi> had recommended caſtration as the only way to immortal <hi>glory.</hi> This ſhews that the <hi>glorious</hi> doctrine we are examining ſprung at firſt from no very creditable ſource; for what dependence can be put on authors, however eminent for parts or learning, when it is well known they have fallen into ſuch ſplenetic dreams, into ſuch pitiful and diſtracted dotages!</p>
            <p>ON this topic Mr. <hi>Wincheſter</hi> flouriſhes in all the pomp of heroiſm. His magnanimity appears in every line. Having preſſed ſeveral precious texts of Scripture into his ſervice, he ranges his arguments in due form, and, muſtering his whole force, fires his ſyllogiſms like chained ſhot. But, though his courage is evidently great, military ſkill is wanting. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery is but poorly ſerved, for his balls do little or no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Some of them fly too high, others too low, and every one falls ſhort of the mark.</p>
            <p>UNLESS all creatures become guilty of ſin, and miſerable in conſequence of their fall, be at laſt reſtored to happineſs, he declares <q>the promiſe in his text can never have a perfect accompliſhment; yea, upon the common ſyſtems, it has ſcarce any meaning at all. <hi>God</hi> has ſworn by the Prophet, that to him every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear; and by an Apoſtle repeats the ſame ſolemn declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is promiſed that <hi>God</hi> will reconcile all things to himſelf. Death ſhall be deſtroyed, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. No <hi>enemy</hi> ſhall be left. <hi>God</hi> is able, and he is willing to reſtore all things. Therefore it ſhall be done, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, under correction, we cannot yet help thinking that a leading malefactor may be totally ſubdued by a Prince, and yet retain his enmity to his government as long as he lives. And why may it not be properly ſaid that the ſerpent's head
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017740_0022_0FA26A1B636E1950"/>
is bruiſed, and his works deſtroyed, though neither he nor any of his incorrigible confederates ſhould ever be reconciled to <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUPPOSE ſome powerful tyrant had, by uſurpation, ſeized a conſiderable part of a certain King's dominion, whoſe royal title was indiſputable, had drawn many of his former ſubjects into rebellion, had very ſtrongly intrenched and fortified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, bidding defiance to the lawful Monarch, and daily ſpreading terror and devaſtation all around. In the mean while it was foretold by ſeveral, who pretended to the gift of prophecy, that the King would in ſome future period of time ſend his own ſon to make war upon this tyrant, and that he ſhould by force of arms utterly overthrow him, and take all his illegal acquiſitions out of his hands. At laſt the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>hero</hi> appears, and lays ſiege to the tyrant's capital city, and having battered down the walls, and forced an entrance by ſtorm, he ſets up his white flag, and by ſound of trumpet cauſes it to be proclaimed through all the country, that ſuch who had been ſeduced by the tyrant ſhould be accepted to his Majeſty's favour, and be honored again as the ſubjects of his kingdom, provided they would, in ſuch a term as ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, throw down their arms, confeſs their folly, and ſue for pardon and reconciliation. But whereas but few, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, chuſe to comply with his gracious overture, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer condemns not only the tyrant, but likewiſe all who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to receive quarters, either to immediate death, or dooms them to perpetual baniſhment into ſome foreign realm, and conſigns them to the moſt abject ſervitude and irrecoverable ſlavery. Now, this done, was ſome haughty politician, in order to diſplay the ſuperiority of his judgment, to declare that the ancient prediction was falſe, for the conqueſt was far from being compleat, nor can it ever be perfected till this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, with all his accomplices in hoſtility, are redeemed from their bondage, called home to the King's Court, and not only ſo, but are dignified with all the immunities, and indulged with the ſame privileges which his beſt ſubjects enjoy; nay, they muſt be admitted into the King's palace, they muſt feaſt at his table,—yea, which is ſtill more, they muſt be raiſed to the throne, and be made partners in his crown; for until all this is done, the victory is but partial, and the hero's tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017740_0023_0FA26A1C264CDEE0"/>
but mock pageanty and illuſive oſtentation. Would not ſuch reaſoning be univerſally exploded as ridiculous to the laſt degree? And what could the impertinent author juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but to be hiſſed out of countenance, and eſteemed as a madman wherever he went? Yet this is the exact picture of Mr. <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s elaborate ratiocination on this ſubject. His arguments, in all their formality, have juſt as much force to prove, that unleſs wicked men and devils are in general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from their infernal torment, the promiſes of <hi>God</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fulfilled, nor will <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ever ſee the entire travail of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied. In ſhort, it is very clear that all the ſcriptures this author has recited in theſe pages, or in any other part of his performance, do, when put together, prove nothing more than this, viz. that our glorious redeemer ſhall reign till all his enemies are made his footſtool. Heaven, and earth, and hell, ſhall eternally reſound with his peerleſs exploits, and angels, men and devils, with one everlaſting ſhout, recognize his matchleſs atchievements. His friends ſhall voluntarily give all poſſible <hi>glory</hi> to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and his foes ſhall yield him an equal tribute of praiſe, though by compulſion. For ſurely a ſlave may vow allegiance unto and bow down to a conqueror, though he does both with the greateſt reluctance. A felon may acknowledge the authority of his Judge, and confeſs the equity of the ſentence paſſed upon him, though at the ſame time his heart may be filled with an implacable antipathy to his perſon, inſomuch that, was it in his power, he would gladly ſtab him with a mortal wound, and rejoice in the perpetration of ſo horrid an act. So here, the reprobate world ſhall doubtleſs bow, and kneel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and ſwear, and deeply ſubmit to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> owning his abſolute and incontroulable Sovereignty. But all this is far from arguing their emancipation. It does not at all prove their future enlargement. For this, all this they may, yea, and ſhall do in their infernal priſon. All this they ſhall do with ſempiternal ſorrow, and anguiſh, and weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth, without the leaſt hope of any deliverance from the fiery dungeons into which they will be caſt, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and rueful victims of his inexorable <hi>fury,</hi> and <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>anger,</hi> and <hi>indignation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:017740_0024_0FA26A1D38BBAA98"/>IN the concluſion of his diſcourſe the author lays down five propoſitions, on which he ſays the glorious doctrine is built, all which muſt be proved to be falſe, before it can be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. In theſe, he lets us know, conſiſts the merit of his cauſe; <q>theſe are the foundation principles or which the mighty ſuperſtructure reſts; and till theſe are overthrown, all attempts againſt the doctrine are vain.</q> So, then, far as we have proceeded, we have ſcarcely yet ſet out upon our journey. And behold! mountain upon mountain, in terrible gradation, placed before us. To remove them, it ſeems, is impracticable, and to climb over them at leaſt very difficult, if not altogether impoſſible; and one or the other we muſt do, or renounce particular redemption, and embrace the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious doctrine, the reſtoration of all things. A perplexing dilemma indeed! However, <hi>fortune favours the brave.</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this good old apothegm, we ſhall attempt the latter; <hi>i. e.</hi> we will endeavour to make our way over all theſe craggy cliffs, rather than give up the truth. And by permiſſion, we ſhall take a view of his propoſitions in order.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <q>GOD is love, eſſentially and communicatively, and loves all the beings he has made, conſidered as his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and is conſtantly ſeeking to do them good.</q> This is all true; and if ſo, we may be ſure he will uſe the beſt means in his power to prevent their falling into ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by involving themſelves in miſery. And what means could be ſo likely to effect this moſt loving deſign as the aſſuring them, that if they ventured to tranſgreſs they muſt <q>ſuffer his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſpleaſure, as the natural conſequence of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion!</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF GOD would rule his creatures at all, he muſt appoint certain laws for their obſervation. For without laws, there can be no government. But laws are of no validity, without ſome penalties annexed; and penalties would be of no force, without a ſtrict execution. Is it inconſiſtent with a ſupreme magiſtrate's affection to his ſubjects for him to put the laws in execution? Does it diſcover a diſregard to their welfare to puniſh thieves, and robbers, and murderers, and traitors, &amp;c. &amp;c. with death? Quite the reverſe. Neither is it contrary to the eſſential or communicative <hi>love of God</hi> to fulfil his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous threatenings, in the everlaſting perdition of all his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017740_0025_0FA26A20C8136DB8"/>
and irreclaimable enemies, and eſpecially thoſe whom he often called to repentance, promiſing them remiſſion of their guilt, provided they would return to their duty. If, after all, many of them pertinaciouſly perſiſt in their wickedneſs until the act of indemnity is repealed, who, I beſeech you, is cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of their eternal ruin but themſelves? <hi>God</hi> can and does ſtill love them, conſidered as his creatures, but not as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate foes. As ſuch he hates, and will puniſh them, and that in perfect proportion to their ſeveral deſerts. So then we have happily paſſed the firſt of theſe mountains.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2dly. GOD's deſign, in creating intelligent beings, was to make them happy in the knowledge and love of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perfections.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3dly. GOD's abſolute ultimate deſigns cannot be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruſtrated.</q> But, as they were free agents, their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depended on their perfect obedience during the ſpace of their probation. But in caſe any of them revolted, one of <hi>God</hi>'s abſolute deſigns was, according to his threatening, and as appears by the event, that they ſhould ſuffer for ſo doing. Therefore, though many of them are left to periſh in and for their ſins, <hi>God</hi>'s deſigns are neither temporally nor eternally fruſtrated by their fall. Thus we have gained a paſſage over two of theſe mountains at once.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <q>4thly. CHRIST died for all men (he ſhould have added for all devils too) and died not in vain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the merit of our <hi>dear Redeemer</hi>'s death is ſufficient in value to ſave all men, is granted: For his blood cleanſeth from all ſin. If men, therefore, refuſe to apply this remedy, what can they expect but to die under the curſe of God's holy law? It is an Apoſtle's interrogation, <q>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect <hi>ſo great ſalvation?</hi>
               </q> Neither is the virtue of our Saviour's paſſion loſt, though multitudes periſh by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing it. No medicine, however powerful to heal, will prove beneficial until applied. If a ſick perſon rejects the phyſic offered unto him, and dies by his obſtinacy, whoſe fault is it? Whoſe but the patient's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The phyſic remains as efficacious as if he, and ten thouſands more, had taken it, and had all been reſtored to health by its operation. Beſides, all mankind do actually receive ſeveral benefits in this world, in conſequence of our <hi>Lord</hi>'s mediation. All that temporal
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017740_0026_0FA26A2212CC64A8"/>
felicity that nations, as well as particular perſons, are indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with, flows from no other fountain but the merit of his blood. The goſpel, conſidered only as a ſyſtem of morals, is doubtleſs in itſelf the greateſt bleſſing any kingdom or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth can be favoured with; and where that goſpel is truly preached, though but a ſmall number, comparatively, may be ſavingly converted, yet multitudes have been greatly reformed thereby,—their corruptions have been and ſtill are in a great meaſure reſtrained, and innumerable iniquities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which otherwiſe they would have committed. Now, as it is as clear as Scripture light can make it that there is a conſiderable inequality even in the torments of <hi>hell,</hi> reaſon ſays theſe perſons cannot be as miſerable in a future ſtate as the atheiſt, the blaſphemer, the perſecutor, the deceiver of men, the hypocrite, and thoſe profane wretches who declare their ſin as Sodom, and hide it not.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE Chriſt is the greateſt bleſſing:—Chriſt is the choiceſt donation that could be conferred on our world, even if it had no relation to the next. It follows, then, that this objection, if all men (yea and devils too) are not at laſt crowned with glory, and exalted to the regions of endleſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Chriſt died in vain, is but a groundleſs ſurmiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Scripture or reaſon to ſupport it. So we are got beyond another mountain.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <q>5thly. CHRIST came to deſtroy the evil principle, or ſin, out of the univerſe, which he will finally effect, and then miſery ſhall be no more.</q> Had he ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came into this world to deſtroy ſin, and baniſh miſery out of it, which he will certainly effect, the whole propoſition would have been granted, <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> But that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it out of hell is denied. Becauſe we are aſſured by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, that the fire that burns there is abſolutely unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that the torment ſuffered in that flaming pit is in dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eternal; and that the pains of damnation are ſtrictly and properly everlaſting, and will continue in <hi>ſecula ſeculorum, forever,</hi> yea, <hi>forever</hi> and <hi>ever. Chriſt</hi> never deſcended into <hi>hell,</hi> neither did nor will he ever redeem any of its inhabitants. Thus we have made a ſhift to ſurpaſs all theſe mountains,— and, through mercy, are not yet quite out of breath, and hope we ſhall have more level ground to walk on for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:017740_0027_0FA26A2229A583A8"/>BUT Mr. <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in his appendix, labours to prove that the <hi>words eternal,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and <hi>forever,</hi> yea, and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever,</hi> are as often, in the holy Scriptures, uſed to denote a limited duration, as an endleſs eternity. The words he aſſures us are <q>equivocal; ſo that no concluſive argument can be formed from them to prove the endleſs torments of the damned.</q> But he is obliged to allow, that they are ſometimes applied to an endleſs duration. Why then ſhould we not underſtand, that the meaning of the inſpired writers was to let us know that the miſery of the wicked, as well as the happineſs of the righteous, ſhall be really eternal? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as they deſcribe both by one and the ſame term. When our Lord declares, that the former ſhall go away into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment, but the latter into life eternal, it is well known that the word, though varied in our tranſlation, is the very ſame in the original. So that, if the reward of grace is eternal, the penalty of juſtice muſt be of equal duration, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Saviour's very plain repreſentation of the laſt judgment. And to accuſe the Prophets and Apoſtles, yea, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, with ſpeaking to poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in equivocal terms, or words of a double meaning, is an impeachment that does not at all become the tongue or pen of a Chriſtian. Was this inſolent charge as true as it is falſe, what dependence could be put in <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>? Nay, that can be no revelation at all, but rather a riddle, that is delivered in ſuch a manner. Alas! into what pernicious blunders! Yea, into what ſhocking and nefarious blaſphemies will men fall by error and deluſion, when they have once eſpouſed their intereſt, and are engaged to plead their cauſe for ſome ſecular emolument!</p>
            <p>BUT that the words mentioned above are all, or any of them, uſed as much as once in the whole Bible to ſignify a limited duration, is an aſſertion I abſolutely deny. Nor does the inſtances he has produced, nor all he can collect hereafter, evince the contrary. They conſtantly and every where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port nothing ſhort of a perpetual exiſtence of the thing ſpoken of, whatever it is.</p>
            <p>To have a clear conception of this important truth, we muſt conſider that the various ceremonies of the Levitical law, as well as the ſeveral predictions of the Jewiſh Prophets,

had for the moſt part, if not always, a direct reference to the goſpel diſpenſation. For inſtance, the land of Canaan, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Abraham and his ſeed, was a type of heaven, which is an eternal inheritance, and ſhall be poſſeſſed by all his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual children forever and ever. The covenant of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion typified the covenant made with Chriſt, and in him with all the elect, which is doubtleſs eternal, and will remain in full force and virtue forever and ever. The prieſthood of Aaron repreſented the prieſthood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is eternal, and will by him be continued without ceſſation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption forever and ever. The horrible flame kindled to conſume Sodom and Gomorrah was a ſtriking figure of hell fire, which is eternal, and will burn forever and ever. The fire continually preſerved by the ſons of Aaron on the altar was emblematical either of the love of God to his people, or his wrath againſt his enemies, both of which are eternal, and will continue forever and ever. Even ſo, all the promiſes divulged, and the threatenings denounced by the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, although they had a primary reſpect to temporal bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or curſes, yet without diſpute they bore a relation to ſpiritual rewards and puniſhments, both of which are likewiſe eternal, and will endure forever, yea, forever and ever.</p>
            <p>THUS the words, even in the Old Teſtament, always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an unbounded duration: How much more ſo in the New! But our author inſiſts upon it, and repeats it over and over again, that theſe words ſignify ages, and ages of ages, and periods, and periodical <hi>eternities!</hi> Tremendous doom! This is worſe and worſe! We only plead that the wicked ſhall ſuffer but one eternity; but he avers they ſhall ſuffer, ſome of them at leaſt, ſeveral eternities, and nobody can count how many! Where he found ſuch idle, inſipid, as well as fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtuff, whether in the Alcoran of Mahomet, or in the writings of Jacob Boehman, or whether it be the fiction of his own fertile genius, he beſt knows. One thing is certain, there is nothing any how reſembling it in the <hi>Book of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his reaſonings about the unpardonable ſin, had he noticed what is very viſible in the divine oracles, he would have loſt all the aſſiſtance he fancies can be derived from our Saviour's words concerning it. The verb to forgive, in ſacred dialect, ſometimes ſignifies no more than to exempt from
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017740_0029_0FA26A23A350D908"/>
preſent puniſhment. So Moſes reminds the Lord, that he had forgiven his people Iſrael from Egypt until now, though we are aſſured he viſited their iniquities upon them, and that with terrible judgment afterwards. Thus God may forgive whole nations and communities for ſeveral years, yet puniſh them, and very ſeverely at laſt. Thus God winked at the ſins of the heathens in the times of their ignorance; <hi>i. e.</hi> he bore their provocations with long ſuffering and patience, becauſe they had not the means of knowing better. But this was not the caſe with the Jews, eſpecially in our Saviour's days. They ſinned againſt the clear light both of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and miracles, and thereby brought down the moſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calamities on themſelves that ever befel any nation. Therefore, when our <hi>bleſſed Lord</hi> ſays that that ſin ſhall never be forgiven, he evidently means that the Phariſees, and all others who proved guilty of it, ſhould ſuffer his higheſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, not only in hell hereafter, but even in this preſent world, as we know they did. So that this declaration is far enough from proving that all other ſins ſhall be pardoned in the next life, as he vain-gloriouſly aſſerts.</p>
            <p>AND although Job and Jeremiah wiſhed they were never born, this was only ſpoken with regard to their preſent afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>i. e.</hi> had they no proſpect of a beter life hereafter, they ſuppoſed it more eligible to have had no being at all. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, <q>if in this life only we have hope, we are of all men the moſt miſerable.</q> So that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of thoſe holy men don't at all prove that Judas might be ſaved, though our <hi>Lord</hi> declared it were good for that man if he had never been born.</p>
            <p>WE might proceed to conſider the other ſcriptures, which he tells us are objected againſt his glorious doctrine, and which he maintains are rather for than againſt him; but it is judged needleſs at preſent. It would ſwell this piece beyond the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended dimenſions,—and prolixity on any ſubject is my aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I ſhall, therefore, only take a little more notice of that <hi>inſpoken ſeed</hi> he ſo zealouſly recommends, and then come to a concluſion.</p>
            <p>WE are told that this <q>
                  <hi>ſeed</hi> lies in unregenerate men, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with <hi>death</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> until Chriſt, by his goſpel, reaches and draws it into motion.</q> It ſeems, then, that it
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017740_0030_0FA26A24584349D8"/>
is inviſible, and not to be ſeen even by the ſouls in which it is buried. Nor do we find that it is to be heard by them, for it is dead and buried. How then can it ſpeak? And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this deſcription, it is impoſſible to comprehend the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this <hi>ſeed.</hi> Nor can we conceive what it is good for. If Chriſt, the Sun of righteouſneſs, muſt reach it, previous to its vivification, it is certainly uſeleſs, and anſwers no purpoſe at all. For one ſingle ray of divine light flowing from Jeſus Chriſt, and darted into the ſinner's heart, is abundantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to effect the bleſſed change, without borrowing any aſſiſtance from this inanimate and ſepultured ſeed. Moreover, in what part of the unconverted ſinner is this ſeed to be found? In his underſtanding? No; that is all darkneſs. In his mind? No; that is all enmity againſt God. In his will? No; that is all rebellion. In his affections? No; they are all pollution and carnality.</p>
            <p>THE author tells us, that immediately after their fall the bodies of our firſt parents became like beaſts, and their ſouls like fallen angels. Now Moſes ſays Adam beg at children in his own image. It follows then that all his poſterity are born in the perfect likeneſs of Adam, whatever that is. And if you enquire what it is, the famous Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> in one of his Sermons, anſwers, <q>man, in his natural ſtate, is half <hi>beaſt,</hi> half <hi>devil!</hi>
               </q> With this good man, Mr. Wincheſter exactly agrees. There is a perfect conſonance in the import of their expreſſions, only the latter chuſes to be a little politer in the more diſagreeable part of the portraiture. Perhaps he was afraid he ſhould offend ſome of his ableſt friends, had he uttered his ſentiments in ſuch harſh and grating language as the other did. The picture, however, is odious enough. Nor does it at all exceed the truth. And if the perſon of a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs man is indeed ſuch a motly mixture of <hi>beaſtiality</hi> and <hi>deviliſm,</hi> in what part ſhall we find the dreary ſepulchre where this admirable <hi>ſeed</hi> lies interred? In the brutal part? No, certainly! For there can be no divinity in a beaſt. In the diabolical? Surely no! For if no divine principle can dwell in a beaſt, much leſs can it find an abode in the devil. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after the moſt accurate ſcrutiny and aſſiduous inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are obliged to give up, and conclude with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, it is to be found <hi>no where!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:017740_0031_0FA26A2583C214F8"/>THERE is in this ſeed ſomething ſuperlatively ſtrange! It is a beam of light, yet it is not perceptible. It is a ſpark of fire, but without heat. It is an orator, yet not audible. It is able to teach us all we need to know, and yet it is quite ſilent, and as dumb as death! It can be no ſubſtantive, for it is not to be ſeen, heard, felt or underſtood. Neither is it an adjective; for it is deſcriptive of no quality whatever. It is not white, nor black, nor hot, nor cold, nor great, nor ſmall, nor good, nor bad. In ſhort, it is juſt what the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> makes ſpace to be, viz. a mere vacuum, a non-entity, a nothing but a name.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>ſeed,</hi> or <hi>ſpark,</hi> it appears by the whole current of the ſermon, is that moſt benevolent ſhepherd, who ſhall at laſt lead the whole flock of once deſpairing goats out of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſart, ſhall transform them into amiable ſheep, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them into the ſold of celeſtial <hi>glory,</hi> where they ſhall bleat forth one eternal hallelujah to their adored deliverer. Nor will Lucifer and his angels be left behind. No! They ſhall all of them be partakers of the triumph, and gladly join the univerſal acclamation of praiſe. Though this will prove a very tedious enterprize; nor can it be accompliſhed, it ſeems, until many ages are elapſed; nay, until numberleſs, long, reluctant, tardy, ſlow-circling, periodical eternities have performed their ſeveral revolutions; and then ſin and miſery ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>BUT what are ſome wicked men ſent to hell for at all? One would think that the ſun would reach this ſeed, and bring it up while they were on earth; or that if it fails here, their caſe will be hopeleſs: For the nearer the ſun, the more and ſtronger influence it muſt have on any ſubſtance. And hell, every body muſt allow, is farther from heaven than our earth is. If he ſays the fire of Tophet will rend or melt theſe rocks that now cover the ſeed, does not this attribute more ſaving virtue to the flames of hell, than to the blood of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Though he tells us, that when it was ſhed, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently had a phyſical virtue over nature itſelf. It cauſed the earth to ſhake, the rocks to rend, and the graves to open. And yet all this power, and virtue, and efficacy, is not of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient energy to quicken this ſeed, until the ſoil in which it is ſown is purged in the furnace of damnation. In order to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017740_0032_0FA26A261ADFE5E8"/>
which, ſome parts of it at leaſt muſt burn during innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>eternities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is purgatory with a contradiction. But was that all, it would be a trifle in compariſon.</p>
            <p>IT is, alas! it is a ſhameful diſparagement to his <hi>blood,</hi> who is the true <hi>God</hi> and <hi>eternal life!</hi> But can he tell us, by whoſe manuduction the <hi>devils</hi> ſhall regain their <hi>freedom?</hi> For he ſays it, nay he repeats even to <hi>tautology,</hi> that all things ſhall be reſtored, and of conſequence theſe abaſed ſpirits ſhall regain their ancient honors, and re-aſcend their heavenly thrones. <hi>Did Chriſt die for them?</hi> He will hardly ſay <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for them alſo. For he took not on him the nature of angels. Nor have we received the leaſt account that <hi>God</hi> has provided any <hi>Mediator</hi> for thoſe wretched ſpirits. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are ever redeemed, it muſt be by an arbitrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; though Mr. <hi>Wincheſter</hi> will have nothing arbitrary in the whole proceſs, when it ſuits him. But, if <hi>God</hi> ſaves the reprobate angels by a ſovereign act of his will, without any attonement or ſatisfaction made to his juſtice, why might not men be ſaved by a like act of ſovereignty? Does not this repreſent the <hi>manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> in contriving the plan of our redemption, as <hi>horreſco referre!</hi> As what I dare not name? Upon this ſuppoſition too, our condeſcending, our amible and compaſſionate <hi>Redeemer</hi> might have ſpared all his labour, and ſweat, and pains, and blood!</p>
            <p>BUT we are told this light of Chriſt within man is not ſomething diſtinct from <hi>divine revelation,</hi> much leſs in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, but the <hi>beginning</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>If ſo, a written revelation is altogether unneceſſary. For what uſe has he of a candle, who enjoys the ſun in all its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian glory? How were all the Prophets and Apoſtles deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! They, honeſt men, thought they had ſome extraordinary inſtructions given them immediately by God, which the reſt of mankind were not favoured with. But it ſeems they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly miſtaken. No, no, weak men, you might have kept your hiſtories, and prophecies, and goſpels, and epiſtles to yourſelves! All men, without exception, have had, and ſtill have the very ſame and equal ſhare of inſpiration, which you either out of ſimplicity or roguery made a monopoly of. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this allegation, the light in us is not to be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017740_0033_0FA26A29F10047F0"/>
by the holy Scriptures, but they are to be tried by it. So that the outward revelation muſt always yield to this inward pedagogue. No wonder Mr. Wincheſter could ſo eaſily and clearly prove his <hi>glorious</hi> doctrine from the conſtant tenor of both Old and New Teſtament, and find it every where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with "Thus ſaith the <hi>Lord."</hi> Why did he take ſo much pains to quote particular pages from them? He might have preſented the whole <hi>Bible</hi> at once, and told us, as ſome pious preachers do of late<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is my Confeſſion of <hi>Faith!</hi> This one argument would have been as forcible as all that he has offered both in his ſermon and the appendix, as the whole concatenation of citations, and repetitions, and reflections, and exclamations, and ſyllogiſms, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. It is only for him to ſay, with a ſerious and reverend air, it was the light of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within that taught me my hiſtory of the creation, and my ſcheme of divinity too, and therefore they cannot be contrary to the ſcriptures; and for any of you to think or ſpeak otherwiſe is only to betray your weakneſs; for all you can ſay againſt them is fighting againſt God!</p>
            <p>WHAT can we oppoſe to ſuch maſterly reaſonings as theſe? <hi>Ipſe dixit!</hi> We muſt not gainſay. No! We muſt lay our hands upon our mouths. The point is decided. Both <hi>men</hi> and <hi>devils</hi> ſhall certainly obtain a glorious reſtoration. We have, ſome of us, for years paſt obſerved ſundry new-fangled notions prevailing. A variety of ſtrange opinions, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect both to doctrine, worſhip and diſcipline, have, like Jonah's gourd, ſprung up in a night; and indeed ſome of them alſo withered in a night. Not long ago, we were told that God had no mercy at all. That compaſſion did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Divine nature</hi> in any ſenſe. But behold! now this ſame <hi>Being</hi> is all <hi>mercy,</hi> and little or no juſtice. In him there is neither <hi>fury, warth</hi> nor <hi>anger.</hi> Formerly it was poſitively affirmed that the elect were juſtified from <hi>eternity,</hi> that Chriſt died only for that choſen number, and never ſhed a drop of his blood for the reſt of mankind, and that none but they were to be invited to come to a Saviour by any means. But lo! this wind is quite turned—and what weather next? Why, the whole race is now exactly on a par. Chriſt died equally for them all, yea, he is in them all. And they are all to be invited, and exhorted, and commanded, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017740_0034_0FA26A2B577ED8C8"/>
and intreated to receive him. Though, at the ſame time, they all have him in full poſſeſſion, he dwells in them all as an inſpoken <hi>ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A year or two paſt it was publicly proclaimed in this State, that the war was at an end, our independency was eſtabliſhed, and the ſound of battle and deſtruction ſhould no more be heard in our land. But ſince that, alas! the ſword has reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even to the ſoul of Virginia, many of our brave <hi>patriots</hi> have been quite impoveriſhed, and ſome have loſt their lives by the hand of the enemy.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the ſame time we were aſſured, with the greateſt prophetic confidence, that the latter-day <hi>glory</hi> was juſt now breaking forth, that the illuſtrious morning had already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to dawn, and we ſhould very ſoon ſee the <hi>ſun.</hi> All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would ſpeedily be converted, the whole <hi>church</hi> become of one mind, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf deſcend, in all the pomp and magnificence of heaven, perſonally to reign among them, and exalt his once poor, hated, deſpiſed people to riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to principality and power, and might, and dominion, and renown; and in a word, elevate his followers, as Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met promiſed to do his, to the very ſummit of earthly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and introduce them to the full fruition of all ſenſual enjoyments, and the plenary gratification of every carnal and fleſhly appetite. But ah, how have we been diſappointed! We are ſtill fed with the bread of tears, and have the water of gall to drink! We ſee not our ſigns, neither is there any that can tell us how long! We have ever ſince been with longing eyes gazing toward the eaſt, but Aurora ſtill hides her roſy face, not a ſingle bluſh of radiance appears to diſſipate the nocturnal gloom; nay, we are not ſo much as ſatisfied that the <hi>morning ſtar</hi> is yet riſen. For though others may judge Mr. Wincheſter's <hi>ſermon</hi> to be it, yet we in Virginia rather take it to be an ominous comet, which, inſtead of portending proſperity to the nations, forebodes ſtill greater judgments in reverſion, and ſhakes baleful influences, wars, famines, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences and deſolation from its horrid hair!</p>
            <p>ONCE more. We uſed to be taught, that none but a very ſmall part of mankind had the leaſt chance of obtaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation at all. But now, even <hi>Judas,</hi> with the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi>—yea, and all the <hi>blackeſt fiends</hi> below, ſhall at
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017740_0035_0FA26A2CDCCE38C8"/>
laſt be cleanſed, and purified, and turned into angelic <hi>beauties,</hi> and be made equally happy with the glorious army of <hi>martyrs,</hi> and the firſt born ſons of light! And pray, what is this but a new edition of <hi>purgatory,</hi> only a little corrected and amended? And what will follow? What but the <hi>extreme unction, prayers for the dead, Peter-pence, pilgrimages, auricular confeſſion, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, indulgences, tranſubſtantiation, ſupererogation,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WE were altogether at a loſs, in times paſt, to know from what origin ſuch ingenious innovations ſprung; but this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> has obliged us with a friendly evolution of the whole myſtery. It is, doubtleſs, by the ſuperior documents of this <hi>inherent Preacher,</hi> that the children of this generation are grown ſo much wiſer than their <hi>Fathers.</hi> The author might have ſpared his vehement ejaculation for the poor <hi>deiſts</hi>; for who but this ſupreme <hi>Pontiff</hi> taught them to eſpy ſo many glaring blemiſhes in divine revelation? And indeed he is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teaching others the noble ſciences of ſelf-conceit, and the contempt of ſerious piety, conformity to this world, ſcoffing at religion, crying up the dignity of human nature, deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel, vilifying its faithful Miniſters, and pride, and wantonneſs, and atheiſm, and infidelity, and profaneneſs of every kind. And now he has brought forth a leſſon, which, if it does but ſucceed, will do the whole effectually. Rejoice, ye ſons of Belial! ſhout loud, all ye children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! for that eternal <hi>hell,</hi> at which you uſed to be terrified, which freqently checked you in the jovial career of vanity, that reſtrained your corruptions, and often, often embittered your mirth, and mingled wormwood with your golden cup of pleaſure, that eternal <hi>hell</hi> is now no more! It is found at laſt to be nothing but a melancholy fiction, an idle dream, meer prieſtcraft, and nothing elſe!</p>
            <p>REJOICE, ye devils, alſo! Yea, let all your dark dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons reſound with the voice of jubilation! No longer need you to believe and tremble! No, no,—Wait but for a little moment, and your iron chains ſhall burſt aſunder! Your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon walls, though of adamant ſhall be broken down! You ſeraphic wings ſhall be reſtored! You ſhall regain your pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meval velocity, and in the twinkling of an eye reach you former habitations! This is a joyful proclamation indeed But, whatever ſome men on earth may do, I am perſuade

there is not a ſingle devil, or damned ſpirit in hell, that pays the leaſt credit thereunto. They, alas! they all know that it is an egregious <hi>falſhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, let this doctrine be ever ſo glorious in other peoples eſteem, to me it is very certain it is a doctrine that is not of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT doctrine, which contradicts the plaineſt dictates of reaſon; that doctrine, which diſagrees with the experience of all true chriſtians; that doctrine, which depreciates the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and derogates from the value of redeeming blood; that doctrine, which is directly oppoſite to the whole ſcope of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, which is diſhonorable to God, and plainly tends to ruin precious ſouls, by encouraging them to go on in ſin without reſtraint; that doctrine is not, that doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of <hi>God.</hi> But ſuch is this glorious (alias) inglorious doctrine of the reſtoration, as this author holds it <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> it is not of <hi>God.</hi> That the doctrine we have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining does evidently bear all theſe characters, however odious, has appeared in part already, and might eaſily be made more fully to appear; but let what has been written to that purpoſe ſuffice at preſent.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>author,</hi> before he finiſhes his appendix, tells us, he has <q>aimed at the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the welfare of mankind, in publiſhing and in maintaining his doctrine.</q> Well! what his aim was is not for me to determine, but one thing is too clear to be concealed—he has taken a very unlikely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to promote either of theſe ends.</p>
            <p>AND for my part, though I think it my duty very ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to oppoſe his doctrine, yet I find not the leaſt inclination to reproach the <hi>man,</hi> nor caſt any contempt on his perſon. No, verily, my ſoul loves, pities and prays for him. <hi>May God</hi> give him eyes to ſee his error, and grace to retract it, before it does any more miſchief! For though it may a little ruffle his meek ſpirit, we muſt rank his doctrine of univerſal redemption among the vileſt of <hi>Hereſies.</hi> And it does really appear to be one of the moſt dangerous and deſtructive that was ever yet propagated among mankind. Let all thoſe, therefore, who deſire ſalvation, beware of this inward <hi>inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> and at leaſt cloſely try him, before they eſpouſe his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or embrace his tenets. Let them take heed leſt what
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017740_0037_0FA26A2E19865CE0"/>
is recommended to their notice as the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the woman ſhould, inſtead of that, be nothing but the ſerpent's head. Remember, precious <hi>ſouls,</hi> remember that alarming text: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf is transformed into an angel of light.</hi> Suſpect, oh ſuſpect the voice of adulation. Shun, carefully ſhun the ſnare of the fowler, and the noiſome peſtilence. Take heed, leſt the light that is in you ſhould prove to be darkneſs. Fly, quickly fly from the paths of the <hi>deſtroyer.</hi> Haſten, oh haſten, not to the light within, but to the <hi>light</hi> without you; even to Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaves ſinners only in this world, which is the only one that he has redeemed. To him be <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
