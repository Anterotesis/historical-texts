            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Of Pot-ash.</head>
               <p>Pot-ash is generally obtained by making a lye of the ashes of vegetables, evaporating the water, and calcining the combustible matter, which remains mixed with the ashes, in a high degree of heat.</p>
               <p>It may likewise be obtained very pure, by fusing the nitrate of pot-ash or salt petre with charcoal, dissolving the substance which remains behind in water, and filter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it through paper. When pure pot-ash is exposed to the air, it attracts a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moisture, and is resolved into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor called the oil of tartar per deliquium.</p>
               <p>The common pot-ash of the shops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a large portion of carbonic acid, or

                  <p>If the sulphuric acid is used, a sulphate of pot-ash or vitriolated tartar will be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if the nitric acid, nitrate of pot-ash, or common nitre; and if the muriatic, a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riate of pot-ash or digestive salt of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</p>

               <p>Soda is generally obtained from the ashes of marine plants, by proceeding in the same manner as in procuring pot-ash.</p>
               <p>It may also be made from the muriate of soda or common salt, by adding pot-ash to a solution of this substance, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating a part of the liquor by means of heat, when the pure alkali will be obtained in crystals.</p>
               <p>The pot-ash unites to the muriatic acid of the common salt, and forms muriate of pot-ash, which will be held in solution in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatant liquor, while the soda will be set at liberty.</p>
               <p>Soda differs from pot-ash; because it is less caustic; does not attract moisture from the atmosphere, but effloresces in it; crys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallizes in rhomboidal octahedrons; forms different products with the same bases and is more proper for vitrification.</p>

               <p>It may be procured in a very pure state, by distilling equal parts of sifted quick lime and the muriate of ammoniac or common sal ammoniac together, in a glass retort, to which a receiver must be connected, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a portion of water, correspondent to the weight of the salt employed.</p>

                  <head>EXPERIMENT XCV.</head>
                  <p>To make the nitric solution of silver, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve one drachm of lunar caustic in two ounces of rain water.—Or,</p>

                  <p>Put four five penny bits into a wine glass, or wide mouthed vial, and pour upon them half an ounce of nitric acid diluted with an equal quantity of water. Let the vial stand near the fire, until the solution is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated to dryness; then add to it two ounces of rain water.</p>

The solution will assume a light green color, in consequence of the alloy of copper, which silver money contains.</p>

                  <p>Dissolve one grain of common salt in a glass of rain water, and add to it one drop of the nitric solution of silver, and it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a white color.</p>
                  <p>A double elective attraction takes place; the nitric acid of the nitrate of silver, unites to the soda of the common salt, and forms nitrate of soda, while the muriatic acid of the common salt unites to the silver, and forms muriate of silver, or Luna Cornea, which is precipitated.</p>
