            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BY the Constitution, Government and Laws of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> are a Free People. Their Freedom consists principally, if not wholly, in this general Privilege, that "NO LAWS CAN BE MADE OR ABROGATED, WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMENT."</p>
            <p>By the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> every Commoner hath a Right not to be subjected to Laws made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Consent, and because such Consent (by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great Inconvenience and Confusion attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Numbers, in such Transactions) cannot be given by every individual Man in Person, therefore is the Power of rendering such Consent, lodged in the Hands of Representatives, by them elected and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, for that Purpose. Their Subjection, then, to their Laws, is not forced, but voluntary.</p>
            <p>As the chief Excellency of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution consists in the Subject's being bound only by such Laws to which they themselves Consent, as aforesaid; and as, in order to their enjoying that Right, they are (agreeable to the Constitution) necessarily vested
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009658_0003_0F773A98B01A25E0"/>
with the Power of electing their Representatives; so this Right or Power is a fundamental Privilege, and so essential a Part of the Constitution, that, without it, the Subject cannot be said to be free: Therefore, if he be hindred from voting in such Election, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the lawful Use of that real Right or Privilege, a Suit will lie for him at Common Law.</p>
            <p>None of the Privileges included in those general Rights (which, in an especial Manner, denominate the <hi>British</hi> Subjects a free People) is maintained with greater Care and Circumspection, and of which they are more jealous, than this particular, known, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and fixed one, that No Tax, Loan or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence can be imposed on them, but with their own Consent, by their Representatives in Parliament. This Privilege is of ancient Date, and whenever it hath been encroached upon, has been claimed, struggled for, and recovered, as being essential for the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Liberty, Property, and Freedom of the Subject: For if the Privilege of not being taxed without their Consent, be once taken from them, Liberty and Freedom are certainly gone with it. That Power which can tax as it shall think proper, may govern as it pleases; and those subjected to such Taxations and Government, must be far, very far from being a free People: They cannot, indeed, be said to enjoy even so much as the Shadow of <hi>English</hi> Liberties.</p>
            <p>Upon these general and fundamental Principles, it is conceived that the Parliament (althô it hath a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Authority, a supreme Jurisdiction over all His Majesty's Subjects; yet, as it is also the high and safe Guardian of their Liberties) doth not extend its
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009658_0004_0F773A99443BF048"/>
Taxations to such Parts of the <hi>British</hi> Dominions, as are not represented in that grand Legislature of the Nation; nor is it to be presumed that this wise and vigilant Body will permit such an essential Right, which is as the very Basis of the Constitution, in any Instance, ever to be violated. And upon the same Principles (as is apprehended) those subordinate Jurisdictions or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, which, by Distance, are so separated from <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that they are not and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in Parliament, have always been permitted to have and enjoy Privileges similar to those of their Fellow-Subjects in the Mother Country, that is, of being subjected only to Taxations laid by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Legislatures, wherein they are or may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by Persons, by them elected for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and, consequently of not being taxed without their Consent. Thus, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Taxes are laid by the Parliament of that Kingdom; and, in the Colonies or Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> by the several Assemblies or Legislatures therein.</p>
            <p>These being the essential Rights and Privileges of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution, founded on the Principles of the common Law, thô, in diverse Respects, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly regulated by sundry Statutes, <hi>The King's Subjects in the Plantations,</hi> claim a general Right to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Constitutional Part of them, as their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Right and Inheritance. This claim is founded on such Considerations as follow, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The People in the Colonies and Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> are really, truly, and in every Respect, as much the King's Subjects, as those born and living in <hi>Great Britain</hi> are. "All Persons born in any
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009658_0005_0F773A9AA7F4E990"/>
Part of the King's Dominions, and within his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, are his Subjects; as all those born in <hi>Ireland, Scotland, Wales,</hi> the King's Plantations, or on the <hi>English</hi> Seas; who, by their Birth, owe such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Allegiance to the King, that they cannot, by any Act of theirs, renounce or transfer their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to any foreign Prince." 4 <hi>BAC.</hi> 166.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> All the King's Subjects, both in <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and in the Colonies and Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> have Right to the same general and essential Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution, or those Privileges which denominate them to be a free People.</p>
            <p>As Protection necessarily demands and binds to Subjection and Obedience to that Authority and those Laws whereby a People are protected; so Subjection and Obedience as necessarily and justly Intitle to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: These mutually imply, require, and support each other. The King, as political Head of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, stands equally related to them, in that Capacity, and is as really obligated to protect one Subject as well as another; and as he has an Interest in all his Subjects, so they have an Interest in him, regulated according to the political Constitution. Though the particular and formal Parts of the Governments of the Colonies may be various one from another, and diverse from that of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and such Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Forms or Establishments necessarily arise from their different Situations and Circumstances; yet both Law and Equity agree, in this general Principle that All the King's Subjects ought to be supported and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in their Rights and Liberties, and especially in such as are fundamental and essential to their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009658_0006_0F773A9B12BD6CA0"/>
The Subjects in <hi>Great Britain</hi> are under no greater or stronger Obligations of Submission and Obedience to the Crown, than those in the Colonies are; and surely, if the Colonists are under the same Obligations to Submission and Obedience with other their Fellow Subjects, it will not be easy to shew, that they have not the same Right to be protected and secured in the Enjoyment of every just and legal Privilege.</p>
            <p>Though the Subjects, in the Colonies, are situate at a great Distance from their Mother Country, and, for that Reason, cannot participate in the general Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature of the Nation, nor enjoy some particular formal Immunities possessed by those at Home; yet, as they settled, at this Distance, by Royal Licence and under national Encouragements, and thereby enlarged the <hi>British</hi> Dominions and Commerce, which add Riches and Strength to the Nation; and as they brought with them, and constantly claimed, the general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, those fundamental Principles, which contain the Essence and Spirit of the common Law of the Nation; it may not be justly said they have lost their Birth-Right, by such their Removal into <hi>America;</hi> for to suppose that those Settlements, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of such important and public Services, should be prejudicial to the Claim of the Colonies to the general Privileges of <hi>British</hi> Subjects, would be inconsistent both with Law and Reason, would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lead to unjust and absurd Conclusions, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as those public national Advantages would not have been promoted, unless some of the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had planted, settled and dwelt in his Colonies
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009658_0007_0F773A9B83EECA48"/>
abroad: And yet, that such planting, settling and living, should subject the Inhabitants to the Loss of their essential Rights as <hi>Englishmen,</hi> would be to reward great, public and meritorious Services with great and unspeakable Losses and Disadvantages: And how inconsistent such Measures and Principles are with the Honour and Justice of the <hi>British</hi> Crown and Government, may well deserve Consideration. It therefore seems apparent that the King's Subjects in the Plantations have a Right, and that it is for the Honour of the Crown and the Law, that they should have a Right, to the general and essential Privileges of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution, as well as the Rest of their Fellow-Subjects. And with Regard to the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> in particular, there can be on Question of its having such Right, as these general Privileges and Immunities are fully and explicitly granted and declared to belong to them, by the Royal Charter of Incorporation given to the said Colony by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in the fourteenth Year of his Reign, in which is contained this Paragraph, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <q>And further Our Will and Pleasure is, and We Do, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, Ordain, Declare and Grant, unto the said Governor and Company, and their Successors, that all and every the Subjects of Us, Our Heirs or Successors, which shall go to inhabit within the said Colony; and every of their Children which shall happen to be born there, or on the Seas in going thither or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from thence, shall have and enjoy all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Immunities of free and natural Subjects, within any of the Dominions of Us, Our Heirs or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009658_0008_0F773A9D9C448E98"/>
Successors, to all Intents, Constructions and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses whatsoever, as if they, and every of them, were born within the Realm of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> Now, whether these Words are to be understood only as declarative of the Principles of the ancient Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and of the common Rights of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen,</hi> settled by Royal Licence, and under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Crown, in a Colony or Plantation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and so evidential of the Rights and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to all the King's Subjects in <hi>America;</hi> or whether they are to be consider'd as a Grant and Confirmation of such Privileges and Immunities to His Majesty's Subjects of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> in particular, they equally evince (as far as a Royal Declaration and Grant can operate to that Purpose) the Truth of what is here pleaded for, so far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the People of the said Colony. Indeed these Words (on the general Principles of the Common Law) ought (as is apprehend) to be construed as containing a full Declaration of the Rights of the Subject, and in order to remove all Doubts about the same, a Confirmation of them is annexed to or joined, therewith. It may also be further observed, that by this Paragraph can't be meant or intended that the King's Subjects, within all his Dominions, should have or be governed by the same particular and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Laws or Regulations, because their Situations are in distant Parts of the World, and their Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are so widely different, that the same particular Establishments and formal Regulations, which in one Place might be good and wholesome for the People, in another would be unwholesome, prejudicial, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009658_0009_0F773A9E53703628"/>
by no Means answer the End of Laws: But this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and Confirmation denotes and imports (as is conceived) that all those general and essential Rights which the free and natural Subjects in the Mother Country are possessed of, and vested with, by Virtue of the main, leading, and fundamental Principles of the Common Law of Constitution of the Realm, the King's Subjects, in the said Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> shall have and enjoy, to all Intents, Constructions and Purposes whatsoever, that is, in such Plenitude as always to be, and ever to be treated as, free and natural Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> In order that the King's Subjects in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies and Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> might have and enjoy the like Liberties and Immunities as other their Fellow-Subjects are favoured with, it was and is necessary the Colonies should be vested with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power of Legislation; and this they have accordingly assumed and exercised, from their first regular Settlement, down to this Time, and have been constantly owned and acknowledged therein, treated as having such Authority, and protected in the same by the Crown and the supreme Legislature of the Nation. Those Corporations, which, by their Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Circumstances, are privileged with the Right of electing their Representatives to bear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Part in the general Legislature of the Nation, althô they may be vested with Authority to make By Laws and Regulations, within their own Jurisdictions, agreeable to the Bounds and Limits of the Charters which institute and give them Existence, indeed are, and ought to be, immediately subject to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009658_0010_0F773A9EB473C7B8"/>
the Laws, Orders, and Taxes of such general Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature, as well as others, and that even without being expressly named, for this obvious and solid Reason, because they are legally represented therein: But with Regard to those Corporations or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, by their Distance and Situation, have no possible Opportunity of such a Representation, the Case is far otherwise. Whenever, therefore, Acts are formed by the supreme Legislature, that are, in any Respect, to extend to the Governments abroad, they are made to be so extended by express Words; and even such as are so extended to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects who are not admitted a Representation, or to bear a Part in the Legislation, may not improperly be said to be <hi>sovereign Acts,</hi> or Acts supported by the sovereign Dominion of the Makers of them. And as the Exercise of such sovereign Authority may be said (as is humbly conceived) to be, in some Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure an Exception from the general Rule by which <hi>British</hi> Subjects (according to the Constitution) are governed, it is most justly to be presumed and relied upon that the supreme Guardians of the Liberties of the Subjects, will never extend that Authority further than may be done without depriving any of the King's Subjects of those Privileges which are essential to their Liberty and Freedom, or leave them in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of such Rights and Liberties. It is a clear Point that the Colonies may not, they cannot, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in Parliament; and if they are not vested with legislative Authority within themselves, where they may be represented by Persons of their own electing, it is plain they will not be represented in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009658_0011_0F773A9F46DDE388"/>
any Legislature at all, and, consequently, if they are subjected to any Laws, it must be to such as they have never consented to either by themselves or any Representatives, which will be directly contrary to that before-mentioned fundamental Principle of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution, that "NO LAWS CAN BE MADE Or ABROGATED, WITHOUT THE CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THEIR REPRESEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATIVES." It therefore appears that for the Crown to govern the Colonies and Plantations abroad, by and with the Consent of the People represented in Assemblies or legislative Bodies, is properly and truly to govern them agreeable to the <hi>British</hi> Constitution of Government; and althô this may not, in every Form and Manner, be exactly similar to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Home, yet, as near as the different Situation and Circumstances admit will it agree with the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principles thereof. That the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> (agreeable to these general Principles) is vested with such a legislative Authority, appears by their Charter, full to that Effect. By this Charter the Colony are impowered to meet in a general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, consisting of a Governor or Deputy-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Assistants and Deputies, annually to be chosen by the Freemen: And such Assembly is vested with Authority, from Time to Time, to make, ordain and establish all Manner of wholesome and reasonable Laws, Statutes and Ordinances, Directions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, not contrary to the Laws of the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> and every Officer, appointed for putting such Laws, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from Time to Time, into due Execution, is sufficiently warranted and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009658_0012_0F773AA0ADC3CA30"/>
against the King's Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, by a special Clause, in the same Charter, express to that Purpose. By this Royal Patent it is therefore evident, that a full Power of Legislation is granted to the Colony, limitted with a Restriction that they conform, or are not to act contrary to the general Principles of the Laws of the Nation, and consequently, as when they exceed the Bounds and Limits, prescribed in the Charter, their Acts will be void, so, when they conform and regulate their Acts agreeable to the Intent and Meaning of it, their Acts may properly be said to have the Royal Approbation and Assent. And these Powers, Rights and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Colony has been in Possession of for more than a Century past. This Power of Legislation necessarily includes in it, an Authority to impose Taxes or Duties upon the People for the Support of Government and for the Protection and Defence of the Inhabitants; as, without such Authority, the general Right of Legislation would be of no Avail to them. These Privileges and Immunities, these Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Authorities, the Colony claims, not only in Vertue of their Right to the general Principles of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution, and by Force of the Royal Declaration and Grant in their Favour, but also as having been in the Possession, Enjoyment and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, of them for so long a Time, and constantly owned, acknowledged and allowed to be just in the Claim and Use thereof, by the Crown, the Ministry, and the Parliament; as may evidently be shewn by Royal Instructions, many Letters and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, all supposing and being predicated upon the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009658_0013_0F773AA11EE5CA40"/>
Colony's having and justly exercising these Privileges, Powers and Authorities: And what better Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for, or greater Evidence of, such Rights can be demanded or produced, is certainly difficult to be imagined.</p>
            <p>These Points being thus rendered so clear and evident, may it not thence be very justly inferred,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> That charging Stamp Duties, or other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Taxes, on the Colonies, in <hi>America,</hi> by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Authority, will be an Infringment of the formentioned Rights and Privileges, and deprive the Colonists of their Freedom and Inheritance, so far as such Taxations extend? The charging a Tax on any particular Part of the Subject's Estates in the Plantations, by Authority of Parliament, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less be found Nothing less than taking from them a Part of their Estates on the sole Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their being able to bear it, or of having a Sufficiency left notwithstanding. It must certainly be admitted that the People thus charged, do not consent, nor have any Opportunity so to do. An express Consent, either by themselves or Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, can by no Means be pretended, neither can their Consent be argued from Implication, as their Subjection and Allegiance to the Crown, are supposed to be according to the Tenor of the Laws of the Nation, for althô the King is stiled the Head of the Common Wealth, Supreme Governor, <hi>Parens Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae, &amp;c.</hi> yet is he still to make the Law of the Land the Rule of his Government, that being the Measure as well of his Power as of the Subjects O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; for as the Law asserts, maintains and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009658_0014_0F773AA183937F30"/>
for the Safety of the King's Royal Person, Crown and Dignity, and all his just Rights, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, Powers and Prerogatives, so it likewise declares and asserts the Rights and Liberties of the Subject. [4 <hi>Bac.</hi> 149.] Therefore, in this Case, as there can be no other implied Consent than what the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Principles of the Law or Constitution implies, or what is included in the Obligations to Submission and Obedience to Laws. And as the general, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principles of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution or Laws, which the <hi>Americans</hi> claim the Privilege of, are quite the Reverse of such Implications, and really imply and suppose the Contrary, it follows that charging such Taxes will be to take Part of their Estates from the People without their Consent, either expressed or implied; it can't be said such Charging would be founded on Contract, as it might be where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are represented in the Legislature; neither may it be founded on a Forfeiture, as there is no Pretence of that Kind in these Cases; surely, then, there can be no Right either to demand or receive a Man's Estate, where both these are wanting.</p>
            <p>If these internal Taxations take Place, and the Principles upon which they must be founded, are adopted and carried into Execution, the Colonies will have no more than a Shew of Legislation left, nor the King's Subjects in them, any more than the Shadow of true <hi>English</hi> Liberty; for the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which will justify such a Tax of a Penny, will warrant a Tax of a Pound, an hundred, or a thousand Pounds, and so on without Limitation; and if they will warrant a Tax on one Article, they will support

óne on as many Particulars as shall be thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to raise any Sum proposed. And all such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, Burthens, and Deprivations, if they take Place with Respect to the King's Subjects abroad, will be without their Consent, without their having Opportunity to be represented, or to shew their Ability, Disability, or Circumstances. They will no longer enjoy that fundamental Privilege of <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> whereby, in special, they are denominated a free People. The legislative Authority of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, will, in Part, actually be cut off, a Part of the same will be taken out of their own Assemblies, even such Part as they have enjoyed so long, and esteem most dear; nay, may it not be truly said, in this Case, that the Assemblies in the Colonies will have left no other Power or Authority, and the People no other Freedom, Estates, or Privileges, than what may be called a Tenancy at Will? that they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, or rather lost, those Privileges and Rights, which, according to the national Constitution, were their Birth-Right and Inheritance, for such a disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Tenancy? Will not such Determinations amount to plain Declarations, to the Colonies, that althô they have enjoyed those Immunities and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges heretofore, and been acknowledged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the Possession and Use of them, yet now they must expect, for Reasons of State, for some public Utility, to part with them, and be brought under a Kind of Subjection not far from the very Reverse of that Freedom they justly claim and so highly value? May it not be enquired what Reasons are or may be assigned for so different Treatment of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009658_0016_0F773AA3C47265B0"/>
the Subjects of the same Most Gracious King, of the same general State or Community? May it not, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, be concluded, that charging Stamp Duties, or other internal Duties, by Authority of Parliament, as has been mentioned, will be such an Infringment of the Rights, Privileges and Authorities of the Colonies, that it may be humbly and firmly trusted, and even relied upon, that the supreme Guardians of the Liberties of the Subject, will not suffer the same to be done, and will not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them in the Enjoyment of their just Rights, but treat them with great Tenderness, Indulgence and Favour?</p>

               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>To Objections and Observations of this Kind, it may be answered, that as the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is most certainly vested with the supreme Authority of the Nation, and its Jurisdiction and Power most capacious and transcendent, the Colonies will be far, very far from urging or even attempting any Thing in Derogation of the Power or Authority
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009658_0017_0F773AA48B798BB8"/>
of that august Assembly, or pretending to prescribe Bounds or Limits to the Exercise of their Dominion; nothing in the foregoing Observations besure, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, by way of Objection, but that the Crown by its Prerogative, or the Parliament by its supreme and general Jurisdiction, may justly order and do some Things, which may affect the Property of the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Subjects, in a Way which, in some Sense, may be said to be independent upon or without the Will or Consent of the People, as by Regulations of Trade and Commerce and the like; and by general Orders relative to and Restrictions of their Conduct for the Good of the Whole: For as the Colonies are so many Governments independent on each other, or not subjected the one to the other, they can only establish Regulations within and for themselves respectively; and as they are all subordinate to and dependent upon the Mother Country, and Propriety, Conveniency and even Necessity require that they should be subject to some General Superintendancy and Controul, in order that the general Course of their Trade and Business should be so uniform as to center in some general national Interest, it becomes plainly expedient that there should be some supreme Director over all His Majesty's Dominions; and this Character and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, all Men must acknowledge and allow, properly belong to the <hi>British</hi> Parliament. Against the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of such general Jurisdiction, for the common Interest and Advantage of the Mother Country and of the Plantations, collectively taken, the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Observations are in no Measure intended; for it is humbly conceived, that the Subjects in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009658_0018_0F773AA5619EF2E8"/>
may enjoy their Rights, Privileges and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, as <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and yet, for political Reasons, be restrained from some particular Correspondence or Branches of Trade and Commerce, or may be subjected therein to such Duties, Charges and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, as the supreme Power may judge proper to establish as so many Conditions of enjoying such Trade. Reasons of State may render it expedient to prohibit some Branches of Trade and to burden others as aforesaid. And as such Regulations will doubtless appear, upon Examination, rather to be a preventing the Subject from acquiring Property, than taking it from him, after it is legally become his own, the Objections relative to such Establishment, ought to be only against those that may be supposed unequal, unprofitable, or not expedient, the Determination of which must nevertheless be left to the supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Nation. What therefore is designed to be urged from these general Principles of the <hi>British</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, is, that the Legislatures of the Colonies ought to be left entire, and that His Majesty's good Subjects in them should be permitted the continued Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their essential Rights, Immunities and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, which will not, as is supposed, by any Means be the Case, if the internal Taxations before mentioned should take Place. But if Restrictions on Navigation, Commerce, or other external Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only are established, the internal Government, Powers of taxing for its Support, an Exemption from being taxed without Consent, and other Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which legally belong to the Subjects of each Colony, agreeable to their own particular Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009658_0019_0F773AA61E4509E8"/>
will be and continue in the Substance of them whole and entire; Life, Liberty and Property, in the true Use of the Terms, will then remain secure and untouched.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="objection">
               <head>OBJECTION.</head>
               <p>On this Distinction it may perhaps be further said, by Way of Objection, that a Stamp Duty differs from a Tax, as it will oblige the Subjects only to pay for Paper, Parchment, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> which they are at Liberty to use or not to use, at Pleasure; and so, if they chuse to make use of it, they voluntarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Charge, and can't be said to be taxed without their Consent.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>This by no Means will obviate the Arguments; for a Regulation which necessarily obliges a Man to part with any certain Portion of his Estate, amounts to the same Thing as the actual taking such Portion from him. It must be supposed that the People in <hi>America</hi> will buy and fell their Lands, nay, in a Multitude of Instances, they would not know how to subsist without such Dispositions: They will also be necessitated to give and take Obligations, and to use Paper for various other Purposes, or there will be of Course, so great a Stagnation of Business as almost to bring on a Dissolution of their civil and political Existence. These Things will be found as necessary as the Use of Agriculture itself. They will therefore be as certainly taxed by a Duty charged on the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of their Lands, as by a Tax laid directly on the Land itself. If Lands were to be taxed, it might as well be said, People are not obliged to have Lands
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009658_0020_0F773AA752EA4130"/>
(and indeed some have none) so that such as do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them, voluntarily submit to the Charge, which is really saying Nothing to the Purpose, for the Use and Improvement of Lands Barter, and Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Property are as necessary in civilized Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as Food and Raiment are to the Body natural. Indeed the Supposition of the Necessity and certain Use of the Articles to be charged, can be the only Foundation to render a Revenue arising therefrom worthy of Notice, as otherwise the Effect would be altogether precarious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> Another Reason offered as an Objection against charging Stamp Duties, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> in the Colonies, may be drawn from the Consequence of such a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as it is most probable, if not certain, it will, in the Event, prove prejudicial to <hi>Great Britain</hi> itself. The Colonies and Plantations in <hi>America</hi> are, indeed, of great Importance to their Mother Country and an Interest worthy of her most tender Regard: The more they prosper and increase in Number, Riches and Commerce, the greater will be the Advantage not only to them but also to the Nation at Home. In the Colonies there is a Vent for and a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of almost all Sorts of <hi>British</hi> Manufactures, and of many and various Kinds of Goods of the Produce of other Countries, first imported into <hi>Britain</hi> and from thence brought into the Plantations, whereby the Revenue of the Crown and Wealth of the Nation are much encreased, at the Expence of the Colonies; for these Goods the Colonies make Remittances with what Monies they are able to collect, in a Variety of their own Produce, and by circular Trade; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009658_0021_0F773AA7C37D66F0"/>
the whole Trade together, it amounts, to a very great Sum, the Profits of which in general center in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> If the Plantations are encouraged and prosper, this will be an increasing Interest and become more and more of Importance; but if Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures should be taken, which, in Regard to them, would have a natural Tendency to abate their Vigour, Spirit and Industry, or to turn them into some other Channel, to supply the Necessaries of Life, what can be expected but a Decrease of the Colonies Wealth and Prosperity, and consequently a Decay of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant national Interest. And as, on the one Hand, depriving the Colonies of Part of their Powers and Privileges and rendering the Tenures of them and of their Liberties and Properties precarious, as by charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stamp Duties or other internal Taxes upon them by Act of Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will naturally produce that unhappy Effect of causing the Colonies to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and decrease; so, on the other Hand, uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and continuing the Freedom of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, maintaining their Authority, their Laws, securing their Properties, considering and treating their Privileges and Immunities as Matters too sacred to be violated, will naturally tend to invigorate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven and encourage the People, and keep up in them a Spirit of Industry in all Kinds of Dealing and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of Emulation in the Service of their Mother Country, whereby they will become more able and zealous to promote the national Interest. This will doubtless be found almost universally to be the Case of a People where they enjoy Liberty, and their Lives, Properties and Privileges are secure, and the Reverse
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009658_0022_0F773AA8447E67E8"/>
of it as generally to be the Consequence of a contrary Treatment; for what Encouragement hath the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to expose his Interest to Chances and Dangers, the Farmer, the Mechanic and the common Labourer to weary themselves in their fatiguing toilsome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, if, after all, Part of their Estates (and how great a Part is to them altogether uncertain) may be taken from them, and in such Ways and Manner as they have heretofore been led to think are inconsistent with their essential Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties? Surely then, if subjecting the Colonies to Burdens which will discourage and abate their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, will eventually prove disadvantageous to the Mother Country, and the charging of Stamp Duties or other internal Taxes on them, will, in the End, have that Effect (as has been endeavoured to be shewn and evinced) the taking such a Measure must be inconsistent with good Policy and the true Interest of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> Furthermore to enforce the Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Stamp Duties or other internal Taxations, it is conceived that a summary Representation of the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, special Services and Circumstances of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> may be here, with great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety adduced, from whence very cogent Reasons may be drawn in their Favour.</p>
               <p>The first Settlers of the Colony, who were derived from <hi>England,</hi> their native Country, planted here in the Year 1636, and having purchased their Lands, or rather a Right of Pre-emption of the Crown, or the King's Patentees, they were obliged to Purchase the greatest Part of them again of the native Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Possessors, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009658_0023_0F773AAA3570EC68"/>
Proprietors of the Country, and some other Part was obtained at a much dearer Rate, which was by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; for the People of these new Settlements, scarce of one Year's Date, and very small, were forced, for the Defence of their Lives and those Settlements, which in a fair and equitable Manner they had made, to enter into a War with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Tribe of <hi>Indians,</hi> then in this Part of the Country, who rose with all their barbarous, insidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, crafty Force and Cruelty to rout these new Settlers out of the Country, as the first Effort of their set and declared Design to break up and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Settlement of <hi>New-England.</hi> Against this numerous and powerful Tribe, enraged with Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy at the <hi>English,</hi> these Planters, who were able to raise but about fourscore Men, took up Arms, and, by the Smiles of Heaven, in sundry severe Conflicts, overthrew, conquered and effectually sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued these their crafty, bloody and inveterate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies. And as this was the first <hi>Indian</hi> War in <hi>New-England,</hi> and issued so Successfully on the Part of the <hi>English,</hi> whose Courage, Force and Conduct in War now became the Dread and Terror of the Natives throughout the Land, it laid a Foundation for Tranquility in general for almost forty Years after, which gave a most favourable Opportunity for the Settlements in the Country to multiply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in Strength and Vigour.</p>
               <p>The Plantation and Settlement of the Colony, by the Year 1661, being considerably increased, they made Application to the Crown for a Charter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, with Powers of Government, founded
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009658_0024_0F773AAA980DCA88"/>
on the general Principles of the <hi>English,</hi> now <hi>British</hi> Constitution, that is to say, that they might be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned with the Consent of the People represented in an Assembly composed of Members elected for that Purpose; and, in Consequence of such Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in the 14th Year of his Reign, granted his Royal Charter to the said Colony, the Preamble of which is worthy of special Notice, as in it are these Words. <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Whereas, by the several Navigations, Discoveries; and successful Plantations, diverse of our loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this our Realm of</hi> England, <hi> several Lands, Islands, Places, Colonies, and Plantations have been obtained and settled in that Part of the Continent of</hi> America <hi>Called</hi> New-England, <hi>and thereby the Trade and Commerce there hath been of late Years much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased: And whereas we have been informed, by the humble Petition of our trusty and well-beloved</hi> John Winthrop, John Mason, &amp;c. <hi>being Persons princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally interested in our Colony or Plantation of</hi> Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut <hi>in</hi> New-England, <hi>that the same Colony, or the greatest Part thereof, was purchased and obtained for great and valuable Considerations, and some other Part thereof gained by Conquest and with much Difficulty and at the only Endeavours, Expence and Charges of them and their Associates and those under whom they claim, subdued and improved, and thereby become a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enlargement and Addition to our Dominions and Interest there: Now, know ye, that</hi> IN CONSIDERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION THEREOF," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hereby it appears that this Charter was granted upon valuable Considerations, which adds Weight
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009658_0025_0F773AAB905A6AA8"/>
and Strength to the Title on which the Claim of the Colony to the Rights, Immunities, and Franchises therein granted and confirmed are founded, for here are the Considerations of large Sums of Money ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, Conquest made at the Expence of the Blood and Treasure of the Planters, eminent publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Services performed and to be performed, and all to the Enlargement of the King's Dominions and for the Increase of the national Commerce, which the Charter is a clear and full Evidence of. The Powers and Privileges granted by this Charter were properly the Purchase of the People, and the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was an Instance of Royal Justice to them, thô the Grace and Favour of the Crown assuredly ought to be and hath been at all Times humbly and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledged therein. Therefore as there really were valuable Considerations which were prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Foundations for such a Grant, it was doubtless judged to be for the Honour of the Crown to grant the Powers of Government with such ample and beneficial Immunities and Privileges as are allowed and given in and by the Charter aforesaid; and these the People indeed look upon as the Purchase of their Ancestors, as a gracious and royal Reward of the Merit and Services of their Forefathers, and as one of the best Inheritances they left to their Children; whether therefore it can be consistent with Law of Equity they should be deprived of such an Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or any Part thereof, may be worthy of serious Consideration: For if the Right of a single Person to vote in the Election of a Member of Parliament be so sacred in the Eye of the Law, that to deprive him
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009658_0026_0F773AAC05E9C370"/>
of it, entitles to an Action at Common Law for his Damages and the Violation of his Privileges, as was adjudged in the House of Lords, in the Case of <hi>Ashby</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> how sacred then ought the Powers, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Immunities of a whole Colony of loyal People, of all the Freemen in it, to be look'd upon and considered? And of what Importance is it they should be defended and protected therein? As the Enjoyment of such Privileges and Liberties, of such a free Constitution of Government naturally tends to promote Loyalty and Obedience in a People, so the Inhabitants of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> (without arrogating) may, with the strictest Veracity, say and insist, that none of the Colonies in the <hi>British</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, have approved themselves more loyal and obedient to the King's Majesty, or more forward and zealous for promoting his Service, then they have constantly done. These Principles of Loyalty and Zeal, the natural Result of Liberty and Freedom, have influenced the Colony to exert itself with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming vigorous Spirit and Resolution in public and benevolent Services, whenever they have been called upon or applied to for that Purpose. It hath not only defended itself in its infant State against the violent Insurrections of the <hi>Indians</hi> who formerly lived near or dwelt among them, and at all Times down to the present Day, against all its Enemies, but also, as it increased in Numbers and Strength, hath from Time to Time, afforded Aid, Succour and Relief to the neighbouring Colonies. It is found, by ancient, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, that the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> united with, and at large Expence and to most remarkable Effect,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009658_0027_0F773AACC50A2D28"/>
assisted the other Colonies in carrying on the famous <hi>Indian</hi> War called the <hi>Narraganset</hi> War, which raged about the Year 1675, when (after a shocking De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the <hi>English</hi> People, their infant Towns and Settlements) those Barbarians were totally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and the distressed Country thereby saved from impending Ruin.</p>
               <p>From the Year 1688 to about 1695, <hi>Connecticut,</hi> at sundry Times and as Occasions required, furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expeditious Aid and Succour to the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> for the Defence and Protection of <hi>Albany</hi> and other Places, then exposed to frequent Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> in which Service, at the several Times of their Distress, were employ'd about five Hundred Men, at the Charge and Expence of the Colony, the Amount whereof appears to be about five Thousand Pounds. Within the same Times, Help and Relief were repeatedly raised and sent forward, with great Expedition, for the Defence of the Frontiers in the County of <hi>Hampshire,</hi> in the Province of the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily tended to the Safety, Encouragement and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the People there, and was gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and certified by some of the principle Men in those Parts. The Expence of these Services to the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> (besides the Loss of Lives in several Encounters) amounted to near two Thousand Pounds.</p>
               <p>It appears also that the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> in the Years 1703, 4, 5, and 6, on repeated Alarms, Occasioned by Irruptions of the Enemy, on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Towns and Places in the Province of the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachusetts-Bay,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:009658_0028_0F773AADD8EC2080"/>
raised and sent Numbers of Men for the Relief, Succour and Defence of the Inhabitants in those Parts. These Men were generally sent on Horseback for the Sake of Expedition, the Occasions being urgent, thô at some Times on Foot. And as those Alarms were frequent, the Succours were sent in about twenty several Parties succeeding one another. The Number of Men employed in those Services was about seventeen Hundred and of Horse near nine Hundred. And the total Expence occasioned thereby to the Colony (as may be still shewn by the Accounts thereof) amounted to near eleven Thousand Pounds. The Currency in those Times was about three-fourths the Value of Sterling Money. All these Services were voluntarily performed by the small Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> for the Relief and Protection of their Fellow-Subjects in the other Colonies (one of which in particular was under the immediate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Crown) without receiving either Money or any other Aid from the Crown, or from the neighbouring Provinces.</p>
               <p>In the Expedition in 1710 against <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> now <hi>Annapolis,</hi> when it was taken from the <hi>French,</hi> and the costly disastrous Expeditions set on Foot against <hi>Canada</hi> in 1709 and 1711, the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> bore a full Proportion of Expence and sustained a very great Loss of Men. And the Colony failed not likewise of bearing a large Share in that memorable Expedition formed by the <hi>New-England</hi> Governments against <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> in 1745, when it was reduced to the Obedience of the <hi>British</hi> Crown. This was a seasonable an important Conquest, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009658_0029_0F773AAE444D8448"/>
will not be forgotten, while the principal Articles which served as a Basis for restoring the Peace to <hi>Europe</hi> that followed it, are had in Remembrance.</p>
               <p>But the more recent Instances of the Loyalty, Zeal and Serviceableness of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> are such as follow.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1755, when Forces were raised by the Northern Colonies for removing Encroachments made on His Majesty's Territories in <hi>America,</hi> by the <hi>French, Connecticut</hi> raised a Thousand Men for that Service, and also two Thousand more the same Year to reinforce the Army at <hi>Lake George,</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended too weak to withstand the Enemy. This Number was two or three Times the Proportion of <hi>Connecticut</hi> compared with some other Colonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that Expedition. In 1756 it raised two Thousand five Hundred Men, which was double the Number proposed by the King's Commander in Chief for the Colony's Proportion in the Service of that Year. This was done by the Colony as it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the southern Colonies would fail of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion allotted for them to raise; and left the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice should suffer, it exerted itself in such duplicate Proportion. In 1757, the Proportion demanded by His Majesty's Commander in Chief, for the Service of that Year, being fourteen Hundred Men, the Colony not only raised that Number, but also, on Intelligence of the Attack on Fort <hi>William Henry,</hi> speedily sent forward about five Thousand of the Militia, for the Relief of that Fortress and Protection of the Country, then in great Consternation in those Parts. And in 1758 an Expedition was set on Foot
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009658_0030_0F773AB0B5BDB4A8"/>
for the Reduction of <hi>Canada,</hi> and the Colonies being called upon by the Crown, to raise as many Men as the Number of their Inhabitants would admit of; and as it was apprehended that in Case of Success, an End would be put to the War in these Parts by that Year's Campaign, <hi>Connecticut</hi> exerted itself beyond all former Efforts, in Hopes of its being the finishing Stroke, and accordingly agreed to raise five Thousand Men, and actually had but few short of that Number in the Field. But as this important Design failed of Accomplishment at that Time, the Colony, by Royal Direction, was called upon strenuously to exert itself in the like Service, in 1759, and even until the End of the War. And as what hath been done by the Colonies, on that extraordinary Occasion, in 1758, seem'd constantly to be made the Rule of Demand upon them afterwards, the annual Requisition of the Crown proved exceeding heavy upon the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> for it had indeed exerted itself vastly beyond its Ability, and any just Proportion in that Year; yet nevertheless they agreed to raise the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber demanded in every succeeding Year of the War, being spirited, as far as possible to yield the strictest Obedience to the King's Commands, and determined to persevere in his Service with the utmost Efforts. And in the present Year 1764, the Colony hath raised upwards of two Hundred and fifty Men for the Annoyance of the <hi>Indians</hi> and Protection of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Subjects in other Governments. These Troops are now out on Service at the Direction of the King's Commander in Chief in <hi>North-America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these Services, from the Year 1755 to the Year
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009658_0031_0F773AB1CE74CE40"/>
1762 inclusive, the Expences of the Colony, over and above the parliamentary Grants (which have been received with the most sensible and humble Gratitude) amounts to upwards of four hundred thousand Pounds; the large Arrears of which Sum will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a heavy distressing Burden upon the People for many Years to come. Moreover several Thousands of the hardiest and most able young Men, the Hope and Strength of the Farmers, have been destroyed, lost, and enervated in the many distant arduous Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, during the Course of this terrible War. The Husbandary of the Country (its only Resource) has suffered and still suffers extremely hereby; and the Colony will not recover itself from these Disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a long Tract of Time. And althô, by the Success of the military Operations in <hi>America,</hi> large, extensive and most valuable Acquisitions have been made to the <hi>British</hi> Dominions, yet the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> gains Nothing thereby, further than as it may be said to be concerned in the Common Cause and general Interest of the Whole. It had no Lands to recover or even to secure from the Enemy, as some other Governments had; it hath no immediate Trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> nor will its Situation admit of any but what may, by some Individuals, be carried on through and so subject to the Controul of other Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The Profits of this Trade have ever been mostly in the Hands of those whose Proimity gave them peculiar Advantages for it. Nay, instead of receiving particular Benefit by these Events, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony will rather suffer Disadvantage thereby, in the Emigration of its Inhabitants, already thinned, for
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009658_0032_0F773AB20B74A5D0"/>
Settlement of the vacant Lands in other Provinces, which are now secure from the Enemy who formerly annoyed them. Therefore Principles of Loyalty and Zeal for the King's Service, Principles of Benevolence, Humanity and Compassion for their Fellow-Subjects in Danger and Distress and the agreeable Prospect, a laudable Desire of enjoying Quiet and Peace, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of a general Tranquility in the Land, must be considered as the genuine Motives and Springs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to exert itself in the Manner and to the Degrees before mentioned.</p>
               <p>And now, when all these Things are duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and viewed in a proper Light, will it not be thought that the Colony has good Reason to hope and expect, in Return for and in Consequence of such Services, if not to be indulged with greater and more extensive Favours from the Crown and Nation, at least to be protected and secured in the full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Rights and Privileges essential to the Freedom of <hi>Englishmen,</hi> instead of having those Rights curtailed or infringed, by charging on them a Stamp Duty, as proposed, or any other the like new and unprecedented Taxation.</p>

               <head>OBJECTION.</head>
               <p>Perhaps, after all that hath been offered, it will be objected by some that <hi>America</hi> ought, and is able to bear a just Proportion of the <hi>American</hi> Expence; and that as the Duty already charged will, they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, not be sufficient to defray that Expence, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes necessary to make Additions to the Duties already laid.</p>

               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> In order to obviate and answer this Objection it may be necessary to enter a little into a Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Occasion and Nature of those Charges which, by some are denominated <hi>American</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. That Expence which is occasioned mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Defence and Protection of the new Governments and Acquisitions, it is conceived ought not to be charged upon the Colonies in general, as it is truly no other than a national Interest, or an Interest of the particular new Governments or Acquisitions, and consequently ought, where it is not purely national, to be laid on those whose immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Profit is advanced thereby. The old Colonies, especially <hi>New-England,</hi> were at the sole Charge of settling and defending themselves, and that they should now be compelled to contribute towards settling others, under much better Advantages in that Regard than they were, will not fail of being esteemed hard and injurious. If the Expence arises in defending and securing the Fur Trade and the Out-Posts requisite for carrying on the same, to oblige these Colonies which receive no immediate Advantage by it, to bear a proportionable Part of the Burden, will also be hard and unequal, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if that Trade is sufficiently profitable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port itself, if otherwise, why is there so much Care and mighty Attention constantly exercised towards it. If the Expence occurs in holding and protecting the new and large Acquisitions, wherefore should the Colonies bear that, when they have no Interest
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009658_0034_0F773AB38E562A80"/>
in them? they do indeed properly belong to the Crown, and will finally be disposed of and settled for the Benefit of the Crown and the Nation in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, and not for the Advantage of the Colonies in particular. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> What <hi>America</hi>'s proportionable Part in the <hi>American</hi> Expence will be, is somewhat uncertain and difficult to determine: And in order to form any tolerable Judgment in the Case, it will be necessary to consider the Wealth of the Colonies, compared with the Mother Country, their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Inhabitants, compared with the Extent of their own Country; the Nature of their Climates, in some of which the cold Seasons are of such long Continuance, as to occasion a Consumption of the greatest Part of their Produce, their Trade and Commerce, the Profits of which in general center in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> their Business, Advantages and Disadvantages and other Circumstances, such as their being, in a general Way, obliged to spend so great a Proportion of their Labour in clearing, fencing and preparing their Lands for Improvement; and that the Surplus of their Labour, in many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is but very little and in some Nothing at all. The clear Profits therefore to the Colonies being so very inconsiderable, it must surely be found, on a just and reasonable Computation, that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of any general national Expence, if any Thing, will be very small. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> If, notwithstanding, it shall be judged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary (which is even a difficult Supposition) to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009658_0035_0F773AB4F418C2F0"/>
make an Addition to the Charges on <hi>America,</hi> yet is it humbly conceived, for the Reasons already of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, it will not by any Means ever be thought proper or just in order to effect that Purpose, it should be done in a Way that shall be an Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Constitutions of the Colonies, or that will deprive the Subjects in them of some of those important Liberties and Privileges, which, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen</hi> and Freemen they so justly value, and have a legal and equitable Right to, as well as the Rest of their Fellow-Subjects. Revenues are never raised in <hi>Great Britain</hi> by a Violation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitution or any Part of it, but the Liberties and Privileges of the Subjects are always saved and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in those Cases; and why the <hi>Americans</hi> should not value their Privileges at as high a Rate as their Fellow-Subjects in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> do theirs, and wherefore the same Justice is not due to the one as to the other, what sufficient Reasons can possibly be assigned? Therefore whatever may be done in this Matter, it is humbly trusted will surely be effected in such Manner as to leave the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Colonies entire, and the People in the full Possession and Enjoyment of their just Rights and Immunities. This, it is conceived, might be effected by a Duty (if thought necessary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) on the Importation of Negroes, and on the Fur Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for althô that on Slaves may and doubtless will fall with most Weight where the greatest Numbers are imported, yet will none be charged thereby but such as voluntarily submit
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009658_0036_0F773AB5575D9140"/>
to it, and was such Importation lessened, which might indeed be some Disadvantage to a few Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, yet probably it would be attended with many salutary Effects, both with Respect to <hi>Great Britain</hi> and her Colonies in general. And as a principle Article of the Expence in <hi>America</hi> must be for protecting and securing the Fur Trade, what good Reasons can be adduced wherefore that Trade should not be so charged as to support itself? for (as hath been already hinted) if it will not bear this Charge, why is it still held and maintained at such great Expence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus shewn that the</hi> English <hi>are a free People; that their Freedom consists in these general Privileges, that</hi> No Laws can be made or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated without their Consent by Representatives, <hi>and for that Purpose have Right to elect their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives; that the</hi> American <hi>Colonists are as really the King's Subjects, as loyal, and have as much Right to the general and fundamental Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the</hi> British <hi>Constitution, and to Protection in the Enjoyment thereof, as the Rest of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects in the Mother Country; that, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence hereof the Colonies and Plantations in</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, <hi>according to the general Principles of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Constitution, are vested with Authority of Legislation, and have Right to be represented in their Assemblies, in whom that Authority is lodged, and with whose Consent they are to be governed by the Crown; that for the Crown to govern these Colonies
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009658_0037_0F773AB5C706A520"/>
and Plantations by and with the Consent of the People in such legislative Assemblies, is properly and truly to govern them agreeable to the national Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or that it is as conformable to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principles of the</hi> British <hi>Government that the Subjects in the Colonies should be represented in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies or legislative Bodies, as that the Subjects in</hi> Great Britain <hi>should be represented in Parliament or the supreme Legislature of the Nation, and that the Government of the Subjects, with the Consent of their respective Representatives, is founded on the same general and essential Principles of Liberty: That charging Stamp Duties, or internal Taxes on the Colony, by Authority of Parliament will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with those Authorities and Privileges which the Colonies, and the People in them legally enjoy, and have, with the Approbation of the Supreme Power of the Nation, been in the Use and Possession of for a long Course of Years; as also the Probability that such Measures will, in the Event, prove prejudicial to the national Interest as well as hurtful to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, together with some Matters and Circumstances more directly and peculiarly in Favour of the Colony of</hi> Connecticut, <hi>and the especial public and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Services performed by it on many Occasions, which may justly merit some favourable Considerations; and answered such Objections as might probably be made against the Tenor of the Reasonings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations herein offered and laid down; it is now concluded, that on the Account of these and such other
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009658_0038_0F773AB683C81038"/>
weighty Reasons as may occur, a</hi> British <hi>Parliament whose Design is to keep up that Constitution, Support the Honour and Prerogative of the Crown, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Privileges of the People, will have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Regard for the Rights and Immunities of the King's Subjects in the</hi> American <hi>Colonies, and charge no internal Taxations upon them without their Consent.</hi>
