         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And he ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining after rain.</p>

               <hi>David</hi> is here: He was a Royal Prophet, and ſpake as inſpir'd by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> v.2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his Word was in my Tongue.</hi> The Spirit of God ſuggeſted theſe words to him, and govern'd him in the delivery of them: 2 Pet. 1.21. <hi>For the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> They were under the unerring guidance of this Divine Perſon as to the Matter and Words of the holy Scriptures; ſo that what they thus ſpake muſt be receiv'd not as the <hi>Word of Man,</hi> but as it is in truth, the <hi>Word of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND here I may obſerve by the way, That inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it follows in the Words of my Text, The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me—Some ſuppoſe here's an intimation of the Three glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perſons in the Trinity; The Father, the GOD of Iſrael, the Son, the Rock of Iſrael, and the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, who ſpake by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and particularly <hi>by the Mouth of his ſervant David.</hi> Whether this be the Truth of this Place or no, It is certainly a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article of our holy Religion, to be firmly believ'd becauſe GOD hath reveal'd it. 1 Joh 5.7. <hi>For there are Three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Words of my Text, We may obſerve, 1. <hi>The Perſons ſpeaking</hi>: The GOD of Iſrael ſaid. GOD is in a peculiar Manner the GOD of his Iſrael, their Covenant GOD. The Rock of Iſrael; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by whom, as we have already hinted, ſome underſtand the Son of GOD, who is One with his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002583_0006_0FE5D43639168468"/>
Eternal Father in the Divine Eſſence, and is the Rock on whom the Church is built, the Strength and Support, Defence and Safety of his People. 2. We may obſerve, <hi>to, or of whom —. To me,</hi> i. e. To <hi>David,</hi> by way of <hi>Precept</hi>; or <hi>of me,</hi> i. e. of him, or his Houſe, by way of Prediction and <hi>Promiſe.</hi> 3. <hi>What is ſaid.</hi> He that ruleth over Men —. Some underſtand theſe Words as a Prophecy, and read them after this manner, There ſhall be a Ruler over Men, or among Men, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> 
               <q>who tho' he be the inviſible GOD, yet ſhall viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear &amp; Rule among Men.</q> Thus the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Prophecy of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and of his Kingdom, who is in an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Senſe, <hi>the Juſt One,</hi> and being filled with the Spirit, deſerved this Character in Perfection, both reſpecting his Perſonal Qualifications, and the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fruits of his Reign; which are truly more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and of greater and more extenſive Uſefulneſs than the Light or Rain of Heaven. And thus it may be ſuppos'd that <hi>David</hi> reflecting on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities already brought on his Houſe, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing by the Spirit, that the Glory of it would ſtill further decay and fade as a Leaf; refreſheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Conſideration of the Coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> his Son and Succeſſor, and his Lord, in whoſe moſt righteous &amp; happy Government, not his Family and People only; but even the whole World were to be Bleſſed. And this Senſe may ſeem to be favoured by what immediately follows, Ver. 5. <hi>Altho' my houſe be not ſo with God; yet he hath made with me an Everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002583_0007_0FE5D4384011D280"/>
my deſire, altho' he make it not to grow.</hi> But then, others underſtand theſe Words as ſpoken to <hi>David</hi> by way of Precept, <q>and ſo they are a Declaration of the Duty of Kings, particularly of <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son and of his Succeſſors the Kings of Iſrael, for whoſe Inſtruction he gives this Rule.</q> Our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation favours this Interpretation. And indeed theſe Words contain an Excellent Deſcription of the Duty of Civil Magiſtrates, of the King as Supream, and of ſuch as are under him in place of Power. They muſt be Juſt towards Men, which in the large Senſe of the Word, comprehends the whole of our Duty towards our Neighbour, according to the Place and Relation we ſuſtain, and ſo includes Clemency, Mercy, and the like, which in ſome Caſes are Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And then this Juſtice to Men muſt flow from an inward Principle of holy Fear towards GOD, who is the Fountain of all Power, and be regulated by it. And then, the 4th Ver. <hi>He ſhall be as the light of the Morning —.</hi> May be a Deſcription of the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp; Glory of ſuch Rulers, and of the happy Fruits and Effects of their Adminiſtrations with reſpect to the People under their Government. God will be Preſent with ſuch to uphold and ſucceed them, ſo that they ſhall come in, and go out before God's People in the Strength of the Lord, as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might; and come down upon them as the Rain, as the ſhowers that water the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6. They ſhall be to the <hi>Moral World,</hi> what the Sun and Rain are to the <hi>Natural, Great</hi> and Extenſive Bleſſings; and their Wiſe and Juſt Government will, by the Bleſſing of GOD pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Fruits no leſs grateful and beneficial to their

People. Now, it is with an eſpecial regard to this Reading that I have choſen theſe Words; however the other, which may well enough conſiſt with it, taking <hi>Solomon</hi> as a Type of <hi>Christ,</hi> is ſo noble and excellent in it ſelf; and ſo profitable for us all, and particularly for Civil Rulers to M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ditate upon, that I ſhall not wholly omit it. In the words then we may obſerve theſe Four Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> GOD is the Rock of Iſrael. <hi>II.</hi> The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath the Supreme Government over Men by God's appointment, and his People are moſt happy under his holy, juſt, and proſperous A miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>III.</hi> They that Rule over Men muſt be Juſt, Ruling in the Fear GOD. <hi>IV.</hi> Such Rulers ſhall proſper themſelves by GOD's Bleſſing upon them, and be made great and extenſive Bleſſings to their People.</p>
            <p>DOCT. I. <hi>GOD is the Rock of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me. This is One of the Names and Titles whereby God is pleas'd to make himſelf known to his People. GOD is in Scripture frequently ſpoken of and ſhadow'd forth to us under this Metaphor, in which we have ſome imperfect Repreſentation of GOD's Everlaſting and Unchangeable Being, whoſe Name is JEHOVAH, and I AM THAT I AM; of his invinſible Power; of the Stability &amp; Firmneſs of his Counſels, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Providential Diſpenſations in the World. Deut. 32, 4. <hi>He is the Rock—.</hi> This Title is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him about Six times in this Chapter. And then,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002583_0009_0FE5D439CE5A7810"/>
He is the Rock of Iſrael, of his Covenant-People. His Ancient People call him <hi>their Rock, v.</hi>31. GOD is the Strength of Iſrael. their Defence and Strong Tower, in whom alone they have a ſure Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge when purſued with threatning Evils. If it be demanded how that GOD who is a Conſuming Fire to Sinners, becomes a Rock of ſafety &amp; refreſhment to any of the Sinful Children of fallen Adam, It muſt be ſaid, That the Eternal Son of GOD, who is the Great GOD our Saviour, was in the fulneſs of Time <hi>ſent forth made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law</hi> —: He is God-Man Mediator, and in Him GOD is the Rock of Salvation to his People. He is in Scripture call'd a Rock, 1 Cor. 10.4. — <hi>That Rock was Chriſt.</hi> The Son of GOD was prefigur'd by the Rock mention'd, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.6. which being ſmitten gave forth waters in abundance, which followed the Iſraelites in their Marches thrô the dry &amp; bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Wilderneſs: For thus the Son of GOD in our Nature, having been ſmitten by GOD, when he was made a Curſe for his People, became a Fountain Open'd in the Merit of his Obedience, and in the abundant Effuſions of His Spirit, whoſe Graces and Comforts are as Streams and Rivers of living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the comfortable ſupply &amp; refreſhment of his People, <hi>Job.</hi> 7.37—39.

GOD, <hi>is the Rock on which the Church is built,</hi> and therefore the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, <hi>Matth</hi> 16.17, 18. Again, The Son of GOD is unto his People as the <hi>Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land,</hi> Iſai. 32 2. If theſe and the foregoing words refer to <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; yet they are ſuppoſed by good Expoſitors to look thrô him to Chriſt the great Antitype, who affords his People a cool and moſt refreſhing Shade under which they may ſit with great delight, being defended from the ſcorching heat of GOD's wrath, from the Curſe of the fiery Law, and from all thoſe Calamities which their Sins have deſerved In a Word, He is the Fortreſs and Strong tower to which they may fly for Refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before them, when purſued by Revenging Juſtice, and in which they may be ſafe from all their Enemies.</p>

But if the Son of GOD be a ſtone, &amp; rock of offence to you, You will ſtumble &amp; fall into Eternal Perdition; and when he ſhall in the Great Day of his wrath fall upon you, He will grind you to powder.

Let us build our hopes of Eternal Life upon this Rock, that ſo whatever Storms of temptation and trouble ariſe and beat upon us, our building may ſtand: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24.-27. If we are intereſted in CHRIST, and vitally United to him by his Spirit dwelling in us, &amp; by a true Faith, we may then amidſt all the Changes &amp; threatning Evils of this Life, rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſing with the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael, 2 Sam. 22.47. <hi>The Lord Liveth, and bleſſed be my Rock; and Exalted be the God of the rock of my Salvation.</hi>

It is true, we have by our great degeneracies given GOD reaſon to complain of us ſomething as of his ancient People, Deut. 32.15. <hi>But Jeſhurun waxed ſat and kicked</hi> —, then he forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his Salvation. We have been in an high degree unmindful of the Rock that begat us, and forgotten God that formed us. We have provoked God to Jealouſy by our hainous iniquities, and now God provokes us to anger with a fooliſh Nation. We muſt ſay of our Enemies, <hi>Their Rock is not as our Rock</hi>; But alas! Out Sins have in a dreadful meaſure ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and our God, and he refuſeth to give us thoſe Tokens of his gracious Preſence, and to fight our battels, as formerly hath been Experienc'd, when our Enemies were numurous, and we but a few comparatively. And ſhall we go on to provoke the Lord by our Sins till our Rock fell us, "<hi>quit his intereſt in &amp; relation to us</hi>". O let us not do it? For if God leave us, our Defence and Glory are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. Let us not go from God with a perpetual backſliding; but let us Return to him by ſincere Repentance; lay hold of his ſtrength and make Peace with him. Then we might hope to ſee that good word fulfilled in us. Deut. 33.27. <hi>The Eternal God is thy refuge:— and be ſhall thruſt out the Enemy from before thee, and ſhall, ſay deſtroy them.</hi>

               <hi>DOCT. II.</hi> THE Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Government over Men by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his People are most happy under his Holy, juſt, &amp; Proſperous Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>WE have already obſerved that ſome Read theſe Words as a Prophecy; There ſhall be a Ruler over Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and apply them to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>David,</hi> in whom the <hi>Covenant of Royalty</hi> made with <hi>David,</hi> in which GOD promis'd, <hi>That his Throne ſhould be as the days of Heaven,</hi> Pſal. 89.29. had it's full accompliſhment. Agreably, We have that Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, Iſai. 11.1-4. <hi>There ſhall come ſorth a Rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe: — And the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of wiſdom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel &amp; might, the ſpirit of knowledge, and the fear of the Lord: And ſhall make him of quick Underſtanding in the fear of the Lord, and he ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes, —But with Righteouſneſs ſhall be judge the poor.—</hi> And we have the happy fruits of his Government deſcribed in the ſame Chapter, 6-9. <hi>v.</hi> Here I would ſpeak to a few particulars very briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over Men by G0D's appointment.</hi> The Son of GOD is the King of Glory. He is <hi>Over all God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> Joh. 1.3. And therefore his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> over all Creatures, as he is GOD, <hi>is natural and neceſſary,</hi> for he is eſſentially One with the Father and the Spirit, <hi>Equal in Power &amp; Glory.</hi> But beſides

this, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a <hi>Delegated &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Kingdom</hi> as he is the Son of GOD Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the only Mediator between GOD and Man, and the Saviour of his People. Iſa. 9.6, 7. <hi>Unto us a child is born—, and the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder: and his Name ſhall be called, Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, Counſellor, the mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the increaſe of his Government &amp; Peace there ſhall be no End, upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with judgment &amp; with juſtice, from henceforth even for ever:</hi> The Zeal of the Lord of hoſts will perform this. Now in this reſpect the Meſſiah is GOD's King in a ſingular and moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent manner, and is Exalted by GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the Reward of his meritorious Obedience in his Humiliation. Phil 2.8, 11. <hi>And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto death, even the death of the Croſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name. That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow —</hi> Not as if we were obliged to bow our Bodies whenever the Letters and Syllables of the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; for <hi>Joſhua</hi> is call'd <hi>Jeſus</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8. And ſome of the Creatures here mentioned, have no Knees to bow. It muſt ſignify therefore, that all muſt pay homage to the Perſon ſignified by this Name, and be in Subjection to him either freely or by conſtraint. This Kingdom of CHRIST of which we are now ſpeaking is a <hi>Univerſal Kingdom,</hi> a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which Ruleth over all. He is <hi>the King of Kings,</hi>—Rev. 19.16. The Son of GOD is the

Supreme Ruler of Heaven and Earth: <hi>All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth,</hi> Matth. 28 I8. The holy <hi>Angels are ſubject to him</hi>: They Worſhip him and ſtand about his Throne as miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1, 2. The <hi>Devils are ſubjected</hi> by Conqueſt: Col. 2.15. <hi>Having ſpoiled principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; powers,</hi>—<hi>triumphing over them</hi>—. Our glorious Lord, who is the Seed of the Woman, hath bruiſed the Serpent's Head. Again, The <hi>whole World of Mankind</hi> is under the Government of CHRIST. The Father hath given him <hi>Power over all fleſh,</hi> Joh. 17.2. Whether they be Elect or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, Good or Bad, our Lord Jeſus is in a large ſenſe King over them all. He <hi>Rules in the midſt of his Enemies,</hi> Pſal. 110.2. He hath a Rod of Iron to daſh in pieces his implacable Enemies, and muſt ſit at God's Right Hand, till all of them <hi>are made his footſtool,</hi> ver. 1. The <hi>Shields of the Earth</hi> belong to him, even <hi>all Rulers,</hi> who ought by their Office to be as Shields to protect and defend their People from Injuries. All Governments are under him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, who is <hi>the bleſſed and only Potentate,</hi>—I Tim. 6.15. It is owing to his good Providence that there's any good Order and civil Peace among ſinful Men, and that ſome heathen Rulers have been Benefactors to their People. GOD the Son, who is called <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi> Luk. 11.49. ſpeaks, Prov. 8.15. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice.</hi> When ever they are enabled to Execute Juſtice, this is from CHRIST, tho' the Heathen know him not. But then, our Lord is in a peculiar ſenſe, <hi>the King of his Church &amp; People,</hi> whom he Governs by his Word and Spirit Pſal. 2.6.—<hi>I ſet my King

on my holy hill of Zion.</hi> And He hath a peculiar Reſpect to their Welfare in the Exerciſe of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. And hath put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, and gave him to be <hi>the Head over all things to the Church.</hi> And here we may take notice of Chriſt's viſible and inviſible Kingdom, as the Church falls under a two-fold conſideration in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The <hi>Viſible Church</hi> is in Scripture call'd the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 25.1. which conſiſts of thoſe that <hi>Openly profeſs ſubjection to Chriſt &amp; his Laws, and of their Seed.</hi> CHRIST is the Lord of his own Houſe, the Church, and hath in his Word, which is his Rod or Scepter, given thoſe Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances by which he will have it govern'd; to which are annexed Promiſes &amp; Threatnings, as Sanctions. The Goſpel is the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. The Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.22. Accordingly, He charged his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and their <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> to the End of the World, <hi>To teach his ſubjects to obſerve whatſoever he had commanded,</hi> and then <hi>promiſeth them his gracious Preſence always even unto the End of the World,</hi> Mat 28.19, 20. His Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Word is the Rule and Meaſure of our Obedience; from which nothing may be taken, to which nothing may be added, if we would avoid that dreadful Curſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. Again, Our Lord in the Execution of his Kingly Office, hath <hi>appointed Officers</hi> in his Church to feed and rule his People in his Name, and according to his Word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, whoſe power is not <hi>lordly,</hi> but ſtewardly and <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial</hi> under Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. Now, theſe things belong to Chriſts viſible Kingdom upon Earth, in which he governs his People by his own Laws, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

Cenſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore it is moſt intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Preſumption for any to require the Church and People of GOD to obſerve the Traditions of Men, and ſo to do what in them lies to make void Chriſt's Law. As Chriſt ſays to the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6. — Thus have ye made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition: Or unlorded it, as the word ſignifies. This is indeed to ſnatch at a flower of Chriſt's Crown, how light ſoever Men may make of it; and when he comes to Judgment, will be found <hi>Crimen laeſae Majestatis,</hi> High Treaſon againſt the King of Heaven. Such is the Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Antichriſt, who Oppoſeth and Exalteth himſelf above all that is called God,</hi>— Whom the Lord ſhall <hi>Conſume</hi> with the <hi>Spirit of his Mouth,</hi> and ſhall <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4—8. Surely then, it much concerns the ſubjects of Chriſt, as they wou'd approve themſelves loyal to him, and conſult their own ſafety, to ſtand a great way off from <hi>Roman Antichriſtian,</hi> in their Principles and Practices, left when ſhe ſhall fall, (as.we are ſure ſhe ſhall and riſe no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2, 21.) they be terribly ſhaken: Rev. 18.4. — <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to proceed, the things but now mention'd belong to the viſible diſpenſation of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon Earth, under which Multitudes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that are not ſavingly Converted. But then, there are a Number whom GOD hath <hi>choſen in Chriſt, before the foundation of the World, that they ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love,</hi>— Eph. 1.4. who are in all Ages effectually Call'd by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002583_0018_0FE5D455D42852F8"/>
the Holy Spirit, and made willing in the Day of God's power. Now of theſe it may be ſaid that the <hi>Kingdom of God is within them,</hi> Luk 17.21 When this glorious King rides forth proſperouſly on the Word of Truth, He ſubdues his Elect, who were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in their Minds to the obedience of Faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working of his mighty power. Theſe Experience the <hi>Renewing of the holy Ghost,</hi> Tit. 3.6. They are <hi>born again, from above, born of water &amp; of the Spirit,</hi> and ſo enter into the Kingdom of GOD, <hi>Job.</hi> 3.3, 5 There's a Saving &amp; Supernatual Change wrought on all the powers of their Souls, whereby they are deliver'd from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of GOD's dear Son. Their Underſtanding is Enlightned, their Wills, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and they are enabled from their hearts to Receive Jeſus Chriſt as their Prince &amp; Saviour, and to ſubmit to him; ſaying with them, Iſai. 26.13. <hi>O Lord our God, other lords beſides thee have had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us: but by thee only will we make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Name.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt Rules in their hearts by his Spirit dwelling in them, and <hi>cauſeth them to walk in his ſtatutes and keep his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>—,Ezek 36.27. And inaſmuch as by his Grace they come up to the Terms of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, He gives them a ſure title to all the Privileges and Immunities, Bleſſings &amp; Benefits of the <hi>Goſpel Charter</hi>; ſuch as Juſtification, Adoption, ſupport under Temptations &amp; Afflictions, Victory over all Enemies, the Conſolations of the Spirit, Perſeverance in Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I may add, The Protection and Proviſion of his good Providence, reſpecting their outward Man. Again, Such are the Reſt of

their departed Spirits in the Paradice of God, their glorious Reſurrection, when their vile Body ſhall be changed &amp; faſhion'd like to Chriſt's glorious Body; and they ſhall obtain Salvation with Eternal Glory. For when the Son of Man, to whom all Judgment is committed, ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him; when he ſhall be <hi>Revealed in flaming Fire,</hi> — taking Vengeance of thoſe that know not God and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Then will he <hi>appear to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Mat. 25.2 Theſ. 1.7, 8, 9. Heb. 9.27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>OUR Lord Jeſus Chriſt is moſt Holy &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all the Adminiſtrations of his Government.</hi> He is in Scripture often call'd the Juſt Righteous One, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11.

Being God &amp; Man in One Perſon, he cannot Err. Even when the Son of GOD goeth forth againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies it is to Execute Judgment.

Great GOD our Saviour, by taking proper Methods to Goſpelize the <hi>dark Corners of this Land</hi>; and to ſpread the Savour of the Knowlege of CHRIST among the <hi>Aboriginal Natives,</hi> that they who dwell in the Wilderneſs may bow before him. If you do thus fall in with GOD's great deſign of Glorifying his Son JESUS CHRIST, he will Honor you; for in ſo doing you Honor GOD himſelf, and the Lord ſaith, — <hi>Them that Honour me, I will Honour</hi>—, 1 Sam 2.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>I wou'd beſeech my Reverend Fathers &amp; Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Miniſtry to ſuffer the Word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Uſe your beſt Endeavours to Promote the Intereſts of CHRIST's Kingdom.</hi> You are by your Office in an eſpecial manner obliged to ſeek the Proſperity of Chriſt's Kingdom upon Earth. Permit me then, tho' moſt unworthy, to ſuggeſt a few things very briefly. CHRIST's Kingdom is not of this World, and conſequently, our Work is Spiritual, and lies principally with the Souls of Men, about their Eternal State. The great and important Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand upon which the Son of GOD ſends you, is <hi>to turn Sinners from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith in him,</hi> Acts 26.18. As alſo to build up his obedient Subjects and followers on their moſt holy Faith. Now for this End, we muſt. Preach the <hi>Word of the Kingdom,</hi> and not ſhun to declare the whole Counſel of God. We muſt Preach not our ſelves, but CHRIST JESUS the Lord. The great Scope and Deſign of our Preaching muſt be to Glorify GOD, by winning Souls unto
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002583_0024_0FE5D45EF8BB02A0"/>
CHRIST, and advancing his Kingdom more &amp; more in the hearts of his People. We muſt therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. Not to know any thing ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified. Jeſus Chriſt in his Natures, Divine &amp; Humane, in the Myſterious &amp; wonderful Conſtitution of his Perſon, in his Offices, and in the ineſtimable benefits of his Kingdom; eſpecially in that Great &amp; Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive One, the <hi>ſending his Holy Spirit</hi>; muſt be the great ſubject of our Preaching. Yea, whatever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we inſiſt upon, as we ought to Explain &amp; Enforce the great duties of the Moral Law, we muſt ſpeak the Truth as it is in JESUS; for, as a Learned Divine Obſerves, <q>Chriſt Jeſus the Lord is the Sum and Center of all revealed Truth; neither is any thing to be preached unto Men, as an object of their faith, or neceſſary element of their Salvation, which doth not ſome way or other, either meet in him, or refer unto him.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Edw. Reynolds.</note>. We muſt declare unto Men the abſolute Neceſſity of their being United to Chriſt, by his Spirit dwelling in them, and by a living Faith, that ſo they may be juſtifyed thrô his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs imputed to them; of their being Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, and of their living by the faith of the Son of God, if they would ſerve God acceptably in this World, and Prepare for his heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>AND then, if we wou'd approve our ſelves loyal and faithful to Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt take Care to Teach his People to Obſerve <hi>whatſoever He hath Commanded</hi>; doing our utmoſt in our Places that his
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002583_0025_0FE5D45FC3E6D338"/>
Worſhip &amp; Ordinances may be kept Pure &amp; Entire according to Scripture-pattern; for indeed all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural additions to the Worſhip of God, are Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of it; agreeably we have that threatning, Iſai. 29.13, 14.— <hi>Their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of Men: Therefore behold, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to do a marvellous work among this people:</hi> — <hi>for the wiſdom of their wiſe men ſhall periſh</hi> —. The Word of GOD muſt be our Rule &amp; Directory reſpecting Doctrine, Diſcipline &amp; Worſhip. We muſt take Care to maintain a godly Diſcipline in the Churches of Chriſt, obſerving that Word, Jer. 15.9. — <hi>If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou ſhall be as my mouth: let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</hi> In a word, We muſt be <hi>Enſamples to the Flock</hi> over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made us Overſeers, going before God's People, in an holy, humble, blameleſs, fruitful Converſation, being our ſelves Conformed to the Image and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our glorious Lord. 1 Tim. 4.12. — <hi>Be thou en Example of the Believers, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</hi> We are in an eſpecial manner obliged to take heed we be not conformed to this World in its evil Cuſtoms and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Practices; but that we be transform'd by the Renewing of our Minds, that we may prove what is that good, and acceptable &amp; perfect Will of God. That word of our Lord is ſeaſonable for us, Rev. 16.15. <hi>Behold, I come as a Thief, Bleſſed is he that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and keepeth his garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>IS it not needful that the Word of Chriſt,</hi> which is the Rod of his Strength whereby he ſubdues thoſe that were Enemies, and then Rules them as his willing People, <hi>Should be Publickly Read in our Churches?</hi> I ſuppoſe it will be readily granted that Reading the Scriptures is a <hi>part of Religious Worſhip</hi>; and doth not GOD require that we ſhould own Him as our Law-giver, by making this <hi>a part of Publick Worſhip?</hi> Is not this an <hi>Ordinance</hi> by which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Preaching,</hi> this glorious Light of the Goſpel ſhould be held up &amp; held out in the Churches which are compar'd to golden Candleſticks?

That the <hi>Son of GOD may continue to walk in the midſt of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſticks, and to hold the Stars in his Right Hand.</hi>

It is a Proverbial ſaying, <hi>All men will conform to the King's Example</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Regis ad Exemplum —</note>. When ſuch as are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity do therefore ſet a <hi>fair Copy</hi> by their honeſt and good Behaviour, there will be ground to hope that their People will imitate them. Rulers then muſt be juſt to their <hi>own Character,</hi> and ſhew forth the <hi>Image</hi> of God <hi>in them,</hi> if they would have others duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Image</hi> of God which is <hi>upon them,</hi> in their high Station of Dignity and Power. They muſt do their Duty towards themſelves, or they will not be capable of attending their Duty aright towards their People. They muſt by the Grace of God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their own Appetites and Paſſions, and Exerciſe a Rule over their own Spirits. Thus, they muſt be temperate in the uſe of Meats and Drinks, or they will pervert Judgment, and Expoſe themſelves to Contempt. Prov. 31. 4, 5. <hi>It is not for Kings, O Lemuel, it is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes ſtrong drink: Left they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</hi> If this Vice be indulg'd it will in a peculiar manner unfit Rulers to diſcern and execute Judgment; it will make them vile, and lay their honour in the duſt; for it will bereave them of that Wiſdom which cauſeth the face to ſhine, and which in an eſpecial manner commands Reſpect and Reverence in Perſons of a ſuperior Character. Again, They muſt know how to <hi>poſſeſs their veſſels in ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; honour, and not in the luſt of uncleanneſs,</hi> for this is one of thoſe Sins which eſpecially corrupts and infatuates the Mind. Hoſ. 4.11. <hi>Whoredom,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:002583_0037_0FE5D477B06FFE70"/>
and Wine—<hi>take away the heart.</hi> Accordingly we have that Dehortation given to <hi>Lemuel,</hi> that is to <hi>Solomon</hi> as Interpreters generally agree; Prov. 31.3. <hi>Give not thy ſtrength unto women, nor thy ways to that which deſtroyeth Kings.</hi> How pernicious were the fruits of this Sin in <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reigns; how great a Blot to thoſe famous Kings! Again, They muſt <hi>Rule their own Spirits,</hi> and regulate their Anger according to the Rule of GOD's Word. Such as have the Sword of Juſtice put into their hands, had need be Men of a meek, ſedate, &amp; calm Spirit; for the wrath of Man works not the Righteouſneſs of God. It is true, They muſt be Zealous in GOD's Cauſe, and for their Country's Safety; but ſhould be patient and forbearing in their own. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Meekneſs was one eminent Qualification that fitted him to bear the burden of his Government over a froward People. We read, Prov. 17.27.—<hi>A man of underſtanding is of an excellent Spirit.</hi> 
                  <q>Or as others render it, is <hi>of a cool Spirit,</hi> calm and moderate, not eaſily provok'd.</q> In a Word, They that Rule over Men muſt <hi>be Juſt &amp; Fair in their Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> conſider them in their private Capacities and Employments. And this is call'd <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> in which there is a mutual giving and receiving of that which is each one's due, as Men are Nei'bours and Brethren. And in this reſpect Rulers muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Rule, Rom. 13.7. <hi>Render to all their dues.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</hi> Theſe Commands reach Men in an high Station as well as others. They muſt do to others, as they wou'd have them do unto them; they muſt not ſeek their own only, but alſo another's Wealth;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002583_0038_0FE5D47A9BD22D58"/>
and take heed they take no Advantage from the higher ground they ſtand upon, to over-reach or oppreſs their Brethren of low Degree. They ſhould not endeavour to engroſs all Advantages to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but declare by their Practice that they are deſirous that their Nei'bours ſhou'd thrive and grow in their Eſtates alſo, in ſome Equitable Proportion. Yea, they ſhould be <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Charity &amp; Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,</hi> being ready to give a portion to fix &amp; to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as their Neighbour's neceſſity and their ability require; yea, they ſhould be ready to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they may thereby eminently ſerve their poor Brethren, and put them in a way of getting an honeſt livelihood. Thus ſuch as are in publick Place ſhou'd go before others in a Conſpicuous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Righteouſneſs, that they may Call upon their People to follow them, &amp; ſtir them up to attend their Duty in theſe reſpects. Thus they ſhould do their Endeavour to bring the Duties of the Second Table into Repute among their People. O there might, by the Bleſſing of GOD, be a great deal of Good done this way, if ſuch as are called gods would be imitators of GOD the Juſt One, and followers of that which is Good. Such Examples wou'd be likely to attract the Eyes and Hearts of Men, and wou'd have an Excellent tendency to promote Juſtice among a People; and the ſetting them is a Debt which Civil Rulers owe to GOD and their Country.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>THEY they that Rule over Men, muſt take Care that Righteous Laws be Enacted for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Juſtice between Rulers and Ruled, and among their People.</hi> I am ſenſible that all in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

Such as may be a juſt and equal Boundary between the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Ruler, and the <hi>Privilege</hi> of the Ruled. Such as are ſuitable and ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which is Right among their People, and to diſcountenance &amp; Puniſh all Injuſtice.

As was ſaid of Judah and Iſrael under <hi>Solomon</hi>'s peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and happy Government; 1 Kings 4.24. <hi>Judah and Iſrael dwelt ſafely, every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree.</hi> If Civil Rulers would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves Juſt to their People, they muſt exert their Authority that the <hi>Wicked may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Man that is more Righteous than he. And that Men may not be as the Fiſhes of the Sea which have no Ruler over them:</hi> And for this End they muſt take Care that Good Laws be made to Reſtrain and Curb in the impetuous Luſts of thoſe Men who are as the <hi>Horſe,</hi> or as <hi>the Mule, which have no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi>;—;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002583_0040_0FE5D47C33D73998"/>that ſuch as have not the Fear of GOD before their Eyes, and are not awed by the Judgment to come, may be terrified by the Fear of preſent Puniſhment from the Magiſtrate, and ſo be deterr'd from executing their wicked Purpoſes. <hi>Diſtributive Juſtice,</hi> which conſiſts in the Equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of Rewards &amp; Puniſhments, by the Civil Magiſtrate to the People under his Government, can't be duly exerciſed, unleſs juſt Laws be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted as the Rule and Meaſure of it; for where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion. It is an Eminent Act of Juſtice therefore in Rules to make righteous Statutes and Judgments, in which the Sanction of the Law, or the Penalty annexed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, ſhall bear a due proportion to the Nature, Aggravation, and Degree of the Sin forbidden: That Men may not be emboldened to gratify their vile Luſts, becauſe the Puniſhment to be inſlicted is ſome ſmall Fine or light Puniſhment, which they can bear almoſt without feeling it. No! Rulers muſt be a <hi>Terror to Evil Works,</hi> Rom. 13.3. and muſt make Sinners afraid of the Power, by adjuſting the Puniſhment to the Crime, that when others <hi>hear</hi> of the Judgment Executed according to Law, <hi>they may Fear, and not do ſo wickedly.</hi> But after all, due Care muſt be taken that the Laws be <hi>put in Execution</hi> when Enacted, otherwiſe the Proclaiming them will be but an empty Sound, that will rather Expoſe a Government to Contempt, than render it terrible to hold Tranſgreſſors. And this brings me to the third particular:</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>THEY that Rule ever Men, muſt take Care that the Juſt Laws made, he duly Executed, and look to

it that they be Righteous in all their Adminiſtrations.</hi> It is not enough that good Laws be made, they muſt alſo be faithfully and vigorouſly Executed by thoſe to whom the Executive Power belongs, or the Law will be made void, and of none Effect. The Seat of Judgment muſt be the Habitation of Righteouſneſs. Rulers muſt look to it that the dreadful Evil ſpoken of, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.16. be not found in their Government,—<hi>I ſaw under the Sun, the place of Judgment, that wickedneſs was there</hi>—. For this is an abomination to the Lord.

                  <q>He was Righteous in all his Adminiſtrations, as a Garment covers the whole body; he was Juſt in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Courſe, and did not put off this Garment from any partial reſpect, or for any ſiniſter ends, yea ſo Righteous were his judicial Sentences, that they were the principal Honor and Ornament of his Office</q>

19.7. — There is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of gifts. Here is their great and perfect Exemplar, and they muſt endeavour that their Rule may be a fair Copy and Tranſcript of the Juſtice and Equity of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Government. And here ſeveral particulars may be briefly ſpoken to, which are implied in this third Head, and ſo may fitly be conſider'd under it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>RULERS muſt take Care that ſuch be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, with the Executive Power under them, as are beſt qualified, and ſpirited to Execute Juſtice.</hi> There are various orders and degrees in Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and accordingly ſome are intruſted with Authority to Commiſſion others for the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice in this or the other Poſt of Civil Truſt. Now if ſuch wou'd approve themſelves juſt, they muſt diligently endeavour to find out and improve ſuch perſons as are moſt capable and beſt inclin'd to give to every Man his Right, and protect him in it. The Rule of proceeding in this matter muſt not be, Who will give moſt for an Office, or who hath the moſt powerful and wealthy friends to commend him to it; but, <hi>Let it be given to the moſt Worthy.</hi> For if Men are obliged to <hi>Purchaſe</hi> and Maintain themſelves in their <hi>Places</hi> by Money, they will be under a ſore temptation to <hi>Sell Juſtice,</hi> to the great damage of the Publick. Such then as are any ways concern'd in appointing or chooſing Perſons to Places of Truſt &amp; Profit in the Government, muſt do their part that the <hi>Officers</hi> of their People may be <hi>Peace,</hi> and their <hi>Exacters Righteouſneſs,</hi> by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that excellent Rule, which was given to <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:002583_0043_0FE5D48697028890"/>
by <hi>Jethro,</hi> Exod. 18. 21. and approved by GOD, Numb. II.I6.— <hi>Thou ſhalt provide out of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covertouſneſs; and place ſuch over them</hi>—. Rulers muſt do their utmoſt, according to the truſt repos'd in them, that ſuch may be ſet over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as are Men of Piety, Men of known Ability, Men of Integrity &amp; Valiant for the Truth, Men that hate Coveteouſneſs; for where the love of Money pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, it will be the root of many pernicious Evils, and will incline Men to pervert Judgment for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>THEY that are in Place of Power muſt take Care to Underſtand the Law, and then to keep to it in Adminiſtring Juſtice.</hi> The Legiſlative and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power are many times put into the ſame Hands. Now ſuch as have Power of Executing the Laws are then Juſt when they lay out themſelves to Maintain and Uphold the good Laws which are made, in their full force &amp; vigour: for theſe are the Rule of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of the Subjects Obedience; yea very much the foundation of the Common-Wealth, and the Pillars upon which it ſtands. Now in order to this, Civil Rulers muſt ſtudy the Law, and endeavour to furniſh themſelves with a ſufficient Knowledge of it for the right diſcharge of their particular Truſt. For unleſs they underſtand &amp; obſerve the Law, they will neither be able to attend their own Duty, nor yet to bear due Teſtimony againſt the Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others. This is a matter of ſo great moment, that in the <hi>Jewiſh State, The King himſelf was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God to write him a Copy of the Law, and Read therein all the days of his life,</hi> — Deut. 17.18, 19.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002583_0044_0FE5D4876F85C580"/>
Now this Law comprehends in it, the <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Laws,</hi> which were then immediately appointed by GOD, and muſt for ever be conform'd to the <hi>Moral Law</hi> which is an eternal Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <q>A Magiſtrate without the Law, (ſays an excellent Divine,) and a Miniſter without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are equal abſurdities: A Magiſtrate unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Law, and a Miniſter ignorant in the Scripture.</q> And indeed unleſs Rulers know the Laws by which they are to govern, and then take heed to obſerve them in adminiſtring Juſtice, they will not be able to ſay with Job 29 15. <hi>I was eyes to the blind, and ſeet was I to the lame.</hi> It may be of very hurtful'conſequence, if ſuch as ſit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have not a ſpirit of diſcerning as to the Rule they muſt go by in paſſing Sentence; but muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on them who plead before them. They muſt in this reſpect know what Iſrael ought to do, and be able well to diſtinguiſh between Right &amp; Wrong; and then muſt act with a ſtrict regard to the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>THEY muſt ſhake their hands from Bribes; Adminiſter Juſtice freely &amp; without reſpect of perſons.</hi> Covetouſneſs, which conſiſts in an immoderate eſteem of and love to this worlds goods, and appears in uſing unlawful Means to Enrich ourſelves, is an heinous Sin, and of moſt pernicious tendency in thoſe who are eſpecially concern'd to look to it that the Common-Wealth receive no damage. Civil Rulers muſt therefore avoid this Sin, and be careful they do not in any meaſure deſerve that ill character, Mic. 3.1. <hi>The heads judge for reward</hi> —. Hoſ 4.18. — <hi>Her Rulers with ſhame do love, Give ye.</hi> For
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002583_0045_0FE5D488CA12FAC0"/>
thus the Great GOD ſpeaks, Exod. 23.8. <hi>Thou ſhalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wiſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the words of the righteous.</hi> And GOD threatens that fire ſhall <hi>conſume the tabernacles of bribery,</hi> Job 15.34. Rulers muſt look at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profit more than at their own private gain, and endeavour that <hi>Judgment may run down at waters,</hi> freely and plentifully; that ſo all that thirſt after Righteouſneſs may come and be refreſhed. They, to whom this truſt is committed, muſt ſee to it that ſuch as ſerve the Publick, attend their duty faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and then take Care that they have their juſt Wages paid them without any unneceſſary delay, &amp; without making any private gain to themſelves.</p>
               <p>IN a word, they muſt obſerve that Rule, Deut. 1.17. <hi>Ye ſhall not reſpect perſons in Judgment, but you ſhall hear the ſmall as well as the great</hi> —. It is their duty to adminiſter Juſtice impartially, and to beware of being biaſs'd by favour &amp; affection; or by fear of Men which brings a ſnare. They muſt <hi>look</hi> to the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> not to the <hi>Parties</hi> concern'd<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Fuller</hi> ſpeaking of the good Judge hath this ingenious obſervation, <q>When he put on his Robes, he put off his Relations to any; and like <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> becomes without Pedegree.</q> 
                     <hi>Holy State,</hi> p. 259.</note>. And in this reſpect reſemble GOD, <hi>Who without reſpect of perſons judgeth according to every man's work</hi> —, 1 Pet. 1.17. They muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely oppoſe the moſt Potent Offenders, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppreſſed that have no helper. <hi>Judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow,</hi> Iſai. 1.17.</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:002583_0046_0FE5D48AA9E92040"/>4. THEY that Rule over Men, <hi>muſt Exerciſe Clemency &amp; Mercy towards their People.</hi> A learned Expoſitor obſerves on this place, <q>That we have here the Two principal Parts of a King's Duty, anſwerable to the two Tables of God's Law, Juſtice towards Men, and Piety towards GOD—. To which if you add Benignity and Clemency, whereby a King renders his Government not fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and burdenſome, but acceptable and amiable to his People—. Here is a compleat Character of an excellent Prince or Governour</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pool.</hi>
                  </note> . Now Righteouſneſs in Scripture ſometimes ſignifys Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and Mercy: Thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103 17.— His Righteouſneſs unto Childrens Children, <q>Either his Faithfulneſs; or his Mercy or Benignity: This Word being frequently uſed in both theſe Senſes</q>

                     <hi>id.</hi>
                  </note>. And in aſ much as this is what Rulers are oblig'd to, if they wou'd diſcharge their Duty aright towards their People, it may well enough be conſidered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general Head of Juſtice. Indeed there is a Pity, falſly call'd Mercy, which is injurious to the Publick. As when ſuch are ſpar'd againſt whom the publick Safety calls aloud for Vengeance. Such pretended Mercy to private Perſons is Cruelty to the Publick. But then, there is alſo the Exerciſe of Mercy which is of great Benefit to a Community, and to Rulers themſelves. It was the Character given of the Kings of lſrael, that they were <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kings,</hi> 1 Kings 20.31. Above all, the Son of GOD is ſo, infinitely Gracious and Merciful. The King's Favour is ſaid to be as a <hi>Cloud of the latter
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002583_0047_0FE5D48DC7FB2EB0"/>
Rain,</hi> Prov. 16.15. It is very acceptable, and a great Refeſhment to his People. And oftentimes the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Clemency and Mercy is of great uſe and advantage to Rulers as it eſtabliſheth them in the high Eſteem and ſincere Affection of their People: Prov. 20.28. <hi>Mercy &amp; Truth preſerve the King, and his Throne is upheld by Mercy.</hi> And as theſe are under God, very much the Supporters of the Throne; ſo of Inferiour Rulers in their Station. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one Head more, like to the former.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THEY that Rule over Men, muſt be <hi>of a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirit in the Exerciſe of a fatherly Love to their People, and generous Concern for their Welfare.</hi> It is very unbecoming for Perſons in Publick Station, to Seek themſelves inordinately, and ſuch a vicious Self Love in them, bodes ill to the Commonwealth: 2 Tim. 3.1, 2. — <hi>Perilous times ſhall come. For Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves</hi>—. It is a moſt unjuſt thing for Perſons to ſeek after Places of Publick Truſt that they may Serve themſelves rather than the People over whom they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Rulers; and then to make it their great aim to ſeek their own, not the Publick Good. Even the Light of Nature condemns this. An <hi>Heathen Moraliſt</hi> cou'd ſay, <q>That to make a Gain of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is not only baſe, but alſo wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable</q>

No! they muſt act in their Exalted Station from an inward principle of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Fear of that GOD, who is the Fountain of all Power, muſt influence &amp; regulate them in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Juſtice towards Men. Which brings me to,</p>
               <p>PROP. II. <hi>THEY that Rule over Men muſt Rule in the Fear of G0D.</hi> The Fear of GOD as us'd in Scripture, may ſometimes be taken more ſtricly for that <hi>particular Grace</hi> of the Holy Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſtand in awe of GOD, his infintie Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and threatned Judgments; and from an holy dread of his Diſpleaſure, fly from all Sin. And in as much as this filial, reverential Fear, which is drawn forth by a believing ſight of GOD, is of ſuch great uſefulneſs in our Religious Serving of God; it is alſo put for the <hi>whole inward Principle</hi> of our Worſhip &amp; Service of God, and ſo contains in all Graces of the Spirit, which are wrought in the Soul at once and are never ſeparated. Eccl. I2.I3. — <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> The whole of Man. Where it ſeems plain that Fear is put for the inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Obedience, and ſo comprehends other Graces. Again, It is ſometimes put for the <hi>outward Worſhip</hi> of God as preſcribed by him in his Word. Iſa. 29.14. <hi>Their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of Men</hi> compared with, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. Yea it ſeems
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002583_0050_0FE5D49345E85058"/>
to Comprehend both the inward Principle, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Practice of Religion. Pſal. 130.4. There is forgiveneſs with thee; <hi>that thou mayſt be feared.</hi> The Service of God muſt be perform'd with <hi>Reverence and godly Fear,</hi> Heb. 12.28. Now we need not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude either of theſe Senſes in considering the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before us; but may improve them all as there ſhall be occaſion. The Glorious GOD ſpeaks, Pſal 2.0, 11, 12. <hi>Be wiſe, O ye Kings; be inſtructed ye Judges of the Earth. Serve ye the Lord with fear—.</hi> They muſt fear this glorious &amp; fearfull Name, <hi>the Lord their God.</hi> They muſt tremble for fear of him and his Judgments, who cuts off the Spirits of Princes, and his terrible to the Kings of the Earth: They muſt fear the Lord, and his Goodneſs, who hath in his Sovereign Providence made the difference between them, and the meaneſt under their Government; and take heed their Hearts be not lifted up above their Brethren, as if they were not of one blood with them. That word is very ſuitable for them, <hi>Be not high minded but fear.</hi> They who may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlves above the fear of Puniſhment from Men, and above Reproach, muſt ſtand in awe of that GOD who <hi>pours Contempt upon Princes</hi>; Who by terrible Diſpenſations maketh them to know that the <hi>moſt High GOD ruleth in the Kingdom of Men</hi>; Who can in the midſt of their ſinful Pleaſures <hi>looſe the joints of their loyns, and cauſe their knees to ſmite one againſt another,</hi> by Writing, <hi>Alone, Tekel,</hi> upon them and their Kingdoms. Surely it is their great Duty and higheſt Wiſdom to Fear GOD, Pſal. 111.10. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom</hi>

They muſt Reſolve with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that as for <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>houſes,</hi> they <hi>will ſerve the Lord</hi>: They muſt with <hi>David, Bleſs their Houſholds,</hi> and that by offering up the Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer to GOD with them and for them. They muſt be Examples of Reverence and Devotion in the <hi>Publick Worſhip.</hi> And to ſpeak more directly to the Subject before us, They muſt in all their Adminiſtrations as Rulers, Act under the governing influence of the Fear of GOD, and Regulate themſelves by it. Now their Ruling in the Fear of GOD may imply ſuch things as thefe in it;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:002583_0052_0FE5D49A6661F168"/>1. THEY that Rule over Men <hi>muſt be under the abiding influence of the Fear of God in their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</hi> This holy Principle muſt be implanted in their Hearts by the Spirit of God, or they can't Serve God acceptably in their high Station; and it muſt be Operative in them to move and incline them to abide with GOD in their Calling. Thus when that Excellent Governour <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had mentioned ſome Mal-Adminiſtrations of former Governours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they oppreſſed the People, he vindicates himſelf, and ſay's, <hi>But ſo did not I, becauſe of the Fear of God,</hi> Ch. 5.15. This aw'd and kept him, that he did not rigorouſly Exact upon the People, and ſuffer his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Rule them with Rigour, as others had done before him. The Fear of God muſt have a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence upon Rulers in accepting of Places in Government, and in diſcharging the Duties of them; in making and Executing Laws; or in Committing the Executive Power to others: They muſt in this reſpect Honour them that Fear the Lord. Thus <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> gave <hi>Hananiah</hi> together with his Brother <hi>Hanani</hi> Charge over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and why? <hi>For he was a faihtful Man, and feared God above many.</hi> Chap. 7.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THEY muſt have <hi>a Religious Regard to the Revealed Will of God, and take Care that their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations be conformed to his Word.</hi> The Word of God is the inſallible and perfect Rule, according to which our Fear of him is to be Regulated, and accordingly it is call'd, the Fear of the Lord: Pſal. 19 9. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean</hi> —. <hi>i. e.</hi>"The Law and Word of God," of which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt is here ſpeaking. Now this Law, or written
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002583_0053_0FE5D49BCFC20308"/>
Word of God is profitable for the Inſtruction of all Men in their ſeveral Places, that they may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to every good Work. Particularly, Here are moſt Excellent Rules and Precepts given to all in Authority; and they Rule in the Fear of God, when they Rcligiouſly obſerve them, and thus Serve their Generation by <hi>the Will of God,</hi> which is given as the Character of that Pious King <hi>David,</hi> Acts 13.36. Agreeably the King of Iſrael was Commanded to write a Copy of the Law, and to Read therein all the Days of his Life: <hi>that he might learn to fear the Lord his God</hi>; and to keep the words of the Law—, foremention'd <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. Indeed I do not ſay that the Conſtitution of Civil Government is juſt the ſame now, that it was then, when Gods People were under a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> and had their judicial Laws appointed immediately by God. However there are thoſe Rules laid down in God's Word, which are of general Uſe and Obligation to Rulers. They muſt not forbid any thing which God hath required in his Law, nor command any thing which he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; for this wou'd be to eſtabliſh Iniquity by Law, in Defiance of the moſt High. It is the Duty of all in Authority, who have God's Statutes, to make them the Rule of their Government, and to have a ſtrict regard to them, in Making &amp; Executing the Laws of the Land. This is to Rule in the Fear of God:<seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>nd thus muſt Rulers acknowledge their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Him, who is over all, God bleſſed forever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They muſt <hi>Imitate and Reſemble God in their Rule &amp; Government.</hi> GOD is the Supream Ruler of Heaven and Earth, and Civil Rulers, as they
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002583_0054_0FE5D49F5C883EB8"/>
bear at leaſt ſome outward Characters of his Majeſty, his Image upon them, are in Scripture called <hi>Gods</hi>;, Pſal. 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, ye are Gods —.</hi> Now this is a ſtrong Obligation upon them to labour after the Image of GOD in them, that they may reſemble GOD in Knowledge, Rightouſneſs &amp; Holineſs; and then Govern their People in Conformity to that perfect Pattern which God ſets them in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his People. Indeed it is contrary to this Fear of God, for them to affect to be like GOD, in his <hi>Dominion</hi> over the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men; by ſetting up their <hi>Wills</hi> as the <hi>Rule</hi> and Meaſure of right and wrong. It was blaſphemous Preſumption in <hi>Darius</hi> to make a Decree, That every Man that ſhou'd ask a Petition of any God or Man, within Thirty Days, ſave of him, ſhould be caſt into the Den of Lions.. And God did miraculouſly protect <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oppoſition to that wicked Decree. Rulers muſt be willing that their Subjects ſhou'd obey GOD ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than them. But then it is their Duty to behold his imitable Perfections, and to be imitators of him as dear Children. That Exhortation may be applied to them, who are called the Children of the moſt High, Matth. 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. THEY muſt <hi>Employ their Power, to maintain and advance the Fear of GOD, or true Religion, among their people.</hi> They muſt endeavour to deſerve that Character which is given the Royal Tribe: Hoſ. 11.12. — <hi>Judah ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Saints.</hi> And therefore they muſt improve their Authority to maintain Religion in the Power
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002583_0055_0FE5D4A7495B9588"/>
of it. They muſt take Care that the open Profeſſion and Practice of Religion be kept up among their People, and vigorouſly oppoſe whatever hath a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick tendency to ſubvert and overthrow it. And for this End, it is their Duty to make ſufficient Laws for the Puniſhing open Profaneneſs and Irreligion, as Idolatry, Blaſphemy, Profane-Swearing, Sabbath-Breaking, and the like: And they muſt look to it, that ſuch atrocious Crimes have an heavy Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed them in the Law. They muſt draw the Sword of Juſtice, and ſmite ſuch heinous Tranſgreſſors, that their Iniquity may be upon their own heads, (if they refuſe to be reclaim'd,) and not cleave to the Publick. Again, It is incumbent on Civil Magiſtrates to take Care, that the <hi>pure Word of GOD be duly diſpenſed to their People.</hi> Here God teacheth us how we muſt Fear and Serve Him. And therefore if they wou'd promote true Piety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their People they muſt take heed that there be not a famine of hearing of the Words of Lord, by improving their Authority &amp; influence, that a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Orthodox, a Godly and Painful Miniſtry, be maintained and ſupported among them. They ſhoud ſpeak comfortably to them <hi>that teach the good Knowledge of the Lord</hi>; and ſee that they have a <hi>ſufficient Maintenance</hi> allowed them, that they may lay out their Strength and Time in their weighty Work, without being neceſſarily diverted &amp; hindred by Worldly Cares &amp; Buſineſs. <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s pious Care in this matter is worthy their imitation. <hi>Neb.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12, 13. And then, They ſhould oblige their People to Attend the Publick Worſhip; and as much as may be prevent their Prophaning the Lord's Day,

either by Worldly buſineſs and recreations; or by their needleſs cuſtomary abſenting themſelves when GOD's People aſſemble together to Worſhip Him.</p>
               <p>Again, THEY muſt take Care <hi>of the good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Children and Youth among their People,</hi> and look to it that ſuitable and ſufficient provision be made for it. GOD's <hi>ancient People</hi> had not only <hi>inferiour Schools</hi>; but alſo <hi>Colleges</hi> in which the Sons of the Prophets were train'd up in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine Things, and ſo prepar'd for Publick Service<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus at <hi>Ramah,</hi> as is ſuppos'd, where <hi>Samuel</hi> preſided; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.20.

If our Children be ignorant &amp; barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, it can't be expected but they ſhould be profane and vicious; and therefore the Fear of GOD ſhou'd Excite Rulers to Exert their Authority that there may be <hi>Schools</hi> maintain'd for the Inſtruction and Education of Younger Children in learning to Read, that they may <hi>know the holy Scripture from their Childhood</hi>; and in learning the principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contain'd in their <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Grammar Schools</hi> to prepare others for a more liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They ſhou'd alſo take Care that Colleges be Erected &amp; Endowed, Maintain'd and duly Inſpected; that hopeful Young Men may be Educated in Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Learning, and come forth furniſh'd for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of GOD and His People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:002583_0057_0FE59B0CE15F26E0"/>IN a Word, When their People are fallen under decays in Matters of Religion, they <hi>ſhould be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi> &amp; zealouſly Endeavour to bring them back to the Lord. Thus we find that when <hi>Joſiah</hi> had Read in the Book of the Law, which denounc'd dreadful threatnings againſt the Sins riſe among his People, he rent his Clothes, call'd for the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Judah, Made a Covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord; and to keep his Commandments,</hi> 2 King. 22.10, 11. Chap. 23. 1—3. And then <hi>put down the Ho'atrous Prieſts, d fil'd the high places,</hi> &amp;c. Thus, when Civil Rulers are under the influence of the Fear of GOD, they will improve their Power to ſuppreſs thoſe prevailing iniquities which provoke GOD, who is the Defence and Glory of his People, to depart from them. They will tremble for the Ark of GOD, and be afraid of his Judgments, ſo as to lead in the neceſſary work of Reformation, that GOD may turn from the fierceneſs of his Anger, and return unto them in Mercy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>THEY muſt make the Advancement of G0D's declarative Glory the chief End of their Government.</hi> This is the chief and higheſt End of Man. The Command is, <hi>Do all to the Glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. Now, when Rulers are ſaid to Rule in the Fear of GOD, it intends that they ſubordinate all other views and deſigns to this moſt excellent End, and Govern their People in ſuch a manner that GOD may be Glorified. Agreeably we have thoſe put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Rev. 14.7. <hi>Fear God, and give Glory to him.</hi>

We are a degenerate People, iniquity abounds, and GOD is going on in a way of Judgment againſt us.

Name of GOD, by Profane Oaths and Curſes. May not ſomething further be done to ſuppreſs this Heaven-daring Sin? Doth it not deſerve a heavier Penalty than is affixed to it in the Law? Ought not this part of Religious Worſhip, the calling GOD to Witneſs in Swearing, be attended with greater Reverence in our <hi>Courts of Judicature,</hi> that Men may be taught to <hi>Fear an Oath</hi> Improve your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that the <hi>Lord's Day Sabbath</hi> may be <hi>ſtrictly obſerved.</hi> GOD gives his Sabbath to his People as a Sign between him and them; and ſtrictly requires them ſo to <hi>Remember it, as to keep it holy</hi>; Exod. 20. Jer. 17.21, 23, 27. And it hath been often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that as the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is Sanctified or Profan'd ſo Religion is won't to flouriſh or decay. This then is moſt worthy your Pious Care. Bleſſed be GOD for the Good Laws we have to bind us to this Duty; and for that Care which is taken to Execute them. However, There is need that ſome further Care be taken, that under a pretence of keeping the Night before or after the Sabbath day light, both Evenings be not us'd as common Time. And is not the Evil Cuſtom of keeping open Shops on the Evening before the Day, a Prophanation of the Sabbath, which ought to be Reform'd? And then, As there ought to be no Recreations, no carrying of Burdens, no needleſs Journeys on the Lord's Day, ſo it might be a very acceptable Service to GOD, if ſome effectual Means were us'd to ſuppreſs Diſorders between Meetings in our Country Towns, where they live at a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſtance from the Place of Publick Worſhip, and tarry at or near the Meeting-Houſe. As alſo to

It is an abiding Teſtimony of the Pious Concern our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fathers had for the flouriſhing of Religion, that they ſo Early Erected that <hi>Society,</hi> which hath been a great Bleſſing to the whole Land; a Fountain continually <hi>ſending forth ſtreams that have made Glad the City of our God</hi>; yea have refreſh'd diſtant Places alſo.
