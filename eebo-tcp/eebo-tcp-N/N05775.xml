            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in some Measure, for the numberless Imperfections
of it.</p>
            <p>There intervened but one Day between my Arrival in
<hi>Williamsburg,</hi> and the Time for the Council's Meeting,
for me to prepare and transcribe, from the rough Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
I had taken in my Travels, this Iournal; the
writing of which only was sufficient to employ me closely
the whole Time, consequently admitted of no Leisure to
consult of a new and proper Form to offer it in, or to
correct or amend the Diction of the old; neither was I
apprised, or did in the least conceive, when I wrote this
for his Honour's Perusal, that it ever would be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,

was informed, at the Meeting of the present General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I have been particularly cautious not to augment,

selected from the whole, the most probable and consistent
Account.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WAS commissioned and appointed by the
Honourable <hi>Robert Dinwiddie,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Governor,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to visit and deliver a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Commandant of the <hi>French</hi> Forces
on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> and set out on the intended jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
the same Day; the next, I arrived at
<hi>Fredericksburg,</hi> and engaged Mr. <hi>Iacob Vanbraam,</hi> to be my
<hi>French</hi> Interpreter; and proceeded with him to <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
where we provided Necessaries; from thence we went to
<hi>Winchester,</hi> and got Baggage, Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from thence
we pursued the new Road to <hi>Wills</hi>-Creek, where we arrived
the 14th of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I engaged Mr. <hi>Gist</hi> to pilot us out, and also hired
four others as Servitors, <hi>Barnaby Currin,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Mac-Quire,</hi>
Indian Traders, <hi>Henry Steward,</hi> and <hi>William Ienkins,</hi>
and in Company with those Persons, left the Inhabitants the
Day following.</p>
            <p>The excessive Rains and vast Quantity of Snow that had
fallen, prevented our reaching Mr. <hi>Frazier</hi>'s an Indian Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
at the Mouth of <hi>Turtle</hi>-Creek, on <hi>Monongahela,</hi> till
<hi>Thursday</hi> the 22d. We were informed here, that Expresses
were sent a few Days ago to the Traders down the River, to
acquaint them with the <hi>French</hi> General's Death, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007331_0004_0000000000000000"/>
of the major Part of the <hi>French</hi> Army into Winter
Quarters.</p>
            <p>The Waters were quite impassable, without swimming our
Horses; which obliged us to get the Loan of a Canoe from
<hi>Frazier,</hi> and to send <hi>Barnaby Currin,</hi> and <hi>Henry Steward,</hi>
down <hi>Monongahela,</hi> with our Baggage, to meet us at the
Forks of <hi>Ohio,</hi> about 10 Miles, to cross <hi>Aligany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in
viewing the Rivers, and the Land in the Fork, which I
think extremely well situated for a Fort, as it has the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is
20 or 25 Feet above the common Surface of the Water, and a
considerable Bottom of flat, well-timbered Land all around
it, very convenient for Building: The Rivers are each a
Quarter of a Mile, or more, across, and run here very near
at right Angles: <hi>Aligany</hi> bearing N. E. and <hi>Monongahela</hi>
S. E. the former of these two is a very rapid and swift running
Water, the other deep and still, without any perceptible
Fall.</p>
            <p>About two Miles from this, on the South East Side of
the River, at the Place where the <hi>Ohio</hi> Company intended
to erect a Fort, lives <hi>Shingiss,</hi> King of the <hi>Delawares;</hi> we
call'd upon him, to invite him to Council at the <hi>Loggs</hi>-Town.</p>
            <p>As I had taken a good deal of Notice Yesterday of the
Situation at the <hi>Forks,</hi> my Curiosity led me to examine
this more particularly, and I think it greatly inferior,
either for Defence or Advantages; especially the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for a Fort at the <hi>Forks</hi> would be equally well si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
on <hi>Ohio,</hi> and have the entire Command of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nongahela,</hi>
which runs up to our Settlements and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
well design'd for Water Carriage, as it is of a deep
still Nature; besides, a Fort at the <hi>Fork</hi> might be built at
a much less Expence, than at the other Place.—</p>
            <p>Nature has well contrived the lower Place, for Water
Defence; but the Hill whereon it must stand being about a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007331_0005_0000000000000000"/>
Quarter of a Mile in Length, and then descending gradually
on the Land Side, will render it difficult and very expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
making a sufficient Fortification there.—The whole
Flat upon the Hill must be taken in, or the Side next the
Descent made extremely high; or else the Hill cut away:
Otherwise, the Enemy may raise Batteries within that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
without being expos'd to a single Shot from the
Fort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shingiss</hi> attended us to the <hi>Loggs</hi>-Town, where we arrived
between Sun-setting and Dark, the 25th Day after I left
<hi>Williamsburg:</hi> We travelled over some extreme good, and
bad Land, to get to this Place.—</p>
            <p>As soon as I came into Town, I went to <hi>Monacatoocha</hi>
(as the Half-King was out at his hunting Cabbin on little
<hi>Beaver</hi> Creek, about 15 Miles off) and inform'd him by
<hi>Iohn Davison</hi> my <hi>Indian</hi> Interpreter, that I was sent a
Messenger to the <hi>French</hi> General; and was ordered to call
upon the Sachems of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to acquaint them
with it.—I gave him a String of Wampum, and a Twist
of Tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King;
which he promised to do by a Runner in the Morning, and
for other Sachems.—I invited him and the other great Men
present to my Tent, where they stay'd about an Hour and
return'd.</p>
            <p>According to the best Observations I could make, Mr.
<hi>Gist</hi>'s new Settlement (which we pass'd by) bears about
W. N. W. 70 Miles from <hi>Wills</hi>-Creek; <hi>Shanapins,</hi> or
the Forks N. by W. or N. N. W. about 50 Miles from
that; and from thence to the <hi>Loggs</hi>-Town, the Course is
nearly West about 18 or 20 Miles; so that the whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as we went and computed it, is at least 135 or 140
Miles from our back Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>25th,</hi> Came to Town four of ten <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
from a Company at the <hi>Cuscuscas,</hi> which lies at the
Mouth of this River; I got the following Account from
them. They were sent from <hi>New Orleans</hi> with 100 Men,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007331_0006_0000000000000000"/>
and 8 Canoe Loads of Provisions to this Place; where they
expected to have met the same Number of Men, from the
Forts this Side Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> to convoy them and the Stores
up, who were not arrived when they ran off.</p>
            <p>I enquired into the Situation of the <hi>French,</hi> on the <hi>Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippi,</hi>
their Number, and what Forts they had built: They
inform'd me, That there were four small Forts between
<hi>New-Orleans</hi> and the <hi>Black-Islands,</hi> garrison'd with about
30 or 40 Men, and a few small Pieces, in each: That at
<hi>New-Orleans,</hi> which is near the Mouth of the <hi>Missisippi,</hi>
there are 35 Companies, of 40 Men each, with a pretty
strong Fort mounting 8 Carriage Guns; and at the <hi>Black-Islands</hi>
there are several Companies, and a Fort with 6 Guns.
The <hi>Black-Islands</hi> are about 130 Leagues above the Mouth
of the <hi>Ohio,</hi> which is about 350 above <hi>New-Orleans:</hi> They
also acquainted me, that there was a small pallisado'd Fort
on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Obaish</hi> about 60 Leagues
from the <hi>Missisippi:</hi> The <hi>Obaish</hi> heads near the West End
of Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> and affords the Communication between the
<hi>French</hi> on <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssisippi</hi> and those on the Lakes. These Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
came up from the lower <hi>Shanoah</hi> Town with one <hi>Brown,</hi>
an <hi>Indian</hi> Trader, and were going to <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About 3 o'Clock this Evening the Half-King came to
Town; I went up and invited him and <hi>Davison,</hi> privately,
to my Tent, and desir'd him to relate some of the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of his Journey to the <hi>French</hi> Commandant, and Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there; and to give me an Account of the Ways and
Distance. He told me, that the nearest and levellest Way
was now impassable, by Reason of many large miry Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas;
that we must be obliged to go by <hi>Venango,</hi> and should
not get to the near Fort under 5 or 6 Night's Sleep, good
Travelling. When he went to the Fort, he said he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in a very stern Manner by the late Commander; Who
ask'd him very abruptly, what he had come about, and to
declare his Business, which he said he did in the following
Speech.</p>

               </gap>hers, We kindled a Fire a long Time ago, at a Place
called <hi>Montreal,</hi> where we desired you to stay, and not to
come and intrude upon our Land. I now desire you may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
to that Place; for be it known to you, Fathers, that
this is our Land, and not yours.</p>
            <p>Fathers, I desire you may hear me in Civilness; if not, we
must handle that Red which was laid down for the Use of the
obstreperous. If you had come in a peaceable Manner, like
our Brothers the <hi>English,</hi> we should not have been against
your trading with us, as they do; but to come, Fathers, and
build great Houses upon our Land, and to take it by Force,
is what we cannot submit to.</p>
            <p>Fathers, Both you and the <hi>English</hi> are white, we live in a
Country between; therefore the Land belongs to neither
one nor t'other: But the Great Being above allow'd it to be
a Place of Residence for us; so Fathers, I desire you to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
as I have done our Brothers the <hi>English;</hi> for I will
keep you at Arms Length: I lay this down as a Trial for both,
to see which will have the greatest Regard to it, and that
Side we will stand by, and make equal Sharers with us. Our
Brothers the <hi>English</hi> have heard this, and I come now to tell
it to you, for I am not afraid to discharge you off this Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:007331_0008_0000000000000000"/>
This he said was the Substance of what he said to the
General, who made this Reply.</p>
            <p>Now my Child, I have heard your Speech, you spcke first,
but it is my Time to speak now. Where is my Wampum that
you took away, with the Marks of Towns in it? This Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum
I do not know, which you have discharged me off the
Land with; but you need not put yourself to the Trouble of
speaking, for I will not hear you: I am not afraid of Flies,
or Musquitos, for <hi>Indians</hi> are such as those; I tell you, down
that River I will go, and will build upon it, according to my
Command: If the River was block'd up, I have Forces suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to burst it open, and tread under my Feet all that stand
in Opposition, together with their Alliances; for my Force is
as the Sand upon the Sea Shore: Therefore, here is your
Wampum, I sting it at you. Child, you talk foolish; you say
this Land belongs to you, but there is not the Black of my
Nail yours: I saw that Land sooner than you did, before the
shannoahs and you were at War: <hi>Lead</hi> was the Man that
went down, and took Possession of that River: It is my Land,
and I will have it, let who will stand up for, or say against
it. I'll buy and sell with the <hi>English, (mockingly).</hi> If
People will be rul'd by me, they may expect Kindness, but
not else.</p>
            <p>The Half-King told me he enquired of the General after
two <hi>Englishmen</hi> that were made Prisoners, and received
this Answer,</p>
            <p>Child, You think it is a very great Hardship that I made
Prisoners of those two People at <hi>Venango,</hi> don't you concern
yourself with it, we took and carried them to <hi>Canada,</hi> to get
Intelligence of what the <hi>English</hi> were doing in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He informed me that they had built two Forts, one on
Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> and another on <hi>French</hi>-Creek, near a small Lake
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007331_0009_0000000000000000"/>
about 15 Miles asunder, and a large Waggon Road between;
they are both built after the same Model, but different in the
Size; that on the Lake the largest; he gave me a Plan of
them, of his own drawing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> enquired very particularly after their Brothers
in <hi>Carolina</hi> Goal.</p>
            <p>They also asked what Sort of a Boy it was that was taken
from the <hi>South</hi>-Branch; for they had, by some <hi>Indians,</hi> heard
that a Party of <hi>French Indians</hi> had carried a white Boy by
the <hi>Cuscusca</hi> Town, towards the Lakes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>26th.</hi> We met in Council at the <hi>Long-House,</hi> about
9 o'Clock, 'where I spoke to them as follows,</p>
            <p>Brothers, I have called you together in Council, by Order of
your Brother the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to acquaint you that
I am sent, with all possible Dispatch, to visit, and deliver a
Letter to the <hi>French</hi> Commandant, of very great Importance to
your Brothers the <hi>English;</hi> and I dare say, to you their Friends
and Allies.</p>
            <p>I was desired, Brothers, by your Brother the Governor, to
call upon you, the Sachems of the Nations, to inform you of it,
and to ask your Advice and Assistance to proceed the nearest
and best Road to the <hi>French.</hi> You see, Brothers, I have got
thus for on my Iourney.</p>
            <p>His Honour likewise desired me to apply to you for some of your
young Men, to conduct and provide Provisions for us on our
Way, and be a Safeguard against those <hi>French Indians</hi> who
have taken up the Hatchet against us. I have spoke this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to you, Brothers, because his Honour our Governor
treats you as good Friends and Allies, and holds you in great
Esteem. To confirm what I have said, I give you this String
of Wampum.</p>
            <p>After they had considered some Time on the above, the

               </gap>
we bear them.</p>
            <p>As I had Orders to make all possible Dispatch, and waiting
here was very contrary to my Inclination, I thanked him in the
most suitable Manner I could, and told him that my Business
required the greatest Expedition, and would not admit of that
Delay: He was not well pleased that I should offer to go
before the Time he had appointed, and told me that he could
not consent to our going without a Guard, for Fear some
Accident should be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

besides, says he, this is a Matter of no small Moment, and
must not be entered into without due Consideration; for
now I intend to deliver up the <hi>French</hi>-Speech-Belt, and make
the <hi>Shanoahs</hi> and Delawares do the same: and accordingly
he gave Orders to King <hi>Shingiss,</hi> who was present, to attend
on <hi>Wednesday</hi> Night with the Wampum, and two Men of
their Nation to be in Readin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

As I found it was impossible to get off without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting

            <p>
               <hi>28th.</hi> He returned this Evening, and came with <hi>Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toocha,</hi>
and two other Sachems to my Tent; and begged,
(as they had complied with his Honour the Governor's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
in providing Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to know on what Business
we were going to the <hi>French?</hi> this was a Question I all along
expected, and had provided as satisfactory Answers to, as I
could, and which allayed their Curiosity a little.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monocatoocha</hi> informed me, that an <hi>Indian</hi> from Venango
brought News, a few Days ago, that the <hi>French</hi> had called all
the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

told them that they intended to have been down the River
this Fall, but the Waters were growing cold, and the Winter
advancing, which obliged them to go into Quarters: But
they might assuredly expect them in the Spring, with a far
greater Number; and desired that they might be quite pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and not to intermeddle, unless they had a Mind to
draw all their Force upon them, for that they expected to
fight the <hi>English</hi> three Years, (as they supposed there would
be some Attempts made to stop them) in which Time they
should conquer, but if they should prove equally strong,
that they and the <hi>English,</hi> would join to cut them all off,
and divide the Land between them; that tho' they had lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Men enough to reinforce them, and make them Mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'This Speech, he said, was delivered to them by one Captain
<hi>Ioncaire</hi> their Interpreter in Chief, living at Venango, and
a Man of Note in the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>29th.</hi> The Half-King and <hi>Monocatoocha,</hi> came very
early, and begged me to stay one Day more, for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they had used all the Diligence in their Power, the
Shanoah Chiefs had not brought the Wampum they ordered,
but would certainly be in To-night; if not, they would delay
me no longer, but would send it after us as soon as they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived:
When I found them so pressing in their Request, and
knew that returning of Wampum was the abolishing of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements;
and giving this up, was shaking of all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon the <hi>French,</hi> I consented to stay, as I believed an
Offence offered at this Crisis, might be attended with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ill Consequence, than another Day's Delay. They also
informed me that <hi>Shingiss</hi> could not get in his Men, and was
prevented from coming himself by his Wife's Sickness,
(I believe, by Fear of the <hi>French</hi>) but that the Wampum of
that Nation was lodged with <hi>Custaloga</hi> one of their Chiefs at
<hi>Venango.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening late they came again and acquainted me
that the <hi>Shannoahs</hi> were not yet come, but it should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
the Prosecution of our Journey. He delivered in my
Hearing, the Speeches that were to be made to the <hi>French,</hi>
by <hi>Ieskakake,</hi> one of their old Chiefs, which was giving up
the Belt the late Commandant had asked for, and repeating
near the same Speech he himself had done before.</p>
            <p>He also delivered a String of Wampum to this Chief,
which was sent by King <hi>Shingiss,</hi> to be given to <hi>Custaloga,</hi>
with Orders to repair to the <hi>French,</hi> and deliver up the
Wampum.</p>
            <p>He likewise gave a very large String of black and white
Wampum, which was to be sent up immediately to the Six
Nations, if the <hi>French</hi> refused to quit the Land at this Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which was the third and last Time, and was the Right
of this <hi>Ieskakake</hi> to deliver.</p>

               <hi>30th.</hi> Last Night the great Men assembled to their
Council-House, to consult further about this Journey, and
who were to go; the Result of which was, that only three of
their Chiefs, with one of their best Hunters, should be our
Convoy: The Reason which they gave for not sending more,
after what had been proposed at Council the 26th, was, that
a greater Number might give the <hi>French</hi> Suspicions of some
bad Design, and cause them to be treated rudely: But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think they could not get their Hunters in.</p>
            <p>We set out about 9 o'Clock with the Half-King, <hi>Ieska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kake,
White Thunder,</hi> and the Hunter, and travelled on the
Road to <hi>Venango,</hi> where we arrived the 4th of <hi>December,</hi>
without any Thing remarkable happening but a continued
Series of bad Weather.</p>
            <p>This is an old <hi>Indian</hi> Town, situated at the Mouth of
<hi>French</hi> Creek on <hi>Ohio,</hi> and lies near N. about 60 Miles
from the <hi>Loggs</hi>-Town, but more than 70 the Way we were
obliged to go.</p>
            <p>We found the <hi>French</hi> Colours hoisted at a House which
they drove Mr. <hi>Iohn Frazier,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Subject, from;
I immediately repaired to it, to know where the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
resided: There were three Officers, one of whom, Capt.
<hi>Ioncaire,</hi> inform'd me, that he had the Command of the
<hi>Ohio,</hi> but that there was a General Officer at the near Fort,
which he advised me to for an Answer. He invited us to
sup with them, and treated us with the greatest Complaisance.</p>
            <p>The Wine, as they dosed themselves pretty plentifully
with it, soon banished the Restraint which at first appear'd
in their Conversation, and gave a License to their Tongues
to reveal their Sentiments more freely.</p>
            <p>They told me, That it was their absolute Design to take
Possession of the <hi>Ohio,</hi> and by G—they would do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for that they were sensible the <hi>English</hi> could raise two Men
for their one; yet they knew, their Motions were too slow
and dilstory to prevent any Undertaking of theirs. They
pretend to have an undoubted Right to the River, from a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007331_0014_0000000000000000"/>
Discovery made by one <hi>La Sol</hi> 60 Years ago; and the
Rise of this Expedition is, to prevent our settling on the
River or Waters of it, as they have heard of some Families
moving out in Order thereto. From the best Intelligence
I could get, there have been 1500 Men on this Side <hi>Ontario</hi>
Lake, but upon the Death of the General all were recalled
to about 6 or 700, who were left to garrison four Forts,
150 or there abouts in each, the first of which is on <hi>French</hi>
Creek, near a small Lake, about 60 Miles from <hi>Venango,</hi>
near N. N. W. the next lies on Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> where the
greatest Part of their Stores are kept, about 15 Miles from
the other; from that it is 120 Miles to the carrying Place,
at the Falls of Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> where there is a small Fort which
they lodge their Goods at, in bringing them from <hi>Montreal,</hi>
the Place that all their Stores come from: The next Fort
lies about 20 Miles from this, on <hi>Ontario</hi> Lake; between
this Fort and <hi>Montreal</hi> there are three others, the first of
which is near opposite to the <hi>English</hi> Fort <hi>Oswego.</hi> From
the Fort on Lake <hi>Erie</hi> to <hi>Montreal</hi> is about 600 Miles,
which they say requires no more, if good Weather, than
four Weeks Voyage, if they go in Barks or large Vessels,
that they can cross the Lake; but if they come in Canoes
it will require 5 or 6 Weeks, for they are oblig'd to keep
under the Shore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5th,</hi> Rain'd excessively all Day, which prevented our
Travelling. Capt. <hi>Ioncaire</hi> sent for the Half-King, as he
had but just heard that he came with me: He affected to
be much concern'd that I did not make free to bring them
in before; I excused it in the best Manner I was capable,
and told him I did not think their Company agreeable, as
I had heard him say a good deal in Dispraise of <hi>Indians</hi> in
general; but another Motive prevented me from bringing
them into his Company; I knew he was Interpreter, and a
Person of very great Influence among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and had
lately used all possible Means to draw them over to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007331_0015_0000000000000000"/>
therefore I was desirous of giving no Opportunity
that could be avoided.</p>
            <p>When they came in, there was great Pleasure express'd at

coming to visit him, made several trifling Presents,
and applied Liquor so fast, that they were soon render'd
incapable of the Business they came about, notwithstanding
the Caution that was given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6th,</hi> The Half-King came to my Tent, quite sober, and
insisted very much that I should stay and hear what he had
to say to the <hi>French;</hi> I fain would have prevented his speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Thing, 'til he came to the Commandant; but could

               </gap>vail: He told me, that at this Place a Council Fire
was kindled, where all their Business with these People was
to be transacted, and that the Management of the <hi>Indian</hi>
Affairs was left solely to Monsieur <hi>Ioncaire.</hi> As I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of knowing the Issue of this, I agreed to stay, but
sent our Horses a little Way up <hi>French</hi> Creek, to raft over
and encamp; which I knew would make it near Night.</p>
            <p>About 10 o'Clock they met in Council; the King spoke
much the same as he had before done to the General,
and offer'd the <hi>French</hi> Speech-Belt which had before been
demanded, with the Marks of four Towns on it, which
Monsieur <hi>Ioncaire</hi> refused to receive; but desired him to
carry it to the Fort to the Commander.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7th,</hi> Monsieur <hi>La Force,</hi> Commissary of the <hi>French</hi>
Stores, and three other Soldiers came over to accompany
us up. We found it extremely difficult getting the <hi>Indians</hi>
off To-day, as every Stratagem had been used to prevent
their going up with me: I had last Night l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft <hi>Iohn Davison</hi>
(the <hi>Indian</hi> Interpreter that I brought from the <hi>Loggs</hi>-Town
with me) strictly charg'd not to be out of their Company,
as I could not get them over to my Tent (they having
some Business with <hi>Custaloga,</hi> to know the Reason why he
did not deliver up the <hi>French</hi> Belt which he had in Keeping)
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007331_0016_0000000000000000"/>
but was obliged to send Mr. <hi>Gist</hi> over To-day to fetch
them, which he did with great Persuasion.</p>
            <p>At 11 o'Clock we set out for the Fort, and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
from arriving there 'til the 11th by excessive Rains,
Snows, and bad Travelling, through many Mires and
Swamps, which we were obliged to pass, to avoid crossing
the Creek, which was impossible; either by fording or raft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Water was so high and rapid.</p>
            <p>We passed over much good Land since we left <hi>Venango,</hi>
and through several extensive and very rich Meadows; one
of which I believe was near four Miles in Length, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
wide in some Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>12th,</hi> I prepar'd early to wait upon the Commander, and
was received and conducted to him by the second Officer
in Command; I acquainted him with my Business, and
offer'd my Commission and Letter, both of which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
me to keep 'til the Arrival of Monsieur <hi>Riparti,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
at the next Fort, who was sent for and expected every
Hour.</p>
            <p>This Commander is a Knight of the military Order of
St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and named <hi>Legardeur de St. Piere.</hi> He is an elderly
Gentleman; and has much the Air of a Soldier; he was
sent over to take the Command, immediately upon the
Death of the late General, and arrived here about seven
Days before me.</p>
            <p>At 2 o'Clock the Gentleman that was sent for arrived,
when I offer'd the Letter; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> again; which they receiv'd,
and adjourn'd into a private Apartment for the Captain to
translate, who understood a little <hi>English;</hi> after he had done
it, the Commander desired I would walk in, and bring my
Interpreter to peruse and correct it, which I did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>13th,</hi> The chief Officers retired, to hold a Council of
War, which gave me an Opportunity of taking the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
of the Fort, and making what Observations I
could.</p>

It is situated on the South, or West Fork of <hi>French</hi>
Creek, near the Water, and is almost surrounded by the
Creek, and a small Branch of it which forms a Kind of an
Island; four Houses compose the Sides; the Bastions are
made of Piles driven into the Ground, and about 12 Feet
above, and sharp at Top, with Port-Holes cut for Cannon
and Loop-Holes for the small Arms to fire through; there are
eight 6 lb. Pieces mounted, two in each Bastion, and one Piece
of four Pound before the Gate; in the Bastions are a Guard-House,
Chapel, Doctor's Lodging, and the Commander's
private Store, round which are laid Plat-Forms for the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Men to stand on: There are several Barracks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Fort, for the Soldiers Dwelling, covered, some with
Bark, and some with Boards, and made chiefly of Loggs:
There are also several other Houses, such as Stables, Smiths
Shop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could get no certain Account of the Number of Men
here; but according to the best Judgment I could form,
there are an Hundred exclusive of Officers, of which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are many. I also gave Orders to the People that were with
me, to take an exact Account of the Canoes that were haled
up to convey their Forces down in the Spring, which they
did, and told 50 of Bir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

many others that were block'd out, in Readiness to make.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>14th,</hi> As the Snow encreased very fast, and our Horses
daily became weaker, I sent them off unloaded, under the
Care of <hi>Barnaby Currin</hi> and two others, to make all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Dispatch to <hi>Venango,</hi> and there wait our Arrival if
there was a Prospect of the Rivers freezing, if not, then to
continue down to <hi>Shanapin</hi>'s Town, at the Forks of <hi>Ohio,</hi>
and there to wait 'til we came to cross <hi>Aligany,</hi> intending
myself to go down by Water, as I had the Offer of a Canoe
or Two.</p>

               </gap>ssed for Admittance this Evening, which at
Length was granted them, privately, with the Commander
and one or two other Officers: The Half-King told me,
that he offer'd the Wampum to the Commander, who
evaded taking it, and made many fair Promises of Love
and Friendship; said he wanted to live in Peace, and trade
amicably with them, as a Proof of which he would send
some Goods immediately down to the <hi>Loggs</hi>-Town for
them; but I rather think the Design of that is, to bring
away all our straggling Traders they meet with, as I pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
understood they intended to carry an Officer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
with them; and what rather confirms this Opinion, I was
enquiring of the Commander, by what Authority he had
made Prisoners of several of our <hi>English</hi> Subjects; he
told me that the Country belong'd to them, that no <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishman</hi>
had a Right to trade upon those Waters; and that
he had Orders to make every Person Prisoner that attempted
it on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> or the Waters of it.</p>
            <p>I enquir'd of Capt. <hi>Riparti</hi> about the Boy that was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by, as it was done while the Command devolved on
him, between the Death of the late General, and the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the present; he acknowledged, that a Boy had been
carried past, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> had two or three white
Men's Scalps, (I was told by some of the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Venango</hi>
Eight) but pretended to have forgot the Name of the Place
that the Boy came from, and all the Particulars, though he
question'd him for some Hours, as they were carrying him
past: I likewise enquired what they had done with <hi>Iohn
Trotter</hi> and <hi>Iames MacClocklan,</hi> two <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
whom they had taken, with all their Goods: They
told me, that they had been sent to <hi>Canada,</hi> but were now
returned Home.</p>
            <p>This Evening I received an Answer to his Honour the

this Affair; I saw that every Stratagem that the most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Brain could invent, was practised, to win the Half-King
to their Interest, and that leaving Him here was giving them
the Opportunity they aimed at.—I went to the Half-King,
and press'd him in the strongest Terms to go: He
told me the Commandant would not discharge him 'til the,
Morning. I then went to the Commandant, and desired
him to do their Business, and complisin'd of ill Treatment;

and remain in the Water Half an Hour or more, getting
over the Shoals; at one Place the Ice had lodged and made
it impassable by Water; therefore we were obliged to carry
our Canoe across a Neck of Land, a Quarter of a Mile over.
We did not reach <hi>Venango,</hi> till the 22d, where we met with
our Hors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>23d.</hi> When I got Things ready to set off, I sent for the Half-King,
to know whether he intended to go with us, or by
Water, he told me that <hi>White-Thunder</hi> had hurt himself
much, and was sick and unable to walk, therefore he was
obliged to carry him down in a Canoe: As I found he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to stay here a Day or two, and knew that Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ioncaire</hi> would employ every Scheme to set him against the
<hi>English</hi> as he had before done; I told him I hoped he would
guard against his Flattery, and let no fine Speeches influence
him in their Favour: He desired I might not be concerned,
for he knew the <hi>French</hi> too well, for any Thing to engage
him in their Behalf, and though he could not go down with
us, he would endeavour to meet at the Forks with <hi>Ioseph
Campbell,</hi> to deliver a Speech for me to carry to his Honour
the Governor. He told me he would order the young Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to attend us, and get Provision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if wanted.</p>
            <p>Our Horses were now so weak and feeble, and the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
heavy, as we here obliged to provide all the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
that the Journey would require; that we doubted much
their performing it: therefore myself and others (except the
Drivers which were obliged to ride) gave up our Horses for
Packs, to assist along with the Baggage, I put myself in as
Indian walking Dress, and continued with them three Days,
till I found there was no Probability of their getting in, in
any reasonable Time; the Horses grew less able to travel
every Day; the Cold increased very fast, and the Roads were
becoming much worse by a deep Snow, continually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and as I was uneasy to get back, to make Report of
my Proceedings to his Honour the Governor, I determined
to prosecute my Journey the nearest Way through the
Woods, on Foot.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I left Mr. <hi>Vanbraam</hi> in Charge of our Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
with Money and Directions, to provide Necessaries
from Place to Place for themselves and Horses, and to make
the most convenient Dispatch in.</p>
            <p>I took my necessary Papers, pulled off my Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

myself up in a Match Coat; and with my Pack at my Back
with my Papers and Provisions in it, and a Gun, set out
with Mr. <hi>Gist,</hi> fitted in the same Manner, on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the
26th. The Day following, just after we had passed a Place
called the <hi>Murdering</hi>-Town, where we intended to quit the
Path, and steer across the Country for <hi>Shannapins</hi> Town, we
fell in with a Party of <hi>French</hi> Indians, who had lain in
Wait for us; one of them fired at Mr. <hi>Gist</hi> or me, not 15
Steps, but fortunately missed. We took this Fellow into
Custody, and kept him till about 9 o'Clock at Night, and
then let him go, and walked all the remaining Part of the
Night without making any Stop, that we might get the
Start, so far, as to be out of the Reach of their Pursuit the
next Day, as we were well assured they would follow our
Tract as soon as it was light: The next Day we continued
travelling till quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ark, and got to the River about two
Miles above <hi>Shannapins;</hi> we expected to have found the
River frozen, but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each
Shore; the Ice I suppose had broke up above, for it was
driving in vast Quantities.</p>
            <p>There was no Way for getting over but on a Raft, which
we set about, with but one poor Hatchet, and got finished
just after Sun-setting, after a whole Days Work; we got <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

launched, and on Board of it, and set off; but before we were
Half Way over, we were jammed in the Ice in such a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that we expected every Moment our Raft to sink, and
ourselves to perish, I put out my setting Pole to try to stop
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007331_0022_0000000000000000"/>
the Raft, that the Ice might pass by, when the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity

but I fortunately saved myself by catching hold of
one of the Raft Logs; notwithstanding all our Efforts we
could not get the Raft to either Shore, but were obliged, as
we were near an Island, to quit our Raft and make to it.</p>
            <p>The Cold was so extremely severe, that Mr. <hi>Gist,</hi> had all his
Fingers, and some of his Toes frozen, and the Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

up so hard, that we sound no Difficulty in getting off the
Island, on the Ice, in the Morning, and went to Mr. <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi>'s.

Parts of the Colony of <hi>Virginia,</hi> are so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
known to be the Property of the Crown
of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that it is a Matter of equal
Concern and Surprize to me, to hear that a Body of
<hi>French</hi> Forces are erecting Fortresses, and making
Settlements upon that River, within his Majesty's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>The many and repeated Complaints I have received of
these Acts of Hostility, lay me under the Necessity, of
sending, in the Name of the King my Master, the Bearer
hereof, <hi>George Washington,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of the Adjutants
General of the Forces of this Dominion, to complain to
you of the Encroachments thus made, and of the Injuries
done to the Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in open Violation
of the Law of Nations, and the Treaties now subsisting
between the two Crowns.</p>
            <p>If these Facts are true, and you shall think fit to justify
your Proceedings, I must desire you to acquaint me, by whose
Authority and Instructions you have lately marched from

               <hi>Canada,</hi> with an armed Force, and invaded the King of

that according to the Purport and Resolution of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
I may act agreably to the Commission I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with, from the King my Master.</p>
            <p>However Sir, in Obedience to my Instructions, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
my Duty to require your peaceable Departure;
and that you would forbear prosecuting a Purpose so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptive
of the Harmony and good Understanding, which
his Majesty is desirous to continue and cultivate with the
most Christian King.</p>
            <p>I persuade myself you will receive and entertain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<hi>Washington</hi> with the Candour and Politeness natural
to your Nation; and it will give me the greatest Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
if you return him with an Answer suitable to
