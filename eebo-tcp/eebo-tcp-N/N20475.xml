            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ELECTION SERMON.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>As we are convened with our civil fathers to pay our religious acknowledgments to the Deity, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in his temple, the theme for our contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I have ſelected from the ſacred pages, is this—</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <bibl>PROVERBS III.6.</bibl>
IN ALL THY WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM, AND HE SHALL DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RECT THY PATHS.</q>
            <p>THIS reſpected audience will eaſily forgive the omiſſion, if they ſhould hear nothing ſaid at this time concerning the neceſſity, the origin, or the nature of civil government; nor of the particular kind which is moſt eligible, and moſt conducive to the happineſs of a ſtate or nation: Things which have been often attempted on ſuch occaſions, and by thoſe who were thought equal to the undertaking. Neither will it be ſo requiſite to point out thoſe qualifications which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026855_0005_0FD23967AECA1A88"/>
the delegated electors ought to regard in thoſe whom they, ſet up as rulers, as in thoſe times when one whole branch of the legiſlative body were choſen by the aſſembled repreſentatives, on this anniverſary. Accordingly a ſubject is choſen which does not lead to theſe things; but to ſhew the neceſſity of paying a due regard to the moſt high God; and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an important encouragement to our ſo doing.</p>
            <p>THE words <hi>ways,</hi> and <hi>paths,</hi> in the text, are eaſily underſtood as applied to a man's conduct in the courſe of his life; to that of one as much as another, whatever may be his ſtation; ſo that the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the affairs of government is included.</p>
            <p>IF any ſuch perſons can be found, as deny, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe, the exiſtence of the Divine Being, they are fartheſt of all men from complying with the duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the text. But it may juſtly be doubted whether any rational human creature has lived and died under ſuch a deluſion. The opinion can only be founded in folly. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God</hi>; and of ſuch only it is to be expected, who are either naturally wanting in underſtanding, or who have greatly abuſed and obſcured the light of reaſon and conſcience by ſin. <hi>For by the things that are made,</hi> and muſt have been created by him, <hi>are clearly ſeen, and underſtood, his eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi> The exiſtence of things, not eternal nor ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, muſt lead us to believe in one who is ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026855_0006_0FD23938FAD57A48"/>
without beginning, and poſſeſſed of all perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions.</p>
            <p>BUT the acknowledgment of this truth, That God is, cannot be all, nor the principal thing which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. For by this the generality of mankind are but little, if at all, diſtinguiſhed one from another.</p>
            <p>THE belief of God's governing providence over all his works is undoubtedly included; and the oral profeſſion of this belief is not excluded. For it would be irrational to ſuppoſe that the Almighty Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the univerſe has no governing influence over the work of his own hands.</p>
            <p>WE do not deny that Omnipotence, directed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom, is equal to the taſk of making a moſt huge and complicated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſhould need no direction, or ſupport, after the original impulſe, in order to anſwer innumerable wiſe ends in its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But that he has done this in the ſtructure of the material univerſe, it is impoſſible to prove. Much has been diſcovered by philoſophers, concerning the laws of matter and motion. But the moſt ſagacious theoriſt could never aſſign any phyſical cauſe of grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, which probably pervades all matter, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects its motions: But have confeſſed that this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal property, or affection, may be no other than a conſtant energy of the Supreme Being, If this is the caſe, or allowed to be ſo, the reality of a divine prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026855_0007_0FD2393F90CEA490"/>
is not to be denied, or doubted. He that ſtands at helm, we may ſay, directs the ſhip and governs its motions.</p>
            <p>IN language of inſpiration, God is ſaid to <hi>uphold all things by the word of his power</hi>; and without him, it is aſſerted, that not even a ſparrow dies. How much more then muſt the nobleſt of his viſible creatures, and their affairs, be under his direction? Thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God which are fitted to act morally, from motive and choice, are evidently under his governing influence. This appears from his impoſing ſyſtems of laws to regulate their conduct; from his promiſes and threatenings, of rewards to the obedient, and puniſhments to the rebellious; from the promiſed aſſiſtances of his Holy Spirit, and the miniſtration of the celeſtial angels to the heirs of ſalvation. By the divine agency, either directly or through his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the meek are guided in judgment; and even the hearts of kings, however ſtubborn, are turned by the Monarch of the univerſe, as the rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>AND if individual perſons are under the divine guidance, the ſame is ſurely the caſe of ſtates and communities, which are compoſed of individuals. Theſe are equally fit ſubjects of the divine government, and would be equally unhappy in the want of it. Accordingly we are aſſured in holy writ, that <hi>the kingdom is the Lord's,</hi> and that <hi>he is the Governor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026855_0008_0FD2394147C75540"/>
the nation.</hi> With good reaſon then do his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants believe in his governing providence, as exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this inferior world.</p>
            <p>PRAYER is alſo a fit acknowledgment of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Men ſhould ſo depend upon the divine influence, and be ſo affected with a perſuaſion of it, as to apply to him for guidance, in all their important affairs and transactions, <hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him.</hi> This will be following the divine direction in other parts of the ſacred volume; and the laudable examples of the devoted ſervants of God, both in ancient and modern times.</p>
            <p>AND this ſeeking to God for direction is not only the duty and privilege of the common people, but more eſpecially of thoſe who are called to guide the ſtate, and adminiſter the great affairs of the publick. For theſe men act not only for themſelves, but for the whole community. So that errors in their conduct may be moſt extenſively hurtful and pernicious. And queſtions come before them in the courſe of their buſineſs, not only of great weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but often very complicated and perplexed. And as the conſcience of a good ruler will not allow him to act and determine by gueſs, or at random; how great need has he, not only of exerting his own beſt abilities, but of ſupplicating the friendly aid of one, in whom are boundleſs treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, and who cannot err in judgment? Every
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026855_0009_0FD2291747362930"/>
pious ruler is convinced of his need of aſſiſtance from on high; and will gladly make uſe of his privilege to repair to the throne of grace for this favour, in the arduous affairs of government. Moſes affords ſuch an example to human governors. He was wont to apply to God for direction, in guiding his refractory people. And Solomon, when a choice of divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours was offered him, ſupplicated for wiſdom and underſtanding, to enable him to manage the affairs of his government.</p>
            <p>I TRUST I am not ſpeaking to thoſe who will ſay in their hearts, <hi>What profit ſhall we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> The duty of prayer is not only enjoined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly in the oracles of God; but clearly dictated by the light of nature, as appears from the conduct of the heathen mariners with Jonah. There cannot be a more reaſonable ſervice. But for our aſſurance of gracious anſwers to our prayers, we are moſtly, if not wholly, beholden to divine revelation. By this we learn that God is nigh unto all that call upon him, or invoke him with ſincerity; and that, if we implore his aid in caſes of difficulty, he will direct our paths.</p>
            <p>THOUGH the intention and uſe of prayer cannot be to inform the omniſcient Being of our wants, nor to alter the purpoſes of our unchangeable benefactor, there is ſtill a connection between aſking and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his favours. And this devout exerciſe will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſerve to keep up in our minds a ſenſe of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026855_0010_0FD2398852DE2B70"/>
and of our wants and dependence; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for the right reception and improvement of what he beſtows.</p>
            <p>THERE are many ways in which he can give us aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and direction, beſides doing it by the immediate agency of his Spirit. And his power of doing the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter none will dare to diſpute. The almighty agent, who created the human ſoul, has a more near and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate acceſs to it than any creature can have; ſo that he can excite in men ſuch ideas, and lead them into ſuch trains of thought, as ſhall influence their actions in perfect conſiſtency with their moral agency, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countableneſs for their conduct.</p>
            <p>BUT a practical acknowledgment of the Deity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, alſo, a profound ſubmiſſion to his authority over us, and a voluntary obedience to his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What will it avail for men to profeſs that he has in his hands, by right, and in fact, the government of the world, if they oppoſe their wills and actions to his infinite authority? Or, of what account will be their belief of his exiſtence, ſo long as they allow themſelves to live in practical atheiſm? It is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad character, given of ſome who profeſs to know God, that in their works they deny him, being abom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inable and diſobedient, and to every good work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</p>
            <p>THIS practical acknowledgment of God is the higheſt intereſt, and the unqueſtionable duty of all
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026855_0011_0FD239498AB13E60"/>
men. And all the wiſe and good rejoice in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine commandments; accounting the ſervice of God as better than freedom; and take delight in conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to their knowledge of his will, as it is conducive to his honour, and to the reſtoration and felicity of their lapſed nature. But the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itent and disobedient diſreliſh the divine government, placing the moſt of their happineſs in ſecular and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, immoral, and ungodly conduct: And, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the divine forewarnings and threatenings, r;uſh headlong in the way to perdition.</p>
            <p>FROM the doctrines contained in the ſubject, civil rulers may be led to obſerve ſomething of the nature of their duty towards God. As men, they are on the ſame footing as others; equally bound to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Deity, in all the ways that are dictated by reaſon and revelation. They ſhould alſo remember that, as they are miniſters of God, and his repreſentatives, it is of high importance that they be followers of him in all his moral perfections and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as far as their ability extends; eſpecially in their conduct towards men. Otherwiſe they will be unfit to be conſidered as earthly Gods. They are ſet in conſpicuous places; and have it in their power to be extenſively beneficial to mankind, by their pious and virtuous examples. They ſhould not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves, in all their conduct, to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, but exhibit in their lives bright patterns of ſubmiſſion to the good laws of men. If private
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026855_0012_0FD23967B1A92280"/>
Chriſtians are ſacredly bound to ſhew forth the virtues of him who has called them, and to ſhine as lights in the world; much more is it requiſite in men who are veſted with civil authority. For their good examples will be far more influential on mankind, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe in the lower walks of life. Mankind are ambitious of imitating the conduct of their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. And as the talent is given to magiſtrates, in, this way to be publick benefactors, they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that they muſt be anſwerable to the ſupreme gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, if they are found guilty of the non-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. For they muſt be viewed as diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine authority, unleſs they comply with this duty; and may juſtly expect the fate of the unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervant.</p>
            <p>THEY muſt enact no laws but ſuch as have the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick welfare for their object: For God inveſts them with no authority, but to do good.</p>
            <p>BUT if, inſtead of practically acknowledging the divine authority over them, they take advantage from their promotion to affront and provoke him, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the people, or neglecting to ſerve them; and by wicked examples encourage immorality and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs; what account will they be able to give of themſelves to their maſter in heaven?</p>
            <p>POSSESSION of the publick power is attended with ſome peculiar temptations. It enables men, in ſome caſes, to commit wickedneſs with impunity. Thoſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026855_0013_0FD2291AC93CF5B0"/>
who hold the reins of government can defraud the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of their juſt dues, and eſtabliſh iniquity by laws. They can ſecure to themſelves the emoluments of their office, without performing its duties accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intention, and juſt expectation of their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. They have opportunity to influence in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of unfit perſons to ſerve in the judicial and executive departments of government; and to keep out thoſe of better characters, for the ſake of bribes, the proſpect of advantages to themſelves or families, or through prejudice and party ſpirit. That thoſe who are drawn aſide from the path of duty by ſuch ſiniſter motives are unſit for the high employment of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and guiding the affairs of a State, cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. Inſtead of approving themſelves as the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of God for the good of the people, they may be conſidered as emiſſaries of ſatan, and ſcourges of the publick. Such men do not acknowledge the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being. They are deſtitute of religious rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards him; and the language of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is, that they will not have him to reign over them.</p>
            <p>ALSO, the duty of rulers to mankind, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to thoſe who veſt them with authority, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from the ſubject. If they have a due regard to the Deity, they will make uſe of their power and authority as he requires, no otherwiſe than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs of ſociety. The latter cannot but flow from the former; and where the latter is not, a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026855_0014_0FD2396A591A54A0"/>religious regard to the Deity has no place. For an Apoſtle of Chriſt has well ſaid, <hi>If a man love not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PHILANTHROPY is a Chriſtian virtue of eſſential importance; and in men of publick character it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably requiſite to their anſwering the deſigns of their appointment. Patriotiſm is the branch of it which ſhould be a ſtriking trait in their character. The worthy magiſtrate will therefore bear it in mind that he is put into office to promote the welfare of the community, and of that particular part of which he is ſtrictly a member. This is not only the great deſign of God, but of man, in his appointment. No free people are ſuppoſed to elect a ruler for any different purpoſe. He will therefore endeavour, in all his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial conduct, to promote the public welfare. As a legiſlator he will give his vote for the enacting of no laws, and the annexing of no ſanctions, but ſuch as he is convinced will be conducive to the good of the publick, let who will be in favour of them. For though he ought to weigh with candour all that may be ſaid againſt his opinion, after all he muſt act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dictates of his own reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. He is principally anſwerable to God, and to the vicegerent of God in his own boſom.</p>
            <p>AND as a friend to ſociety, ſuch a ruler will think it of importance to prevent, as far as may be, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026855_0015_0FD2291D4C959E60"/>and obſcurity in the language of laws, which may render them perplexing and enſnaring to the common people.</p>
            <p>IN the repealing of laws, he muſt be actuated by the ſame conſcientious and benevolent principles. And there may be as real occaſions for unmaking old, as for making new laws and regulations. By means of changes in the circumſtances of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, thoſe which were once good and neceſſary may become unfit and inexpedient. And if antiquated and uſeleſs laws, or even any which cannot be put into execution, are ſuffered to ſtand unrepealed, it may be queſtioned whether they do not operate to the weakening of the hands of government; or lead ſubjects to diſobey the beſt laws with hopes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.</p>
            <p>THE worthy magiſtrate will be ſo tender of the publick welfare, that he will be careful to inform himſelf of the true characters of candidates for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate offices, knowing that vicious and ungodly men ought never, unleſs in caſes of neceſſity, to be entruſted with power; leſt they ſhould ſo abuſe it as to bring ſcandal upon government, and miſchief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people. And being acquainted with their characters, he will not countenance their being put into places of honour or truſt; nor will he connive at the continuance of ſuch perſons in office. The ſubordinate officers which Moſes was adviſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026855_0016_0FD2395E70EFEC70"/>
were not only to be able men, capable of performing the duties of their ſtation, but ſuch as feared God, and were men of truth, hating covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>GOOD rulers will be actuated by ſuch a care for the happineſs of the community, that they will uſe their wiſdom to explore ways and means to alleviate the publick burdens, and the hardſhips which chance to fall upon individuals, or on particular orders of men; impoſe no burdens without real neceſſity, for the ſupport of government, for the defence of the State, or the increaſe of publick happineſs on the whole. And they will ſtudy to call for ſuch contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions only, as can be made in the moſt eaſy, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and imperceptible manner.</p>
            <p>IT may be expected of them that they be encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers and ſupporters of the means of education, by good laws, and by ſuch eſtabliſhments and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as appear fit and needful. Eſpecially this will be done by intelligent republican rulers; as on it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the peace, proſperity, and perpetuity of the State: How eaſily might an ignorant people be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by an eloquent demagogue to rebel againſt ſuch a government, and introduce anarchy, confuſion and ruin? How unqualified are ſuch a people to elect able rulers, and ſuch as are fit to be entruſted with authority? They will ſet up men who are like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, through partiality, or ignorance, or from the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026855_0017_0FD2393A5E331058"/>
neceſſity of the caſe. And when the blind have blind leaders, all will be confounded together.</p>
            <p>IT may be ſaid, to the honour of our conſtitution of government, that civil rulers are happily reſtrained by it from the abuſe of power; and in particular, from interfering with the rights of conſcience. So long as they make this their directory, ſubjects need be under no diſmal apprehenſions of oppreſſion. But ſhall magiſtrates make no uſe at all of authority with reſpect to religion and morality? It is agreed that it would be going beyond their line to do anything of this ſort, more than is perfectly conſiſtent, with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred rights of conſcience. For, as Chriſtians, we are under the government of Chriſt; and civil rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as ſuch, have no authority in his kingdom. And yet they may, and they ought to be, nurſing fathers to the church of Chriſt. They may ſecure to Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians the enjoyment of the rights of conſcience; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being interrupted in the exerciſe of their religion; and enable Chriſtian ſocieties to raiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions among themſelves, to ſerve religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. And if, with political views, they may enforce the ſupport of ſchools for the inſtruction of youth, why not that of meetings for the inſtruction of grown up children in religion and morality, ſo far as they ſhall judge it needful to promote the welfare of ſociety? Why not oblige a diſhoneſt perſon to attend theſe meetings, of the denomination he prefers, if it were only to prevent his invading the property of his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026855_0018_0FD239615F903728"/>
Chriſtian neighbours, while they are at the place of publick worſhip? And why not conſtrain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſon to do the ſame, in hope that he may learn to be afraid of perjury, the practice of which vice would be pernicious to a community, as it would render good government impracticable. All that is indiſputably beneficial to ſociety, and conſiſtent with the rights of individuals, is within their line. And good inſtructions in piety and morality are ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of this ſort, that they have been adopted by the moſt applauded of ancient governments.</p>
            <p>WE rejoice with our honoured rulers this day, in the peace, independence, and proſperity of our State and Nation. And we look back with pleaſure, and devout gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, on the ſnares which we have eſcaped. The Lord was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us. As by Moſes he delivered his choſen people from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian bondage; ſo he raiſed up a leader to our forces, of like wiſdom and patriotick zeal, whoſe name will be equally known to future generations.</p>
            <p>OUGHT we not to be the more ſenſibly affected with our deliverance, and the obtainment and ſecurity of our rights, when we conſider with what amazing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties a great and powerful nation, in alliance with us, have been ſtruggling, to obtain and ſecure the ſame rights, and a free government, of which we are in the peaceable poſſeſſion? May all their wiſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026855_0019_0FD239531D6033E0"/>
deſigns, and laudable endeavours, be crowned with happy ſucceſs; and thoſe individuals among them, and nations around them, who have unrighteouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their deſign of reforming their national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be convinced of the evil of their conduct. Are the governors of that afflicted nation charged with cruelty, on account of the multitude of capital pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments? The blame of this ſhould partly fall on their wicked invaders, whoſe bloody onſets and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious intrigues, have encouraged many to engage in inſurrections, treaſons and rebellions, by which they forfeit their lives. What degrees of lenity might have been exerciſed towards offenders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the ſafety of the State, perhaps it is very difficult for us at this diſtance to determine. Whilſt, as true republicans we cannot but approve their glorious deſign, we may ſay they have probably fallen into great errors, in their zealous purſuit of it. Nor is it to be expected that their powers will be in the beſt manner directed, till they more devoutly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the government of him who is over all. It was right to reject an abſurd ſpecies of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and it is hoped that a better one will be ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted.</p>
            <p>THE union of our States ſeems to be ſettled on an immoveable baſis; and our rapid increaſe promiſes to give us national conſequence and reſpectability. We foreſee nothing to prevent it, under the wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a ſupreme executive in whom all hearts are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026855_0020_0FD2393CA503DC50"/>
united; nor ſo long as the ſpirit of mutual conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion is cultivated among the States. The nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſtitution, ſo generally approved, may be viewed as a band of that laſting union, which cannot be too zealouſly cultivated. That ſaying ſhould not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, By uniting we ſtand, by dividing we fall.</p>
            <p>THIS reſpectable State, in particular, has reaſon to rejoice in the enjoyment of its rights, and of a happy republican government. Our conſtitution does hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to its framers; approaches ſo near to perfection; and has hitherto ſo well anſwered the wiſe purpoſes of its formation, that it can hardly be thought adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to put ourſelves to the expenſe and trouble of a reviſal. It would be very uncertain whether any real amendment would, on the whole, be obtained.</p>
            <p>WITH pleaſure we behold a reſpectable delegation from the various parts of this extenſive Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for the purpoſe of tranſacting the important publick buſineſs of the preſent year. May theſe choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en patriots be actuated by a noble zeal to promote the publick welfare, and may heaven vouchſafe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all their ſteps. May they act in the fear of God, as they are accountable to him for their conduct. For though, on account of their ſtation, they are conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as children of the moſt high, they ſhall die like other men; and after death is the judgment.</p>
            <p>AND here we cannot refrain from condolence with our political fathers on a melancholy event, which has
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026855_0021_0FD23962DADDBF20"/>taken place ſince our laſt anniverſary election; the removal of that diſtinguiſhed perſon, and illuſtrious republican, who has ſo long ſat, and with ſo much dignity, in the chief ſeat of government. May his uniform and inextinguiſhable love of his country, and attachment to the rights of mankind; and not leſs his regard for the inſtitutions of religion, and friendſhip to the teachers of it, be remembered, and emulated by thoſe who ſhall hereafter be called to fill his important ſtation. Long will his philanthropy, generoſity and munificence, be had in remembrance. Eſpecially will the numerous partakers of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty riſe up and call his memory bleſſed.</p>
            <p>WE rejoice to ſee his venerable copatriot now in the place of firſt magiſtrate; a gentleman of well known, and long approved ability and virtue; who early took an active part towards the accompliſhment of our happy revolution. May the ſupreme Governor take him into his holy keeping: And, as he will not fail to acknowledge God, ſo may he be favoured with all needful divine direction, in the duties of his arduous office. Having always deſerved well of the publick, he will experience the moſt agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by having his power of doing good increaſed. May his life and uſefulneſs be protracted, that he may long rejoice in the gladneſs of our nation. And in the cloſing ſcene may his peaceful conſcience antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate that joyful plaudit, which all the faithful ſhall receive from the great Judge of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:026855_0022_0FD23954CE6977E8"/>THE reſpected, and much honoured gentlemen, who are elected to form the two branches of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, have received a recent teſtimony of the confidence of the people in their integrity and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we truſt will not be abuſed nor diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. As you are veſted with the power of the ſtate, and conſtituted guardians of its precious rights, your God, your conſciences, and your ſacred oaths, oblige you to uſe your beſt endeavours to promote the political good of this people. Your betruſtment is great, and part of your work may be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, at this eventful era, when our affairs are ſo much embarraſſed by means of the war that rages in Europe, and the depredations in the Weſt Indies, by which we greatly ſuffer. If you find that you need wiſdom, you are to aſk it of him who is the fountain of it, and anſwers the prayers of all who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him aright. In the elections of this day may you be under a divine guidance, and in all the buſineſs of your ſeſſions through the year.</p>
            <p>PERSUADED of the purity of your intentions, the preacher will not preſume to be your dictator, in a line that is out of his profeſſion: But would humbly recommend to your paternal attention a few things, which to him appear to be of ſome political import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>IF practicable, it ſeems deſirable that ſomething may be done towards putting into full execution the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026855_0023_0FD2397DE90F42D0"/>
law reſpecting ſchools; that the riſing generation may become poſſeſſed of thoſe advantages, which were anxiouſly deſired by the framers of it, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be thought important by an enlightened re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. And whether ſome harmleſs alteration might not render the law more eaſy to be enforced, is ſubmitted to your wiſe conſideration.</p>
            <p>OUR civil fathers will alſo conſider whether the means of defence ought not to be more attended to, than they have hit her to been; as we know not what alarms may come, nor what enemy may next be diſpoſed to invade us—whether military ſkill ſhould not be more aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cultivated—and the militia kept on the moſt reſpectable footing, that we may not be wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to repel an invaſion—And whether, in our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſpect of affairs, escouragement ſhould not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to the general government, not only for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting our navigation and commerce from piratical depredations; but for the ſpeedy erection of forts and batteries, on our expoſed maritime borders. A little delay, with reſpect to the laſt of theſe objects, may lead to tragical and diſtreſſing ſcenes. What other nation is contented with ſo defenceleſs a coaſt?</p>
            <p>FRUGALITY, induſtry and economy are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as excellent virtues in the inhabitants of any State. For without theſe no country arrives at opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; nor without their continuance, will depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and wretchedneſs be prevented, much more

are they needful in a young country, with low finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and which has yet done ſo little towards provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the publick ſafety and defence, theſe virtues are evangelical, as well as political, and eſſential parts of that righteouſneſs which exalts a nation. The want of them would effectually prevent our growing into that reſpectability, which we have been fondly anticipating in expectation. But why, in the name of reaſon, will we keep ourſelves low, by eagerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and purchaſing the trifling manufactures of diſtant nations? Poſſibly our political guardians, without the enaction of ſumptuary laws, may deviſe ſome means to check the rage for foreign ſuperfluities, which is complained of by many as too prevalent, and of a pernicious tendency.</p>
            <p>IN ſubſerviency to ſuch a deſign, might not ſeveral new manufactories be erected, and foſtered by the hand of government, to ſupply the people, not only with neceſſary things, but with ſome that are elegant and ornamental? the natural conſequence would be, preventing much of our wealth from taking wing, and flying to the tranſatlantick regions.</p>
            <p>THE government in time paſt has done honour to itſelf, by their kindneſs and aſſiſtance to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in this vicinity. You will consider what further help it may need, to continue and increaſe its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026855_0025_0FD2396BCD670BA8"/>
and uſefulneſs to the publick.<note n="*" place="bottom">BY means of the taking down of one of the buildings, that seat of learning has not been ſufficient, for ſeveral years paſt, to lodge all the ſtudents. Expenſe in education is thus increaſed; and a number of them at preſent are put to many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of a remote lodging; where they loſe the benefit of the immediate inſpection of the governours.</note> And not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that the central part only of this extenſive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ſo well furniſhed with the means of a liberal education; you cannot be ſo partial, but that you will be diſpoſed to eſtabliſh and endow ſimilar ſeats of learning in the remote parts; that ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants may not be in danger of loſing their repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican virtues through lack of knowledge. If the weſtern has been thus favoured, why ſhould not the oriental be attended to? Though, while the ſettlers are moſtly emigrants from the older parts of the Commonwealth, a few men of erudition may happen to be found among them; what proſpects can we have concerning the next and future generations? The need of erudition ſeems greater in a region bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on provinces of Britain, where principles of kingly government prevail; that the corruption and defection of the people may be effectually, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever prevented.</p>
            <p>IT is preſumed that you need not be reminded to conſult the honour and credit of government, by a punctual fulfilment of all the obligations the State is under; and render to all what they have a juſt right
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026855_0026_0FD239353866A4F8"/>
to expect. The ſpeaker dares not affront you ſo much as to ſuggeſt a ſuſpicion that you will take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your high authority to practice iniquity. Chriſtian rulers are not diſpoſed to injure the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the State; how much leſs its friends and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, its ſervants and defenders? For they will conſider that contracts are as much binding in the ſight of God, upon States and corporate bodies, as upon individuals; and that no fraudulent machiavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian policy may be expected to proſper.</p>
            <p>THE addreſs now turns to my fellow citizens of every rank, who are here aſſembled. As we wiſh and pray for the continuance and increaſe of publick proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, it is incumbent on us that, regarding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, we do all in our power to ſtrengthen the hands of the government we are providentially under. It is not enough that we elect wiſe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, to conduct the affairs of the publick. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to pay a ſacred regard to the laws; ſo as neither to violate them ourſelves, nor encourage oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in doing it. Thoſe who offend againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority ſhould be rebuked and puniſhed, that others may not dare to follow their example. And no improper fear of being perſecuted as informers ſhould deter any from cauſing offenders againſt our good government to be detected. If no zeal nor courage were wanting, in giving aſſiſtance to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power, government would diſcover its full energy, and happy effects; and comparatively few would be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026855_0027_0FD2396519EC1008"/>
moleſted in the enjoyment of their rights. It is not the want of good laws, ſo much as the want of virtue in the ſubjects to give them force, that occaſions our hearing of ſo many grievances, contentions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</p>
            <p>THAT the good laws of the land may be duly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, magiſtrates ſhould be revered and honoured. As they are veſted with the power, they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as poſſeſſors of the dignity and majeſty of the State. But, by refuſing them due honour, the people diſhonour themſelves, and contribute to bring the community into contempt.</p>
            <p>COMPLAINERS and fault-finders, who vent their gallagainſt publick characters and meaſures, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be diſcountenanced by every friend to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. For perſons ſhould not be haſty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that their rulers, have erred in any inſtance. They ſhould rather conſider that the collected wiſdom of the State or Nation, and the ſuperior advantages for information, poſſeſſed by political aſſemblies, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it probable that their deciſions are more wiſe and ſit than the opinions even of an enlightened individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual. But, as all men are liable to err, if our rulers are found to do ſo, none but peaceable and reſpectful methods ſhould be uſed to convince them. As an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical elder ſhould be entreated as a parent; ſo ſhould our political fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:026855_0028_0FD2397143795010"/>DISAFFECTION to government often ariſes from a ſordidly avaricious temper; which makes men back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to pay tribute, according to their ability and the exigencies of the State. How unreaſonable and ſhameful are ſuch a temper and conduct! Is it fit that we ſhould expect to receive for nothing the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefits of good government, the ſecurity of our liberties, perſons and fortunes? Can we wiſh our rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ſpend their time and attention in the publick ſervice, without an adequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te reward? Or can we be ready to indulge ſuſpicions that they are too forward to lay burdens upon us, when we know that they themſelves bear their proportion of them, according to their ſeveral abilities? For ſo happy is our ſituation ſince the revolution, that our rulers, in moſt caſes, cannot oppreſs us without hurting themſelves.</p>
            <p>LET us ſee that we always make the wiſeſt poſſible uſe of the power of appointing our own rulers, which the good providence of God has given us; implor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his direction in theſe matters; and endeavour in all poſſible ways to advance the publick welfare. For by ſo doing we ſhould remember that we promote our own happineſs. All the members partake of the health of the body, political, as well as natural. And that we may not fail of being good ſubjects, it ſhould be conſidered that we ought to obey our rulers from a principle of duty to our Almighty Sovereign. For good rulers are ordained by him; and by reſiſting them we ſhall oppoſe the ordinance of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

ourſelves to his wrath. It is therefore our duty, our intereſt, and wiſdom, to reſolve that we will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their laws, that ſo we may <hi>lead quiet and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lives,</hi> while we perſevere <hi>in all godlineſs and honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For this is good, and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING indeed can do more towards the ſupport of government, than the practice of religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Were mankind perfect in theſe things, human government and laws would be rendered uſeleſs. So that the more they are practiſed, the more eaſily gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment will be adminiſtered; and the more happy will be the condition of ſociety. Let us then reſolve, that, by the help of God, we will thus become ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactors to the publick. If this were done by the generality, a bleſſed reformation would be effected. The bleſſing of heaven would be upon us, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times would be experienced than have ever yet been known. Expenſive vices would give place to fruitful induſtry. Rulers and ruled, teachers and private Chriſtians, and all corporations inſtituted to ſerve the community, would exert themſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the public happineſs. The arts and ſciences would flouriſh, as genius and learning would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Agriculture and commerce would be more productive of ſupport and wealth. Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would increaſe, and arrive to the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The fame of our increaſing wealth and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs would draw multitudes of emigrants from oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

quarters of the globe, to aſſiſt in our improvements, and to participate in our proſperity. Our peace and happineſs would exhibit no faint picture of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted millennial ſtate, or be the dawn and introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
            <p>FINALLY. May perſons of all denominations be induced, from evangelical motives, to the religious acknowledgment of the Deity, and the practice of univerſal holineſs. Thus, being guided by divine counſel, ſhall we ſecure to ourſelves his approbation and acceptance, through the Redeemer; which are of infinitely greater conſequence to us, than all our terreſtrial enjoyments. The faſhion of this world is ſwiftly paſſing away. All human governments will ſoon be terminated, and gone forever. The rapid wheels of time are driving us on to our moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtate of exiſtence; in which all the godly and virtuous ſhall live in greater felicity than it is poſſible at preſent for us to conceive; a happineſs anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the deſires and capacities of our ſouls, without alloy, and without end.</p>
