            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SUPPLEMENT TO THE ESSAY ON MONIES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is not pretended that the foreign coins are accurately rated in the Pamphlet on Monies. Preciſion in this caſe is of but little conſequence in a publication, by a private perſon, which holds out intimation rather than inſtruction; and it remains with government to aſcertain preciſely the valuation of foreign coins.</p>
            <p>What would be the tendency of rating foreign coins at more or leſs, in cents, than their exact current value abroad? I wiſh you to pauſe on this queſtion,—weigh the probable conſequences. To me it ſeems that <hi>more</hi> of cents would induce an importation of coin in lieu of goods.—Goods, which, if imported, would be uſed luxuriouſly: but they would pay cuſtoms to the public, which the coins would not. The money imported would, however, invigorate commerce and enterprize. In proportion, as money abounds in the country it will diminiſh in its importation from foreign parts: and goods, imported, will increaſe in the like proportion, in return for our exports. What will the politician think of the conſequences of a great influx of luxuries in this caſe? Thoſe luxuries are not to be prohibited; but an increaſe of impoſt, on them, and a proper drawback on a re-exportation may be a wholeſome meaſure. The leſs frugal Planter ſays—"I am for <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi> foreign coins, as an encouragement to the bringing in more goods." This gay countryman ſpeaks not from motives of national good: he would have an abundant
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022368_0004_0FB859434E5407A0"/>influx of goods that he may buy them cheap, however ruinous to the merchant, and that then, beyond the ſupply of neceſſaries and comforts, he may riot in luxuries. There are thoſe, of other claſſes of people, who would <hi>over-rate</hi> the foreign coins from the like motive, a little of ſelf-gratification,—all are but men. The merchant, alſo for himſelf, wiſhes to ſee foreign coins valued, in cents, preciſely <hi>according to their current value abroad;</hi>—becauſe, when there is no overbearing influence applied for biaſſing the rates of money the one way or the other, it will aſſiſt commerce to ſeek, with itſelf, its own level, as doth water, until they ſettle, in uniſon, into an equal and unabating ſtream of employment and wealth to the nation.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſomewhere well ſaid, that—<hi>"The riches of a nation depend on the number of its inhabitants WELL EMPLOYED."</hi> "Riches" may here be underſtood to imply the means of national health, vigour, and happineſs.—What are nations,—what is man, without <hi>employment!</hi> Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the will of God, drowns evil thoughts—gives health and peace of mind—the comforts of life, and orderly manners and affections.</note> It is not meant but that the great repreſentative may and ought, and therefore will interfere when neceſſary for curbing enormities which oppoſe fair trade, or the intereſts of the nation or of commerce in general: but, a free government will be cautious not to diſturb the natural current of monies and trade, leſt they be driven to countries unuſed to check their better inclination.</p>
            <p>The Writer of the Eſſay on Monies ſubmitted the name, "Dollar," againſt his own judgment. It was not an eſſential, and the Congreſs in 1785 had adopted it. He conceived, that denomination was not ſo proper as ſome definite or original term would be. There are dollars of various countries and values: and it threatens to be an inconveniency, that within the United States there ſhould be monies of Spain, worth 108 cents, of a 50 <abbr>d.</abbr> dollar, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022368_0005_0FB85944D3B2A210"/>at the ſame time monies of the country, of the <hi>ſame denomination,</hi> worth but 100 cents, (at moſt 105 cents) from whence may ariſe ſome uncertainty in dealings and in converſations, when "dollars," indefinitely, are expreſſed. A haſty bargain is made for 100 "dollars." What, before a jury, are theſe dollars? Before judges of the ſuperior courts, they are declared to be dollars of the United States: before judges in by-places, there may, in practice, be ſome little latitude taken for declaring them to be the one or the other:—Inclination, ſometimes, has a powerful influence over judgment. If we ſay, "Fleece dollar"—or "Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs"—or "Federal dollar," in either caſe it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and prolix term. If called a "Fleece"—ſo of an "Eagle," the term is indefinite. "Dollar," however, is familiar to the people: Are the variety of dollars and their reſpective values alſo familiar to them?—A contract is made to pay 1000 dollars: the hand writing of the defendant is well proven; but there is no proof of the place where the contract was made, or for what dollars: in fact, it was made at the Havana, and pieces of eight rials, of Spaniſh money, were meant; yet judgment is rendered, in our courts, for dollars of the United States, of the value of 100 cents, whereas the plaintiff ought to have been paid dollars of 108 cents: ſo that he loſes 80 dollars of his juſt due.</p>
            <p>In valuing Spaniſh pieces of eight, it may be noted that nearly all, now in circulation, are of CHARLES III, and that theſe dollars are inferior to dollars of the former Kings of Spain, both in weight and fineneſs:—the old, more perfect dollars of Spain, are for ever gone. The medium weight of 13 Mexican pieces of eight of CH. III, was 416⅓ grains. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon's London prices current, for May 1784, make all the pieces of eight ſell at 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> 2½ <abbr>d.</abbr> an ounce; except the new dollars of Spain, which were at 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> 1½ <abbr>d.</abbr> ſo that the pieces of eight of CH. III, are worth but 53 <abbr>d.</abbr> 15/100, or 106 cents, 3 mills, of a 50 <abbr>d.</abbr> dollar; when the old dollars are worth 54 <abbr>d.</abbr> nearly, or 108 cents. The proportions of fine ſilver and of alloy in the pieces of eight of CH. III, may be diſcovered by calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022368_0006_0FB8594653EB6D20"/>on the value of them <hi>at market.</hi> They there ſell lower than other Spaniſh pieces of eight as 61½ to 62½ in the ounce. It may be preſumed, the acute dealers, in bullion, procured that new money to be nicely aſſayed at the mints, for aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its purity, before the price was ſet at market.

            <p>Portugal money of account is in rees and mill rees:—1000 rees are a mill ree. They are ſeparated by dotting off three figures from the right or unit ſide: ſo that 2000 and 4000 are 2.000 M. R. and 4.000 M. R. The coins of that nation have their value expreſſed on them in figures; and there are coins impreſſed with 20000, meaning ſo many rees or 20 mill rees. Fifty-four pence ſterling are of the value of 800 rees. Likewiſe the Spaniards impreſs on their pieces of eight the figure 8, meaning thereby eight rials; from whence the name "piece of eight."—Will American coins be marked in figures with their value in cents?</p>
            <p>Although Congreſs divided monies of account into dollars, dimes, cents, and mills, which is a very excellent diviſion, and the principle will be retained, yet it probably will happen in practice, that accounts will be kept in dollars and cents, with the fractions of cents called mills; Do. 368 C. M. 98.9. that is 368 dollars, 98 cents, 9 mills; or Do. 368. C. M. 98.9. in one column: or, it may be, according to the Portugal method, 368.989, which are ſo many dollars and mills; for, 1000 mills are one dollar, as 1000 rees are one mill ree. There is, I believe, no money of account ſo manageable,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022368_0007_0FB85948D7D8BC80"/>by the accountant, as thoſe of the United States of America, and Portugal:—To me the method of dollars and mills appears the beſt: 234 Do. 906 M., or 234,,906.—If I am to ſettle accounts with people who uſe all the different methods, it is quite as eaſy to me as if we all were in one and the ſame method: my 234.906 are by dots at once ſhifted into 234 Do. 9 Di. 06 M.—234 Do. 90 C. 6 M., or into 23 E. 4 Do. 90 C. 6 M.; yet thoſe people cannot quite ſo eaſily throw theirs into my denominations. But until the denominations of monies of account and coins are confirmed or altered, it may be well to keep our accounts in cents alone, as there is the leaſt probability of a change in this name.</p>
            <p>It may be conſidered, whether the declaring that "French and Britiſh coins ſhall paſs current in payment of all debts and contracts for money," will not be improper; as they are generally ſo worn as to fall greatly ſhort of their weights and value. French crowns, of the commercial ſtandard, ought to weigh 464½ grains, to be worth 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> ſterling, or 120 cents: yet, what are in circulation, average only about 447 grains, equal to 4 <abbr>s.</abbr> 9¾ <abbr>d.</abbr> or 115<abbr>C.</abbr> 5<abbr>M.</abbr>—Engliſh crowns are ſcarcely an object—there are none in circulation—Engliſh ſhillings are as traſh—20 of them, taken at random, averaged but 8½ <abbr>d.</abbr> ſterling. or 17 cents. The laws of thoſe countries make it penal to ſend their national caſh abroad. Amongſt the <hi>commercial</hi> nations, perhaps, the motive for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,—excluſive of the conſideration of heavy charges to their nation, on expenſive coinages often repeated, is not with the deſire of locking it up from circulating in other countries; becauſe, the more free and extenſive it circulates the better are its purpoſes anſwered. A ſyſtem of commerce, which carries out <hi>money,</hi> will bring <hi>bullion</hi> home.—Countries the richeſt in commodities, nevertheleſs, require bullion in many branches of their commerce: and as the monies of all other nations are, to them, but bullion, whilſt they have an influx of it ſufficient for their purpoſe, the quantity of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022368_0008_0FB8594C5BA7A2B8"/>their national money needs not be ſo great as otherwiſe would be requiſite; and then expenſive coinages are leſſened. Britain ſeems to have greatly declined in coining <hi>ſilver,</hi> from this principle,—nor do I know that ſhe has coined any ſilver for many years paſt, of any conſideration.</p>
            <p>Gold may be preferred to ſilver, for our national money, at leaſt for awhile, as the coinage of it is conſiderably cheaper than of ſilver. Spaniſh ſilver coins, together with the gold of Spain and Portugal, may be tendered in payments: at the ſame time, a moderate ſum of national ſilver ought to be always in circulation, together with our gold coin to a larger amount, as bullion gold ſhall happen to come into the mint. It would, reſpecting the public, be improper to give currency to foreign coins by a perpetual or long continued law: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over our citizens would be ſubject, by ſuch laws, to great impoſition from a depraved coinage, which could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at the will of the foreign ſovereign,—and it might injure our commerce and the commonwealth in general. If the foreign nations ſhould be diſpleaſed with ſuch a public act as might ſeem to give encouragement to the drawing away their monies from them, which at great expence were coined for their own uſe within their own dominions, and not for the purpoſes of ſtrangers,—commerce, in deſpite of oppoſition, will counteract the views of ſuch complaints, and perhaps defeat all the means that government could reaſonably apply for anſwering the expectation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants: for if in ſuch caſe the foreign coins are left to their own bias, to follow in the train of commerce, they will become, or continue current by common conſent; and there will preſently be a ſufficiency of national money for the purpoſes of formal tenders in controverted caſes: under which circumſtances, the municipal laws which gave cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and force to thoſe coins, may be repealed, or not, as ſhall then appear adviſeable. If nothing forbids, ſilver car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the mint to be exchanged for national coin, may be paid for in gold, free of all expence, loſs, or delay. The coſt on the coinage of the gold will be about 3 per cent. to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022368_0009_0FB8594DDB1A27F8"/>the States: Thoſe who carry bullion gold to the mint, will, it is ſuppoſed, alſo receive its value in national gold or ſilver coin, clear of expence or loſs.</p>
            <p>Whilſt money of the Banks, whether it be in paper or bullion, and Spaniſh coins are current as is the national money, by conſent through the influence of commerce, although they be not money known to the municipal law, and therefore not a ſubject of tender, all the purpoſes of a foreign commerce are anſwered by them, and alſo moſt of the inland demands; ſo that formal tenders, which muſt be in national money; being very few, a leſs quantity of the national coin ſuffices. Spaniſh money is not liable to the objections made above, reſpecting the Engliſh and French crowns:—it is but little wore. The portion of it which paſſes through our hands, is ſoon diſperſed over Europe or ſunk in India:—the abſence whereof is yearly renewed, from the mines of new Spain, with a coin that is freſh and perfect: ſo that, if the States ſhould think it proper, until trade is more favourable to us, and we can afford to coin more largely, the act may be, that until ſuch a time (the year 1800) Spaniſh milled and coined monies, and Portugal gold, ſhall paſs current in payments within the United States of America.</p>
            <p>If the devices on the American coins, ſhall generally be of ſubjects of great national concern, the Printing Preſs is a candidate for a place among them—Vehicle of Science—Prop of Liberty!</p>
            <p>However miſtaken may be the principles of this Piece, it perhaps will promote one good—Thought, with inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, on a ſubject particularly intereſting at this time.</p>
