            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I TELL you, Lydia, I'll hear no more.— Plague on his virtues! When did a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, rotten tree produce good fruit? It is impoſſible but the errors of the father muſt, in ſome degree, attach themſelves to the ſon: And I had rather (dear as you are to me) wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs your obſequies, than ſee you in the arms of a man, whoſe principles I deſpiſe. Old Screwpenny's ſpeculations, cheats, and frauds are related at every tea-table throughout the United States; and ſhall the daughter of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Upright, by a marriage with ſuch a raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal's ſon, bring diſgrace on the fair fame of her own father?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
                     <p>My dear father, you know I have always regarded you as a friend, as well as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: you have ever been acquainted with the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:031790_0006_0FEE639E34885958"/>
ſecrets of my heart, and you may reſt aſſured, that my conduct ſhall never be the cauſe of uneaſineſs to you. My acquaintance with Young Screwpenny commenced in England, whither your kindneſs ſent me for my educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we were often together, and frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy produced a mutual eſteem: We have ſince been fellow-paſſengers from England, and his kind attentions to me, on ſhip-board, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have made an impreſſion on my heart, which will require ſome time to eradicate.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Major.</speaker>
                     <p>I almoſt wiſh you had never ſeen England: the death of your mother, (whoſe memory ſtill demands the ſigh of tenderneſs) and, at that time, a want of good ſeminaries for education in this country, induced me to ſend you thither: But, thank heaven, we can now enjoy the bleſſing of giving our children a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and uſeful education, without ſending them to a foreign country, where for every ſingle leſſon of utility they obtain, fifty follies ſprout up to choak its growth:—Republicans can only be properly inſtructed in republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. However, Lydia, I hope I ſhall find in you, an exception to my general opinion.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope, ſir, you will believe I have ſenſe enough to diſtinguiſh between uſeful arts, and the tinſel of a modern Britiſh education. And believe me, ſir, were you acquainted with Mr. Charles Screwpenny, your prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the father would be loſt in your admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the virtues of his ſon.</p>

                     <p>Prejudices! What! when he cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my noble diſbanded troops out of ſeven-eighths of the pay they had ſo hardly earned, ſo richly deſerved, and ſo patiently waited for, is it a prejudice in me to call him a raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal? —When I ſee him invariably ſhifting his ſentiments of politics, to the opinion of the ſtrongeſt party, merely to further his merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary views, is it a prejudice in me to deſpiſe him?—When I ſee him continually employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in baneful monopolies, oppreſſions, and land ſpeculations, diſtreſſing the poor, and bringing diſgrace, infamy, and diſhonor on my country, is it a prejudice in me to hate and deteſt him? No! I hope Major Upright will always be remarked for love of virtue, and deteſtation of vice. But come, Lydia, ſhould I find Young Screwpenny the character you have deſcribed him to be, far be it from me to oppoſe your happineſs; however it muſt be on certain conditions; and ſuch as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſgrace ſuch a connexion will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably tend to produce.</p>
