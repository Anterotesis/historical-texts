            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Author of this epiſtle, in his concluſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Hebrews to ſeveral chriſtian duties; and in this verſe, of which our text is a part, <hi>to obey them that have the rule over them, and ſubmit themſelves.</hi> By thoſe who had the rule over them, the Apoſtle means thoſe who were Paſtors of the Church; being appointed overſeers by the Holy Ghoſt, to lead the people in their public devotions; explain the word of God to them; to ſpeak, exhort, and rebuke, with all authority; and to adminiſter to the Church the ſeals of the covenant.</p>
            <p>Goſpel Miniſters are ſtewards of the myſteries of God; and when they faithfully perform their work, obedience and ſubmiſſion are due to them from thoſe whom they are ſet over. People are bound to obey the truths preached by the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſubmit to their inſtructions and leading, as far as they are agreeable to the divine rule: for Miniſters have their commiſſion and authority from the King of Heaven; hence diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them is diſobedience to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A reaſon why people ſhould obey them who have the rule over them is given in the words of our text, "For they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account." Your ſouls
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028426_0003_0FD945411287BE70"/>
are near their hearts, and they have critical and painful work to do for them; to watch for their ſalvation, and carefully avoid every thing in their miniſterial work which will hinder it. And this they do as knowing they muſt hereafter give account to him, who put them into the miniſtry, of all their conduct as Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and what attention they have paid to your ſouls. Seeing then they have ſuch a ſolemn charge over you, and account to give, it becomes you to obey them, and ſubmit yourſelves, leſt their account finally prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for you, which will be the caſe if they have to give up their account with grief for your diſobedience to the goſpel which they preached to you.</p>
            <p>From the words of our text we may note this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, viz.</p>
            <p>That Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt give account how they watch for ſouls.</p>
            <p>The following remarks may illuſtrate the doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The truſt committed to Miniſters is very precious. It conſiſts in the ſouls of men; thoſe rational capacities which render men ſubjects of moral government; with which they may ſerve and enjoy God forever. But the ſouls of men, which are by nature ſinful and expoſed to eternal puniſhment, may be ſaved by the goſpel which the Miniſters of Chriſt preach to them: ſouls for whom Chriſt came into this world and laid down his life that a way be opened for their ſalvation; ſouls who, if obedient to the goſpel, will forever enjoy and praiſe God in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; but if finally diſobedient, will forever ſink under the wrath of the Almighty, and more dreadfully than if they never heard of the goſpel of Chriſt. Theſe ſouls were made after the image of God, and do ſtill retain his natural image—They are to anſwer ſome very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant end in the divine plan, which will be attended with unſpeakable joy or woe to theſe ſouls.</p>
            <p>If Miniſters have ſuch precious things committed to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028426_0004_0FD94542ECB8F598"/>
their truſt, it is evident they muſt give account of the betruſtment to him whoſe the property is. And <hi>all ſouls are God's</hi>; hence he will call for an account of his own property, which was delivered to the care of his ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; and eſpecially ſuch valuable property as the ſouls of men, who are to be eternally happy or miſerable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The eternal intereſt of ſouls is nearly connected with the goſpel which the Miniſters of Chriſt are to preach. The goſpel contains that eternal life which all the ſaved do partake in; and it is by the preaching of the goſpel that God ſaves ſinners, and builds up ſaints in faith and holineſs for the heavenly world. If Miniſters do not warn ſinners, they will die in their ſins: and if they do not feed Chriſtians, with goſpel truths, they will not increaſe in knowledge under their miniſtry. If Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters corrupt the word by their preaching, ſouls will be miſled, and ſettle down in belief of ſuch errors as will prove their eternal ruin. If Miniſters faithfully preach the goſpel, Chriſtians will be edified and ſtrengthened in the ways of God; ſinners may ſee the danger of all their falſe refuges; be ſenſible of the need of Chriſt for their Saviour; and be influenced to comply with the terms of the goſpel, which are ſet before them by the faithful preaching of it. If Miniſters are faithful, the finally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, under their miniſtry, will have no excuſe to make for continuing in unbelief and impenitence. They were faithfully warned, and earneſtly invited to Chriſt for ſalvation, but would not obey. Their blood then will be upon their own heads; and their eternal puniſhment will be more dreadful than if they had never ſat under the faithful miniſtry of the goſpel! If ſuch great, and eternally important things are connected with the goſpel being preached to men, how ſtrict will the account be which Miniſters muſt give to him who ſent them to preach the goſpel! If ſuch are loſt through the negligence, or corrupt preaching of Miniſters, they muſt give account for ſuch conduct in their miniſtry which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028426_0005_0FD945482FAF17A0"/>
ruined ſouls! why they neglected the ſouls under their care! why they prefered corrupt doctrine to the pure word of God! why they choſe to declare <hi>ſmooth</hi> things to ſinners, rather than proclaim the terrors of the divine law, and precepts of the goſpel, which are very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſinners, tending to alarm their conſciences and make them feel uneaſy in hearing ſuch truths. If Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have been fed by the faithful preaching of Goſpel Miniſters, and the finally impenitent prepared for a more dreadful puniſhment by it, they muſt give account of ſuch faithful preaching which has occaſioned ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and dreadful effects. But it will be a joyful and happy account for ſuch faithful Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The work is very great which Miniſters have to do in watching for ſouls; far greater than any other work men can engage in. They have to treat with ſouls as they are related to the Great God and Eternity. Miniſters have to ſet the Divine Character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their people in its ſcriptural light. And how great a work is this! No being is to be compared with God for greatneſs! Before him all nations are leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and vanity. How ſolemn will the account be which Miniſters will have to give, how they treated the character of God in their preaching! Whether they ſtrictly adhered to the Revelation God has given of himſelf in his word concerning his natural and moral perfections, and concerning his univerſal government over all creatures and events, and have carefully avoided giving any feature of the Divine Character which is not clearly warranted by the word of God? Or whether they have not, in ſome meaſure, deſcribed the Divine Character in ſuch a light as is pleaſing to the ſelfiſh feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſinners; and explained ſome of the ſcripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations concerning God, ſo as to ſtrip them of that majeſty and terror which they wear in plain ſcripture language; and this with a view that wicked men may feel more eaſy in their minds concerning God, than the Bible will allow them to feel?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028426_0006_0FD94549AE5DC810"/>Miniſters have alſo the Law of God to ſet before ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This is a very neceſſary and important part of their work, for this is the rule of their duty toward God and man. This ſhews the conſequence of diſobedience to its precepts, and is as important to be known as the goſpel: for without a right knowledge of the law a perſon can have no conſiſtent ideas of the Goſpel. The goſpel eſtabliſhes the divine law, and illuſtrates its purity and juſtice in the cleareſt light. The law ſhews ſin in its nature and conſequences; and the need ſinners ſtand in of the goſpel ſalvation is more clearly ſeen by rightly underſtanding the law. No perſon can be a true friend to Chriſt and his ſalvation, and at the ſame time wholly ignorant of, or an enemy to the law of God.—Here, then, is ſolemn work for Goſpel Miniſters. They muſt give account how they watch for ſouls in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the law of God before them; whether, to pleaſe men, they ſaid little or nothing about the law; or what they did ſay was of ſuch a nature as to bend the law down to the ſelfiſh feelings of the natural heart, and ſtrip it of all its terrors, with which ſcripture clothes it relative to tranſgreſſors! or whether, in watching for ſouls, they have, like Paul, knowing the terrors of the law, perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, by unfolding the law in its purity, juſtice, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, extenſiveneſs and <hi>dreadfulneſs</hi> as it relates to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and ſhewing them that no thought, word or deed of theirs can be conſidered a conformity to the law of God, in the leaſt degree, while wholly deſtitute of holy love to God and men. And whether they have thus ſet the law before ſinners, from a ſincere deſire for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſouls; not being influenced by the fear of offending them, on the one hand, nor from a party ſpirit to irritate and ſtir up their paſſions, on the other hand. In this great work which Miniſters have to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, is contained the news of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. This is great, important and intereſting. Here they have to ſhew that God had an eternal purpoſe of grace
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028426_0007_0FD9454CA03EBED8"/>
for men, appointing a certain number of them to eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt. The glorious character of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer they have to deſcribe to men, and ſet him before them as God-man, mediator between God and men; his atonement as the only foundation of hope for ſinners; his doctrines, precepts, the religion which he requires of his followers; its nature and influence on the life of a Chriſtian. What his ſalvation conſiſts in; on what terms it can be enjoyed by ſinners; and what the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences will be of finally neglecting to comply with theſe terms; the nature of the chriſtian Church; the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of its members; the rules for its government; and its final proſperity and victory over all its enemies. A future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; a general reſurrection, and final judgment, are ſubjects for Goſpel Miniſters to treat upon in their miniſtry. In performing this great work, they muſt give an account how they treated the various ſubjects of the goſpel. Whether they ſtrictly conformed to the ſcripture repreſentation of truths in their connection and importance; or have gloſſed them with human inventions, to pleaſe men, and be popular in the view of the world. When treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saviour of men, whether they have held him up in his glorious and myſterious union of divine and human natures, or repreſented him as a mere creature! Whether they have rightly treated of the atonement of Chriſt, as being neceſſary for the ſalvation of men; or denied its neceſſity and wholly ſet it aſide. When ſpeaking of the ſalvation by Chriſt, whether they have deſcribed it in its glorious reality as deliverance from <hi>moral</hi> evil, as well as natural; enjoying and ſerving God forever in heaven; or conſidered it moſtly as deliverance from future puniſhment. And whether they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged ſinners to hope for this ſalvation on any thing they can do ſhort of Repentance and Faith. Whether they have inſiſted on the neceſſity of regeneration, that ſinners be holy and ſafe; and taught that it was effected
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028426_0008_0FD9454FAFB39410"/>
by the ſpecial influence of the Holy Spirit, or by the endeavours of the ſinner.</p>
            <p>Miniſters muſt give account, whether they have taken pains to convince ſinners that they are wholly to blame for remaining in impenitence and unbelief; or whether they have ſo repreſented their ſtate as tends to make them feel that they are excuſable for living in rejection of Jeſus Chriſt. Whether, in treating of Chriſt's reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they have carefully endeavoured to diſtinguiſh it from all counterfeits, and ſhew wherein the difference conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Miniſters muſt give account, whether they have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fed the people of God, with wholeſome truths, precepts and promiſes, explained in a goſpel light. Whether they have taken pains to guard Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt error in doctrine, and deviations from the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian rule in practice.</p>
            <p>Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt give account why they entered into this great, glorious and dreadful work of the goſpel miniſtry. Whether it was from love to ſouls; regard for the intereſt of Chriſt's kingdom in the world; and a deſire of glorifying God in this line of duty: or whether it was from ſelfiſh views; for the ſake of filthy lucre, popular applauſe, or any other ſiniſter motive. Whether they entered upon it with fear and trembling, from a view of the greatneſs of the work, and their own inſufficiency to perform it; with humble, earneſt prayer to God for wiſdom, and grace rightly to engage in this work, and faithfully go through with it; or whether they paid no heed to it in this manner, and little thought of its importance and ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>Miniſters muſt give account, whether they have been much at the throne of grace in fervent prayer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may be directed in the ſearch of divine truth; in giving the true ſenſe of the ſcripture, when they attempt to explain it to the people; be directed wiſely to chooſe ſubjects for the benefit and inſtruction

of their hearers; that they may be faithful in all their work with ſouls, both as to preaching and living.—And whether they have earneſtly and honeſtly prayed for their people, that they may be ſaved; that believers may increaſe in numbers, and grow in grace; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have been ſtrangers to prayer in their ſtudies, and families, for their people. They muſt give account whether they have made their work their buſineſs; by devoting their time to ſtudy, and other parts of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſterial duty; or whether they were oftener found in worldly employments than in their ſtudy, and attending to their flocks.—Whether they have watched all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to do good to ſouls, by private viſits, as they had opportunity, as well as public adminiſtrations, and make theſe viſits ſerve religious purpoſes; and in ſome way or other promote the intereſt of ſouls; or whether they have viſited only from worldly views.—Whether they have taken all the pains in their power with care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinners, to awaken them; with convinced ſinners, to lead them to Chriſt; and with converts, to build them up in knowledge and holineſs.—Whether they have been diligent to warn their people againſt the errors in doctrine which they ſaw them expoſed to; and ſhew them the danger of ſuch ſchemes of religion which pleaſe the natural hearts of men; and have endeavoured to prove from the word of God that ſuch religion is falſe, and dangerous; and though it may offend thoſe who are inclined to error, yet from love to their ſouls have perſevered in beating down theſe ſtrong holds of Satan; or whether from fear of offending their hearers they have let them alone in their errors. Alſo when they have known of any wicked conduct among their people, they have borne teſtimony againſt ſuch things; exhorting the guilty to repent of all vile conduct, and reform from it; ſhewing how ruinous to the ſoul ſuch things are, which the word of God condemns: or whether from fear of giving offence, they have ſuffered their people to live in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028426_0010_0FD94552ACBE3D28"/>
known tranſgreſſions without warning them.—How ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn the account will be! And the work being ſo <hi>great,</hi> an account muſt be given how it was performed!</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The work of the goſpel miniſtry is attended with great difficulty, ariſing from various cauſes; which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it needful that Miniſters have patience, forbearance, fortitude, fidelity, ſkill, and a ſpirit of holy prayer, in a right diſcharge of the work.</p>
            <p>Though the precepts and rules of the goſpel are plain, and intelligible; yet there are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which require cloſe and diligent ſtudy, in comparing ſcripture with ſcripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſearching for the connected meaning of ſuch paſſages, leſt a wrong conſtruction be given to ſcripture, and the hearers thereby miſled. Miniſters then muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how they have attended to this part of their duty, for the benefit of their flocks.</p>
            <p>The work of the goſpel miniſtry is very unpopular in view of a careleſs world; and will ſubject Miniſters to many cenſures, reproaches, and bitter words, if they are faithful to ſinners, in ſetting before them the truths of Revelation, which their natural hearts diſlike. Here is a temptation for Miniſters to ſoften their preaching to the taſte of ſinners, in order to live in good terms with them. Miniſters then muſt give account whether they patiently endured reproach, for their faithful diſcharge of the truſt committed to them; chooſing rather to pleaſe God than men: or whether, to pleaſe men, they have daubed with untempered mortar!—No ſerious perſon wiſhes to be an object of contempt, merely, to his fellow men; and when he is thus unjuſtly treated, it muſt be trying to his feelings. This is the caſe with Miniſters, when they are deſpiſed, and rejected, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithful to ſouls. Therefore they muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whether they prefered fidelity to popular applauſe, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Miniſters, in general, are dependent on their people
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028426_0011_0FD9455A1E430260"/>
for temporal ſupport. Their work forbids them from engaging in worldly buſineſs, to procure ſupport and worldly riches for themſelves and families. They muſt give their time to their miniſtry; and look to them whom they ſerve for their neceſſary ſupport. This is a trying circumſtance in their miniſtry. For they need bread and clothing, as well as others; and the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and conveniences of life are deſirable to them, in a reaſonable meaſure, as well as to Chriſtians in a more private life: but to be dependent for theſe things on men, who diſlike the truths of the goſpel, is, in ſome reſpects, undeſirable; and affords a temptation to Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters to ſeek to pleaſe wicked men, by withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain truth from them, that they may more cheerfully contribute to their worldly ſupport. Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters muſt give account how they have watched for ſouls in this reſpect. Whether they have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſubmit to inconveniences ariſing from this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the ſake of being faithful to ſouls; or, for the ſake of worldly gain, have been willing their people ſhould be ignorant of plain and important truth!</p>
            <p>Miniſters are men of like paſſions with other men; they have infirmities of body and mind; their health is often ſo impaired as to render it very difficult to attend public adminiſtrations. Yet many people are unwilling to make excuſes for them on this account; when, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, one half of the complaint in themſelves, which their Miniſters labour under, would be ſufficient to keep them from places of public worſhip. This is hard treatment.</p>
            <p>Miniſters muſt often expoſe their health, in viſiting the ſick and others of their flocks, or offend their people. This is another difficulty they have to meet with. They muſt then give account, whether, in ſuch caſes, they have conſulted their own eaſe more than duty, in ſerving their people, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Miniſters alſo have to contend with their own ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028426_0012_0FD9455BB078F750"/>
infirmities, which remain in them, as well as in other Chriſtians, and often cauſe them very ſorrowful reflections. They are liable, like other Chriſtians, at times, to be off their guard, in ſpeech and behaviour, and to be led aſide by temptation. They have the paſſions of anger, reſentment, grief, &amp;c. which may, in times of temptation, break forth in an unchriſtian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for which they are humble and penitent when they come to reflect thereon. Yet how ready are their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, often, to catch at ſuch infirmities in them, and raiſe irreconcilable objections againſt them, on account thereof; and are wholly unwilling to make ſuch allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for their Miniſters, in ſuch caſes, as they would wiſh to be made for themſelves, even in far greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations from the line of duty!—Miniſters, then, muſt give account how they watched for ſouls, under ſuch difficulties; whether they conſcienciouſly bore teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt all ſin, even in ſuch inſtances wherein they themſelves have been overtaken. Whether they could forgive thoſe who treated them with unchriſtian ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; whether they humbled themſelves for their ſinful misſteps, and cautiouſly watched againſt ſinful paſſions and conduct in future; or whether it were otherwiſe with them.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Miniſters have the eternal intereſt of their own ſouls involved in watching for the ſouls of their people. If they are unfaithful to the ſouls of others, they will be ſo to their own ſouls: but if faithful to others, they will be ſo to their own. If they truly ſtrive for the ſalvation of others ſouls, they will for the ſalvation of their own ſouls. If ſinners periſh through the ſinful neglect of Miniſters, their blood will be required at the watchman's hand. That ſolemn and alarming paſſage in the 3d and 33d Chapters of Ezekiel is worthy the ſerious and abiding attention of every Goſpel Miniſter.
<q>So thou, O ſon of man, I have ſet thee a watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael; therefore thou ſhalt hear
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028426_0013_0FD9455DB28E7D58"/>
the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I ſay unto the wicked man, O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely die; if thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.—Nevertheleſs, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he ſhall die in his iniquity; but thou haſt delivered thy ſoul.</q>—Here we ſee how nearly connected with his work a Miniſter's own intereſt is. If ſinners periſh, through his unfaithfulneſs, their blood is to be required of his hands. He muſt be accountable for their death, as far as it was owing to his neglect to warn them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But if he diſcharges his duty with fidelity, he is ſafe, though ſinners periſh whom he warned.—When the Apoſtle Paul took his leave of the Elders of the Church at Epheſus, he ſaid unto them,
<q>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God.</q>
He felt himſelf clear from the guilt of any man's final ruin to whom he had preached; from this conſideration, that he had not ſhunned to declare unto them all the counſel of God. Therefore it was not through his fault, or neglect, that any of his hearers were finally loſt. And it implies, that if he had ſhunned to declare all the counſel of God to thoſe whom God ſent him to preach the goſpel to, and they had periſhed, he could not be pure from their blood. So that his own ſalvation was involved in his faithfully watching for ſouls.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Paul exhorts Timothy to take heed to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as well as to the doctrine, for in doing this, he would ſave <hi>himſelf</hi> and thoſe who heard him. Miniſters have to watch over their own hearts, and lives, in watching for ſouls; and ſee that they love and live the religion of Chriſt, which they preach to others. Paul ſaid he did thus, he kept his body under, and brought
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028426_0014_0FD9456090DFCB30"/>
it into ſubjection, leſt when he had preached to others he himſelf ſhould be a caſtaway. Which implies, that Miniſters who have no true religion themſelves will be loſt. Nor can they faithfully watch for ſouls, if they take no care to maintain a life of religion before their people. A true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt is a man of true religion; and he will ſtrive to be faithful in his preaching and perſonal religion. Therefore Miniſters muſt give account how they watched for ſouls with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their own ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Miniſters of the Goſpel have their commiſſion and charge to preach the goſpel from Jeſus Chriſt. He qualifies them with gifts and grace for the work. He ſends them forth, in his providence, to preach to ſouls. They are put into office by the rule of Chriſt in his word. They are bound to preach the truth which Chriſt has revealed to men. God has committed to them the word of reconciliation; they are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, and in his ſtead to pray men to be reconciled to God. They are Miniſters of Chriſt, and ſtewards of the myſteries of God. Conſequently they muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to him, who made them overſeers of the flock of God, and ſtewards of his word, whether they have ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformed to the rule, given them by their Great Lord and Maſter, in preaching to ſaints and ſinners; not daring to add any thing of human invention; or leave out any part of the goſpel, through deſign to pleaſe men. Whether they have endeavoured, all in their power, to underſtand the errand which they are ſent upon, and plead the cauſe of their Maſter. When they have been treating with the enemies of Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they honeſtly ſtood up for their Lord, his word and kingdom, or ſhamefully betrayed their truſt, by ſiding with his enemies; allowing their objections to be true, and juſt, which they make againſt God, his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and religion; and juſtified the enemies of Chriſt, in their refuſal immediately to ſubmit to him; by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028426_0015_0FD9456335D4DA70"/>
them to do many things previouſly to their repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſubmitting themſelves to their Sovereign, whom they ought to obey and love conſtantly. The leaſt deviation from the rule of Chriſt, in watching for ſouls, is going aſide from the commiſſion and authority which he has committed to their truſt; and they muſt give account of it to their Lord; and ſo of all their work, whether faithful or unfaithful.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The glory of God is the great end of the goſpel miniſtry, as well as other parts of God's plan; and Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of the Goſpel muſt ſo watch for ſouls as to honour God. In preaching divine truth, God is ſet on high, as before obſerved. It is for his honour, for Miniſters to preach to their people thoſe plain, cloſe, uncorrupted truths which God has revealed in his word. It is for the glory of God, that ſinners are brought to embrace the goſpel, and be ſaved: that ſaints are, by the faithful preaching of the goſpel, built up in chriſtian knowledge and holineſs; and that the finally impenitent are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more inexcuſable, by attending to the faithful min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of the goſpel. Miniſters then muſt give account, whether they have regarded the honour of God, or not, in this work. Whether, in their reading, praying, preaching and living, they have had a ſacred regard for the Divine Being; and deſire that they may glorify him, in all their miniſterial work; and be inſtrumental in leading ſinners to honour and pleaſe God. Whether, for the honour of God, they have borne teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all vile conduct among their people; or ſuch as their people have been expoſed to elſewhere, and they may be knowing to. Whether, for the honour of God, they have endeavoured to ſtop the mouths of gainſayers, and refute the errors and corrupt opinions of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the word of God. Whether they have, for the honour of God, pled for the rules and order of Chriſt's houſe, and ſhewn the importance of Chriſtians walking agreeably thereto. Whether, for the glory of God,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028426_0016_0FD945658BC35A40"/>
they have perſevered in pleading for his cauſe, truth and religion, when they have been hated, reviled and abuſed; and refuſed to yield to the unreaſonable deſires of men, relative to their ſolemn covenant engagements; or whether they have had no regard for the honour of God, in any part of their miniſtry!</p>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="1">1. We infer from this ſubject, the importance that Miniſters of the Goſpel be men of ability, knowledge, and real religion. Without theſe they cannot be qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified for the goſpel miniſtry. Men cannot perform this great work of watching for ſouls, if they are deſtitute of knowledge and grace. Thoſe who have no talent for inſtruction, and exhortation, are not fit for the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Nor are thoſe who are ignorant men, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with letters, in any conſiderable degree. Nor thoſe, who are ignorant of the doctrines of the bible, and the nature of true religion. How can men teach ſouls the important truths they ought to know, if they have no knowledge of truth themſelves? And how can men who have no true religion be faithful guides to ſouls? Such know not the ſpiritual taſte of real Chriſtians, nor how to feed them ſuitably to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters. Unholy men are not engaged for the ſalvation of ſouls; nor the honour of the Great Redeemer. They may preach truths, but they do not love divine truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Miniſters of the goſpel muſt give account how they watch for ſouls, we may learn how cautiouſly they ought to enter upon ſuch a great and ſolemn work. With what ſeriouſneſs, attention, examination and prayer, ſhould they exerciſe themſelves before they dare venture forth in ſuch an important and dangerous field! They ſhould be ſatisfied, from good evidence, that God has qualified them with gifts, knowledge, and grace, for this ſolemn work; that they may not miſlead ſouls; ruin themſelves; and diſhonour God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028426_0017_0FD94569938E39C0"/>3. This ſubject may lead us to reflect on the great difference between the accounts of the faithful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Miniſters of the word. Thoſe who loved the truth, lived the religion of Chriſt, and honeſtly preached his goſpel, will meet the approbation of their Lord, ſaying, Well done! good and faithful ſervants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord! On the other hand, thoſe who have been deceitful workers, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or neglecters of the truth, enemies to the religion of Chriſt, unfaithful to ſouls and the cauſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, muſt meet with a dreadful frown from the Great Judge of the World, ſaying, Go ye wicked and ſlothful ſervants into outer darkneſs, bound hand and foot! The faithful Miniſter will be approved by his Judge, in the great day, and glorious in heaven forever, though numbers to whom he preached are eternally loſt! He is free from their blood, having been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them! And the unfaithful Miniſter muſt ſink down, moſt dreadfully, under the wrath of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with thoſe whom he miſled in his miniſtry, and was criminally inſtrumental in their ruin! Who can trifle with ſo ſolemn a work as the goſpel miniſtry! How can a man feel eaſy in his mind, when he has evidence that he was always an enemy to the goſpel of Chriſt, which he pretends to declare to others! And how can he be content to make ſelf and wordly intereſt his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end, in entering on this work! Do ſuch think how dreadful an account they are preparing for the day of Judgment? How pale and trembling will unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters meet their people at the bar of God! to ſee thoſe, whoſe ſouls they undertook to watch for, loſt through their negligence and unfaithfulneſs! remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering what corrupt ſentiments they taught them; with what ſelfiſh arguments they perſuaded them to embrace a falſe religion; and reject the ſound doctrines of the bible, and holy religion of the Redeemer. All their corrupt, ſelf-pleaſing ſermons will be exhibited to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028426_0018_0FD9456AD4633148"/>
view in that day! All the exhortations and directions they gave to ſinners, which encouraged them to reſt ſhort of Chriſt, in their impenitence, hoping to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at laſt, will then be rehearſed in their true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the miſerable ſouls, who were ſo fooliſh as to be deluded by ſuch unfaithful dealing, will appear before them, as evidences of their guilt in ruining their ſouls! How dreadful is the thought concerning the account of unfaithful Miniſters! On the other hand, how joyful will be the appearance of the faithful ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Jeſus Chriſt! The goſpel truths they delivered in their ſermons; the cloſe applications; the warm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations; and the earneſt entreaties with ſinners, to repent and believe; will then be mentioned in their favour. And they will ſee all their flocks, to whom they miniſtered in this world: the children of God, whom they were inſtrumental in ſaving, comforted by the truths they heard at ſuch and ſuch a time, and warned from their miſtakes and wrong ſteps, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them as their crown of rejoicing! And thoſe of their people, who refuſed to obey the truth which they preached to them, will be preſent, alſo, and remember the times their Miniſters warned them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, which they refuſed to comply with. Now they find true what their faithful guides told them; that except they repented in time they would be loſt forever! But the faithful Miniſter is clear; their blood will be upon their own heads!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Learn from this ſubject, how ſolemn and weighty the connection is between a Miniſter of the Goſpel and his people. They have choſen him to the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervice a mortal can do for them; and he has taken upon him the moſt weighty charge he <hi>can</hi> take. The connection being ſo ſolemn, a Miniſter ought, from a full conviction or his duty, to take the overſight of a flock, and never wiſh for a diſſolution of his connection with them, except fully ſatisfied that duty requires it. Small,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028426_0019_0FD9456DC0DE07D8"/>
trifling matters ſhould never influence him to quit his ſolemn charge. So with the people, they ought to look well whom they chooſe to be ſet over them as their ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual guide; as to his natural, acquired, and gracious qualifications. That he is ſound in the faith; will feed them with knowledge and underſtanding; and will be willing to ſpend and be ſpent for the good of their ſouls. And if they have ſuch a one given them by the great Head of the Church, they ought very highly to prize him, for his works ſake, and hold him in reputation. No ſmall affair ſhould influence them to part with ſuch a meſſenger from <hi>the LORD of Hoſts.</hi> A true and faithful Miniſter of Christ is endeavouring to ſerve his people, in their beſt intereſts. How careful ſhould they be, that they do not hinder his uſefulneſs among them! Much is required of a people toward their Miniſter, that he may profit them. They muſt pray much for him; provide for his comfort; be very friendly to him at all times; put the beſt conſtruction on all he ſays and does, privately and publicly, which caſes will admit of. Never grieve him by oppoſing the truths he delivers; nor by cenſuring him for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in bearing teſtimony againſt their bad conduct. Nor try to hurt his influence among his people, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing their minds againſt him, relative to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or conduct. If a Miniſter is guilty of error in any of his ſermons; or unchriſtian ſteps in his conduct; he is entitled to the privilege of the rules of Chriſt's houſe; to be tried thereby; and his people ought never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him, till they have found him guilty upon trial. How can a people know that their Miniſter will not give them chriſtian ſatisfaction, if they deal with him according to goſpel rule? And poſſibly, upon exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, it may appear that he has not tranſgreſſed, as they ſuppoſed him to have done. And if they have accuſed and condemned him without trial, and thus hindered his uſefulneſs, how great muſt their guilt be!
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028426_0020_0FD945715DAC8AD8"/>
They have injured their own ſouls, and the ſouls of others, by deſtroying the influence of one whom God approves of as faithful; and alſo grieving a friend and ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt! Such people ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſolemn words of the Lord Jeſus, "He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me." Chriſt is here ſpeaking of thoſe whom he ſent forth to preach the goſpel to men; and we ſee how dreadful it is to deſpiſe them! Their crime does not ſtop againſt the Miniſter, whom they deſpiſe; but reaches to Chriſt, and the Father. The Son of God and eternal Father are deſpiſed! How great muſt their guilt be, who are ſeeking all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they poſſibly can, to prejudice the minds of others againſt their Miniſter! Some will prejudice their children againſt their Miniſter, by often, in their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, oppoſing the doctrines he preaches, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſcripture proof of their being unſound. And thus their children drink in an unjuſt prejudice againſt the truths they hear from their Miniſter, and receive no benefit from his miniſtry; all his inſtructions are in vain to ſuch perſons; and they may die in ſuch preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the truth, and periſh forever. Dreadful thought for parents! If a people, by their unkind and unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian treatment of a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould ſo far prevail as to deſtroy his influence among his people, that a ſeparation from them becomes neceſſary, how dreadful is the ſin of ſuch a people! They do deſpiſe Chriſt, and in effect pray him to depart from them; and they have awful reaſon to fear he will leave them without any ſpiritual guide at all; or ſend them one who will pervert the truth, and lead them on to endleſs ruin. The connection then between Miniſters and people is moſt important.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may infer from the ſubject, that people who have rejected a faithful watchman, will have a moſt dreadful account to give in the great day; that is, if
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028426_0021_0FD945722F887118"/>
they die impenitent for ſuch rejection. They and their Miniſter muſt meet again; but it will be at the bar of God, where nothing but truth will be admitted. No plea will avail there, which is not conſiſtent with the commands of God, and religion of Jeſus Chriſt. It will not then do to plead, they did not like the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ſentiments, provided they are ſound, according to the bible; nor to plead, they ſurmiſed him to be irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in ſome of his conduct. If they have treated him contrary to the rules of the goſpel, and thus been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential to deſtroy his uſefulneſs, they muſt anſwer for it on that dreadful day of account. How confounded will they be to hear the Judge approve of the faithful min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of his ſervants, whom their people rejected; and even of thoſe very things they rejected them for! How ſolemn their account concerning their own ſouls! Why are they not ſaved? They had warning from the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of Chriſt. The particular ſabbaths, lectures, and private interviews with their Miniſters, will all be brought into view. The particular ſermons, the truths which were delivered, the exhortations and entreaties to repent and believe, will all be mentioned then; with the arguments which were uſed to urge a compliance with the goſpel. What then can be ſaid in defence of rejecting ſalvation by Chriſt? To ſay then, as often they do in this world, they ſuppoſed the Miniſter was angry; had a party ſpirit; and the like; will not avail with them. If he faithfully warned them, they ought to have received the warning, and repented.—But ſome never take pains to hear what the watchman has to ſay for the good of their ſouls, at leaſt, very ſeldom attend. Chriſt ſent a meſſenger to them, to inſtruct them in their duty; but they would not hear what he had to ſay to them. They had opportunity to attend, but choſe to neglect it. They eſteemed it a great calamity to have ſuch a one among them; and wiſhed to be rid of him. Are ſuch perſons friendly to their own ſouls?
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028426_0022_0FD94573F590DC30"/>
Are they friendly to Chriſt? It is impoſſible! For they ſin againſt Chriſt, in refuſing to hear whom he ſends to them; and he who ſins againſt Chriſt wrongs his own ſoul.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us now apply this ſubject more particularly to this preſent ſolemn occaſion; an occaſion the moſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn, in ſome reſpects, I was ever called to attend to.</p>
               <p>In compliance with the free invitation of this Church, and People, I was, nine years ago, ſet a watchman over you, to watch for your ſouls; for which I muſt ſhortly give account. My miniſterial connection with you is now diſſolved; being requeſted by the town. I am no more your watchman as heretofore. I have not that particular charge of your ſouls, which I once had. And though it is poſſible ſome of you may hear me preach again, yet not as your Miniſter, as once I was. But this is not the laſt meeting we are to have together. The moſt ſolemn meeting we can have, is yet future. It will be at the bar of God; where we ſhall ſee each other, and know that we once had an important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection together as Miniſter and People! Then will be mentioned the means which led to this connection; and thoſe alſo which led to a diſſolution of it; with all the circumſtances attending us, from my firſt preaching to you, to this cloſing ſermon. You muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your motives in inviting me to ſettle with you; and of all your meaſures in bringing about ſuch a connection. I muſt give account of my motives in accepting your invitation; and all my public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conduct towards you ſince, as your Miniſter. You muſt give account of the parts you have taken, in thoſe meaſures adopted by the town, in diſſolving this union. And I muſt give account of every thing I have done in this ſolemn affair, till a diſſolution took place. As to my miniſtry here, I have a moſt ſolemn account to give, whether I have prayerfully endeavoured to be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028426_0023_0FD945794A6B28F8"/>
faithful to your ſouls, in ſtudying, preaching, warning, reproving, exhorting, viſiting, and living religion. Though I have many failings in the courſe of my min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry to bewail before God; yet, I humbly truſt, through infinitely ſovereign grace, I ſhall appear pure from the blood of all your ſouls, which have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my care. But for this I rely upon the mercy of God alone, through the great Redeemer. From a conſciouſneſs of duty, I have relinquiſhed my miniſtry here; yet I may poſſibly be miſtaken, and have gone aſide from duty.</p>
               <p>Let me, my Chriſtian Friends, addreſs a few words to you on this occaſion, particularly the CHURCH in this place. With you, as a body, I have walked in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip for a number of years; but am no more your Paſtor, to adminiſter common and ſpecial ordinances to you; and it is probable we ſhall never more ſit together at the table of the Lord in this world. But, my friends, we muſt meet again in another world, and there remember all the ſolemn ſcenes we paſſed through in this world. I muſt give account how I have treated you, as a part of the viſible ſpouſe of Jeſus Chriſt; of all the methods I have taken to lead you as your Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, with my motives in taking the overſight of you. Whether I have faithfully endeavoured to feed you with the good and wholeſome truths of Revelation, free from human invention: Whether I have plainly laid before you the marks of the real Chriſtian; and faithfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted you to examine whether theſe marks could be found upon you. Or whether I have ſo deſcribed the Chriſtian, as was calculated to deceive you, and cauſe you to hope without ſufficient grounds. Whether I have honeſtly endeavoured to watch over the Church, and warn them of danger from errors in doctrine, and deviations from the rule of duty in conduct. Whether I have ſet before you the order of Chriſt's houſe, as revealed in the ſcripture, and ſhewn you the importance
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028426_0024_0FD9457AF11EA560"/>
of ſtrictly complying therewith. Whether I have been cautious and careful in the examination of candidates for church communion; not daring to encourage any to come, who did not give me ſome reaſon to believe they were ſubjects of ſaving grace, though I may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived concerning them. Whether I have pitied you under all your trials and temptations, which have come to my knowledge, and endeavoured to give you all that inſtruction and comfort in my power. Whether I have rejoiced to ſee you appearing at any time to maintain the honour of Chriſt's cauſe, by an holy life, and love to the doctrines of the goſpel: and, on the other hand, mourned to ſee a different appearance in any of you. And whether I have daily borne you on my heart at the throne of grace, that you may grow in chriſtian knowledge and grace, and all finally be ſaved.—O what a ſolemn account have I to give to him who made me an overſeer over this Church of God! And, my friends, have not <hi>you</hi> alſo a very ſolemn account to give in this connection? If your Paſtor has been faithful, muſt you not give account how you have improved under his miniſtry? But if he has been unfaithful, muſt you not give account whether you have treated him as the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel rule requires of you? Yes, <hi>you</hi> muſt all give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your thoughts, words, and conduct towards your Paſtor. Whether you have loved him, pitied him under trials, prayed for him, and tried all in your power to ſtrengthen his hands. Whether you have carefully avoided ſaying or doing any thing which could weaken his miniſterial influence among this people; and refuſed to receive an accuſation againſt him but before two or three witneſſes.—And relative to this ſolemn ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has now taken place, you muſt give account whether you were aiding in it; or endeavoured by all chriſtian ſteps to prevent it. Whether you have never ſhewn oppoſition to any of the truths your Paſtor has preached; and thus ſtrengthened the hands of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028426_0025_0FD9457CB2D1B460"/>
Whether any of you have had your ears open to the tattle of the vain world, and been ready to believe idle reports without examination. Whether you have had your minds cooled towards your Paſtor from mere hearſay, without ever knowing whether or not they were true. And whether you have never given a miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of facts, by means of which, others have been troubled in their minds. And, in a word, you muſt give account whether you have endeavoured at all times to treat your Paſtor as an Ambaſſador from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>May God, of his free gace, through Jeſus Chriſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all our ſins we have been guilty of towards each other, as Paſtor and Church! And I pray God to build you up in the faith and order of the goſpel; and enable you to keep up a ſtrict watch over one another in the Lord; and may we finally meet in the heavenly world, where chriſtian friends will never more part!</p>
               <p>I would now ſay a few words to the CONGREGATION, not particularly of the Church. I am now about to take my leave of you, as your Miniſter; perhaps never more to preach the goſpel to you. But we muſt give account of the opportunities we have had together in this connection: <hi>I</hi> of my preaching; <hi>you</hi> of your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or refuſing to hear. I muſt ſoon give account of all my treatment of you in my miniſterial connection with you; and, if I have been faithful, the account will be joyful for me; but dreadful for you, if you have not been faithful to your own ſouls. From <hi>you,</hi> as a town, my diſmiſſion was occaſioned. <hi>You</hi> deſired me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh my miniſtry in this place. <hi>You</hi> have refuſed to give reaſons for this deſire; and <hi>you</hi> have alſo refuſed to have this ſolemn affair examined by an Eccleſiaſtical Council. But, a Council, called by the Paſtor and Church, have adviſed to a diſmiſſion, which has now taken place. But, my friends, the affair is not to end thus: all theſe tranſactions are regiſtered in the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028426_0026_0FD9458048EE06A8"/>
Court of Heaven, to be brought out to public view be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſembled univerſe! <hi>You</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſhall then have a very ſolemn meeting! <hi>Then</hi> I ſhall hear the reaſons why you preſſed for a diſmiſſion from my miniſtry, as you have done. Chriſt is perfectly acquainted with them; and he will ſtate them plainly, that all the world may know them! <hi>Then</hi> you <hi>cannot</hi> keep them out of hearing. And are you ſure they are ſuch as the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judge will approve of?</p>
               <p>Relative to this ſolemn affair, I muſt give account of every ſtep I have taken in it. Why I ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon order and regularity in ſuch a ſerious affair, which we have been attending to. Whether it was from ſelfiſh views, or from a regard to the order of the Churches, and the ſolemn charge of your ſouls. <hi>You</hi> muſt give account whether it were from covetouſneſs, you refuſed a Council; or from a full conviction that ſuch a ſtep would be contrary to the laws of Jeſus Chriſt. Should any individuals in this town think themſelves free from this ſolemn account, becauſe they have not acted on either ſide, but remained neuters through the whole; let ſuch remember, they muſt give account why they have not acted in this ſolemn and important affair. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you have not voted for, or againſt; or, in view of the world, taken ſides in the late ſtruggles concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Miniſter; yet your minds have certainly been decidedly on one ſide or the other; and you know what ſide you wiſhed might prevail. There is no ſuch thing as the mind being neuter towards oppoſing cauſes which it attends to. Chriſt ſays, "He that is not <hi>with</hi> me is <hi>againſt</hi> me."<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> And you have, at heart, been either <hi>for</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> your Miniſter. If you believed his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conduct to be ſuch as rendered him worthy of contempt and rejection from this people; you muſt give account why you have not boldly, for the cauſe or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, exerted yourſelves to remove him from his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028426_0027_0FD94581EC9A6178"/>
here, agreeably to goſpel rule. But if you believe that he has endeavoured to be honeſt and faithful in his miniſterial charge; you muſt give a dreadful account for withholding your help, when you ſaw him abuſed and perſecuted by his oppoſers! Theſe things are nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the cauſe of God. And is not <hi>his</hi> cauſe worthy your taking an active part in? The Angel of the Lord pronounced a bitter curſe againſt thoſe, who came not to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Judges, v. 23.</note> And how can you feel eaſy in your minds, when you know you have not come forth to the help of the Lord in this place? Another day will diſcloſe your views and motives in neglecting to be active in this ſolemn affair. Thoſe who have diſliked my preaching, muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whether they had good reaſon to believe that I did not preach the goſpel of Chriſt truly, and profitably for honeſt minds: or whether the truths delivered, did not apply too cloſely to them, condemn their conduct which they choſe to indulge; and yet unable to ſay that any thing was ever delivered contrary to the bible in its connection.</p>
               <p>It is to be feared that ſome of you, who have ſat under my miniſtry, are ſtill in your ſins; never complied with the invitations of the goſpel which have been ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; and it is likely I may never have any more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to warn you of your danger. Let me tell you, once more, O ſinners, that if you go on till death in your impenitence and unbelief, you will forever ſink down under the wrath of the Almighty; and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and warnings you have had, will ſerve to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate your dreadful puniſhment! You will remember all the calls and warnings you have had from thoſe whom God ſent to you in the name of Chriſt. And now you are free from your Miniſter, and from any more public warnings from him, as your Miniſter; what will be the event is known only to him who governs all
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028426_0028_0FD94585706EF0E8"/>
things. How ſad will be your caſe, if you never have any more warnings from God by his ſervants! You may be given up to chooſe corrupt preaching, which pleaſes the natural heart; and that will ruin you. Or you may be left to the choice of no worſhip at all; this alſo will deſtroy you. Therefore repent <hi>now</hi>; chooſe Chriſt, and his religion, and you will be happy forever. And if you as a people truly humble yourſelves before God for all your ſins, he may yet build you up.</p>
               <p>If here are any who have been under ſerious impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from what they have heard under my miniſtry, and are returning again to vanity; I have one word to ſay to you. The time is coming when it will appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you were affected by <hi>truth</hi> which you heard, or not; and why you can now feel cold towards ſuch things as once made you tremble. If you once believed that your Miniſter preached truth, which was ſolemn and important, why do you now treat the ſame kind of preaching with neglect? Are you <hi>now</hi> ſure that what you <hi>once</hi> thought to be true is falſe?</p>
               <p>I have now done with you <hi>all,</hi> perhaps, forever! I may never preach to you again; at leaſt I am no more your Miniſter! Have I been faithful to you? Have you been faithful to your own ſouls? Will there not be a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeparation among us, another day?—May God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all of us to repent of all our ſins; believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and live a holy life; then we ſhall have a happy meeting together in a better world!</p>

            <p>THE following is the Reſult of the Eccleſiaſtical Council, which ſat in Stoneham, the 30th of September, 1794; and adviſed Mr. CLEAVELAND to aſk a diſmiſſion from his paſtoral relation to his people.</p>

            <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Pike,</hi> Eſq. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily abſent.</p>
            <p>Having ſupplicated the divine preſence and direction, the Council proceeded to buſineſs. And from all the information reſpecting the unhappy ſituation of this town, which they have been able to collect from the ſtatement made by Mr. Cleaveland; from the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given by a Committee of the Church, choſen for the purpoſe; and from the votes of the Town, properly atteſted; it appears to this Council,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:028426_0030_0FD9458A2EF48200"/>1. That Mr. Cleaveland's influence among this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is loſt, and irrecoverably loſt; and that it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary that his miniſterial connection with them be diſſolved: And it is the advice of this Council that he aſk a diſmiſſion from his paſtoral relation to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It appears, from the fulleſt, and, they truſt, the moſt impartial examination of the ſubject, of which they are capable, that Mr. Cleaveland has given no juſt cauſe for that averſion and oppoſition to him, which, in ſo <hi>violent</hi> and very <hi>unprecedented</hi> a manner, they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It appears to this Council, that Mr. Cleaveland's moral, chriſtian and miniſterial characters ſtand fairly, and firmly ſupported; and they cordially recommend him to the church and people of God, wherever, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, he may be caſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As Mr. Cleaveland has given to this people no juſt cauſe for that oppoſition to him, which they diſcover, and which renders his removal from them neceſſary; and as his removal muſt be attended by great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and expenſe to him; it is the opinion of this Council, that he ought to receive a compenſation: And they recommend it to the parties concerned, to chooſe mutually three judicious, impartial characters from ſome of the neighbouring Towns, to eſtimate the damage to which Mr. Cleaveland is ſubjected by his removal.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Selectmen of the Town be ſeaſonably furniſhed with an atteſted copy of this Reſult.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Council, deeply impreſſed with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſacrifice which Mr. Cleaveland's friends make, in parting with their valuable and beloved Paſtor, beg leave to exhort them to acknowledge the hand of God in this affecting providence, as becomes Chriſtians; to maintain the order of Chriſt's houſe; and with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ardour promote the intereſt of his kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:028426_0031_0FD9458D319BDFF8"/>And now, brethren, we commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.</p>
