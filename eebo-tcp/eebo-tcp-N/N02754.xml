            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT our Lord Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners, is a faithful Saying, worthy of all Acceptation: And it might be moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably expected, that miſerable guilty Man ſhould give him a joyful and ready Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. But alas! he is deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of men. In the days of his Fleſh <hi>he came to his own, but his own received him not.</hi> We find him very frequently complaining of the Neglects and Affronts he met with among his own people, the <hi>Jews</hi>: upbraiding them with their Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Impenitence, &amp; declaring them to be inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003281_0004_0FF03CF471BE5830"/>He tells his Diſciples, in our <hi>Context,</hi> that they too muſt expect to meet with Indignities and Perſecutions from a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant World, on his Account. <hi>They will hate you and perſecute you,</hi> ſays Chriſt; <hi>and all for my Name's ſake, becauſe they know not him that ſent me.</hi> He makes their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God to be the Cauſe of their Enmity to Chriſt and his People.</p>
            <p>But to prevent their abuſing this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his, and turning it into an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for their guilty Refuſal of Chriſt, and Perſecution of his Diſciples, he ſaw fit to add, as in the Verſe out of which I have taken my Text, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had Sin: but now they have no Cloke for their Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt came and ſpake in perſon to the Men of that Generation; preached the Kingdom of God, and manifeſted his Name unto them, revealed the Father, and proved himſelf to be the Son of God, the true Meſſiah; he preached Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the great Congregation, and declared to them the Things of their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Peace, wooing and beſeeching them to be reconciled to God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the great Salvation offer'd them. Had he not thus done, <hi>they had not had Sin,</hi> i. e. they had not been chargeable
<pb facs="unknown:003281_0005_0FF03CF917179F00"/>
with this <hi>kind</hi> of ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> Unbelief, which is one of the greateſt Sins, being againſt the tender Mercies of a Redeemer, and the clear Light of the Goſpel: Or it may mean, they had not had this <hi>Degree</hi> of Sin; for had they not had the Goſpel preached to them, their Sins had not been ſo heinous and aggravated.</p>
            <p>If they had never heard of Chriſt and Salvation by him, they had had no Sin, comparatively no Sin. But <hi>ſince I have come and ſpoken to them</hi> (ſays Chriſt) their Guilt is very aggravated, and they have no Pretence, no Excuſe, to palliate their Hatred and Refuſal of me.</p>
            <p>Now the ſame may be ſaid of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners under the Goſpel, who tho' they profeſs to know Chriſt, yet in Works deny him. Chriſt is ſtill coming to us, tho' not in perſon, yet by his Miniſters, and ſpeaking to us in his Word. So that we who profeſs the Goſpel, and yet don't live up to our Profeſſion, but practically refuſe Chriſt, I ſay, we ſhall be inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, as much as the men of that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who ſaw Jeſus in the Fleſh, and received the Call of the Goſpel immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from his bleſſed Lips. If we die in our Sins from under the Light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we ſhall have no Covering nor Colour
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003281_0006_0FF03CFA9B44A2F8"/>
of Excuſe for our Unbelief: but in the day, when God will reckon with us, ſhall be altogether ſpeechleſs &amp; ſelf-condemned.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE then from the Words may be this, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That Goſpel-Impenitents have no poſſible Cloke for their Sin, but are of all men the moſt inexcuſable: having none to blame but themſelves, if they periſh at laſt.</q>
            <p>By Goſpel-Impenitents, I mean both ſuch as reject the Goſpel in point of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and thoſe that reject it in point of practice. Wherefore it may be ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Thoſe that reject the Goſpel in point of</hi> Belief, <hi>have no Cloke for their Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Infidelity of the <hi>Jews</hi> was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable; and much more the Infidelity of ſuch as have had their Birth and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in places of Goſpel-Light. There are multitudes in Chriſtendom that are <hi>Deiſts</hi> (ſo called) who reject Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and ſet up for a natural Religion in oppoſition to all inſtituted &amp; reveal'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They deny the great Myſteries of Chriſtianity, and renounce the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Precepts of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003281_0007_0FF03CFCF01BBC20"/>But ſurely they act a moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inexcuſable part herein. For if we conſult the familiar Dictates of our own Reaſon, and throw aſide carnal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, we muſt acknowledge the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Neceſſity of a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; whether we conſider Man in his innocent State, or in his fallen State. When God had made Man, having made him a capable Subject of moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Wiſdom, Juſtice and Goodneſs of God ſeem'd to require that he ſhould place him under ſome Law, guarded and enforced with ſuitable Sanctions: and if ſuch a Law or Covenant were made for Man, it was neceſſary it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to him: for as <hi>where there's no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſo where the Law is not publiſh'd and bro't to the Knowledge of Men, <hi>Sin is not imputed.</hi> But much more neceſſary is it, in the Caſe of <hi>fallen</hi> Man, that God ſhould make a Revelation of his Mind and Will unto us. Our Caſe indiſpenſably requir'd it; for we are blinded by our Luſts, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Life of God thro' the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in us: and without a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light hung out from Heaven, to illuminate our paths, we muſt have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Darkneſs even until now, and all
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003281_0008_0FF03CFF2D4FCEC8"/>
the Diſcoveries of human Reaſon would never have ſufficed to conduct us unto our chief End and true Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And it was certainly a Thing worthy of the bleſſed God to take ſo much Pity upon a loſt World, as to reveal himſelf unto them, tell them their Danger, and their Remedy, and proclaim the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Grace toward them. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable therefore to doubt whether God has made a Revelation.</p>
            <p>And 'tis as unreaſonable to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Revelation, which God has made, be contain'd in the holy Bible, the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament. For here all the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Marks of a Divine Revelation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to every impartial Inquirer. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you conſider the intrinſick Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Chriſtian Religion, as exhibited in the Scriptures, or the external Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages wherewith it comes recommended to us, ſuch as the Teſtimony of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, of Chriſt's Reſurrection from the Dead, the Accompliſhment of Prophecies, and the like; it muſt be allow'd that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has all the Proof and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that it needs, or that any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can have. Wherever the Goſpel
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003281_0009_0FF03D01740B0B38"/>
comes, it brings with it the ſtrongeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility; carries with it the moſt convincing ſelf-evidencing Light, added to the force of external Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Surely then ſuch as do not embrace Chriſtianity, but reject the Goſpel, when brought unto them, muſt needs be voted obſtinate, unreaſonable, &amp; without Excuſe, Act. 13.46. <hi>It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you: but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life; lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I paſs to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>They that reject the Goſpel in point of</hi> Practice, <hi>who profeſs to receive the Chriſtian Religion, but at the ſame time live in a moral Oppoſition to it, theſe alſo have no Cloke for their Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Practical Unbelief is damning, as well as ſpeculative Disbelief; and impenitent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have as little Cloke for their Sin, as very Infidels.</p>
            <p>Alas! how many are there under the Goſpel, that practically refuſe Chriſt, and trample under foot the Son of God! They refuſe him as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> by not applying to him for the Illuminations they need, and by neglecting his holy Word. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> by going about to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003281_0010_0FF03D03B9C46038"/>
eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, and not ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs which is of God. They refuſe him alſo as a <hi>King,</hi> by not walking in his Ways, but rebelling againſt his Commandments. There are many profeſs'd Chriſtians, that are openly vicious; others that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wicked; deceived, ſerving divers luſts; having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof. Multitudes there are under the Goſpel, to whom one or other of theſe Characters doth belong. And if they die in their Sins, they muſt periſh without a Remedy. Chriſt will reject all their Confidences; and when they plead, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name done many wonderful works?</hi> he will pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on their vain pretences, and ſay to them <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> He will upbraid them, ſaying, <hi>I have call'd, but ye refuſed: and now you have no Cloke for your Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily in that day, when Chriſt ſhall judge the World in Righteouſneſs, every mouth will be ſtopped. Even the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who ſhall periſh without the Law, will be found <hi>without Excuſe</hi> (Rom. 1.20.) How much more <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have ſinned againſt clearer Light and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003281_0011_0FF03D060438B040"/>
better Means of Conviction! Thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoever thou art, that refuſeſt him which ſpeaketh to thee from Heaven in the glorious Goſpel. Thine own Conſcience muſt needs condemn thee, and ſilence all the vain pleas and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a carnal Mind. Thy Conſcience, O guilty Man, muſt needs acquit God, and lay all the Blame on thy ſelf, if thou pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheſt from under the Goſpel. Thou art lifted up to Heaven, in point of privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and if thou be caſt down to Hell, thy deſtruction will ſurely be of thy ſelf. You can't lay the Blame on any thing <hi>without</hi> your ſelf, whether God, or Satan, or the World; but if you periſh, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you love Death, and refuſe Life.</p>
            <p>Sinners are apt to excuſe themſelves, as if no Blame belong'd to them, that they don't repent and believe. In caſe of groſs Immorality, awaken'd Sinners are ready to condemn themſelves: but in this matter of Unbelief and Impenitence, men have generally little ſenſe of Guilt, and are diſpos'd to vindicate themſelves, as if it were none of their Fault. But alas! they are miſerably deceived, and flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own Eyes, when they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that their Unbelief is but their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and not their Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003281_0012_0FF03D0852043A78"/>To ſet this matter in a convincing Light, I ſhall ſhew diſtinctly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Sinners can't lay the Blame on <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They can't lay it on <hi>Satan</hi> or the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence they muſt needs take it to <hi>themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prop. I. <hi>Goſpel-Impenitents, who finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Chriſt, have no Cloke for their Sin, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pleas or Pretences they can make relating to GOD their Maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The corrupt Reaſon of a carnal Mind may ſuggeſt many Objections and Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from the Decree of God, from the Inſufficiency of the Means, from his with-holding neceſſary Aſſiſtance, and the like. But they are all vain Pleas; The Scriptures allow none of them: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Excuſes, they faſten the Guilt of Unbelief upon Goſpel-Sinners, and charge them with being the faulty Cauſes of their own Impenitency and Ruin. Hence that of our Saviour, Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi> So Matth. 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered thy children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003281_0013_0FF03D34E5878758"/>For the Illuſtration of the Head we are upon, let it be conſider'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Goſpel-Impenitents can't plead, They are not</hi> invited <hi>to believe in Chriſt for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Some may be apt to plead in Excuſe of themſelves, that they have not thoſe Qualifications, which are ſometimes mention'd in the Goſpel-Invitation; as where it's ſaid, Come unto me, all ye that <hi>labour</hi>; If any man <hi>thirſty,</hi> let him come to me, and drink. But then 'tis to be conſider'd, that in ſuch places the Goſpel-Invitation is only <hi>apply'd</hi> to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Subjects; not reſtrain'd to them. Such kind of perſons are the next Objects of Goſpel-Calls and Offers, who are under Convictions and Awakenings. But yet unconvinced Sinners are remote Objects of the ſame Offers. They are call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conſider Chriſt, and are requir'd to hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs; They are commanded to believe in Chriſt, and have the Tenders of Salvation made to them in caſe of their ſo doing. The Goſpel-Invitation runs in indefinite Terms, <hi>Whoſoever will,</hi> let him come. There's a <hi>general Liberty</hi> given men to believe in Chriſt for Salvation: This is made the Duty of all, whether willing or unwilling:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003281_0014_0FF03D0A9F7D3FB0"/>
Abſolute Promiſes of Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are made to all that actually do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: and the Conditional Offer is made to all where the Goſpel comes. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Call of the Goſpel warrants every one's coming to Chriſt, that will: and none are excluded from his ſaving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but ſuch as exclude themſelves by an obſtinate Unbelief. None then under the Goſpel can object that they are not invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo they have not this to plead in Excuſe for their not coming to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Let it now be obſerv'd,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>None have it to plead that they are not</hi> elected: <hi>'Tis no Excuſe, that they don't know whether the Decree of God be for them or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's true, all that belong to the Election of Grace ſhall come to Chriſt, &amp; obtain Salvation. Act. 13.41. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</hi> And 'tis as certain, that all who are not elected, will not come to Chriſt, nor obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Rom. 11.7. <hi>The election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, and the reſt were blinded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, this Doctrine needs not; and ſhould not diſcourage any one from a Care of believing in Chriſt, ſince the Goſpel-Call runs in indefinite Language: For, as no Man can be ſure of his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003281_0015_0FF03D375EB0AC98"/>
               <hi>Election,</hi> while in a State of Unbelief; ſo neither can any one be ſure of his <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> without knowing he has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the unpardonable Sin, and is judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally harden'd in Impenitency. Now ſo long as Men have a doctrinal Belief of the Chriſtian Religion, and are under the Strivings of the holy Spirit, they may not charge themſelves with the unpardonable Sin, and ſuppoſe their caſe deſperate: but ought to preſume upon the Poſſibility of their Salvation; and act, in the uſe of appointed Means in order to obtain it, with the ſame Diligence, as if their Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were aſcertain'd to them.</p>
            <p>It is nothing leſs than <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> for Men to make the Uncertainty of their Election an Argument againſt their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt; becauſe this is acting in Contradiction to the <hi>Command of God,</hi> and to the <hi>Manner of Men,</hi> in all other Caſes of like Uncertainty.</p>
            <p>God has <hi>connected</hi> the Means and the End, in this, as well as other Caſes: and yet in other Caſes, Mankind make uſe of the <hi>Means,</hi> tho' altogether uncertain of the <hi>Ends,</hi> which is not in their own power, but in the hand of God alone, whoſe Counſels and Deſigns are ſecret to

                  <p>God doth as truly decree from Everlaſting whether your Land this Year ſhall be Barren or Unfruitful, and juſt how long you ſhall Live in the World, as he hath Decreed whether you ſhall be ſaved or not. And yet you would think that man but a fool that would forbear Plowing and Sowing, and ſay, <hi>If God have Decreed that my Ground ſhall bear Corn, it will bear, whether I Plow &amp; Sow, or not.

               </note> And is it not then a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing in any to throw off all Care of believing in Chriſt, from a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they are afraid they were not appointed to obtain Salvation by him? Faith in Chriſt is the only Means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that bleſſed End, and the only way to make our Election ſure; So that with all that are truly concern'd about their Souls,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003281_0017_0FF03D39A4712D88"/>
the Uncertainty of their being elected is rather an Argument for, than againſt their labouring to get Faith, and trying to come to Chriſt; that ſo a Caſe of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Importance may be reſolv'd and put out of all doubt with them. To act otherwiſe muſt needs be the height of Folly.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo heinous <hi>Sin,</hi> in that it vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Command of God, which requires of all Men a Care to believe in Chriſt; and in that it calls God a liar, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting his Sincerity in the Goſpel-Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which makes the Conditional Offer of Chriſt and Life unto all.</p>
            <p>In a word, it's not the undiſcover'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, but the reveal'd Precept, that is our Rule, according to which we are to conduct our ſelves, and by which we ſhall finally be judg'd. Deut. 29.29. <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord, our God: but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's a bold Intruding into the ſecret Counſels of Heaven, to conclude poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on our being out of the Decree of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003281_0018_0FF03D0E981BEFA0"/>
as they voluntarily reject Chriſt, againſt all the Commands, Invitations, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the bleſſed God, even while yet they know not but that they may belong to the Election of Grace.</p>
            <p>We are ſure then the Judgment of God is according to Truth; and tho' the Decree of Praeterition be founded in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, yet the Sentence of Death will be executed in Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>I paſs to obſerve in the next place,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sinners have it not to plead againſt the bleſſed God, That he uſes any</hi> Compulſion <hi>or exerts any poſitive Influence, to keep them in Unbelief and harden them in Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever we may read in Scripture <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 4.21. Joſh. 11.20. Rom. 9.8. &amp; 11.8.</note> of God's <hi>hardning</hi> Men's hearts, this is not to be underſtood as if by the Divine Power there were any <hi>poſitive</hi> Infuſion of <hi>evil Qualities,</hi> or that God put a Force upon Men's natural Faculties, ſo as to compel them againſt their Wills to go on in Sin. No, far be ſuch a diſhonorable Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that righteous Lord, who loveth Righteouſneſs, and is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity! Far be it from God, that he ſhould have Fellowſhip with the Workers of Iniquity, and be the Author of Sin! Can it be imagin'd that God
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003281_0019_0FF03D119B4C0598"/>
ſhould put a Conſtraint on Men, to rebel againſt his own Authority, and diſhonour his own Name, and reject his own Son! Our Saviour aſſigns it as the Reaſon, why the <hi>Jews</hi> believed not on him, Joh. 12.39, 40. <hi>Therefore thy could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe that</hi> Eſaias <hi>ſaid again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart; that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their heart, and be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> But we are to underſtand this only of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Obduration; not of any actual Infuſion of vicious malignant Qualities, but a meer Suſpenſion of divine benign Influences. Nothing is meant, which can imply that God compell'd them to reject Chriſt. Vain Sinners may be ready to complain of God in that Language, <hi>Why haſt Thou hardned our hearts from thy Fear!</hi> But this is a moſt baſe Reproach on the glorious God. Hence that of the Apoſtle, Jam 1.13. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he any man.</hi> But to go on,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Sinners have it not to plead, That there is any</hi> deficiency <hi>of ſutable</hi> Means <hi>on God's part, or that he does not afford them neceſſary external Helps for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:003281_0020_0FF03D132046A260"/>The bleſſed God is ſo far from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Men's Hearts, in any direct way, &amp; puſhing them forward to Deſtruction; that on the contrary, he employs a Variety of excellent Means which have a Tendency to bring them to Repentance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Salvation. He actually does all that for them, which it could rationally be expected a wiſe Governour ſhould do, to bring reaſonable Creatures to their Duty. He omits nothing proper to be done in the way of Means; and conſider'd in the order of Means they are ſuch as are every way ſutable and ſufficient. Hence that appeal of the glorious God to his rebellious People of old, Iſa. 5.4. <hi>What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since Men are not able by the dim Light of unaſſiſted Nature to ſpell out their Duty, or diſcover neceſſary Truth, in the full Extent; therefore it hath pleas'd God to make a ſupernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the World; the ſum of which is handed down to us in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And theſe are repreſented by an inſpired Apoſtle, as able to make men wiſe unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Thoſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003281_0021_0FF03D3B28A1C778"/>
ſacred Writings reveal to us the whole Counſel of God, neceſſary to be known, concerning fallen Man's Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt. They diſcover to us the whole Duty of apoſtate Man. They call upon Sinners to repent of Sin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and ſet before them the ſtrongeſt Motives to excite 'em thereto; expoſtulating with them, from the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute need they ſtand in of a Saviour; from the perfect Sufficiency and Divine Appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſave unto the uttermoſt all that come to God by him; from the infinite Advantages of an Intereſt in Chriſt, and the aggravated Damnation they will expoſe themſelves to by rejecting him. They ſet before them the moſt alluring Promiſes, and the moſt tremendous Threatnings: fitted to influence the Hopes and Fears of rational Creatures. They command, they exhort, they beſeech Sinners to come to Chriſt, and be reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>Let it further be obſerv'd, God has ſet in his Church <hi>Paſtors &amp; Teachers,</hi> who are to give themſelves continually unto Prayer and to the Miniſtry of the Word; to ſound the Calls and Counſels of God in the Ears of Sinners, and to pray over them; if by any means they may melt their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003281_0022_0FF03D1620576758"/>
Hearts, and bring them to Repentance.</p>
            <p>In fine, God gives them his Sabbaths; ſets his Sanctuary in the midſt of them; reveals his Covenant, and gives them the Seals appointed as Helps of Faith.</p>
            <p>So that they have all done for them that can reaſonably be expected God ſhould do for ſuch Creatures. He treats them as rational Agents, capable of deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chuſing and reſolving. He affords the beſt Means to enlighten their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, direct their Judgments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade their Wills, and move their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in a rational and moral way. God is repreſented, as <hi>drawing them with the cords of a man,</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. He uſes all the Methods proper to work upon Men, and reclaim reaſonable Creatures from their Sins. Hence when Sinners baffle theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Grace, God is repreſented as at a Stand, &amp; ſeeming not to know what further Courſe could be taken. Hoſ. 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do unto thee? O Judah, what ſhall I do unto thee? for your goodneſs is as a morning-cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole then it appears, if Men periſh from under the Goſpel, it can't be imputed to any Defect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means on God's part; but to their
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003281_0023_0FF03D3E3A720558"/>
own Stubborneſs and Obſtinacy. They had a Price in their Hands to get Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but had no Heart unto it. It is ſufficient to juſtify God, and acquit him of their Deſtruction, That he dealt with them as with rational Creatures, Cauſes by Counſel of their own Actions; and uſed Methods of Teaching and Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and all proper external Means, to work upon them, in a way ſutable to then Nature as Men. — But it may ſerve as a further Vindication of the Divine Proceedings, to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Goſpel-Impenitents have no Cloke for their Sin from any Plea they can make, as to a want of</hi> internal <hi>Aſſiſtances, and a Defect of neceſſary</hi> Influences <hi>from God to make the means effectual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be conceded here, That the beſt Means God affords any, are not in <hi>themſelves alone</hi> ſufficient to perſuade and enable Sinners to repent and believe: but they depend upon the concurrent Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God, to give them ſuch Efficacy as ſhall reach the deſired End. 1 Cor. 3.7. <hi>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, it muſt be conceded, that there is not the <hi>ſame</hi> Energy of Divine
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003281_0024_0FF03D18A961D770"/>
Grace accompanying the Means, unto the Souls of thoſe that periſh, as to them that are ſaved: Neither do's God do all that is in his power, by way of internal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, to perſuade and aſſiſt ſuch as prove finally Impenitent, to come to Chriſt. We read, Rom. 11.6, 7. <hi>And if by grace, then it is no more of works: otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more of grace: otherwiſe work is no more work. What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for.</hi> Whereas they would have obtained, they would have been converted and ſaved, if the Lord had given them Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear, and a Heart to know underſtanding. Our Saviour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>Every one that has been taught and hath learned of the Father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me.</hi> The Divine Light and heavenly Principle put into the Soul of man in Regeneration, infers a moral Neceſſity of his coming to Chriſt; ſo that whatever Corruptions may work within, or Impediments appear without, yet he finds himſelf under a ſweet Conſtraint, a pleaſing neceſſity, and cannot but come to Chriſt. And if God did as much for others, they alſo moſt certainly would be made willing in the day of his Power. To
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003281_0025_0FF03D4086C8D100"/>
imagine that God did as much for <hi>Judas,</hi> as he did for <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſave his Soul, is the abſurdeſt Dream in the World. And to ſay, that God abſolutely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does all that he can to bring any Goſpel-Sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who finally periſh, is to aſſert the greateſt Contradiction. For are not all Things poſſible with God? And has he not the Hearts of all Men in his hand, to turn them as he pleaſeth? Who then can reſiſt his Effective Will, where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and exerts the Strength of his Grace, to convert Men? Verily God reſerves to himſelf a ſovereign liberty, as we read, Joh. 3.8 <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> This ſpake he of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this notwithſtanding, Goſpel-Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents are inexcuſable, and cannot plead a want of neceſſary internal Aids of Divine Grace, as affording them any Cloke for their Sin. For let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd in two or three particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinners do not realiſe</hi> what God tells them of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of his Grace, and of their own <hi>Impotency,</hi> but are apt vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>magnify their own Abilities,</hi> and to think every man of himſelf more highly than he ought to think. They particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly claim ſuch a ſelf-determining Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Liberty of Will in matters ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003281_0026_0FF03D1B01049EC0"/>
as ſuperſedes the Neceſſity of any immediate Energy of the holy Spirit to work in them to will and to do. They aſcribe a great deal too much of Power to moral Suaſion; and think that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, without any renewing Change on the Heart by the immediate Influence of the holy Spirit, to produce Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Job 11.12. <hi>For vain man would be wiſe, though man be born like a wild aſſes colt.</hi> Pride makes men conceited of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and loth to ſee how vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and helpleſs they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and loth to be beholden to Divine Grace. It makes men imagine, They have a Stock of their own to live upon. Their haughty ſpirits can't ſtoop to own Repentance is the gift of God, or that God gives men to believe, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in a way of moral Suaſion. And now it is a righteous Thing in God to deal with Sinners according to their own Preſumption in this matter; and deny 'em that ſpecial Grace, which they think they have no need of: be ſure he's juſt in charging that Unbelief as wilful, which they think it in their own power to help. It is a remarkable paſſage, that of our Saviour to the proud ſelf-ſufficient Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003281_0027_0FF03D42D1196930"/>
Joh. 9.41. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin: but now ye ſay, We ſee; your ſin remaineth.</hi> If Sinners have not an Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they are blind, and impotent, and dead in Sins, and yet reject Chriſt; their Sin is the more aggravated, and God may juſtly with-hold that Grace from them which they have ſo little ſenſe of their need of, and from the Honour of which they ſo detract by a vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Apprehenſion of their own Abilities. They oppoſe, they decry the Doctrine of ſpecial Grace, and God in his unſpotted Juſtice leaves them deſtitute of it. "No men do ſhew leſs of a free-will to all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Good, than the men who have been the great Aſſertors and Admirers of man's free Will: In their own Practice they confute their Opinion; at leaſt render themſelves of all men the moſt <hi>inexcuſable".</hi> Surely this is enough to ſtop their Mouths, that they cannot throw any blame on God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sinners don't pray to God for his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as they ought,</hi> altho' they confeſs their own Impotency. They know that God expects to be ſought to for all needed Bleſſings, and in ſpecial for that Bleſſing of Bleſſings, the ſpiritual Bleſſing: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they call not upon God; or
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003281_0028_0FF03D1D4C5662E0"/>
if at all, yet ſeldom and with a great deal of Coldneſs and Indifference. They ſet upon Duty in their own ſtrength, and attend Ordinances in a prayerleſs careleſs frame, not looking to God for that Grace to aſſiſt them, without which they can do nothing, and without which the beſt means will be inſignificant. We read, Pſal. 10.4. <hi>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not ſeek after God: God is not in his thoughts.</hi> It may be, they are in ſome meaſure ſenſible of their own Impotence, of the Inſufficiency of moral Suaſion alone, and the Neceſſity of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Grace; yet they don't apply themſelves to <hi>Prayer,</hi> as becomes them in order to obtain Divine Aſſiſtances in Duty, and a Divine Bleſſing on external Means.</p>
            <p>Some Sinners, when call'd upon to turn and live, will object their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, &amp; plead, <hi>I can do nothing: God muſt do all.</hi> And this they commonly ſeem to ſpeak with a trifling ſpirit, and profane Eaſineſs, as if their own Impotence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd them from all Care and Concern about the matter; neither do's it put 'em upon <hi>praying,</hi> as it rationally might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Methinks Sinners ſhould reflect on their own Inability, with a deep ſelf-abhorrence, and with great Diſtreſs of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003281_0029_0FF03D4547529688"/>
Soul, with Anguiſh, and with many Tears and Fears. Methinks the ſenſe of their own Impotence ſhould put them upon crying earneſtly to God, as he, Jer. 31.28. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs how many Sinners live without Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or do not call upon God with any Care of Importunity!</p>
            <p>It may be they plead, <hi>They cannot pray.</hi> But then it muſt be ſaid, they don't <hi>ſtir up themſelves</hi> to call upon God. They indulge a Spirit of carnal Security. They neither take pains with their Hearts to get them into a praying frame, nor do they with a juſt Concern and Anxiety of Mind beg of God to teach and help them to pray. God has reſerv'd a peculiar A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency to himſelf, even in the Buſineſs of Prayer: and he does as much command our Application to him for his Aſſiſtance in this Duty of Prayer, as he does demand the Reſt of the Duty. And yet Sinners will not apply to the Throne of Grace, that they may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help them. Surely ſuch are left without all Excuſe. They have no Cloke for their Sin. No Rock can hide them.</p>
            <p>It may be, ſome will plead; They have not ſufficient <hi>Encouragement</hi> to pray for and ſeek converting Grace: becauſe there's
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003281_0030_0FF03D1ECE7DF9E8"/>
no poſitive <hi>Promiſe</hi> for a Sinner to depend upon. But ſurely the Calls and Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel afford ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and are an encouraging Ground of Faith &amp; Hope. — Many have ventur'd upon this Foundation of a rational <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi>; and have ſucceeded. — And then you have as much Ground for Hope here, as in many other Caſes; where yet, while you uſe the Means, you depend upon a Bleſſing. You have a <hi>Peradventure</hi> to encourage you. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>If Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture God will give him Repentance.</hi> So, Act. 8.22. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will not diſpute this Principle, that the Prayers of unregenerate Sinners don't intitle them to the Gift of the holy Spirit, by virtue of any <hi>Promiſe,</hi> God has made to them: But allow he is ſtill at Liberty, and may in his holy Sovereignty deny ſpecial Grace to them. Hear how the Apoſtle treats this critical Caſe, and let us ſet down by his Reſolution, Rom. 9.14, 15, 16. <hi>What ſhall we then ſay? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid. For he ſaith to</hi> Moſes, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003281_0031_0FF03D47A3D1A998"/>
So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> It follows, ver. 19, 20, &amp; 21. <hi>Thou wilt then ſay unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſiſted his will? Nay, but O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother unto diſhonour</hi>? The meer Pleaſure of God determines who ſhall and who ſhall not obtain ſpecial Grace. Yet this is ſo far from being a Plea to excuſe any from praying for converting Grace, that it is rather an Argument why they ſhould pray for it. Becauſe, if their obtaining ſpecial Grace depends on the meer Pleaſure of God, their <hi>Unworthineſs</hi> will not be an <hi>Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the way, neither ſhould it <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> them, that they can find no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Motive in <hi>themſelves</hi> of God's Love. They are as <hi>capable</hi> of being lov'd by him, and as capable to be the object of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Bleſſing, as any in the World. There's nothing <hi>in them</hi> that can <hi>hinder</hi> a gracious God from ſetting his Heart upon them: and <hi>for ought they know,</hi> it may be his good pleaſure to bleſs them. This is the ſame encouragement as they act upon in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003281_0032_0FF03D220623D2B8"/>
other caſes: and if they will not venture upon ſuch Encouragement in the preſent Caſe, they muſt needs be left inexcuſable, and condemn'd as acting a moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent part. Ye Hypocrites, how is it that you can diſcern the face of the Sky, and of the Earth; and when God with-holds the Rain of Heaven, you can howl upon your Beds, and aſſemble your ſelves to cry unto him for Corn &amp; Wine, though you have no aſſurance to be heard! But how is it that you do not diſcern the Time of your ſpiritual Viſitation, as it is ſaid, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. <hi>It is time to ſeek the Lord, till he come and rain righteouſneſs upon you.</hi> And why even of your ſelves judge ye not what is right in this Caſe!</p>
            <p>Let it be added,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sinners under the Goſpel, whether they pray for the Spirit or not, do actually</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <hi>thoſe Aſſiſtances of common Grace, which are a full Vindication of God, and leave them without all Excuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He not only uſes all proper Methods with them in the way of external Means; but he affords them ſuch internal Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, by his holy Spirit, as ſerve to leave them without any Cloke for their Sin. The Spirit of God is often at work in the Conſciences of Sinners; He comes in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003281_0033_0FF03D49E052C3D8"/>
their Minds with inlightning Influences, and awakening Impreſſions; He convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them of Sin, admoniſhes them of Duty, and ſtirs up their Affections, Deſires, Fears, &amp; Hopes: He begets in them good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; lays a Reſtraint upon their Luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, as theſe common Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Aſſiſtances are capable of being improv'd to excellent moral Purpoſes, ſo they are <hi>apparent</hi> Earneſts, probable Tokens of the Spirit's Willingneſs to come into Men by the Operations of his ſpecial Grace. Herein the holy Spirit does practically offer himſelf to Sinners; and if they do not put a Bar in his way, it looks as if he would come and make his Abode with them. But here's the Miſery and Folly of Sinners, they <hi>do always reſiſt and vex the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and oppoſe the Work of ſpecial Grace: by which means they forfeit the Benefit, and render themſelves altogether inexcuſable. So that every mouth muſt be ſtopped before God; and none of the Blame, if they periſh, can be caſt on him.</p>
            <p>It may be remark'd here, and we will ſet an Aſteriſm upon it; <hi>ſuch</hi> Sinners as are of Opinion, that it's in <hi>their own power</hi> ſo to prepare &amp; diſpoſe themſelves, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their natural Abilities, and common Grace, as to <hi>qualify</hi> their Souls
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003281_0034_0FF03D24587162A0"/>
for ſpecial Grace, and <hi>oblige</hi> God in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs unto ſome Promiſe of his to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to them; theſe men, if after all they periſh, will be found <hi>of all men</hi> the moſt inexcuſable. They ſurely can't with any Colour of Reaſon throw the leaſt Blame upon God: for he offer'd his Grace to them, and <hi>in their opinion</hi> oblig'd himſelf to beſtow it, upon certain Terms, which they thought were in their own power to fulfil: and yet they ſupinely failed of a Compliance. They <hi>receiv'd the Grace of God,</hi> as to his common Aſſiſtances, <hi>in vain</hi>; they <hi>turned the Grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>quenched the Spirit,</hi> by carnal Indulgences. So that they forfeited all Right to the (ſuppos'd) Promiſe of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, and God appears infinitely juſt in taking his holy Spirit from 'em, and ſealing their Damnation.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it's evident from what has been ſaid, that God does all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>wiſe</hi> Sovereign to do, both in an external and internal way, to reclaim Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and it may be added, He is <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> towards them as a <hi>merciful</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. It is ſaid, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> So we read, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. <hi>This
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003281_0035_0FF03D4C263DF678"/>
is the will of God, even your Sanctification.</hi> This is his commanding and approving Will, and the plain Language of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards Sinners. He <hi>commands</hi> all Men every where to repent; he gives them a <hi>Space</hi> to repent; and waits long upon them. He does not inſtantly let fly the Arrows of Vengeance, and upon the firſt Provocation caſt them off for ever: but he continues driving with 'em by his Spirit, and repeating the Goſpel-Call, giving them Line upon Line, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon Precept, from one time to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and this it may be for a long Courſe of years. So that none among all them which periſh from under Goſpel-Light, will have it to complain of God, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd them ſufficient Opportunity, or was not willing that they ſhould come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and be ſaved. But they muſt take all the Blame to themſelves; as having trifled away the precious <hi>Seaſons</hi> of Mercy allow'd them; as having reſiſted God, &amp; defeated all the <hi>Methods</hi> of Grace to ſave them; led on by the Luſts of a carnal Mind, that is Enmity againſt God, and full of Prejudices againſt the Redeemer &amp; his Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude, Let us realiſe theſe Things, and take Heed that we be not
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003281_0036_0FF03D269FD90F98"/>
drawn away with the Error of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that we don't impoſe upon our ſelves by any dangerous Fallacies, leſt we periſh with a Lie in our right Hand. Let us conſider, if <hi>we</hi> periſh, who enjoy ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for our Souls, by the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indulgence of Heaven, we ſhall have no Cloke for our Sin, by any Plea of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint we can advance againſt God: but He will be <hi>clear, when he judgeth,</hi> and all the World ſhall confeſs, <hi>The Way of the Lord is equal.</hi> He will convince us that He has acted the part of a gracious and faithful Ruler toward us, and done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconſiſtent with that Proteſtation in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live.</hi> Nevertheleſs ſince we wou'd not turn from our way, He will make us to know that He hath as much Delight in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as in Mercy and Patience; &amp; tho' as a <hi>Lawgiver</hi> and Ruler he expreſſed a <hi>practical Will</hi> for our Salvation, having no Pleaſure in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Creatures, as ſuch, and therefore taking the wiſeſt and moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Methods to promote our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Yet as a <hi>Judge,</hi> he hath <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in repairing the Honour of his violated
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003281_0037_0FF03D4DA91209C0"/>
Law, and delights in glorifying his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Rev. Author before cited gives us his Tho'ts on this Caſe, in theſe <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is thro' the <hi>Glaſs</hi> of the <hi>Word &amp; Creatures,</hi> that in this Life we muſt know God; and ſo according to the Nature of Man, we aſcribe to him <hi>Underſtanding and Will,</hi> removing all the imperfections that we can, becauſe we are capable of no higher Poſitive conceptions of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And on the ſame grounds we do (with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Acts of God's VVill,</hi> as diverſified from the reſpects, or the Objects, though as to God's <hi>Eſſence</hi> they are all one.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the boldlier, becauſe that when we ſpeak of Chriſt, we have the more ground for it from his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And thus we ſay, that the <hi>ſimple Complacency, Will,</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> of God <hi>is</hi> to all that <hi>is Naturally,</hi> or <hi>Morally Good,</hi> according to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Degree</hi> of its <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> And ſo he hath pleaſure in the Converſion and Salvation of all, which yet will never come to paſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And God as <hi>Ruler</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver</hi> of the World, had ſo far a <hi>practical Will</hi> for their Salvation, as to make them a free <hi>Deed of Gift of Chriſt and Life,</hi> and an Act of Oblivion for all their Sins, ſo be it they will not unthankfully reject it, and to command his Meſſengers to offer this gift to all the World, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to accept it. And ſo, he doth all that, <hi>as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, or Promiſer,</hi> belongs to him to do for their Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But yet he reſolveth as <hi>Law-giver,</hi> that they that will not Turn ſhall Die: And as <hi>Judge,</hi> when their day of Grace is paſt, he will Execute that Decree.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. So that he thus unfeignedly willeth the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe that never will be Converted: but not as <hi>Abſolute Lord</hi> with the <hi>fulleſt efficacious Reſolution,</hi> nor as a thing which he reſolveth ſhall undoubtedly come to paſs, or would engage all his power to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh. It is in the Power of a Prince, to ſet a guard upon a Murderer, to ſee that he ſhall not murder and be hanged. But if upon good reaſon he forbear this, and do but ſend to his Subjects, and warn &amp; intreat them not to be Murderers, I hope he may well ſay that he would not have them murder and be hanged; he takes no pleaſure in it, but rather that they forbear, and live. And if he do more for ſome, upon ſome ſpecial reaſon, he is not bound to do ſo by all. —If God were ſo much againſt the death of the Wicked, as that he were reſolved to do all that he can to hinder it, then no man ſhould be condemned: whereas Chriſt telleth you, that few will be ſaved. — <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>They ſuffer no Violence from external Cauſes, nor will any Impediments they meet with in the Way of Duty, afford 'em a Plea ſufficient to juſtify their not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving Chriſt. <hi>What</hi> or <hi>who</hi> ſhould compel the Sinner to refuſe Chriſt? Who ſhould put a Force upon him to go on in his Sins, and reject Chriſt, againſt all the Calls and Attractions of the Goſpel? I have ſhew'd, it can't be imagin'd that the Bleſſed <hi>God</hi> ſhould put Sinners under any Conſtraint ſo to do; which would be to oblige them to rebel againſt his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and diſhonour his own Name, to trample on his dear Son, &amp; deſpiſe the great Salvation, that he has been at an infinite
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003281_0040_0FF03D2B7328BDA0"/>
Expence to purchaſe for us. Nor can it be ſaid that any <hi>Creature</hi> puts a Force upon 'em. Surely not this <hi>Evil World,</hi> whether the Things, or the Men of it. The <hi>Things</hi> of the World have a tempting Influence, but carry nothing of Compulſion in 'em, to bring us into Captivity to Sin. So the <hi>Men</hi> of the World, they may perſuade and intice, but they cannot force. They may indeed uſe a Violence upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and hinder that from external Duties; but they can't reach the Soul, to hinder this from the inviſible Actings of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance toward God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Who then ſhould be the Author of this pretended Violence?</p>
            <p>Will it be attributed to the <hi>Devil?</hi> True, he is our grand Adverſary, and he goeth about as a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour: He's a moſt powerful and malicious Enemy. But yet his <hi>Strength</hi> lies chiefly in his <hi>Policy</hi> and Skill in the Arts of Deceiving. He is more ſubtil to delude, than powerful to conſtrain. What <hi>Force</hi> can <hi>he</hi> uſe? Does the Devil by any ſecret irreſiſtible Efficacy bind and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Men to act in Contradiction to their own real Judgment and Choice? No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: he can intice and decoy, affright and terrify; but not compel and oblige.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:003281_0041_0FF03D5338E3A8E0"/>When Men forſake Chriſt, is it the <hi>Devil</hi> (think you) that draggs them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him by Force! Does the Devil chain their Feet, that they cannot go to the Houſe of God, to ſeek Chriſt in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances! Does the Devil ſtop their mouths, and make them reſtrain Prayer before God! Does the Devil ſhut their Ears, that they cannot hear; and cloſe their Eyes, that they cannot read the Word of Salvation! Does the Devil harden their Hearts and ſear their Conſciences, that they ſhould not be affected and conſider the Things which belong to their everlaſting Peace? Does the Devil enrage Men's Paſſions, when at any time they are full of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and evil-ſpeaking! Does the Devil move Men's Tongues when they throw out their Blaſphemies and horrid Oaths! Or does he open the Drunkards Mouths, when they take down their intemperate and ſtupifying Cups!</p>
            <p>What <hi>Violence</hi> (I pray) does Satan uſe in any of theſe Caſes! 'Tis true, he's a Tempter to all Wickedneſs, and Enemy of all Righteouſneſs; a cunning, a ſtrong, and buiſy Adverſary. He has many Wiles to deſtroy the Souls of Men: He often impoſes upon them by falſe Reaſonings, and by deceitful Baits draws them into a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003281_0042_0FF03D2DBAE30AF0"/>
Snare and Death. He is very ſubtil to caſt in Objections and raiſe Prejudices in Men's Minds againſt the Truths &amp; Ways of God; He is ſubtil to repreſent Sin and Error in a plauſible Dreſs, in very fair and alluring Colours; He has alſo a great Sagacity and Dexterity in applying his Temptations, to ſute the various Tempers of Perſons, to hit the Opportunity, &amp; take all Advantages. And he's very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even indefatigable, in his Efforts to hinder Men from entertaining the Goſpel, and keep them ſtill in their Sins. But when he has done all, he can't compel Men againſt their Wills. Let no man, when he is tempted, ſay he's compel'd by the Devil: for Satan's power is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive, but perſuaſive only. He may perſuade the judgment by deluſive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but he cannot force the Will, againſt the Judgment. He has no Power but what is reſiſtible. Hence that, Jam. 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he ſhall flee from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis the Fault and Folly of Sinners, They <hi>don't</hi> reſiſt the Devil. They don't ſtudy his Devices, and watch his Motions, and oppoſe his Attempts, as they ought to do. Which certainly muſt needs make them inexcuſable, and ſtop their Mouths from pleading the Power of Satan over
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003281_0043_0FF03D56543A9E90"/>
them in Apology for their Sin and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence.</p>
            <p>And then, it muſt be conſider'd, if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan has gain'd a Power over any, which ſeems almoſt irreſiſtible, ſo that they are (as it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.) <hi>Led captive by him at his will</hi>; they have bro't this upon themſelves. The natural Power, or the Power which Satan has over Men by Nature, they may be ſaid to have brought it upon themſelves by their Sin and Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> their primitive Head and Repreſentative: But more eſpecially the <hi>heighten'd Degree</hi> of this Power, may Sinners be ſaid to bring themſelves under, by giving <hi>Place to the Devil,</hi> by yielding to his Temptations, and <hi>doing his Luſts</hi> from time to time. Thus he gets an Advantage againſt them, and acquires to himſelf a new Degree of Power over them. This is the <hi>natural</hi> Effect: ſince every act of Sin ſtrengthens the Habit within Men; and the ſtronger the Habit of Sin is, the more Power Satan has over them; for he rules them by the Mediation of their own Luſts and Corruptions. And then it is the <hi>moral</hi> Effect of the Sinners Conduct, by provoking God judicially to abandon them, and ſuffer Satan to exerciſe a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Tyranny over them. That is the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003281_0044_0FF03D2FF9635478"/>
Caſe of ſome forſaken Sinners, 2 Pet. 2.14. <hi>They cannot ceaſe from Sin.</hi> So it is ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, or the leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Now the grand Reaſon of this their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is the power and working of Satan in them, which obſtructs the Efficacy of the Means of Grace employ'd upon 'em. The Apoſtle reſolves all into this, 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then is this any <hi>Excuſe,</hi> pleadable by Sinners in Vindication of their Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Impenitence? No; for had they not firſt reſiſted God ſo obſtinately, ſo perverſely, He had not abandon'd 'em: but ſince they have forſaken him, he may juſtly forſake them, and leave 'em to the the Power of Satan. Hence that account is given of the matter, Pſal. 81.11, 12. <hi>My People would not hearken to my Voice; and Iſrael would none of me: SO I gave them up.</hi> And therefore they muſt needs be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. The Power, which Satan has over them, affords no Cloke for their Sin: becauſe they have brought this great
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003281_0045_0FF03D57D799CF20"/>
Evil upon themſelves, both by the juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and by the natural Efficacy of their guilty and fooliſh Submiſſions to the Tempter, againſt all the Force of Divine Warnings and Reſtraints, from time to time. Is not he juſtly reputed a ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, that runs into the mouth of this devouring Lion; that has no Care to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, nor takes any Pains in reſiſting him: but heedleſly and preſumptuouſly goes in the Paths of the Deſtroyer, expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for an eaſy Prey to ſo wily and powerful an Adverſary! Our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> wou'd fain have laid the Blame of her Fall upon Satan: ſays ſhe, <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi> But it was a poor Excuſe, and of no Avail. Neither will the like Pretence be of any ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance in the mouth of her Poſterity.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not enlarge any further here. We come now to the laſt Thing:</p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>IT remains therefore, that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners take all the Blame of their Sin and Ruin to THEMSELVES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil and his Inſtruments may lay Temptations before Men, and ſo be acceſſory to their Sinning: but 'tis their own evil Heart, that deceives and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carries
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003281_0046_0FF03D3251B5A160"/>
them on to comply, and is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of their Sin &amp; Ruin. Hence that, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. 'Every Man is tempted, when he is enticed and drawn away of <hi>his own Luſts.</hi> It is the carnal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Principle, ſo deeply rooted in our degenerate Nature, that draws Men from Chriſt, ſeduces them from Duty, and makes them to pervert the right ways of the Lord. It is <hi>their own Luſt,</hi> that fills them with Prejudices againſt Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him. It is <hi>their own Luſt,</hi> that hinders them from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to Chriſt, as the Lord their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. 'Tis <hi>their own Luſt,</hi> that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from confeſſing their Sins, and repenting, to give Glory to God. It is <hi>their own Luſt,</hi> that hinders them from attending, with a ſutable Concern and Diligence, on the Word and Means of Grace. 'Tis <hi>their own Luſt,</hi> that prevents their getting the Good of Ordinances and Providences; that gives the Efficacy to Temptations, and makes Satan ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his malicious Eſſays againſt them. It's all owing to the Luſts of Men's own Hearts. That's the Cenſure upon them, 2 Tim. 3.6. <hi>Led away with divers Luſts.</hi> And theſe are repreſented as <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> Luſts, which drown Men in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003281_0047_0FF03D5A4F6E7850"/>
and Perdition, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. Our Saviour has told us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>And this is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the clearer Illuſtration of the Point, I ſhall purſue it, in three or four particulars, as briefly as I can, with Juſtice to ſo important a Subject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be conſider'd, <hi>Goſpel-Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents do very much</hi> neglect <hi>to uſe, or</hi> trifle <hi>in uſing, thoſe</hi> Means, <hi>which are in their own power, and which they might probably hope God would bleſs, in order to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvatian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho' it is true, that Sinners can't by any innate Power of their own convert themſelves: Yet they can by the help of common Grace attend, with ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeriouſneſs and a moral Sincerity, on the Means of Divine Appointment; and in this way they might do a great deal more toward their Converſion than they actually do. Notwithſtanding that in the moment of Regeneration we are properly paſſive, and the whole Efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is of God: Yet in order to God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this good work upon us, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to be diligently attending on his holy Ordinances; which are the uſual
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003281_0048_0FF03D5D5E8FE210"/>
Vehicles of ſaving Grace, and we can't rationally expert the ſanctifying Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the holy Spirit upon our Souls, but in the way of Duty. To ſit ſtill, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely negligent of our ſpiritual Concerns, and yet expect the ſpecial Influences of Divine Grace, is wicked and dangerous Preſumption. Hence we are frequently call'd upon in ſuch terms as thoſe, Joh. 6.27. <hi>Labour for the meat, which endureth to Everlaſting Life.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate.</hi> So Phil. 2.12. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> And when Sinners are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective &amp; ſlothful, God complains of 'em, as in Hoſ. 5.4. <hi>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God.</hi> So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt reproved the Jews of his day in that Language, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi> Theſe are Complaints lying againſt Multitudes of Profeſſors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel: and indeed all that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh, will fall under the Reproach of theſe heavy Imputations. This will be their Condemnation at laſt, that when they enjoy'd, or had Opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Means of Grace, they neglected the ſame. Not indeed that all who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, will be ſound guilty of an intire and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003281_0049_0FF03D840CD78960"/>
univerſal Neglect: for ſome may give their Attendance on theſe and thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but then they neglect others, and are very formal in all. But the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality will be found to have been groſly negligent of the moſt neceſſary inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Duties of Religion, and will be found to have habitually trifled in them.</p>
            <p>Now if they would not do what was in their power to do, in order to Salvation, no wonder if they periſh: they periſh very juſtly. Some of Solomon's Obſervations may be pertinently enough apply'd in the preſent Caſe: <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.4. <hi>The ſoul of the ſluggard deſireth, and hath nothing.</hi> Chap. 21.25. <hi>The deſire of the ſlothful killeth him, for his hands refuſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> If men are guilty of inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Folly, who neglect the Buſineſs of common Life, and complain of Want: how much more they, who neglect their Souls and the great Salvation! <hi>O how ſhall ſuch eſcape?</hi> And are not many Sinners condemned of themſelves, by their own practice with relation to worldly Concerns! <hi>For no man ever yet hated his own Body, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</hi> And will you ſtarve your <hi>Souls</hi> to Death! Nay, what Man ſhall there be among you, that ſhall have one Sheep, and if it fall
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003281_0050_0FF03D6064184F88"/>
into the Pit, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out: but how much is a <hi>Man better than a Sheep</hi>? Are not Sinners then without all Excuſe, who being themſelves plung'd into Sin and Miſery, are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd, and will not be at any pains to ſeek Deliverance! They have perhaps high Conceits of their own Power and Liberty; and yet don't uſe their power, but abuſe their Liberty. They've a plenty of Means, but are ſlothful in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, <hi>and hide their Talent in a Napkin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! Do not Multitudes of profeſſed Chriſtians let their <hi>Bibles</hi> lie by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without an Eye caſt into them from day to day, and from Week to Week! Or if they look into the Scriptures, is it not more out of Curioſity or Cuſtom, than any ſerious Aim at getting ſpiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereby! And how negligent are many Profeſſors, as to <hi>hearing</hi> the Word preach'd! How apt to omit precious Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of hearing, upon any the moſt frivolous Excuſes! And how very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and indolent in their Attendance! How indulgent to Sleep, or Security; or elſe carnal Prejudices and evil Paſſions many times! Again, When Sinners might as well employ their <hi>thinking</hi> Powers on religious Concerns, as on worldly affairs,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:003281_0051_0FF03D869320CE08"/>
and if they wou'd but think cloſely and frequently on divine Things, this wou'd have a happy Tendency to bring them to a believing Entertainment of Goſpel-Offers, and ſerious Purſuit of their great and beſt Intereſt: yet how do Sinners live in the Neglect of holy <hi>Meditation</hi>; ſuffering the Amuſements of a vain World to engroſs their Thoughts, and careleſly ruſhing on in the purſuit of temporary Profits or Pleaſure! They mind earthly things, and God is ſcarce in all their Thoughts. They think little or nothing about their Souls: &amp; if ever they <hi>examine</hi> themſelves, they do but trifle in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Duty; not willing to come to the Light, leſt their Deeds ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved. Again, What Strangers are many Profeſſors to the Duty of religious <hi>Conference,</hi> and how little is there of a walking with the wiſe; which might have a bleſſed Influence to make them alſo wiſe! Furthermore, Although <hi>Prayer</hi> is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Way, wherein we are to wait upon God for his renewing Grace; yet how do Sinners neglect this Duty, or but thoughtleſly attend it!</p>
            <p>In a word, altho' Sinners are often exhorted to make a <hi>Trial</hi> whether God will enable them by his Grace, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003281_0052_0FF03D63A8261380"/>
&amp; believe in Chriſt; yet they have no Heart to the Experiment. They ſit down in Security or Deſpair, and will not <hi>try</hi> to ſtretch out the withered arm; altho' bidden to do it, and altho' they might hope God wou'd proſper the Eſſay.</p>
            <p>Now, if this be the Conduct of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, while they continue impenitent, 'tis ſurely a vain thing for them to go about to excuſe themſelves with any Plea from their ſpiritual Impotence. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> it may be to plead their Impotence, when by Prayer and in the Uſe of appointed Means they are <hi>waiting u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God</hi> for his Spirit to be given them, without whom they can do nothing to any ſaving purpoſes: Yet it muſt needs be quite <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> and <hi>hypocritical</hi> to make this Plea, while <hi>neglecting</hi> Prayer and the Means of Grace, by way of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> herefor. It's a vanity for Sinners to complain of Weakneſs and Inability, that don't do what is in their power as to the <hi>material</hi> part of Duty. They muſt not think to palliate their Sloth by Pretences of Impotency. It's evident that Sinners <hi>can</hi> do more, both extenſively and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively more, than they actually do, in the uſe of Means, towards their Converſion: And this their Negligence is enough to ſtop
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003281_0053_0FF03D884D6F8B70"/>
their Mouths, and render their caſe utterly indefenſible; For this certainly argues a <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Will</hi> to come to Chriſt and turn to God. From their habitual <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of practicable Duties, and being careleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Matter of Converſion, we may very juſtly infer &amp; aſſert, They <hi>would not</hi> come to Chriſt and turn to God, if it were really in their own power.</p>
            <p>Obſerve; This coming to Chriſt and turning to God may be taken two ways; either in a divided Senſe for the <hi>Acts</hi> of believing and repenting, or in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſenſe for the <hi>Uſe of Means</hi> and <hi>Endeavours</hi> to obtain Faith and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Now, tho' unregenerate Sinners have not a power immediately to <hi>exerciſe</hi> Faith and Repentance: Yet having an ability to uſe the <hi>Means,</hi> which they might hope the Spirit will accompany with his Power and Influence, to beget theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their Souls, and enable them to convert and live to God, they may for <hi>this Reaſon,</hi> if they neglect the Means, or do but trifle in them, be charged with <hi>voluntary</hi> Unbelief and <hi>reſolv'd</hi> Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. It plainly ſhews, their not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt and not turning to God ought to be imputed to their Wilfulneſs, rather than Weakneſs, to their Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003281_0054_0FF03D65EA790818"/>
rather than Incapacity. 'Tis a choſen and delightful Impotence. 'Tis owing to the Malignity of their corrupt <hi>Wills,</hi> that they cannot repent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to God. As it is ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Behold, their Ear is uncircumciſed, and they cannot hearken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I paſs now to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Goſpel-Impenitents a</hi> reſiſt <hi>the Methods of Grace, which the bleſſed God uſes with them, and do</hi> quench <hi>the Holy Spirit ſtriving in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have dreadful Riſings of Heart in Oppoſition to the work of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and not willing to ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of God, they <hi>go about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs.</hi> They are of a ſtubborn and proud Spirit, and take unhappy Methods to extinguiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, that they may live in carnal Eaſe. They not only neglect uſing means themſelves for their Converſion: but they alſo oppoſe the Means uſed with them by the Spirit of Grace. They not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to exerciſe their own Power, in the way of Duty: but likewiſe appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that God ſhould exerciſe <hi>his</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a way of Grace, to turn and reform them. It was a Complaint againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.10. <hi>They rebelled,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003281_0055_0FF03D8A9209A530"/>
and vexed his holy Spirit.</hi> And this Charge holy <hi>Stephen</hi> advances againſt the Jews in his day, Act. 7.51. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the holy Ghoſt: as your fathers did, ſo do ye.</hi> Sinners turn a deaf Ear to the Calls of the Spirit in their Conſciences, as well as to the Calls of God in his Word and Providence. They reſiſt his holy Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtifle Convictions, and do what they can to efface any good Impreſſions begun upon them. They often quench the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by one unhappy Means &amp; another, by Sloth &amp; Careleſsneſs, by Pride and Self-Confidence, by Impatience, &amp; Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, by worldly Buſineſs or ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diverſions, by affected Ignorance, by ſtudy'd Excuſes, Delays, and the like. Thus they fruſtrate the ſtriving Spirit of God, and receive his Grace in vain. So they fail of a ſaving Converſion, by their own wilful Folly: and ſuch as reject the Means, may be ſaid wilfully to refuſe the End. Surely then in this regard Goſpel-Sinners are without Excuſe, and have no Cloke for their Sin.</p>
            <p>Let it now be added,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Goſpel-Impenitents do actually commit thoſe</hi> Sins, <hi>which as they have a natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to hinder their Converſion, ſo they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:003281_0056_0FF03D683A8B1F20"/>
God to with-hold his ſpecial Grace from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners might, if they would, by the help of common Grace, reform their evil Manners, purge their Lives from groſs Enormities, and lay conſiderable Reſtraints on the Luſts and Paſſions of their evil Hearts. They might, if they would, forbear the outward Act of groſs Sins. They might avoid the occaſions of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſhun Temptations, more than they do. They could argue with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Folly of their Vices, &amp; Danger of Impenitence: They could bind their Souls in ſerious Vows and Reſolutions; which might be good Preſervatives and Guards againſt their returning unto Folly, the Folly of ſcandalous Practice.</p>
            <p>What ſhould hinder Sinners from uſing theſe Methods in order to break off their ſins! Have they not a Principle of Reaſon in them, a natural Conſcience, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns their Immoralities, &amp; often prompts them to a Reformation! Cou'd they not conſider, and reſolve, and watch, &amp; pray, that they enter not into Temptation! And if they did theſe things as well as they cou'd, would they ſo often fall into Sin as they do!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:003281_0057_0FF03D8D960EF900"/>What then can we collect from hence, but that they live in <hi>choſen Rebellion</hi> againſt God, whilſt they go on in their Treſpaſſes! They won't part with their Luſts, for the ſake of Chriſt. By their indulging themſelves in Sin, they harden their Hearts in wickedneſs, and take a <hi>natural</hi> Courſe to hinder their Converſion. So it is complained, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11, 12. <hi>But they refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears, that they ſhould not hear. Yea, they made their heart as an adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the law.</hi> They are in a corrupt diſeas'd Condition, ('tis true) and cannot cure and recover themſelves to a State of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Soundneſs. But then if they perverſly take unhappy Methods to make their State worſe, and will even drink down poiſon to deſtroy themſelves utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they muſt needs periſh without Excuſe and without Pity. And then ſince a compaſſionate Phyſician has taken their Caſe into Conſideration, tho' they cannot cure themſelves, yet they can <hi>forfeit</hi> his healing Mercy: and when they reject divine Remedies, and diſobey divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and will preſumptuouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves by venturing upon the moſt dangerous Courſes; How can they
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003281_0058_0FF03D69C2510480"/>
expect but that he ſhould refuſe any more to look upon them! Surely they offer the groſſeſt Indignities to the bleſſed God, the Lord that ſanctifieth us: they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Grace, and tempt him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it from them. They provoke him to blaſt the Means they ſit under &amp; do ſo abuſe. They provoke God to call away his Spirit, to ſwear in his wrath, that his Spirit ſhall no more ſtrive with them, and to reſolve concerning them, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from thy filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all this are Goſpel-Sinners warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: and yet they go on in their Sins, to add Iniquity to Rebellion, Obſtinacy to Tranſgreſſion. They multiply their Sins, and proceed from Evil to Evil, crucifying to themſelves the Son of God afreſh: tho' they know how they hereby expoſe themſelves to the Loſs of the ſtriving Spirit of Grace. O amazing Self-Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! It is ſaid of Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.32. <hi>He that doth it, deſtroyeth his own ſoul.</hi> And in this regard they are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. If the Light of Nature left the <hi>Heathen</hi> without Excuſe, beſure <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who enjoy the Light of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003281_0059_0FF03D90791EA670"/>
Revelation, muſt have no Cloke for their Sin. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20,—32. &amp; Chap. 2.1,—5. For brevity I only turn you to the places, and leave you to read 'em at your leaſure.</p>
            <p>Now upon the whole, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Goſpel-Sinners do all this in a</hi> free <hi>and</hi> voluntary <hi>manner, and upon</hi> Motives <hi>which at the time appear to them founded in Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they do act freely, is a neceſſary Deduction from thoſe Scriptures, that ſpeak of Men's Unbelief as a <hi>Refuſing</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of their Impenitence as an <hi>hardning of their Hearts</hi>; which implies an Exerciſe of the <hi>Will.</hi> And the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as confirm'd by thoſe Scriptures, that charge this Unbelief and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as a <hi>Guilt</hi> upon us; which implies that we are under no phyſical Coaction, or abſolute Neceſſity of Nature: For if ſo, how then would our refuſing of Chriſt be a Sin!</p>
            <p>For the clearing this point, it may be obſerv'd, Notwithſtanding the moral <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> Men are under to the Fleſh, World, and Devil, who rule in the hearts of the Children of Diſobedience; yet they ſtill retain that Liberty of Will, which is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to them <hi>as Men,</hi> and renders 'em
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003281_0060_0FF03D6C1740F508"/>
capable Subjects of moral Government. We ſtill retain all the eſſential Powers of Men; tho' the original Rectitude of them is loſt. Our Actions are ſtill under the Conduct of our internal powers of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will. And the Will in us is yet a <hi>rational</hi> Faculty; <hi>i. e.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Underſtanding and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and acts upon ſome Motives that at preſent ſeem to carry Reaſon &amp; Force with them, tho' they often prove upon a ſtricter Examination of Things, to have little Truth or Weight. However ſuch is the Conſtitution of our Nature, even in this fallen State, that the Will follows the Directions of the Underſtanding; purſuing what that exhibits as a Good, and declining what that repreſents as an Evil. No man loves or hates, chuſes or refuſes, but he pretends to do it upon Arguments of Reaſon, and has ſome <hi>Idea</hi> in his Mind that ſways and governs him.</p>
            <p>Even thus in the Caſe before us, if Sinners harden their Hearts and refuſe Chriſt, they do it upon ſome Grounds and Conſiderations, that in the preſent View of Things appear to them <hi>rational.</hi> This is repreſented in that Clauſe of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Vineyard, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.13, 14. <hi>Then ſaid the Lord of the Vineyard, What ſhall I
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003281_0061_0FF03D923A17DF38"/>
do? I will ſend my beloved Son: it may be they will reverence him when they ſee him. But when the husbandmen ſaw him, they reaſoned among themſelves, ſaying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance may be ours.</hi> And proceeding thus upon ſeemingly rational Views, they appear to act with a <hi>freedom of Will</hi> in rejecting Chriſt. Which is a Truth that all muſt acknowledge, if they entertain a right Notion of human Liberty.</p>
            <p>Now the Liberty of the Will do's not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in an aequilibrious Indifference, a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Suſpenſion, and equal Inclination to two contrary objects: becauſe this wou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, That the <hi>more</hi> virtuous or the <hi>more</hi> vicious any are, the <hi>leſs</hi> they are ſo, being the leſs <hi>free</hi>; and conſequently leſs inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to Rewards, or leſs expos'd to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which belong to free Agents, only in proportion to the Degrees of Virtue or Vice, their Actions carry in them. Human Liberty then cannot lie in an Indifference to Good and Evil: but it is an intelligent Spontaneity, and lies in a Capacity or Propenſity to act according to the preſent Dictates of the Underſtanding. To act freely is to act by a voluntary Motion, agreable to the Reſult of our preſent Thoughts, without
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003281_0062_0FF03D6FD747E660"/>
an unnatural Force and irreſiſtible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion from any external Cauſe. This kind of Liberty is fundamental to human Nature, and the neceſſary Property of moral actions.</p>
            <p>Of this meer eſſential Liberty of Will even the vileſt Sinners are poſſeſſed: and this they exerciſe, when they neglect the great Salvation, refuſe Chriſt, and go on in Sin. They herein act <hi>upon Choice,</hi> and according to their preſent practical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as intellectual and free Agents.</p>
            <p>Indeed the natural man is under a <hi>moral</hi> Impoſſibility of determining himſelf to that which is ſpiritually good, and has not an actual Freedom of Will to chuſe &amp; embrace Chriſt. For by the carnal Mind within him, which is full of Prejudices againſt Chriſt, and repreſents him to the Sinner in a falſe Light, under very odious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, the Will is diſpoſed to avoid and refuſe him, and the Soul carry'd out in Acts of Enmity againſt him: and ſo long as the Underſtanding remains dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd and depraved, the Will muſt remain unalterably ſet in oppoſition to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet this is not a Neceſſity that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes the Sinner from guilt in refuſing of Chriſt; becauſe it is ſuch a Neceſſity as is conſiſtent with a freedom of Action,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003281_0063_0FF03D955136B918"/>
and does not imply any external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion or Force put upon our Nature.</p>
            <p>The Sinner acts with a <hi>full Conſent</hi> of his Will, and with the ſame Liberty, as if there were no manner of Neceſſity lying upon him. He acts as freely, as if there were no determinate Counſel of God concerning him. He acts as freely, as if there were no governing Providence over him. He acts as freely, as if there were no Devil to tempt him; and as if there were no Impediments in the way to prevent his coming to Chriſt. The Sinner is voluntary in his Averſation from Chriſt: and whatever Neceſſity he is under, of acting as he does, it is a choſen and pleaſing Neceſſity, very agreable to his corrupt Nature. It ſprings from a rooted Principle of Enmity in his heart to Chriſt &amp; his Ways, and from a radicated Love to Sin and the World, which he can't ſubmit to part with for Chriſt's ſake. The man is contented with his fallen Condition; he delights in his Chains, and abhors the Terms on which Chriſt offers Deliverance to him. He refuſes Chriſt with a delightful Spontaneity.</p>
            <p>So that whether he is ſuppoſed to be under a moral Neceſſity of acting as he does, or to have a Power of acting other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003281_0064_0FF03D715ADD3280"/>
it makes no Difference; but leaves him equality inexcuſable: for if he were under no manner of Neceſſity or Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but had in himſelf a ſufficient Strength and Ability to come to Chriſt and turn from Sin, yet <hi>he would not</hi>; ſuch is the Malignity of his Will, ſuch the Pride of his Heart and Stupidity of his Soul. He loves not the Perſon of Chriſt; he values not his Offices; he inwardly hates the Laws of Chriſt, and deſpiſes his Righteouſneſs. We read, Prov. 13.19. <hi>It is Abomination to Fools to depart from Evil.</hi> They hate knowledge, and do not chuſe the Fear of the Lord, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.29. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>They love darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8.—<hi>Not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed</hi> can <hi>be. So then they that are in the fleſh</hi> cannot <hi>pleaſe God.</hi> The Scripture imputes a kind of moral Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Sinning as they do, unto Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a State of Nature: And yet alſo imputes their Sins to their own voluntary Choice. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>They have choſen their own ways, and their ſoul delighteth in their abominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now thus to chuſe the ways of Sin, is to chuſe <hi>Death</hi> in the Cauſes of it. Hence that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. <hi>But he that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own ſoul; all they that hate me, love death.</hi> Their Hatred of Chriſt
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003281_0065_0FF03D97C8FB9B38"/>
and Love to Sin, is the fundamental Reaſon of Men's rejecting Chriſt. They are ſet upon their Luſts; and therefore <hi>will not</hi> have Chriſt to reign over them. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They prefer the Body to the Soul, Earth to Heaven, and Time to Eternity: and are reſolved upon the Purſuit of this World's Good at all adventures.

own Deſtruction. Muſt not ſuch then be ſtript of all Excuſes! Surely they have no Cloke for their Sin: they can make no apology for their Unbelief, ſince it ſo manifeſtly appears to be wilful, choſen and reſolute.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now conclude with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections or Inferences from this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>USE 1. <hi>Have Goſpel-Impenitents no Cloke for their Sin! Hence we may learn</hi> the Juſtice of God <hi>in the eternal Condemnation, &amp; aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Puniſhment of ſuch in a future State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An holy, a jealous, and omnipotent God will one day call Sinners into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will judge the World in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, rendring to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Deeds. And as the Rules of Juſtice require that greater Sinners ſhould have a greater Puniſhment; hence Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Sinners, who knew their Lord's Will, and prepared not themſelves to do it, ſhall in that day be adjudged to peculiar Pains, and be beaten with many ſtripes. The wilful obſtinacy of Goſpel-Impenitents exceedingly increaſes their Guilt; and makes the Divine Juſtice in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation ſhine out with a tranſcendent Glory. The whole World of intelligent Beings will unite their Suffrages, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Equity of the Divine Sentence
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003281_0067_0FF03D9A1BDDA6D8"/>
in that Day. Yea, the Sinners themſelves ſhall aſcribe Righteouſneſs to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and as to all Pretences of Injuſtice in his dealings with them, will be <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi> and cover'd with Confuſion. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.11, 12. <hi>And when the king came in to ſee the gueſts, he ſaw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he ſaith unto him, Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a wedding garment? And he was ſpeechleſs.</hi> Every Plea will be wreſted out of Sinners Mouths, by the Advantages they have enjoy'd, and the Profeſſion they made, under the Goſpel: Which will all come in as ſo many Items to accumulate the Guilt of their Impenitency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their Account. They ſhall no more be able to drown the Voice of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, bribe its Judgment, or elude the force of its Charges by any deceitful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings. They ſhall be convinced in that day, however impotent and unable they were of themſelves to turn and live to God; that yet their not doing it was owing to the Malignity of their Wills, and the Enmity in their carnal Minds againſt Chriſt and his Ways, rather than to an involuntary Weakneſs or inſuperable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from their ſpiritual Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:003281_0068_0FF03D7532900010"/>It might ſeem ſufficient to vindicate the judicial procedures of the great Day, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>ſovereign.</hi> Is it not ſaid, He <hi>hath Mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame Lump, to make one Veſſel unto Honour and another unto Diſhonour?</hi> Where God has deny'd effectual ſaving Grace to any, has he with-holden from them what he <hi>owed</hi> them? Nay, is it not a juſt Puniſhment of their ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> to take the Forfeiture he made of Heaven and Happineſs for them, by breaking the Covenant of Life, made with him as our common Head? God might upbraid them in ſuch Language as that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right ſeed: how then art thou turned into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate plant of a ſtrange vine unto me</hi>?</p>
            <p>But <hi>God</hi> will make Impenitents to know in that day that he does not proceed with them in a way of meer deſpotick Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, but according to the ſtricteſt Rules of rectoral Holineſs: That neither does he only condemn them for original Sin, and puniſh them meerly for their native Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity &amp; Corruption: but for their <hi>contracted</hi> Impotence and <hi>perſonal</hi> Rebellions; for their carnal Sloth, and indulged Enmity; for their wilful Infidelity, their affected

Ignorance, and choſen Diſobedience. He will make them to know that thus their Deſtruction is of themſelves: the Reſult of their own criminal Choice. He will upbraid them, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelf, in that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God will waſh his hands in Innocency, and pronounce them guilty of their own Blood. Yea, they themſelves will acquit God, and declare his Throne faultleſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. Conſcience will fly in their faces, and joyn with God in condemning them. They will acknowledge in that day, God has done all that became a wiſe and gracious Sovereign to do, in the way of Means, for the bringing them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and will bitterly bewail it that they did ſo grieve and vex the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: that they did ſo deſpiſe their Bible, their Baptiſm, their Sabbaths, their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, their Parents, and faithful Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Thus the Caſe is repreſented, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. <hi>And thou mourn at the laſt, when thy fleſh and thy body are conſumed, And ſay, How have I hated inſtruction, &amp; my heart deſpiſed reproof?

               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:003281_0070_0FF03D784CF3CFA8"/>They will ſubſcribe to the Equity of the Sentence paſſed upon them; and tho' they once thought the <hi>Threatning</hi> ſevere, they will then confeſs the <hi>Execution</hi> is juſt upon them.

            <p>But I proceed to another Reflection.</p>
            <p>USE 2. <hi>Hence the Awfulneſs of our ſtanding under the Goſpel, and the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Deluſion <hi>of ſuch as truſt to meer Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Externals in Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Standing in God's Vineyard is a matter of joyful, and yet alſo of awful Conſideration. For the Axe is now laid to the Root of the Trees, and every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit, <hi>ſhall be cut down &amp; caſt into the Fire.</hi> Matth. 3.10. Our Goſpel-Privileges are no Security from the Wrath to come. <hi>Joab</hi> may fly to the Horns of the Altar; and yet be hewn in pieces before the Lord.

Goſpel-Advantages will be ſo far from being Pleas for Mercy, that they will rather loudly imprecate Vengeance on the guilty Heads of ſuch as have deſpis'd and abuſed them. Theſe things ſerve but to enhaunce their Guilt, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to a greater Damnation. The Apoſtle mentions it as a very aggravating Circumſtance of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the law, through break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law, diſhonoureſt thou God?</hi>

See <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21, &amp;c. Be not high-minded then, but fear. Don't depend on a meer Profeſſion, and religious externals: but look to your Hearts that they be right with God.

part in neglecting for even one moment ſo great Salvation. Thou art <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> O man, whoever thou art, and canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vindicate thy <hi>paſt</hi> Behaviour. And wilt thou <hi>yet</hi> go on? Wilt thou go on after repeated Calls and Warnings, and ſtrivings of the holy Spirit with you! Art thou not convinced, do's not thy Conſcience tell thee, that thou haſt no Pleas ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defend thee? O how canſt thou neglect thy Saviour and thy Soul from day to day, and year to year! Art thou not afraid of God's Judgments falling upon thee? What can ſcreen you from the Strokes of vindictive Juſtice? What do you think ſhould ſtay the Hand of Vengeance? And when God ariſes to take hand on Judgment, what will you do? What will you plead? Can thine Heart endure, or can thine Hands be ſtrong, in the day that he ſhall deal with thee? Is it not a moſt fearful and tremendous thing, to fall into the Hands of the living God! See then the Danger and the Folly of Delays: and now, even <hi>now,</hi> while it is called to day, be ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger harden your Heart.</p>
            <p>O let us all be exhorted ſeriouſly to <hi>conſider</hi> how inexcuſable we ſhall be, if

            <p>Whatever way of Sin we may be walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, O let us reflect upon the inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Folly we are guilty of, and the Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard we run of Damning our own Souls, if we do not inſtantly turn and give our Hearts to the Lord. God expoſtulates with us, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31, 32. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit; for why will ye die, O houſe of Ifſael? For I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God: wherefore turn your ſelves, and live ye.</hi> Let us conſider ſolemnly with our ſelves, that none of us have any Cloke for our Sin. The <hi>Vicious</hi> &amp; immoral have no Cloke for their Sin, who will not abſtain from thoſe groſs Acts of Sinning, which they might refrain if they would, nor avoid thoſe Temptations, which they might eaſily keep out of the way of. The Drunkard has no Cloke for his Sin, the Adulterer, the Liar, the Injurious, the Worldling, have no Cloke for their Sin: ſince they will not take any Care, nor uſe the Power they have, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their own Iniquity. They
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:003281_0074_0FF03D7C20C50DA8"/>
love their Luſts, and will not part with them. So the <hi>Profane,</hi> the Irreligious, the Formal, and the carnally Secure have no Cloke for their Sin: for they will not employ, nor ſtudy to improve, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Abilities God has given them, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending only on the Means of Grace, and by ſtriving to work up their Hearts to a ſutable Frame, by Meditation, by Self-Examination, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely ſuch have no Cloke for their Sin. O let us conſider, whatever Rank of Sinners we belong to, if we periſh at laſt, we ſhall be found utterly inexcuſable. Neither Chriſt nor Conſcience will have any Plea to make for us: but will both joyn in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing and impleading us. We ſhall ſtand indited of Murder, the moſt heinous, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Self-Murder, the Murder of our Souls, wilful premeditated Self-Murder, &amp; muſt periſh without Remedy. The Guilt of Blood, of our own Blood, will be upon our heads: and we ſhall have none to commiſerate us, even our own Conſciences will be enraged againſt us. Satan will accuſe, and God condemn us. No Eye will pity, nor can any Arm ſave us.</p>
            <p>And now may it not well ſtrike a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror upon us to meditate theſe things! O let us earneſtly ſeek to God for his Spirit
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:003281_0075_0FF03DA341A79D50"/>
to renew us unto Repentance, and be waiting on him in all the ways of his Appointment. Let none be careleſs and ſecure. For <hi>how ſhall you eſcape,</hi> if you neglect ſo great Salvation? And why <hi>ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi> Are you brought to the very Gate of Heaven, and will you refuſe to enter in? You are now not far from the Kingdom perhaps: and will you ſhut your ſelf out by a reſolv'd Impenitence! Will you bid Defiance to a gracious Redeemer, and do Deſpite to the Holy Spirit; and will you be falſe to that God whoſe you are, &amp; whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to Serve! Will you gratify the Devil, and do more againſt your ſelf, than all your ſpiritual Enemies could do againſt you! Are you loſt to all Senſe of the natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Self-preſervation! Shall you not one day regret your Folly! How will you bear to ſee others in Glory, who lived under the ſame Means with you, and your ſelf excluded! Will it not occaſion very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cutting Reflections in your guilty Breaſt!

            <p>O let theſe Reflections ſink down into our Hearts, and make us to be looking diligently left we ſail of the Grace of God.</p>

All the pretended Grounds of Delay are abſurd, and will not bear a Teſt.

If we put off this great Concern, we ſhall ſooner or later bitterly repent our Delays: but if we haſten our Flight to Chriſt, this will be no Grief of Heart to us, but matter of joyful Reflection. Yea, there is Joy in <hi>Heaven</hi> over one Sinner that repenteth.</p>
            <p>USE. 4. If Goſpel-Impenitents are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, who periſh in their own Iniquity; <hi>how much more ſuch Sinners as are voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inſtrumental to the Sin &amp; Ruin of others!</hi>

            <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, Rom. 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the judgment of God (that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death) not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> They intice others to ſin with them, they rejoyce in Iniquity, and take pains to promote it. They act the part of Factors for Hell, and even glory in their Shame. Surely ſuch are very Devils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: and muſt needs be of all Men the moſt inexcuſable. The Guilt of other men's Sins will fall heavy upon their heads; &amp; this added to the weight of their own Sins, muſt needs ſink them deep into Hell. Verily the hotteſt abode in everlaſting Burnings is due to theſe execrable Wretches.</p>

            <p>If <hi>Paul,</hi> who obtained Mercy, when he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ignorantly in Unbelief, found Occaſion to ſay, <hi>The Grace of our Lord was exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> toward him; how much more do's the ſame Grace abound, when ſuch as under the Goſpel have ſinned wilfully after they had receiv'd the Knowledge of the Truth, do come notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be Partakers of the Benefit! Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſee ſurpriſing Inſtances of Converſion in ſuch as have long rejected the Calls of the Goſpel, and run great Lengths in Vice &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs. God has met them in ſome affecting Word, or awakning Providence; &amp; made them willing in the day of his Power.— Tho' they have been guilty of very aggravated Rebellion, and inexculable Obſtinacy: Yet the God of all Patience would ſtill purſue them with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and not leave them until he had bro't them on to a thorow Converſion. When he might have glorify'd his Juſtice, &amp; made them the flaming Trophies of his eternal Vengeance; He yet magnify'd his Grace, and made them the bright Monuments of his ſaving Mercy. How ſhould ſuch admire and triumph in the Riches of free Grace! They ſhould with grateful Souls ever celebrate the Kindneſs &amp; Love of God their Saviour toward them in ſuch Language as that, Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
