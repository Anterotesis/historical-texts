            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCES, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>REEDOM of trade, or unreſtrain'd liberty of the ſubject to hold or diſpoſe of his property as he pleaſes, is abſolutely neceſſary to the proſperty of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and to the happineſs of all individuals who compoſe it; this liberty will produce the following effects:</p>
            <p>FIRST. Every induſtrious man will procure all the goods he can for ſale; this is the way to get moſt money; and gain is the ſoul of induſtry, the hope of reward ſweetens labour, and the moſt righteous have reſpect to the recompence of reward.</p>
            <p>SECOND. Everyman will make his goods for market of the beſt quality he can, becauſe they will bring more money and quicker ſale than goods of mean quality.</p>
            <p>THIRD. Every man will endeavour to carry to market the moſt ſcarce goods, becauſe there is the greateſt demand and beſt price for them. All experience ſhews, that the moſt effectual way to turn a ſcarcity into a plenty, is to raiſe the price of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles waited: Witneſs, among other inſtances, the moſt alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarcity of ſaltpetre and gunpowder, in the beginning of the preſent war, ſucceeded by the moſt abundant plenty in leſs than one year, effected altogether by the high price and premiums ſet on them.</p>
            <p>FOURTH. Every men will go to market and return in good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and full ſatisfaction, even tho' he may be diſappointed of the high price he expected, becauſe he has had the full chance of the market, and can blame nobody; and ſhould be indulge fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016670_0004_0F9D769EEBAF0B60"/>
on the occaſion, he would be the more ridiculed, and leſs pitied by his neighbours: And good humour and ſatisfaction contribute not a little to the happineſs and proſperity of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as well as individuals, and therefore this is an article by no means to be left out or overlooked in the adminiſtration of either public or private oeconomy.</p>
            <p>FIFTH. In times of danger, diſtreſs, and difficulty, every man will uſe ſtrong endeavours to get his goods to market, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the neceſſity and great demand for them; becauſe they will then bring the beſt price, and every man is fond of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing golden opportunities and favourable chances.</p>
            <p>SIXTH. When things grow ſcarce and dear, every man will uſe them with the beſt oeconomy, and make the ſtock on hand go as far and laſt as, long as poſſible; or if he is deſtitute, will buy as little as will juſt ſerve his neceſſity. This naturally preſerves the ſtock on hand from needleſs profuſion and waſte, and converts it to the beſt and moſt prudent uſe for the benefit of the community, and naturally tends to ward off high diſreſs or total want, till the high price and great demand, by their natural operation, will bring further ſupplies to market.</p>
            <p>SEVENTH. In times of ſcarcity, every man will have ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to bring all he can ſpare to market, becauſe it will then bring the higheſt price he can even expect, and conſequently the community will have the benefit of all that exiſts among them, in a much ſafer manner than any degree of force could extort it, and all to the intire ſatisfaction of buyer and ſeller, by which the numberleſs feuds, riots, reſentment, and miſchiefs which uſsually attend forced markets, would be intirely avoided; and the market be ſupplied with all there is to be had. For no principle can draw into market, all the ſupplies which are attainable, ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, as the chearful good-will and intereſt of the owners.</p>
            <p>EIGHT. In times ſcarcity. When all the goods that are to be had, are expoſed to ſale, its not poſſible the prices ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the degree of ſcarcity, for when the prices riſe very high, they will ſoon determine whether the ſcarcity is real or not; for if not real, the high price will bring ſuch quantity to market as will ſoon lower the price; but if real, 'tis neceſſary for the above rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that the prices ſhould continue high 'till ſupplies are produced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:016670_0005_0F9D769FAF46E7C0"/>RESTRAINT of property or limitation of prices will hurt any community, and will probably produce the following effects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the above.</p>
            <p>FIRST. Every man will have as little to do with the market, and bring as few goods there as he can; for the leſs goods he has for ſale, the leſs mortification and loſs he ſuſtains.</p>
            <p>SECOND. Every man will make his goods for market of a bad quality, or at leaſt not the beſt; for they muſt all go at the limited price, and he therefore gets nothing for any ſpecial care or ſkill, he may beſtow on his goods to meliorate or perfect their quality; for the ſame reaſon, every man will expoſe his worſt goods to market, and keep the beſt out of ſight, for example, muſty Tea, ſtale Flour, black heavy Bread, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THIRD. Every man is induced to keep ſuch goods as are moſt ſcarce from market; for if he carries them there, he can get no more than the limited price, and ſtands a chance of a bad huſtling in the croud into the bargain. Whereas, if he can keep his goods from market, the ſcarcity will ſoon force a great price, and he has a chance of great profits.</p>
            <p>FOURTH. If prices are limited, and the owner is compelled to ſell at the prices limited; he conſiders himſelf injured by every ſale he makes for leſs than he ſuppoſes he could have obtained in a free market, that his liberty is taken from him, and he can no longer call his property his own. Theſe are hard feelings to one born to freedom almoſt perfect, and raiſed to the expectations of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in future time, in its higheſt perfection. Theſe feelings fill the mind with anxiety and reſentment, and when inſtances of this become numerous among the merchants, tradeſmen and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, ſmall accidents may blow up the concealed coal, and moſt fetal effects may eaſily be ſuppoſed to enſue. This is a danger of no ſmall magnitude, for the real ſtrength and eſtabliſhment of every government conſiſts in the hearty union and ſatisfaction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals that compoſe it.</p>
            <p>FIFTH. In times of danger, diſtreſs, and difficulty; no man will be induced to any great efforts, to ſupply the market, for an additional danger makes an additional expence upon the goods;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016670_0006_0F9D76A06617F7E8"/>
but he muſt take the limited price and no more; he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently combat and riſk an increaſe of danger and expence without any chance of compenſation.</p>
            <p>SIXTH. When things grow ſcarce, every man will endeavour to lay in great ſtores, if he can do it, without an increaſe of price, and will not think it neceſſary to retrench his expences, whilſt he thinks his ſtock will laſt through the ſcarcity ; the conſequence of which is, that all the ſcarce articles at market will be ſcrambled up by a few hands, who will have no inducement to parſimony in the expenditure of them, by which the ſcarcity and diſtreſs is increaſed, and many muſt be wholly deſtitute; and as far as this reſpects the neceſſaries of life, the conſequences muſt be dreadful.</p>
            <p>EIGHTH. Add to the above, that in times of ſcarcity and great demand, every man who can poſſibly conceal his goods will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do it, in expectation that the great demand will ſoon break through the unnatural reſtraint of the limitation, and he ſhall be able to obtain a great profit in the future ſale; and in ſpight of all the vigilance and force that can be uſed, many will be able to do this, which I take to be one of the natural effects of any unnatural reſtraint of trade, which cannot be avoided.</p>
            <p>NINTH. Add to all theſe the difficulties which muſt attend the execution of ſuch an act of limitation, may perhaps furniſh not the leaſt objection to it. Muſt the owner be obliged to ſell to every perſorn who applies to purchaſe, without knowing whether he wants for uſe or ſale? Muſt he forgo previous engagements of his goods in favour of the preſent demandant? Muſt he be obliged so ſell to every knave and litigious fellow, with whom he would not chuſe to be at all concern'd in any dealing? Who ſhall judge how much he may reſerve for his own uſe, and whether he may give corn to his cattle and hogs, and how much and how many of each he may keep, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Muſt he have his houſe ſearched from top to bottom for concealments? Even the lodging-rooms of his wife and daughters! I muſt beg to be excuſed from any further deſcription of theſe horrors, which too many know are not mero creatures of the imagination.</p>
            <p>TENTH. It is not poſſible to form a limitation of prices which ſhall be juſt, and therefore the whole ſcheme neceſſarily implies injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016670_0007_0F9D76A136B27CB8"/>
The principles on which the juſt prices of goods are fixed, are in a conſtant ſtate of fluctuation, and therefore the prices muſt riſe and fall with their cauſes; all experience proves this, and it holds true in the moſt exceſſive degree, in times of ſuch public diſtreſs and convulſion as we now experience. And as it is much ſafer to bind a man in health than a man in convulſions, ſo it will be ſafer to limit trade in peaceable than convulſed times. 'Tis not more abſurd to limit the preciſe height, to which a ſhip ſhall be fixed at a whalf, where the tide is conſtantly ebbing and flowing. A great force will be requiſite to keep the ſhip from riſing or falling with the tide, and a mighty little uſe to pay for the trouble; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the probability of very eſſential damage which the ſhip muſt incur by the application of the neceſſary force; but indiſcreet as this would be judged, it is leſs dangerous in a calm than in a ſtormy ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>ELEVENTH. Another miſchevious conſequence of this fatal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and not the leaſt I conceive to be its unhappy tendency to corrupt the morals and integrity of the people. To eſcape the ruinous conſequences of looſing all, they are in a manner compelled; but to ſay the leaſt, they have very ſtrong temptation to avoid them, either by downright lying, or uſing little arts, ſhifts, and cheats, to avoid the ſale of their goods to diſadvantage, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally brings them into the habit, and gives them a facility of inventing and practiſing low methods of ſhamming Abraham, which they never would otherwiſe have thought of, and which 'tis infinitely detrimental to the public, they ever ſhould learn; inſtances of this ſort might be enumerated without end. But 'tis needleſs to give examples, 'twere better they and their cauſes ſhould be removed, than that they ſhould be repeated. But after all, 'tis ſaid that a limitation of prices is neceſſary to appreciate the currency and ſupply the army. Two very great objects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: I will attend to both.</p>
            <p>FIRST. I don't conceive that a limitation of prices can poſſibly appreciate the currency or prevent a further depreciation.</p>
            <p>FIRST. The value of money is nothing in itſelf, 'tis a mere rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tis the proportion between the medium of trade and the objects of trade; theſe two will always be in baliance: Therefore, if the medium of trade be increaſed, whilſt the objects of trade continue the ſame, the money muſt depreciate; if the medium
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016670_0008_0F9D76A1E2DDFEB0"/>
of trade increaſe, and the objects of trade decreaſe, the proportion will alter faſt, and the depreciation will increaſe in a double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which I take to be the caſe at preſent. Money will therefore increaſe or decreaſe its value according to the increaſe or decreaſe of its quantity, and the increaſe or decreaſe of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of goods, or the objects of trade. This principle is grounded on the nature of the thing and can never be altered, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently any attempt to oppoſe it muſt be equally vain, as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any other law of nature whatever: It follows from this, that nothing can ever appreciate the money but leſſening its quantity, or increaſing the quantity of goods or objects of trade, and all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to do this in any other method, will prove vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the end.</p>
            <p>SECOND. It follows, that the price that any article of trade will bring in a free open market, is the only meaſure of the value of that article at that time, and if this is warped from the truth, by any artifices of the merchant or force of power, it cannot hold; but the error will ſoon diſcover itſelf, and the correction of it will be compelled by the irreſiſtable force of natural principles, i.e. 'tis not poſſible for merchants to raiſe goods too high, or the force of power to depreſs them too low, and make them keep ſo. Both theſe may be done for a ſhort time, but neither can laſt long.</p>
            <p>THIRD. It follows that any limitation of prices, however ſtrongly inforced, if below the rates required by this great natural proportion, is but temporary injuſtice, can't be of long continuance, will tend daily to leſſen the quantity of goods in market, and ſo will increaſe the miſchief it was deſigned to prevent, and bring with it a large train of evils beſides, which will require much time and wiſdom to remedy, and many that will be utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs, examples of which are obvious.</p>
            <p>FOURTH. Money is made only for a medium of trade, and muſt be kept in circulation and uſe or it periſhes; for to ſtop the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of money and to kill it is the ſame thing, ſtop its courſe and it dies, give it circulation again and it revives, or comes to life again; therefore, the price of goods for ſale, or objects of trade (i.e, every thing for which money is paid) muſt always be ſo high, as to require all the money there is to purchaſe them,

otherwiſe the ſum remaining can't circulate, i.e. there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay it out upon, and ſo the owner muſt keep it by him, dead and uſeleſs, ſo that let what ſums of money ſoever be in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the objects of trade muſt either increaſe in quantity, or riſe in price ſo high as to take all the money there is in circulation to purchaſe them, and as this natural law can't be reſtrained, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be exceeded by any degree of artifice or force for any long time, for if the objects of trade riſe ſo high that all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in circulation will not purchaſe them, the overplus muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main dead and unſaleable in the hands of the owner, which will ſoon reduce the price; for goods which can't be ſold, are as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the hands of the merchant, as money which can't be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated.</p>
            <p>FIFTH. Every limitation of prices below the due proportion, checks the
Circulation of money, than which nothing can be more dangerous, when money is over plenty; his has been the conſtant effect of every limitation of prices which has been uſed in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Buſineſs immediately ſtagnates, goods can't be had, people can't purchaſe with their money the neceſſaries they want, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of courſe to think that their money is good for nothing, and refuſe to take any more of it, and grow willing to part with what they have on hand at a depreciated value, ſo that the certain ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a limitation of prices is a further depreciation of the money inſtead of the contrary. Inſtead of this, 'tis of the laſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in a plenty of money, that a free circulation be kept up, people will readily and even greedily take any money which they can readily paſs again. And as long as this laſts, there can be no danger of the money's ſtopping; whereas, the contrary chills it at once, and in a ſhort time muſt chill it into a Torpor, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of cure. Much in this caſe depends on opinion, which is ſoon formed by people in general, when they find they can't buy neceſſaries with their money. Specious reaſonings, warm har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, declarations of Congreſs, or even the force of power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate little againſt this; 'tis a glaring intuitive proof of the badneſs of money, when it will not purchaſe neceſſaries, and as glaring and ſtrong a proof that 'tis good, when it will buy any thing in market. Hence appears the neceſſity of keeping up a high and briſk circulation of money, and the folly and danger of limitations, or any other meaſures which prevent a circulation and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016670_0010_0F9D76A855FACCF0"/>
obſtruct trade: Theſe are arguments grounded on plain fact, they have their foundation in the laws of nature, and no artifice or force of man can prevent, elude, or avoid their effects; their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is uncontrolable, and therefore I conceive all oppostion to them is the height of abſurdity, and dangerous in the higheſt degree.—For ten months before the late limitations, we had a trade perfectly free, on which two obſervations are obvious.</p>
            <p>FIRST. That any goods at market might be bought for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental money, the Speculators eſpecially (as they are called) were fond of receiving it, and no perſon could be at any loſs for any thing at market, if he had that money to purchaſe the goods he needed.</p>
            <p>SECOND. That imported goods on an average (which were the only articles Speculators dealt in) were 50 percent. cheaper on the 25th of May laſt, than on the 25th of of July preceding, i.e. any given quantity of imported goods would buy 50 per cent more articles of country produce or hard money, on the 25th of July, than on the 25th of May laſt; and for the truth of this, I refer to the merchants books, from which it follows that the Speculators (however numerous and however cenſured) have not raiſed the price of the goods they have principally dealt in:—Indeed all experience teaches, that the more hands the goods in market are held by, the cheaper they will be, and the more difficult to raiſe the price; and therefore, if the merchants ever think of raiſing the price of any article, they never fail to ſay, We muſt wait till theſe goods are drained out of the ſmall ſtores and get them into few hands. In July 25, 1778, price current of imported goods, at Philadelphia, was as follows, Weſt-India rum 3l. 15s. Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado ſugars 30l. molaſſes 40s. pepper 17s.6d. coffee 9s. cotton 15s. bohea tea 60s. Madeira wine 400l. dry goods about 8 to 1 old prices, and hard money 4 to 1, and price current of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try produce, was as follows, for Indian corn 15l. oats 12s. flour 60s, bar iron 200l. conſequently on July 25, 1778, one gallon Weſt-India rum would bring 5 buſhels of Indian corn, 6 buſhels of oats, 1 ¼ hundred flour, and ⅖ of a <hi>hundred of iron,</hi> or 18s. 9d. hard money, any body may eaſily compare the reſt, and they will find enough to prove my aſſertion with large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Price current 25th May laſt was, rum 7l. ſugars 130l. iron
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016670_0011_0F9D76A962E43488"/>
800l. tea 6l. 10s. &amp;c. Indian corn 7l. 10s. oats 90s. flour 30'. (hard money 20 to 1) and conſequently one gallon of rum would buy no more than one buſhel Indian corn, 1½ buſhel of oats, 4 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred flour, and ⅖ hundred iron or 7s. hard money, &amp;c. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations are made in the face of the world, and grounded on facts which any body may diſapprove, if they are not true, or correct the reaſoning, if it is not juſt. Now I have only to add; let any body who is diſpoſed to ſee, open their eyes, and ſee who it is that has raiſed our prices, or, <hi>which is the ſame thing,</hi> depreciated our money. Is it the Speculators who deal only in imported arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? Or the farmers, among whom no kind of dangerous ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations does or can exiſt; perhaps it may be replied here, that the articles of country produce are extremely ſcarce, which raiſes their price beyound the due proportion of other things: If you ſay this, you ſay every thing and yield every thing, viz. that the plenty and ſcarcity of goods will govern the price. You muſt admit too, that the plenty and ſcarcity of money will determine the value of that alſo. Why then will any one pretend to limit either, againſt the operation of this great principle. Tis eaſy in addition to all theſe to prove, that the price of imported articles in general does not exceed the value of them, if computed on the expence of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement: But this I mean only to hint, and wave it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and only wiſh ſome merchants of experience and reputation would take it up, and publiſh the needful eſſay on it.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think that the ſcheme of loans can give eſtabliſhment to the currency, or prevent its depreciation.—For</p>
            <p>FIRST. All loans increaſe the public debt, and the immenſity of the ſum is one cauſe of the depreciation, as it induces people to think it never will be paid, or the payment will neceſſarily be delayed to ſuch a diſtant period, as in point of uſe to the preſent poſſeſſor, <hi>is nearly</hi> equal to total failure.</p>
            <p>SECOND, If the credit of the Loan Office is well ſupported (as it muſt be to give it any good effect) the Loan-Office certificates themſelves will paſs in payment, and ſo become an addition to the currency which they are deſign'd to leſſen.</p>
            <p>THIRD. If foreign loans are negociated, and bills ſold here, drawn on the loaned Bank in Europe, thoſe very bills will become a currency here, and ſo add to the miſchief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:016670_0012_0F9D76A970B87538"/>FOURTH. The diſcount on all European bills, is not leſs than 50 per cent, which loſs muſt immediately be ſuſtained by the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, on the firſt ſale of them.</p>
            <p>FIFTH. If hard money, borrowed in Europe, ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ſold here, the inſurance, which is more than 50 per cent, muſt be left, nor can any man tell the miſchief which would attend any attempt to import hard money, and open offices for the ſale of it for Continental bills; but a large group of theſe preſent themſelves too plainly to need enumeration.</p>
            <p>SIXTH. Nor do I think the ſcheme adopted by our Committee promiſes better ſucceſs for that propoſes. Loaning without induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if it ſhould ſucceed to the utmoſt expectation, it would drain the beſt friends to our cauſe of their money, whilſt our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enemies would pay nothing, for no compulſion is propoſed, and after all. It will be at beſt but an anticipation of the revenue, very dangerous in the end; for the very worſt thing that can be done reſpecting a revenue, is to deſtroy it all, principal and uſe, and the next worſt thing is to anticipate it, i.e. to ſpend this year the rent and proceeds which will become due and payable next year, and theſe two are ſo connected, that the latter generally bring on the former ſooner or later. After all theſe objections to the various methods that have been propoſed, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that I ſhould propoſe ſome method that will be practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and effectual to fix the value of our currency, and this I cannot think very difficult, either in theory or practice, though I have not one new thought to offer the public on the ſubject. We are now on the brink of ruin, and the worſt diſgrace, in danger of loſs of liberty hitherto nobly aſſerted, and ſubjection to ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſlavery, to enemies moſt cruel and inſulting in themſelves, and all that hightened in them to madneſs by the determined op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we have given to their ſcheme of tyranny over us. All this danger ariſes not from our poverty or want, we have offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ſoldiers enough, ſtores of every kind enough, and zeal, union, and virtue ſufficient to inſure ſucceſs; our difficulties ariſes only from our having too much money, and the leſſening that quantity, would relieve us at once from every difficulty, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate the thickeſt clouds that hang over us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016670_0013_0F9D76AAEF053B40"/>IN matters of difficulty and importance, all wiſe counſellors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare well the end and the means, on which two very weighty matters always preſent themſelves.</p>
            <p>FIRST. Whether the means are ſuffcient to ſecure and effect the end propoſed.—And</p>
            <p>SECOND. Whether the end is worth the means neceſſary to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. When theſe two points are ſettled, there remains no more room for conſultation or debate, the reſt is all vigorous action, ſtrenuous exertion to put the means into ſuch effectual exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as to obtain the end. This is a wiſe method of planning, which no man will have any objection to. We will then adopt it in the conſideration of the weighty ſubjct now in view.</p>
            <p>FIRST. The end is fixing our currency and preventing any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depreciation, putting an effectual end to all the cheats, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, diſappointments, and ruinous loſſes, which every one who has been concerned in it have hither to felt, and giving every one a ſure and well grounded confidence in it in future. This is an end, an object of ſuch vaſt, ſuch weighty conſequence, and ſo conſſeſſed and acknowledged by all, that no arguments or illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are neceſſary to be added here.</p>
            <p>SECOND. The only means I conceive poſſible to obtain this end, are to call in ſuch ſums annually by taxes, as ſhall be equal to the annual expenditures, this will prevent the increaſe of the money, will make a great demand for it though the Thirteen United States, will give it a briſk circulation, will exhibit a moſt convincing proof that it may be all called in and redeemed, and that it is the real deſign of Congreſs to do this. Nothing helps the credit of a large debtor like making ample proviſion for actual payments; he may promiſes till he is gray without this, and all in vain, the larger his promiſes the leſs are they credited, and the more ridiculous does he become: The cry againſt him is, Where is the money to come from? Let us ſee a ſample of it? but theory is altered when large payments are actually made, and ſufficient proviſion making for the diſcharge of the whole debt. Let people ſee the money collecting through the Continent, and the ſources of revenue actually opened, and the whole matter in train, there can then remain no doubt but the whole of the Continental money will be redeemed,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016670_0014_0F9D76ABA7D78A08"/>
and every one will venture to truſt the credit of it, and in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence it will be ſoon ſought after and graſped with greedineſs, and hugg'd and hoarded with avidity. This will put life into all our public meaſures, civil and military, will give our government the command of the fulleſt ſupplies of men, money, and ſtores that are in the country, and that can be made or procured, will give ſpirit to our people, will annimate induſtry, and will be a total cure of the miſchiefs we now feel from the low credit of our currency. Here is an object highly worthy of our attention, as every one will admit without heſitation; the only thing then that remains, is whether it be practicable; I ſuppoſe the outcry againſt it will be, that the people will not bear ſuch enormous taxes, that they would ſink the poor and diſtreſs the rich far beyond what they will ever conſent to bear, &amp;c. &amp;c. I conceive a vein of converſation of this ſort not at all founded in truth, for ſeveral reaſons.</p>
            <p>FIRST. 'Tis rare that the people refuſe burdens or ever grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under them, when by general conviction, they are neceſſary for the public good. And I dare ſay, that the abſolute neceſſity of fixing and eſtabliſhing our currency is become obvious to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every individual on this Continent, and the real necceſſity of taxes for this purpoſe clearly ſeen by all.</p>
            <p>SECOND. As far as my acquaintance with people of middling rank extends, they have been generally in favour of taxing for three years paſt; they ſay this money muſt be paid firſt or laſt, and we can better pay it now whilſt we have little uſe for our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whilſt it is plenty and eaſy to be got, than in future time, when we can perhaps not ſo well ſpare it, and when the getting it will be much more difficult.</p>
            <p>THIRD. The enormity of the ſum required for this purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts much more in ſound than ſubſtance; a quarterly tax of one buſhel of wheat, or two buſhels of Indian corn per head, on all perſons in the Thirteen States, would be amply ſufficient. The number of ſouls are computed at 3,000,000, in all the States, at leaſt, this would produce 12,000,000 buſhels wheat, which at 20 dollars per buſhel, (the loweſt preſent price) will be 240,000,000 of dollars, a ſum greatly exceeding any annual exigence of theſe States; each State might apportion this as they pleaſed, ſo as to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016670_0015_0F9D76AC6D870398"/>
relieve the poor, and increaſe the ſhare of the rich, but the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling farmer who has ten in family, would have 40 buſhels of wheat or its value, to pay in a year. I admit this would be a high tax; but is there any thing impoſſible, or ruinous in this. In the beſt of times, it would have been 40 dollars, or 15l. and the ſame ſum of hard money will probably now pay it, 'tis to be obſerved this is not the tax of a post man or a new beginner, but of a middling farmer, with ten in family; ſuch are ſpread over the face of this fetile country, and few of them ſo poor, that ſuch a ſum would diſtreſs them to any great degree. 'Tis to be obſerved further this is not a tax to laſt always, but to be paid only for a ſhort time, during our ſtrong exertions, for the liberty of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our poſterity; again, this ſum is not all to be paid at once, but at four quarterly payments; again, this is not a tax which demands wheat in kind, hard money, or any thing elſe that is ſcarce and hard to be obtained, but for continental money, which is fo plenty ſo to become the great burden of the country, and the ſource of moſt of our public calamities, and which any valuable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity will procure in plenty, and with little trouble; and for which any man may ſell any thing he can beſt ſpare without difficulty; again, this is a fare method to overcome our capital difficulties and fix the currency. Whereas all others are precarious and uncertain in their effect. This is a durable, a finiſhed remedy; all others that have been propoſed are at beſt but temporary, and ſhould they ſucceed, would involve us and our poſterity in great difficulties. Involve us in a vaſt debt, which would lie ſo heavy on the country as would greatly check our future proſperity and diſcourage foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from coming to ſattle with us. For no body likes to move into a country when taxes are very high and burdenſome. I ſubmit it to every man, whether it will not be much eaſier for us by a ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exertion, for a ſhort time, to collect large ſums of our preſent currency, and pay our expences as faſt as they ariſe, than if a foreign loan could be obtained, to pay a vaſt debt of hard money with intereſt to foreigners in future time, when every dollar we pay, muſt go out of the country never to return again. Every man ought to conſider that this proportion of the public debt, is as much a debt faſtened on his eſtate and become to all intents and purpoſes as much a burden and charge on it as any of his private debts the ſame amount, and muſt as ſurely one day be paid; is it not better then to pay it now than to have it lye a burthen on him, to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016670_0016_0F9D76AE985E76E0"/>
be paid in future time, which may be called for at ſome future time when he may not be in condition to pay it ſo eaſy as now. Every prudent man does this with reſpect to his private debts, and what reaſon can be given why the ſame prudence ſhould not extend to the debt, which he owes the public. Can any reaſon be aſſigned why the States ſhould not imitate the prudence and oeconomy of a private man who happens to be involved for a time in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures, which is to pay up and diſcharge as much as poſſible as he goes, and leave as little as poſſible to be ſettled in future time. And to facilitate this, I humbly propoſe one thing more, viz. To take off every reſtraint and limitation from our commerce. Let trade be as free as air. Let every man make the moſt of his goods and in his own way, and then he will be ſatisfied. Let every man taſte and enjoy the ſweets of that liberty of perſon and property, which was highly expected under an independent government. 'Tis a ſad omen to find among the firſt efforts of independence, greater reſtraints and abridgements of natural liberty than ever we felt under the government we have lately renounced and ſhaken off. Let the laws point out the duty, and be the bulwark of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of every man. Nothing gives the people ſuch high ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, with any ſyſtem of government they live under, as the actual enjoyment of the eneſtimable bleſſings of perfect liberty and full ſecurity under it, this will moſt effectually induce them chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſupport it. No burdens will be thought heavy, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties diſcouraging, which the exigencies of government may require, when every man finds his own happineſs involved in the eſtabliſhment of the State; if on the freedom of trade, any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſhould riſe in their price, the miſchief facilitates its own remedy. It makes the payment of the taxes more eaſy and tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. Whereas, if the taxes were collected during the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the market and ſtagnation of buſineſs, the payment would be extremly difficult, and the murmers high and reaſonable; it would be almoſt like the Egyptians demanding brick without ſtraw. But when the circulation of money is briſk, and the price and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for goods high, every one knows that money may be raiſed and taxes may be paid much more eaſily than in dull times of ſtagnated buſineſs. And this ought to be noticed on another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. 'Tis neceſſary our firſt taxes ſhould be rendered as eaſy as poſſible to the people; for though high in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſum, if they had them eaſily paid, the terror and uneaſi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

generally raiſe, will moſtly vaniſh, and the payment will be made without endangering the peace of the State, and theſe things all conſidered together naturally lead is to the free anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond great queſtion to be ſolved.</p>
            <p>SECOND. How is the army to be ſupplied. The method I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if it can be adopted, will undoubtedly fix the currency and create a great demand for money, and a quick circulation of it, this will of courſe open all the ſtores in the State to any purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers that may offer, and a little prudence uſed in purchaſing, may ſupply the army to the full, at reaſonable prices. Indeed I am rather I afraid of overdoing the thing in this way, ſo far as to cauſe an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation of the money, which I don't think ought ever to be done, for I ſee no reaſon why the States ſhould be taxed to raiſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in my pocket to twenty times the value it coſt me, but this is a great argument, and may be the ſubject of future diſcuſſion. I muſt add here that this method will not only fix our currency and ſupport our army, but will afford another advantage of no ſmall moment. It will take away the capital hope and aſſurance of our enemies of conquering us; for they depend more on the failure of our funds than on their own force, for this purpoſe, they count high on the quarrels, contention, oppreſſions and miſchiefs that will ariſe from the low ſinking credit of our money: and by this are encouraged to continue the war, which they would relinquiſh as deſperate without it.</p>
            <p>I WILL juſt note here, that however intolerable the means I propoſe may appear at firſt fight, I can't think them impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the tax I propoſe is not more than two thirds of the annual taxes in Great-Britain, the whole revenue raiſed every year there, is about 12,500,000 ſterling, which is ſomewhat more than 58,000,000 dollars, reckoning them at Four Shillings and Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a piece; divide this by the number of fouls in Great-Britain, which are computed at 9,000,000, and we have the ſum of ſomewhat more than 6 dollars per head on each of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, or living perſons there; but, be this as it may, to balance the argument fairly, I think it ſtands thus: On the one ſide certain deſtruction, and on the other a tax ſo heavy, that a middling farmer's ſhare will be 40 buſhels of wheat, 40 dollars hard money, or the value of it in any thing he chaſes to fell, ti
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016670_0018_0F9D76B1DD301F48"/>
be paid annually, in four quarterly payments. This, if it can be done, will undoubtedly ſave us, reſtore our finances thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fix our currency, and fſpply our army; without this, I don't ſee how theſe great objects can be effected. If any other method can be deviſed, 'tis more than all the united wiſdom of America has yet been able to find and accompliſh, nor do I conceive we have any long time to heſitate, ſomething ſpeedy and deciſive muſt avert our fate.</p>
            <p>THUS I have offered my beſt thoughts freely to the public, and with moſt upright intentions, I hope they may be received with candour. The facts and reaſonings are all open to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every one, if they do not convince, I hope at leaſt they may induce ſome abler perſon to ſketch out ſomething more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and adequate to the great ſubject.</p>
