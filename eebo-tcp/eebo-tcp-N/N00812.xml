            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We have little hopes of convicting any, who are ſo full fraught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enome of that Book, as that no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will avail, but in ſpite of all that is hitherto known, will ſtill retain a Belief to the contrary: yet this we hope, that thoſe who are not ſuch grand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Truth, may hereby be ſatisfyed in thoſe things which they have hitherto but doubted of; for want of which knowledge, they have been unable to defend thoſe Faithful Servants of Chriſt. That is the End of this Book; That thoſe who are well wiſhers to the Eminent Servants of Chriſt, and His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may be able to oppoſe all gainſayers, who by their Reproaches, and Slanders, go about to render them Odious to the world; whereby they will be deprived of all their deſired Opportunities to Serve God &amp; his Faithful People. If this ſhall help any therein, we

ſhall obtain our deſires, and have no cauſe to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that ever we ſpent our Time and Coſt about it; But Rejoyce that ever we undertook this Task. Now that there may be no more Slandering and Reviling, and Reproaching one another, but that we may be all bound in the Bands of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Song of the Glorious Angels above; <hi>Glory to God in the Higheſt, on Earth Peace, Good Will towards men:</hi> Is the hearty Deſire and Prayer of thoſe, who in the Name, at the Deſire, and with the Conſent, of many others, have put this Book into your Hands.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>NEW-ENGLAND</hi> was once a plaee, in which the Feet of them that brought the Good Tidings of the Goſpel were beautiful. But there is now ſprung up a Number, who ſeem to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of another Spirit: No wonder then if thoſe who are Faithful to Chriſt and His Intereſt, are Reproached and Maligned by them that ſerve His greateſt Enemy. It is an awful Symptom, of ſome ſad thing near unto <hi>The Churches,</hi> when the moſt Faithful, and Painful I abourers among us <hi>in them,</hi> are bemired and beſpattered by Ungodly men. But that God who ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men Revile you, and Perſecute you, and ſpeak all manner of Evil of you, falſely for my ſake</hi>; will reward them.</p>
            <p>There is according to our eſteem of it, a Libellous Book lately come unto this Countrey, which Book may truely be called, <hi>A Fire-brand thrown by a Mad-man</hi>; which is writ (with what help we know not) by one <hi>Robert Calef,</hi> who preſumes to call himſelf <hi>Merchant of Boſton</hi>; but we wiſh, <hi>Better</hi> Wares were vended, by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000975_0005_0FAE8C6C2B4D1158"/>
this <hi>Merchant.</hi> The Book is full as is thought by Good men, of Scurrilous Reflections on the <hi>Government,</hi> as well as the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, for the <hi>Government</hi>; the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Book is to perſwade the People, that the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Land; are the Unjuſteſt, Cruelleſt and moſt Blood-thirſty men; <hi>Our Wiſe men</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>becoming Fools.</hi> What was done by them in the dark time of our Troubles from the <hi>Inviſible World,</hi> all Honeſt men believe, they did in Conſcience of the <hi>Oath</hi> of God upon them, and they followed unto the beſt of their Underſtanding, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Precedents of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>other Nations,</hi> on ſuch a Dark and Doleful occaſion. When they found the matter carried beyond the reach of <hi>Mortals,</hi> they ſtopt; and the Honourable Lieutenant Governour, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Aſſembly of the Province, in a Publick Proclamation for a <hi>Faſt</hi>; called for the Prayers of the Countrey, <hi>That whatſoever miſtakes on either hand have been fallen into, referring to the late Troubles raiſed among us by</hi> Satan, <hi>and his Instruments, through the awful Judgments of God, he would Humble us therefore, and Pardon us.</hi> After that thoſe our Honourable Judges (fearing leaſt wrong ſteps might have been taken) had thus ſet apart a <hi>Day</hi> for ſolemn Humiliation before the Lord, humbly Implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000975_0006_0FAE8C6F8EE52410"/>
His Pardon for what might have been done amiſs; for him to <hi>Repeat that matter,</hi> and ſet it out with imperfect Relations and odious Aggravations, thereby intending to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Land, and the Judges obnoxious (tho' all the Learning that he and wiſer men than he, pretends unto, is inſufficient to dive to the Bottom of the matter;) and for him to ſpeak as he does of thoſe Honourable Perſons, (as you will find in his praeface,) <hi>as men obſtinate in an Error, and involved in the guilt of the Blood ſhed by Pagans and Papiſts before them:</hi> what ſhall we think of it, but that 'tis inhumane, and fit for none but a <hi>Servant</hi> of the worſt Maſter? One would have thought, that the <hi>Fear of God</hi> (if he has any) ſhould have darted that Scripture into his mind, (while compiling ſuch a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet) Exod. 22.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak Evil of the Ruler of thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, for the <hi>Miniſtry</hi>; we do admire with what face he dares ſo wilfully to Reproach, and Libel the Servants of Chriſt? How dares he affirm (as p. the laſt, of his preface) <hi>That the Accuſations from the Spectral ſight, being the chief Evidence againſt thoſe that Suffered, were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held both by Magiſtrates and Miniſters, ſo long as they apprehended themſelves in no danger; and then, though they could Defend neither the Doctrine for the Practice, yet none of them have in ſuch a Publick manner, as the Caſe requires Testified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000975_0007_0FAE8C706F9A4B68"/>
either.</hi> 'Tis well known by thoſe who have ever read over the <hi>Wonders of the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World, Enchantments Encountred,</hi> p. 6. that the Judgment of the Miniſters was, <hi>That the Daemons might impoſe the Shapes of Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their Spectral Exhibitions.</hi> And it was the advice of the Elders to the Governour and Council, in the beginning of the <hi>Salem</hi> Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Expreſt in ſuch words as thoſe, <hi>Ench. Enc.</hi> p. 15. <hi>That Preſumptions whereupon perſons may be Committed, and much more Convictions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon perſons may be Condemned as guilty of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, ought certainly to be more Conſiderable, than barely the Accuſed perſons being Repreſented by a Spectre, unto the afflicted, nor are alterations in the ſufferers by a Look, or a Touch of the Accuſed, to be eſteemed an Infallible evidence of Guilt, but frequently liable to be abuſed by the Devils Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demains.</hi> And a Book Compoſed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Praeſident of the Colledge, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Publiſhed for that purpoſe, whereunto, Fourteen Reverend Miniſters ſet their hands. But this is not all, for the whole Body of the Miniſters in the Countrey are charged, as <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sacriledge in the higheſt Degree, if not Direct Blaſphemy, and Diabolical Wickedneſs.</hi> [p. 155.] Elſewhere he vilely endeavours, to charge them with an Opinion, <hi>That there are more Almighties than one, and that Satan is Almighty, and can do what he pleaſes,</hi> He inſinuates, that our
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000975_0008_0FAE8C71566225F8"/>
Reverend Miniſters make the Devil an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being,</hi> and (as he ſayes) <hi>Conſequently a God.</hi> An abominable Charge! Certainly he was altogether unmindful of that Scripture, Deut. 33.11. <hi>Of Levi, he ſaid, Lord ſmite thro' the Loins of them that riſe up againſt him.</hi> That there ſhould be any in the midſt of us, that by publiſhed Libels go about thus to render the worthy Paſtors of the Flocks of Chriſt odious to them, is matter of Grief unto <hi>us</hi>; and no doubt but 'tis ſo to <hi>all Good men.</hi> It was highly rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, when we heard that our <hi>Book-ſellers</hi> were ſo well acquainted with the Integrity of our Paſtors, as not one of them would admit of any of thoſe <hi>Libels</hi> to be vended in their ſhops. And it was our Hope that a <hi>further Teſtimony</hi> would have been born by others againſt ſuch pernicious attempts to blow up the Religion of God among us. But the doing of a piece of Juſtice to our own Reverend &amp; Faithful Paſtors, whom Satan hath ſingled out (by this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>above others</hi> to ſpit his Venome upon, is that which in a more eſpecial manner has obliged us thus to appaer Publickly.

As he is inſtructed in the School of Heaven, to Miniſter in the affairs of the Soul, ſo he is furniſhed with a Talent to tranſact affairs of State. His proceedings have been with that Caution and Circumſpection, as is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the weight of his Commiſſion; he with Courage, and Conſtancy has purſued the noble ſcope of his employment, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the true moment of things, has preferred the Fablick Good to the vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of ſome, that more might have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained if peremptorily inſiſted on; Conſidering open oppoſition and ſecret arts that have been uſed to fruſtrate the beſt endeavours for the Intereſt of <hi>New-England,</hi> the happy iſſue of theſe things is ſuperiour to our Expectations. Your preſent Charter ſecures Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the faireſt flowers of the Civil State:
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000975_0016_0FAE8C79BA0656F0"/>
and which is incomparably more valuable, it ſecures the enjoyment of the Bleſſed Goſpel in its purity &amp; freedome. Altho' there is a reſtraint of your power in ſome things that were granted in the former Charter, yet there are more ample Priviledges in other things that may be of perpetual advantage to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.</p>
                  <p>We doubt not but your Faithfull Agent will receive a Gracious reward above: And we hope his ſucceſsfull Service will be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with your entire approbation, &amp; grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acceptance. We now with ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections recommend our Dear Brother to the Divine mercy, that thro' ſuch dangerous Seas he may ſafely arrive at his deſired place: And we earneſtly pray, that the Bleſſings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may be alwayes upon your Colony; that by the Light and Power of the Goſpel, the Prince of Darkneſs may be expelled from his ancient Dominions; and the Kingdome of our Saviour, may be Eſtabliſhed &amp; Enlarged, by the Acceſſion of the American Heathen to be His Inheritance.</p>

            <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> in his Negotiation for his Countrey, acted Faithfully according to his judgement, and if the wiſeſt Friends <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had in <hi>England</hi> thought, as he did, (as is abundantly atteſted by perſons of great Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency) why has this Impertinent man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached his Fidelity?</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible that a man ſhould have more and greater Teſtimonies to the Faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Duty in ſeeking the Good of this Countrey, to the utmoſt of his ability? <hi>Robert Calef</hi> dares not ſay here is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Witneſſes. No, but this he does.

perſons as any in the City of <hi>London,</hi> would ſet their Hands to they knew not what, and ſo poſitively aſſert a thing they were ignorant of? However, 'tis altogether Falſe; Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> (as he has affirmed to us never had ſuch a thought come into his mind, nor it may be never would, as to have asked ſuch Teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, had not a perſon of Quality that was his particular Friend, deſired that Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> might draw up ſuch a Letter and that <hi>great Doctor,</hi> (when he had well weighed &amp; conſidered our Charter) moſt readily did it. And the Doctor preſented this Letter thus drawn up by himſelf, to ſuch Miniſters as he thought fit, and <hi>Ten</hi> of them ſubſcribed it, before ever Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> ſpoke a word to them about it.

then managed, but was active in cauſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to be Choſen who Reſided there about a Year, and then went to the Heavenly World.

            <p>Thus hath he anſwered our Requeſt unto him; &amp; now Judge, whether Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> were to blame in theſe matters.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (as we have heard, &amp; no doubt it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And ſince the Condemnation of that <hi>Charter,</hi> has he not laboured with might and main, that the <hi>Judgment</hi> iſſued againſt it might be reverſed?

It may be no man living ever had more people under Preternatural and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing Circumſtances, caſt by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, into his more peculiar care, then I have had; but the <hi>Name</hi> of no one Good perſon in the world, ever came under any <hi>Blemiſh,</hi> that I know of, by means of any <hi>Afflicted</hi> perſon, that fell under my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care; yea, no Man, Woman or Child, ever came into any trouble, for the ſake of any that were <hi>Afflicted,</hi> after I had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look after them.

to paſs, that many people took up another Notion of of me?

In that Account, among abundance of prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things which are Sworn by many Credible men, before the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and other Juſtices of the Peace; 'tis particularly Sworn, That the Young man, or the <hi>Demon</hi> in him, often told <hi>Secret</hi> and <hi>Future</hi> Things which no Mortal could have told, and would ſpeak Languages which the Young man had never Learnt: That the Young man being inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſet upon <hi>Dancing,</hi> the <hi>Demon</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into him, would made him <hi>Dance</hi> on his <hi>Knees</hi> his <hi>Toes</hi> never touching the ground, for a long while together; That the Young man would be ſo heavy, that Six or Seven ſtrong men could not lift him, and preſently again ſo light, that One man with his Hand would lift him Three Quarters of a Yard high, and hold him a long while, and find him no heavier, then his Hat, or his Cane: That ſomething like a <hi>Mouſe</hi> appeared about him, and within him, running up and down under his Cloathes, and the <hi>Imp</hi> ſometimes

like the Bigneſs of a little <hi>Dog</hi> in his Bed; and Voices were heard coming from it. Theſe and many more Aſtoniſhing Things, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for a Year together; and there were Thouſands of <hi>Spectators,</hi> that came from all Quarters to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of thoſe Things. The Non-Conformiſt Miniſters, and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in the Vicinity, (eſpecially Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi>) kept many Dayes of <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Faſting</hi> on this occaſion; the Records whereof, he has Tranſcribed from his Diary into his Printed Hiſtory. After all, the Young man was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; but as he was a very Vicious Fellow before his <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> ſo he was not much mended after his Deliverance. When the Tragedy was over, one <hi>Zachary Taylor,</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Virulent Book, (Juſt like our <hi>Calefs</hi>) which affirmed unto the Nation, That the the whole Buſineſs of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> was a <hi>Cheat,</hi> and a <hi>Sham,</hi> and a Combination of the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> to put a Trick upon the Nation: and Reviled that Reverend man of God, Mr. <hi>Jolly,</hi> as Guilty of much <hi>Falſity,</hi> and <hi>Forgery,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> and as deſigning to <hi>hurt the Cauſe of Revealed Religion,</hi> and as worthy to have his <hi>Tongue bored through with an hot Iron,</hi> and other Infamous paſſages, that can't be Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.
