      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As we acknowledge the being and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God; ſo we receive the doctrine of a univerſal providence—<hi>that the Lord reigneth</hi>—that his providential kingdom ruleth over all—and that he <hi>worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will.</hi>

            <p>IF a ſparrow falls not to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his providence; we may conclude, thoſe more important changes which paſs over men, are under his ordering and direction.</p>
            <p>'TIS the inſtruction of wiſdom, that we ſhould <hi>acknowledge God in all our ways; that our ſteps may be directed by him.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 3. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE right management of the important concerns of this day,—reminds us of our duty in this reſpect.—And a bleſſed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege it is, that we may have acceſs through a Mediator, to that glorious Being who is the fountain of knowledge; and humbly aſk <hi>for;</hi> and believingly expect the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of,—that wiſdom which is profitable to</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012502_0006_0F8A8FDF005A06E0"/>
               <hi>direct—even that wiſdom of the prudent, which is to underſtand his way</hi>—that our public affairs being under divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> direction, may be crowned with deſired ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>IF the ſun of proſperity has been made to ſhine upon us—or the day is become gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and dark—we are to conſider theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, as taking place, under the providential government of the ſupreme Ruler of the world; who <hi>wills many changes for us,</hi> tho' he is himſelf unchangeable.</p>
            <p>IN the words before us, we are taught, that, <hi>The King's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of water</hi>—<hi>He</hi> ſetteth up Kings, who formed the Rivers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected what courſes the water ſhould run in—Not, that the hearts of ſubordinate Rulers, or of all men, are not in his hands; but, that thoſe who are exalted as gods among men, who are ſeated at the upper end of the world; are yet under the government of the Moſt High.</p>
            <p>HE makes uſe of men as inſtruments in his hands, to execute the purpoſes of his providence and grace.—Men may be ſet up by him as Kings, advanced to the chief ſeat of government, under the influence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his providence—And the bleſſings
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012502_0007_0F8A8FDFD09360B0"/>
of their adminiſtration, may be as uſeful and beneficial as Rivers of water.</p>
            <p>As <hi>the heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of water</hi>—ſo 'tis added—<hi>He turneth it whitherſoever he will</hi>—that is—He turneth the King's heart as he pleaſeth—'Tis more under his direction and controul, than the Rivers of water are under the power of men, which may be turned into different channels by them.</p>
            <p>Now, as a King implies a kingdom and ſubjects, government and the adminiſtration of it—And as Rivers of water have their important uſe and end in the kingdom of nature;—And as both of theſe are ſaid to be in the hand of the Lord, given by him for valuable purpoſes—I hope the <hi>Metaphors</hi> will not be overſtrained, if we allow the words to ſuggeſt to us the following truths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE univerſal dominion of God, that all hearts, times, ſeaſons, changes and events are in his hands, or under his direction and controul.—The origin, deſign, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, neceſſity and advantage of good civil government—The happy caſe of a people, who are thus favoured of God, for they are as a land well watered with rivers, and enjoy privileges which are</hi>

               <hi>great and invaluable.—A good civil government may be altered, the Rivers of water may be turned into other chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, or may become bitter; or the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of government may become injurious and oppreſſive to the ſubject—And in both theſe caſes—either when we enjoy the advantages of good civil government, or find that it is altered and become grievous—we are to acknowledge the righteous and ſupreme Ruler and Governor of the world, who orders proſperity and adverſity for us; and can turn the rivers of water into their right channels, when they have been diverted from their proper courſes; or remove all our public difficulties, and make us a happy people.</hi>

But the hearts of earthly Kings "notwithſtanding their powers and prerogatives, as much as the hearts of common perſons, are in the hands of the King of Kings. Thoſe that are moſt abſolute are under his government.—They may have the prerogatives of their crown, but the great God has them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his eye but in his hand."</p>
            <p>AND as the great Ruler of the univerſe, has the hearts of Kings, ſo he has the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Kingdoms in his hands. He who made the world governs it—All events in the kingdom of nature, providence and grace, are under his ordering and direction.

            <p>ALTHOUGH there is ſo much ſin in the world, yet a righteous and holy God reigns.

This is the day of his patience, which is exerciſed even unto long-ſuffering; and he knows how to govern and over-rule all events, to the advancement of his own glory, and good of his people.</p>

A LAND without water, without Rivers of water, wou'd ſcarce be habitable, and ſerve, but for a retreat for wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>THE great country of <hi>Egypt,</hi> receives its ſupply of water from a River. Its fertility is owing to the flowings of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which diffuſes it's fatneſs through all their fields, being let into them by proper <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals;</hi> whereby they yield plenty of grain; which otherwiſe would be but burning blowing ſands.</p>
            <p>A PEOPLE without civil government, or in a ſtate of nature, are in an unſafe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—The depraved wicked world we live in, renders civil government neceſſary, for the ſafety and welfare of ſociety.</p>
            <p>THROW down the walls of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to what evils and dangers, thefts, rapines and murders are we continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed?

We could not be ſafe, from thoſe who thought they might injure us in our moſt valuable intereſts, and yet eſcape unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>THE conſequences of an arbitrary tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic government, are yet more diſtreſſing—

When the will of the Prince is the law of the Subject—When life, liberty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty lie at the mercy of a <hi>Deſpot;</hi>—And the nod of the tyrant brings on an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the <hi>bow</hi> and the <hi>ſtring.</hi> Such an adminiſtration of government is like an inundation or landflood, which carries all before it—The ſubject is left to <hi>groan</hi> in poverty, ſlavery and miſery.—</p>
            <p>THE bleſſings a people enjoy who are favored with good civil government, are not to be deſcribed—they are like Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reviving and refreſhing—Highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored of God, are a people who are thus diſtinguiſhed!</p>

            <p>I HAVE been ready to look upon the Britiſh nation, as this happy people—That we had the beſt plan of civil government, of any nation or people under heaven.—That the King of Kings had ſmiled upon us in a peculiar manner, in thus diſtinguiſhing of

            <p>THE names and memories of ſome of thoſe Worthies, whom the great Ruler of the world, in his kind providence placed on the Britiſh Throne, will be dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to this people, ſo long as we have any juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> apprehenſions of the advantages we enjoyed under their happy adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>KING William <hi>the third,</hi> of glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, is regarded by us as the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of God, of delivering the nation from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi>—In his auſpicious reign our Charter was granted, which contains our rights and privileges—which have been dearly bought by us—honeſtly paid for—which we have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted claim to, and I hope in God ſhall never be deprived of them.</p>
            <p>KING George <hi>the firſt</hi>—and <hi>the ſecond,</hi> are Princes, who are ſpoken of with high eſteem and honor. The bleſſings which flow'd from the throne, while they ſat upon it, were as rivers of water, reviving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing—
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012502_0016_0F8A8FE9E43BFC58"/>
Their adminiſtration was like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the deſart, or ſtreams in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—We rejoiced as a happy people under their mild and gentle reigns.</p>
            <p>HIS preſent Majeſty aſcended the throne of his royal anceſtors, amidſt the joyful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of his ſubjects—His way to the throne, (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) ſeem'd to be <hi>pav'd with hearts;</hi> ſo great was the affection of his people for him. His Majeſty gloried in the name of <hi>Briton</hi>—And the whole nation gloried, in having a Prince born and educated among them, who was to wear the Crown, and ſway the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. Scarce ever a Prince aſcended the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh throne with equal advantages to do good, and to render his people happy under his adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>How could we wiſh that bright day had continued clear and ſerene!</p>
            <p>BUT the ſcene is changed—Grievances are complain'd of—In Great Britain—In Ireland—In America—In this Provinces—The day is become gloomy and dark, and the waters are troubled.</p>

FOURTH place, to take notice, that the words intimate—<hi>That even good civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be altered, the Rivers of water may be turned into other channels, or may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bitter; or the adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may become injurious and oppreſſive to the ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS true, the Rivers of water may be ſhifted into other channels, and the water remain the ſame. Government may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in ſome different form, and yet anſwer all the happy purpoſes intended by it.—The waters may be like a rapid river, which cannot be paſſed with ſafety; or, like a river which overflows it's banks, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens danger to all who are within reach of it—(and it is alarming when this is the caſe) Yet, the river may become ſtill and quiet; the waters may ſubſide, and get and keep within their proper limits—Or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be troubled by thoſe who live near them, and enjoy the benefit of them, which may yet become calm and ſerene.</p>
            <p>AND it is as true, in this ſtate of things, that adminiſtration may change—A King may be <hi>miſled</hi> by evil counſellors—He may be <hi>corrupted</hi> by bad miniſters, and give into thoſe meaſures which are <hi>injurious</hi> to the ſubject.—The liberty of the ſubject may be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012502_0018_0F8A8FEB59540628"/>
thought too great—Deſpotic principles may look fair—and a King under a limited mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy may deſire to become independent and abſolute.</p>
            <p>KING James <hi>the ſecond</hi>—when Duke <hi>of York,</hi> was heard to ſay—that he had rather reign one month as the King of France did, than his whole life, as his brother Charles the ſecond did—Unhappy Prince!—When he came to the throne—notwithſtanding his coronation oaths, he acted upon his Popiſh deſpotic principles, till he became obnoxious to the Engliſh nation, <hi>who oppos'd his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> which brought on the happy Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Prince of Orange was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Britiſh throne.</p>
            <p>ADMINISTRATION may be <hi>altered</hi> by ſubordinate Rulers, by bad miniſters, who are intruſted by the King to conduct the affairs of government. Bribery and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption may have great Influence;—and a nation may be even ſold, to ſatisfy the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice of wicked men.</p>
            <p>THE Complaints heard among us; <hi>are;</hi> not <hi>only,</hi> that the Rivers are <hi>ſhifted</hi> into other Channels, <hi>but</hi> that the waters are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>bitter,—yea</hi>—that the waters are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>bloody</hi>—Or thoſe meaſures have taken
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012502_0019_0F8A8FEC17497CA0"/>
place, which in their conſequences have been diſtreſſing—</p>
            <p>OUR difficulties are of a public nature—they are known by us—they tenderly affect us—and make a deep impreſſion on our minds—</p>
            <p>WHAT I have in deſign, is, an humble attempt to lead this people to a ſuitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the righteous over-ruling providence of God, and to conduct towards him in a becoming manner under all our public difficulties.</p>
            <p>I come then, in</p>
            <p>THE fifth and laſt place, to take notice that the words ſuggeſt to us—<hi>That in both theſe Caſes—either when we enjoy the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of good civil Government, or find that it is altered and become grievous: We are to acknowledge, the righteous and ſupreme Ruler and Governor of the world; who orders proſperity and adverſity for us; and can turn the Rivers of water into their right channels, when they have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from their proper courſes; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all our public difficulties, and make us a happy people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012502_0020_0F8A8FED5D2F8308"/>
THESE things are intimated; <hi>as</hi> all the events which take place among men, and the changes which paſs over them, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion and government of God, who expects that we regard his works and the operation of his hands.</p>
            <p>THE great bleſſing of good civil-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be thankfully received.—A people thus diſtinguiſhed, are under the greateſt obligations to acknowlege the favor of the King of Kings, who has thus ſmil'd on them in the diſpenſations of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards them.</p>
            <p>GOD has done great things for our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Under the ſmiles of his Providence we are become a great and powerful People, and are indulg'd with thoſe privileges and advantages, which demand our grateful no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and regard.</p>
            <p>GOD has done great things for theſe Britiſh Colonies—Great things for this Province—He brought our Fathers into <hi>this then howling wilderneſs;</hi> he protected them, when they were few in number, and expos'd to the greateſt hardſhips and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers—He watched over them for good, and cauſed them to take root, to ſpring up and increaſe, and become <hi>ſo</hi> great a people, as we are at this day.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012502_0021_0F8A8FEFEC4F3360"/>
WE enjoy a precious goſpel—The word and ordinances of God; the means of grace and ſalvation; which are deſigned to promote our everlaſting good, that we may be happy here, and bleſſed in the coming world.</p>
            <p>WE are a people favored of God in many reſpects; and the privileges and liberties we enjoy of a civil and religious nature, call upon us to ſtudy what we ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him for all his benefits. If the day is become gloomy and dark, yet we have many mercies to be thankful for, which muſt not be forgotten by us.</p>
            <p>BE SURE it becomes us <hi>to acknowledge God</hi> in this day of public difficulty;—for it is his hand which is lifted up and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt us. Do we think we have reaſon to complain of men, that they have been our enemies without cauſe? that we have been miſrepreſented—falſely accuſed—and treated after an injurious manner?—that our liberties have been invaded, and hoſtile meaſures made uſe of, to bring us to ſubmit to things which are grievous?

hath not done it?—Shall there be the evil of affliction and puniſhment, and the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God not concerned in it.</p>
            <p>I AM not here juſtifying the practice of wicked men; or that thoſe can be excuſed from great guilt, who have acted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous part towards us;—but that they will meet with deſerved puniſhment.</p>
            <p>BUT the conduct of Divine Providence is to be juſtified—God is not the author of ſin, he cannot be tempted with evil, neither does he tempt any man to ſin.—He may ſuffer, or permit ſuch things to be done, which are ſinful or wicked, and yet be holy and righteous.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to our behaviour, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to King George, or as inhabitants of this province, whereby we claim Charter privileges—I believe we have as much to plead in our favour, as any part of the King's dominions, or as any people upon the face of the earth.

            <p>THE Charter governments have many things to plead in their favor—And this Province in particular—For if any people under Heaven, might expect to be ſmiled on by their Sovereign, nouriſhed, cheriſhed and rewarded by the Mother Country, we might juſtly look for ſuch treatment.</p>

THAT great man, Mr. Agent Dummer, in his defence of the Charter governments, has ſet their ſervices, and ſufferings in the common cauſe, <hi>in a true point of light,</hi> up to his time—But it would require volumes to recount all that this people have done, to ſettle and ſupport themſelves <hi>as a people,</hi> without any charge to Great-Britain; and what they have performed, to <hi>ſecure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> and <hi>enlarge</hi> the Britiſh dominions in this part of the globe. What numbers of men, of the flower of our men, have been ſacrificed in this cauſe!

            <p>WE have had the approbation of our Sovereign, and of the Britiſh Parliament, on ſeveral occaſions in years paſt. And we hope the time will ſoon come, when it will appear that we have not done any thing, to forfeit either the favor of the one, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the other; but have acted the part of loyal and dutiful ſubjects; tho' we cannot ſubmit to ſhackles and chains, ſo long as we have a juſt right to the privileges of freemen.</p>

BUT although we have ſo much to plead in our favour, when we conſider our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards our Sovereign and our Parent Country—Yet muſt not our mouths be ſtopped, when we review our behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King of Kings, and conſider what has been done offenſive and diſpleaſing to the Moſt High?</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the divine laws are publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all their ſolemn ſanctions; and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws enacted and executed, to ſuppreſs vice and wickedneſs; yet ſin has broke over all bounds, and like a deluge overſpread the land. There are ſins, and aggravated ſins too, which are found <hi>even among us,</hi> againſt the Lord our God. Does not iniquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound—infidelity—deiſm—profane ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and curſing, and taking God's name in vain—ſabbath breaking—intemperance—debaucheries—murders—and all kinds of wickedneſs? Are there not thoſe ſins found among us, for which a land ſhould mourn? Sins, which are the reproach of a profeſſing people, and threaten their ruin.</p>
            <p>HAS not the Son of God many enemies among us, who reject him in his perſon, offices and benefits; and will not that he ſhould reign over them? Is not a precious goſpel deſpiſed, a great ſalvation neglected,

When we ſurvey our errors, apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacies and declenſions, what corruptions there are in doctrine, and immoralities in practice, we may wonder at the patience and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering of God, and ſay, that he is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us far leſs than our ſins deſerve; for his judgments might have deſtroyed us like an overflowing flood.</p>

            <p>THE bleſſed God has been pleaſed to diſtinguiſh us on account of privileges, both of a civil and religious nature; he has brought us near to himſelf, and own'd us as a people.
