            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Belief of GOD's Exiſtence is moſt eſſentially fundamental to all Religion, and having been at the firſt of the <hi>Dudleian</hi> Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures eſtabliſhed; the moral Obligation which it induceth upon the Nature of Man, may be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our preſent Inquiry.</p>
            <p>A DEVOUT <hi>Hermit</hi> being aſked, How he could profit in Knowledge, living in a Deſart, without Men and Books? anſwered, 'I have one Book which I am always ſtudying, and

turning over Day and Night: The Heavens, the Earth and the Waters, are the Leaves of which it conſiſts.' The Characters of the Deity are plainly legible in the whole Creation around us: And if we open the Volume of our own Nature, and look within, we find there a Law written; — a Rule of virtuous Practice preſcribed.</p>
            <p>RELIGION and Law (divine) are Words of promiſcuous Uſe; denoting in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Signification thereof, <hi>An Obligation lying upon Men to do thoſe Things which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, relative unto them, do require of them.</hi> In this Definition (whether exact and full, or not,) I mean to imply all Things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on ſuch reaſonable Creatures as Men are, toward all Beings with which they are concerned, GOD, the ſupreme, one another, and themſelves; and which are incumbent on them, by vertue of the Perfections of God, in the Relation there is betwixt Him and them: other Obligation which can be ſuppoſed to any of the ſame Things, not being of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Kind. And in the doing thoſe Things to which Religion is the Obligation, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, beſides the actual Performance, the Principles, Motives and Ends thereof; all that is neceſſary to render any Acts of Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internal or external, ſuch as the Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Deity require.</p>
            <p>RELIGION is divided into natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed:—<hi>Revealed</hi> Religion, is that which God hath made known to Men by the immediate

               <hi>THAT Religion is, in ſome meaſure, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the Light, and practicable to the Strength, of Nature;</hi> and is ſo far fitly called <hi>Natural</hi> by Divines and learned Men. The Religion which is poſſible to be diſcover'd by the Light, and practis'd by the Power of Nature, conſiſts in rend'ring all thoſe inward and outward Acts of Reſpect, Worſhip and Obedience unto God, which are ſuitable to the Excellence of his all-perfect Nature, and our Relation to Him, who is our Creator, Preſerver, Benefactor, Lord, and Judge;— And in yielding to our Fellow-Men that Regard, Help and Comfort, which their partaking of the ſame Nature, and living in Society with us, give them a Claim to;— And in managing our Souls and Bodies, in their reſpective Actions and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in a way agreable to our <hi>Make,</hi> and conducive to our Eaſe and Happineſs: And doing all from a Senſe of the Deity, impoſing the Obligation, and approving the Diſcharge of it. For 'tis a Regard to Him in every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duty that conſecrates it, and makes it truly an Act of Religion. Theſe Things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008354_0006_102F3A8B34730C38"/>
are contained in the Revelation of God, which affords the chief Aſſiſtance to our knowing and doing of them; and yet they belong to the Religion of Nature, ſo far as Nature ſupplies any Light and Strength to the Diſcovery and Practice of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT Religion is in ſome meaſure, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by the Light of Nature. The Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation lying on us to do thoſe Things which the Perfections of God, as related to us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, is diſcernable in the Light of natural Reaſon. This Faculty of the human Soul, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the Contemplation of the univerſal Frame of Nature, or of any Parts thereof; and in the Obſervation of the general Courſe of Providence, or of particular Events therein, may convince Men of the Exiſtence and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, the alwiſe, powerful and good Maker, Upholder, and Governor of all Things. It may be queſtioned whether the reaſoning Faculty, as it is in the Bulk of Mankind, be ſo acute and ſtrong, as from the neceſſary eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Exiſtence of the Deity (which is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and inconteſtible, as that any Thing is) to prove all other Perfections do belong to God in an infinite Degree. If it be not eaſy to their Apprehenſion, that the Idea of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Self-exiſtence includes every Perfection, and every Degree thereof, which can poſſibly be, or which implies not a Contradiction; yet it is plain to the loweſt Capacity of thoſe who, with a little Attention, ſurvey the Works
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008354_0007_102F3A8CCA959458"/>
of God, that He is a Being of ſuch Perfection: And that, ſince He is their Maker, Owner, and Benefactor, to whom they are indebted for all that they are, and have, and on whom they depend for all they need, or can enjoy; they are bound to yield unto Him, in the Temper of their Minds, and Manner of their Behaviour, toward Him, and his Creatures they are concerned with, all that Regard which Religion founded in the Nature of God, and in the Nature of Man, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation there is between them implies. They may perceive their Obligation to reverence, adore, and worſhip a Being of ſuch Perfection and Glory, as God is—to invoke the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—pray unto Him, who is able to perform all Things for them; to give Thanks to Him, from whom they receive all Bleſſings; to aim and endeavour to pleaſe their Lord and Maſter, to whom they are accountable for their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and who is juſt to puniſh their Offences, and bountiful to reward their Services.—They may diſcern the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of their Maker, in deſigning and ſitting them for a ſocial Life in this World, and thence the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Engagements they are under to mutual Benevolence, commutative Juſtice, and all ſuch Demeanour in their various Stations and Relations, as tends to promote the common Welfare, and the Good of Individuals.— Their Souls may know right well, how wonderfully God hath made them with Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſuperior to any bodily Endowments;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008354_0008_102F3A8F466C4980"/>
which ſhould not therefore be ſubjected to the Sway of bruitiſh Appetites and blind Paſſions. Reaſon may know it's divine Right to govern, to maintain it's Empire in the Soul, regulating the Paſſions and Affections; directing them to proper Objects, and ſtinting them to juſt Meaſures. Nature affords conſiderable Light for the Diſcovery, and Arguments for the Proof, of ſuch Parts of Religion. There is an eſſential Difference between Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, in many Caſes that relate to moral Conduct toward our Maker, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ourſelves, which the Underſtanding (if made uſe of) cannot but diſcern. The obvious Diſtinction is founded in the Natures and Relations of Things: And the Obligation thence ariſing to chuſe the Good, and do that which is Right, is not (as I conceive) antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any Law or Inſtitution, enjoining this upon us. It primarily originates from the Will and Appointment of the Author of thoſe Natures, and Founder of thoſe Relations, which are the Grounds and Reaſons of it. And his Will is ſignified by his apparently wiſe and good Conſtitution of Things, in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Natures and Relations. The Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by the God of Nature, who is Lord of all. He enacted it by creating and eſtabliſhing a World of Beings in ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as he hath done. He publiſhes it to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures (as is neceſſary to it's binding them) in making them capable to learn from his Works, what is good, and what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008354_0009_102F3A94867876B0"/>
of them. Natural Conſcience is his Voice, telling them their Duty. This (in part) is the <hi>work of the Law in their Hearts.</hi>—'Tis the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravement of it there, anſwerable to the Writing of it on Tables, in order to it's being made known: And ſo Men are <hi>a Law unto themſelves,</hi> are ſupply'd with a Rule of Actions within their own Breaſts. The Righteouſneſs which is of Nature (to adopt the Language of Inſpiration) ſpeaketh on ſome ſuch wiſe, as doth that which is of Faith: <hi>Say not in thine Heart who ſhall aſcend into Heaven; or who ſhall deſcend into the Deep,</hi> to bring us the Knowledge of our Duty? <hi>The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Heart,</hi> ſhewing thee what thou oughteſt to do: <hi>Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs,</hi> teſtifying for or againſt Men, according as they obey or diſobey the Word of Reaſon, which is the Word of God: And ſo <hi>their Thoughts</hi>—the general Notions of Good and Evil in them, make them either to accuſe themſelves as Tranſgreſſors of a known Law, or elſe excuſe them, as not having culpably done any Thing againſt it. In the due Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their natural Faculties, Men are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of attaining ſome Knowledge of God's Will, and their Duty, manifeſted in his Works, as if it were written in legible Characters on the Tables of their Hearts. And 'tis on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that any Part of Religion is called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and ſtands diſtinguiſhed, in <hi>Theology,</hi> from that which is revealed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:008354_0010_102F3A961E6649A0"/>II. THAT Religion is, in ſome Meaſure, practicable to the Strength of Nature. There is doing, as well as knowing, by Nature, the Things contained in the Law of it. Knowing them is but in order to the doing them: And the Capacity to know them would be in vain, (which nothing in Nature is) if there was no Ability to do them. Whoever obſerves the divine Workmanſhip in human Nature, and takes a Survey of the Powers and Faculties with which it is endowed, muſt needs ſee that it was deſigned and framed for the Practice of Virtue: That Man is not merely ſo much lumpiſh Matter, or a <hi>mechanical</hi> Engine, that moves only by the Direction of an impelling Force; but that he hath a Principle of Action within himſelf, and is an Agent in the ſtrict and proper Senſe of the Word. The ſpecial Endowment of his Nature, which conſtitutes him ſuch, is the Power of Self-determination, or Freedom of Choice; his being poſſeſſed of which is as ſelf-evident, as the Explanation of the Manner of it's operating, is difficult: He feels himſelf free to act one Way, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And as he is capable of diſtinguiſhing between different Actions, of the moral Kind; ſo is he likewiſe of chuſing which he will do, and which leave undone. Further to qualify our Nature for virtuous or religious Practice (which neceſſarily muſt be of Choice) the Author of it hath annexed a ſecret Joy or Complacence of Mind to ſuch Practice, and as ſenſible a Pain or Diſplicence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

And this inward Judgment which every one paſſes on his own Actions, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with another Principle, which belongs more or leſs to our common Nature, viz. a Regard to the Judgment that is paſſed upon our Conduct by other Beings; eſpecially Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings whoſe Favour or Diſpleaſure is of any Importance to us: There is a ſecret Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soul, which ariſeth from their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and as exquiſite a Senſe of Pain and Uneaſineſs from their Cenſure. — The Spirit of Man being thus formed within him, it is (according to the original Deſign and wiſe Contrivance of our Maker) naturally diſpoſed toward Religion: It hath an Inclination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to implanted in it, which under the Direction of right Reaſon, is an inward Spring of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Action, when Reaſon alone would not give ſufficient Quickneſs and Vigour in purſuing it's Dictates.</p>
            <p>THERE may be ſomething in the intelligent moral World analogous to Attraction in the material Syſtem—ſomething that inclines and draws Men toward God, the Centre of their Perfection, and conſummate Object of their Happineſs; and which, if it's Energy were not obſtructed, would as certainly procure ſuch Regularity in the States and Actions of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Beings in the ſpiritual World, as that of Attraction doth in the Poſitions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all the Bodies in the material World. — "Created intelligent Beings (ſays Dr. <hi>Cheyne</hi>) are Images of the SUPREME INFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITE,

There muſt therefore be an Image of this his infinite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after Happineſs in all his intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures —a Deſire after Happineſs in a Re-union with Him. An intelligent Being, coming out of the Hands of infinite Perfection, with an Averſion, or even Indifferency, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united with it's Author, the Source of it's ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Felicity, is ſuch a Shock, and Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the beautiful Analogy of Things, ſuch a Breach and Gap in the harmonious Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, obſervable in all the Works of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and that in the nobleſt and higheſt Part of his Works, as is not conſiſtent with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom and Perfection, much leſs with the ſupremely infinite Wiſdom of the ALL-PERFECT. — This Principle was moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly implanted in the Creation of intelligent Beings, in the very Fund and Subſtance of their Natures, thô there remains but few Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps and Inſtances of it's Being or Effects.—.

His Formation of them qualifys them, in a meaſure, for religious Practice; as his Regeneration, or Renovation of them doth more ſo. And his fitting them by Nature therefor, is a Work of his, to which the Work of Sanctification, in his furniſhing them with Grace to evangelical Obedience, beareth Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. The former is the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, that they may do, as well as know, what it enjoins: The latter is the Impreſſion of the Goſpel upon them, that, thro' Chriſt's ſtrengthening them, they may do what it requires. And by doing the Things contained in the Law of Nature, Men <hi>ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, and are a Law unto themſelves,</hi> as truly and plainly, as regenerate Chriſtians, by doing the Things contained in the Goſpel, are <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, not in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhly Tables of the Heart.</hi> The Scriptures thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Religion of Nature and of Chriſt, clearly diſtinguiſh between them; as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may be practiſed by the Strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the latter by the Strength of Chriſt, — his Spirit helping the Infirmities of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

The Goodneſs of God, in the general Courſe of his Providence, toward ſinful Mankind, ſheweth Him to be placable, and leadeth them to Repentance; but doth not aſſure them of Pardon upon it, much leſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of eternal Life, for imperfect, tho' it ſhould be ſincere, Obedience. If Reaſon doth not ſee and pronounce it inconſiſtent with the Perfections of God to pardon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, on the ſole Condition of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet it cannot infer from them, that he will:—All that it can ſay, is in the Words of a Heathen King, <hi>Who can tell if the Lord will turn from his Anger, that we periſh not?</hi> Such Inducement they may have to repent, and turn from their evil Ways:—And it may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encourage them to better Obedience, by ſuggeſting the Conſideration which may be had by a merciful God of the Frailty of their

Nature, and the gracious Allowances He may poſſibly make them, whoſe Strength, ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as it is, cannot reach the Heighth of their Duty. In the Preſcription of Duty, 'tis not unreaſonable, that what may be required, even in Rigour, ſhould be preciſely determined, thô in Execution of Juſtice, or Diſpenſation of Recompence, Conſideration may be had of our Weakneſs; whereby both the Authority of our Governor may be preſerved, and his Clemency glorified. Men's Thoughts or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences accuſing them for the Violation of the Law of Nature, implies a Fear which is not groundleſs, that they ſhall be brought into Judgment: And their Thoughts excuſing and approving of them for doing, in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, what the Law requires, implies a Hope, which may not be altogether vain, that they ſhall be accepted. Thô it ſhould be, as one ſaith, "That all the moral Virtues are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cyphers—unavailing Nothings, unleſs the Deity be placed as the principal Figure at the Head of them;" yet if practiſed out of any Senſe of Duty to God, and with a View to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Him, as it is poſſible they may be, and have been, ſhall we ſay, they are meerly ſplendid Vices in his Eyes; and that the moſt humble Prayers of natural Men are Blaſphemies in his Ears? May there not be ſuch a conſcientious doing <hi>by Nature the Things contained in the Law</hi> of it, as, thrô the Riches of divine Bounty and Goodneſs, ſhall in ſome low Meaſure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with doing the ſame by Grace, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

May not a <hi>God of Knowledge, by whom Actions are weighed,</hi> diſcern ſome Good in thoſe done by the Strength of Nature, and approve the honeſt, thô weak, Efforts thereof, to ſerve him; and thereupon, beſides outward Favours (of which He is liberal to all both good and bad Men) grant the Succours of his Grace, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them to do the ſame, and other Things to better Acceptance, and to the obtaining a greater Reward, even that which the Chriſtian Revelation propoſes; and is thereby differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and diſtinguiſhed from natural Religion?</p>
            <p>AND, now, if what hath been ſo imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, be according to the Truth in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not inconſiſtent with the Chriſtian Verity, the proper Uſe and Improvement of it is, <hi>To form a juſt Eſtimate of Natural Religion;</hi> and guard againſt the dangerous Extremes in our Regards to it—Not to have a debaſing, nor a too exalted Notion of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE ſhould not depreciate and cry down Natural Religion, on Pretence of advancing the Honour of Revealed—as if they were two oppoſite Religions, and could no more ſtand together in the ſame Temple than Dagon and the Ark of God. Whatever Diſtinction we obſerve between them, there is no Contrariety in the one to the other: They ſubſiſt harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly together, and mutually ſtrengthen and confirm each other.

               <hi>Additional</hi> to Natural; built, not on the Ruins, but on the ſtrong and everlaſting Foundations of it. Nothing therefore can be vainer and more prepoſterous, than the Attempt to raiſe the Credit of the one, upon the Diſcredit of the other; as if to allow any Virtue, or any Praiſe, in natural Religion, would be deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Honour of revealed: And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the former as inſignificant to the grand Purpoſe of Religion, and chief End of Man; the glorifying and enjoying God:—As avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing towards Man's Recovery from a ſinful State, and his Attainment unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Happineſs:—As if his knowing and doing <hi>by Nature the Things contained in the Law</hi> of it, could be no more acceptable to his Maker, nor profitable to himſelf, than his Ignorance and Neglect of them: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Improvement and Progreſs he made in natural Religion, he was not a Step nearer the Kingdom of God; nor a ſairer Candidate for Heaven than a <hi>Heathen-Man, or a Publican.</hi> The Law of Nature, like that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> may be ſerviceable unto Men, <hi>as a School-Maſter to bring them to Chriſt,</hi> for higher Inſtruction; eſpecially where the Means of ſuch are afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſo uſher them into a State of Grace. Notwithſtanding the Inſufficiency of natural Religion to their Salvation, yet it may, in ſome Meaſure, prepare them to be Partakers of the Benefit, without any Diminution of the Glory of the Goſpel, which is the Grant of it, or Detraction from the Merits of our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008354_0019_102F3AB3181BF388"/>
who is the Author of it. It is only by Grace that ſinful Men can be ſaved; yet, by making ſome good Uſe of their rational Powers (weakened as they be) in the Study and Practice of natural Religion, they may be in a better Preparation of Mind to comply with the Offers and Operations of divine Grace, than if they wholly give up themſelves to the Conduct of ſenſual Appetites &amp; Paſſions. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Offers &amp; Operations of divine Grace are deſigned for, and ever vouchſafed to ſuch as are not favoured with Revelation; and it be poſſible for them to obtain Mercy, in the Day when God by Jeſus Chriſt ſhall judge the Things which they have done, <hi>according to the Goſpel;</hi> is a Point which Revelation only can determine; and is not my Province to diſcuſs.</p>
            <p>IN the Preference we give to revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we ſhould not for the ſake of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Truth we apprehend to be deliver'd in it, haſtily renounce a Principle of natural Religion, ſeeming contrary thereto. Both ſhould be carefully examined, before either be rejected: Elſe we may err, after the manner which the <hi>Sadduces</hi> did, <hi>Not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the Power of God.</hi> It muſt be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Ignorance, or Miſapprehenſion of Things hard to be underſtood in the Book of Nature, and the holy Bible, that we cannot reconcile them. No Doctrine, or Scheme of Religion, ſhould be advanced, or received as ſcriptural and divine, which is plainly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008354_0020_102F3AB75C9100E8"/>
inconſiſtent with the Perfections of God, and the Poſſibility of Things. Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Contradictions (from which few hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Schemes are entirely free) are not to be obtruded upon our Faith. No Pretence of Revelation can be ſufficient for the Admiſſion of them. The manifeſt Abſurdity of any Doctrine, is a ſtronger Argument that it is not of God, than any other Evidence can be that it is. "A Revelation muſt be agreable to the Nature of God, and Poſſibility of Things." We are not raſhly to determine concerning one that it is not ſo, becauſe we don't eaſily and clearly ſee it to be ſo: Nor plead that any may be ſo, which contradicts all our natural Ideas of the Attributes of God. To ſay, in Defence of any religious Tenets, reduced to Abſurdity, that the Perfections of God, his Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs, are quite different Things in Him, from what, in an infinitely lower Degree, they are in Men, is to overthrow all Religion both natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; and make our Faith, as well as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vain.— For, if we have no right Notions of the Deity, (as 'tis certain upon this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, we have none,) as we worſhip, ſo we believe, we know not what, or why. We don't know what Reſpects are due from us to the Perfections of God; or that any are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us by Him. For, as well as any other moral Perfections, Truth may be quite different in God, from what it is in Men; and ſo there may be nothing of that which we conceive of as

ſuch, in his Aſſertions and Promiſes.—He may declare one Thing, and mean another; promiſe one Thing, and do another:— God may be True and Faithful, and yet deceive us; as well as Holy and Juſt, and do that which is not Right. Revelation gives us the ſame (tho' clearer) Ideas of the Attributes of God, which we have from Nature and Reaſon: And if it taught any Thing contrary thereto, it would unſay what it ſaith, and deſtroy it's own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility. To ſet the Gifts of God at variance, is to fruſtrate the good Deſign and deprive ourſelves of the Benefit of them. Vehemently to decry Reaſon, as uſeleſs, or as a blind Guide, leading Men into Error and Hell; and to run down natural Religion as mere <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the Credit of revealed, ſubverts our Faith in it, and diſſolves our Obligation to practice it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE ſhould not magnify and extol natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, to the Diſparagement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. We cannot ſay, that the Light and Strength of Nature, how great ſoever, in it's original State of Rectitude, had no Aſſiſtance from Revelation, toward the firſt Man's actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Knowledge and Performance of his Duty to his Maker. At the firſt opening of his Eyes and Underſtanding, he might not by one intuitive View, have a clear and full Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Perfections of God ſtamped on his Works, and the moral Obligations engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Heart.— God made Himſelf and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008354_0022_102F3ABBED89AB48"/>
his Will known to <hi>Adam</hi> in ſome other Way beſide that of his Creation. There was ſome <hi>other</hi> Voice of the Lord, beſide that of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Nature's declaring his Being and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to him; and by which more might be ſpoken for his Inſtruction, than we have an Account of in the Moſaick Hiſtory. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch Manifeſtation as God more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately made of Himſelf to Man, put his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Exerciſe for all the Diſcoveries it was capable of making afterwards from the Works of Creation. Had Man, with all his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Endowments in their perfect Order and Strength, been placed in this World, and no Notice given him of it's Maker, might he not have ſtood wondring ſome Time at the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Fabrick, before he would have thence, by Deductions of Reaſon, argued an inviſible Being, of eternal Power, Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be the Author of it and him; to whom he was therefore obliged to pay all Regards ſuitable to ſuch glorious Excellencies? Would he ſo ſoon and eaſily have made thoſe Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, which are neceſſary to the Perfection of natural Religion, underſtood and practic'd by him in Paradiſe, till he eat of <hi>the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil?</hi> If his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Created after the Image of God imports more, than his Formation with a ſufficient Capacity in his Nature for, and entire Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to, even the actual Poſſeſſion and Uſe of all that Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, of which the Religion of Nature,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008354_0023_102F3ABD85196B80"/>
conſiſts; yet his falling into Sin, and effacing the divine Image in his Soul, greatly alter'd the Caſe, with reſpect to him, and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and made Revelation a neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of ſupernatural Light and Strength, for the Diſcovery and Performance of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and available Religion. And ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, in it's firſt Degree and early Dawn of it, was graciouſly vouchſafed to Man, upon his Fall into a State of Darkneſs and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sin and Miſery. — Which Revelation continued, and gradually encreaſed, to the Church of God in all paſt Ages of it from the Beginning, hath done more to preſerve and propagate that little even of natural Religion, which there hath been among Mankind, than all the boaſted Improvements of Nature's dimmed Light, and enfeebled Powers have done. The firſt Parents of Mankind, no doubt, inſtructed their Children in the Principles and Duties of Religion, not only thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd them as ſinful Creatures, and are founded in the new and encouraging Relations God ſtands in to us, which the Goſpel, publiſhed in Paradiſe, reveals, but alſo in thoſe which are comprehended in the Law of their Creation: Otherwiſe they might not ſoon enough, if ever, have arriv'd to a competent Knowledge of them. It might have been long, e're Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, uncultivated by Education, would by ſearching, have found out God — ſo much as that He is. Perhaps of it's own natural Motion, now become ſo dull and ſtupid, it
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008354_0024_102F3AC29B11BBB8"/>
would not have enquired after Him, or have proceeded far in the Diſcovery of Him. To a traditionary Revelation, how imperfect and obſcure ſoever, amongſt moſt Nations that have dwelt on the Face of the Earth, might be owing the Knowledge they had of God, and divine Things:— At leaſt the Hint thus given them of ſuch Things, might awake their rational Powers to any Exerciſe about them, which otherwiſe might have lain dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in their benighted Minds.</p>
            <p>REASON, as well as Revelation, teacheth us, that human Nature, in it's original Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and as it came out of the Hands of a good Creator, muſt be Perfect in it's Kind, and that it ſince, by our Abuſe of it, is wofully impaired. It might not approach quite ſo near the Angelical, yea, Divine Nature in it's integral State, as ſome imagine; nor might it by the Sin of the <hi>Protoplaſt</hi> fall quite ſo low, as others affirm; and become a ſtrange hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous Compound of two other Natures, retaining nothing of Humanity in it. The ſuperior Excellency and Strength of innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, might not be ſo much above the common Standard, ſince, as the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his bodily Stature—ſo Tall, that, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Earth, he could touch the Heavens with his Hand; yet it doubtleſs had every way the Advantage for the free and ſublime Exerciſes of a rational Soul. Some appear to have an extravagantly high Opinion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a too debaſing Notion of human Nature,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008354_0025_102F3AC5A497C858"/>
even in it's lapſed Eſtate: There are ſtill in it, as received by Derivation from apoſtate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, "ſome <hi>legible Characters, Out-lines,</hi> and <hi>Lineaments</hi> of it's Beauty; ſome <hi>magnificent Ruins,</hi> which ſhew what it had been, enough to demonſtrate the original Impreſſion of the divine Image and Law." It is, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd and debilitated, a rational Nature, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of religious Knowledge and Practice. But can we gueſs, how much thereof it would attain to, in the ſhort Time of this Life, if it were left altogether uncultivated in Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and Mankind had run wild, like the Beaſts of the Field? How much more would the Generality of 'em know, than what they know as <hi>natural brute Beaſts?</hi> and in thoſe Things have corrupted themſelves: The higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Nature not exerting themſelves for the firſt Years of their Lives, and ſo the more ſubjected to the Sway of the inferior, might be of little Uſe toward the Diſcovery and Performance of the Things of Religion: Any innate Inclination to them might be ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Crowd of worldly Luſts; the Attention of the Mind diverted from them, and all the Eſſays to do them, be hindered by the Amuſements of ſenſual Pleaſure, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of ſecular Buſineſs, the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of bad Cuſtoms and Examples. The Capacities with which they are made, the Principles with which they are endowed, in order to their knowing of, and acting agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to, moral Obligations, might be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008354_0026_102F3AC739BFA548"/>
and kept down by violent Appetites and Paſſions, and lie buried under earthly Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Men might have been abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World;— without any Senſe of the Deity upon theit Minds; without all Thought of any other Things than ſuch as were juſt before them. Their Knowledge and Care might not have extended beyond the Sphere of Senſe: Their Prudence might have appear'd only in Matters of a civil Life, and a temporary Concern; and poſſibly there wou'd have been no Religion in the World, but that which conſiſted merely in, as Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts ſay, all was introduced by, <hi>State-Policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS much, I think, may be probably inferred from the Hiſtory of all Ages of the World, in which the Nations which have not enjoyed the Revelation which God from Time to Time granted to his Church, have had ſo little of Natural Religion among them, mixed and ſpoiled with the groſſeſt Errors, Superſtitions, and Abominations. The Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of Nature's Light, and ſmall Remains of it's Strength, not being duly improved, were, in a manner, loſt from among them, and they <hi>ſat in Darkneſs, and the Region of the Shadow of Death:</hi> Thô what might be known of God, was manifeſt to them in his Works; and they had moreover ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Traditions, which gave Riſe to their heatheniſh Worſhip, and according to which they ordered the Rites of it. While we are amaz'd at the Stupidity which they labour'd

under in their reaſonable Faculties, it ſheweth us what is to be expected from ſavage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined Nature. We do not argue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from the Incapacity of human Reaſon, under all the Diſadvantages of our lapſed State, to know and do better; but the Inefficacy of it, in fact, to the Purpoſes of Religion, when unaſſiſted by Revelation.—And were it not for this, we may gueſs what a deplorable State of Ignorance and Wickedneſs, increaſing from one Age to another, all Mankind would have been in at this Day. What hath poliſhed Nature and refined Reaſon to boaſt of, in Matters of Religion, among the wiſeſt and moſt learned of the Heathens? Did they <hi>by Wiſdom know God, and glorify Him as God.</hi> Did <hi>Athens,</hi> that Eye of the World, ſee the <hi>inviſible Things of Him,</hi> made viſible enough in his Works to the Eye of human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>even his eternal Power and God-head?</hi> The Altar erected there to the UNKNOWN GOD, was a Monument of their Ignorance of the true. If they worſhipped Him at all, they <hi>did it ignorantly, and were in all Things too ſuperſtitious.</hi> Was the State of natural Religion better at <hi>Rome,</hi> when Learning flouriſhed there, than that of the Chriſtian is, now Popery prevails? They, <hi>who profeſſed themſelves wiſe, became Fools;</hi> as great, as if <hi>they had ſaid, There is no God,</hi> in <hi>changing the Glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beaſts, and creeping Things;</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:008354_0028_102F3ACB7A977B30"/>
and, <hi>ſerving the Creature, more than the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> and approving and doing thoſe Things that are contrary, not only to the Religion, but even the Inclination of Nature. — Under much Doubt and Uncertainty have the ableſt Writers of them left the firſt Principles of Natural Religion. It is enough (ſaith one) to raiſe the Pity of a Chriſtian, when he reads <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the <hi>Nature of the Gods,</hi> to find the Diſputants fighting in the dark, puzzling themſelves, and one another, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Truth and Error; and at laſt draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off almoſt on equal Terms without Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory's declaring on either Side.—Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Deficiencies and Errors in any Scheme of Natural Religion, which the learned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ever preſented the World with; I may ſay, that the Chriſtian Revelation contains one far more entire and ſatisfying. The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Duties of it are therein ſtated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and enforced, in a Way far above whatever they were before. And 'tis not without Reaſon ſuppoſed, that they would not have been propounded ſo clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they be, in the moſt celebrated Writings of Morality among the Heathen, had there been none of divine Inſpiration among the People of God.</p>
            <p>THE Goſpel of Chriſt hath to be ſure been <hi>a Light to lighten the</hi> modern deiſtical <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> For the juſter Notions they have of the divine Attributes, and moral Duties than the ancient, they are greatly indebted to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008354_0029_102F3AD12CF5E340"/>
which they decry. Not to ſay any Thing of thoſe heavenly Truths and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Duties, which are taught only in the Bible; 'tis there we learn the Religion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it's greateſt Purity; which, if there were nothing more to be ſaid in it's Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation might be enough to raiſe our Eſteem of it. And the Grace of God appears in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Reaſon by Revelation in thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, which it poſſibly could, but never did, nor would make, without ſuch Help. — And the ſame is true, with reſpect to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of Duty: <hi>In thy Light we ſee Light.</hi> It is in the Light of Revelation, added to that of Nature, that Things are ſo plain and eaſy to our diſcerning, as that we are ready to think bare Reaſon muſt diſcover them to all Mankind, and that we, un-enlightned by the Goſpel, ſhould have known as much of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion. But, if we are thence inſenſible of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful for, <hi>the tender Mercy of our God,</hi> whereby <hi>the Day-ſpring from on High hath viſited us,</hi> we are ſtupidly inconſiderate; and need not (as we are apt) to ſmile at the odd Philoſophy of the ſimple <hi>Ruſtick,</hi> who thought the World had little Benefit by the Light of the Sun, "Becauſe it ſhin'd in the Day-time." By Means of Revelation we have the right Uſe of Reaſon, in Matters of Religion: And, by the due Exerciſe of Reaſon, ſo excited and directed, we have the ineſtimable Benefit of Revelation. Both are <hi>good Gifts,</hi>—Rays from
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008354_0030_102F3AD406A4BAB8"/>
               <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> to <hi>enlighten every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> — The Mind hath great Satisfaction in obſerving the harmonious Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, and the Objects of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Knowledge and Faith appear the more beautiful and amiable in this double Light: And the better we underſtand and practiſe the Religion of Nature, the wiſer and better Chriſtians ſhall we be.</p>
            <p>IN a juſt Senſe of this, and with a pious View to the Eſtabliſhment of Religion, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and revealed, and the Propagation of it in this Land, free from impure Mixtures of Heatheniſh and Popiſh Errors and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the Miniſtry of able, authorized Preachers, was the Anniverſary-Lecture, here founded by the Honourable Judge DUDLEY, whoſe Memory muſt be ever precious in this Society, as his Praiſe will be in our Churches, as well as Courts.</p>
            <p>AND this Diſcourſe may lead the Students of the College, ſuch eſpecially as are deſign'd for the Work of the Miniſtry, to reflect on the great Advantage of a liberal Education, to open and enlarge their Minds for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and diſpoſe their Hearts to the Love and Practice, and fit them to be Preachers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.— Academical Studies, particularly in natural Philoſophy and mathematical Sciences, tend to impregnate your Souls with grand Ideas of the Attributes of God, diſplayed in his Works, <hi>which are great, ſought out of all them that have Pleaſure therein;</hi> and help you
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008354_0031_102F3AD6C73BA770"/>
more clearly to diſcern the Foundations of natural Religion. Some other Branches of Literature may ſeem more dry and barren, yet are uſeful to furniſh you with the Tongue of the Learned; and prepare you to the Search of the Scriptures in their inſpired Originals; ſo that at thoſe Fountains of ſacred Truth, your Souls, thirſty of it, may poſſibly drink it in purer, than it is convey'd to us in the beſt Tranſlations. All the Skill you here acquire in Arts and Sciences, may be ſerviceable to you in the Profeſſion of <hi>Theology:</hi> And the better Scholars you go from this Place, the abler Divines will you prove, and the more Good may you do in the World. Having ſuch a Price in your Hands to get Wiſdom, may every One of you have a Head and Heart to it!—How reproachful will it be to you, and not a little diſhonourable to this School of the Prophets, if, when for the Time and happy Advantages enjoyed in it, ye ought to be Teachers, you ſhould then have need that one teach you the Rudiments of natural Religion, and the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God?</p>
            <p>IT concerns us all to make Proficiency in Religion, anſwerable to our Capacities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, and the Means and Helps afforded us thereto—That having the Foundations of it well laid in our Minds, by convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and authentic Teſtimonies of Scripture, we go on to Perfection: Which that we may do;—Let us, as the Diſcourſe now had, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes

us, have a due Reſpect both to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and revealed Religion: And not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Zeal to ſwell ſo high, and move in ſo ſtrong a Current towards the one, as ſhall prove a Drain from, and lower the Regard, which we owe to the other—Let us faithfully improve all the Light and Strength which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon and divine Revelation ſupply, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our knowing and doing <hi>whatſoever Things are true — honeſt — juſt —pure—lovely—and of good Report — in which there is any Virtue, and any Praiſe;</hi> and ſo make continual Advance in Religion, 'till we come unto <hi>a perfect Man,</hi> in the redintegrated State of Nature—<hi>unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of CHRIST.</hi>

            <p>YEſterday, with great Decency and Reſpect, were interr'd here the Remains of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable PAUL DUDLEY, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Chief-Juſtice of the Superior Court of Judicature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within this Province: A Gentleman not more diſtinguiſhed by his high Station, than by his eminent Virtues and great Abilities, ſo long and happily employ'd for the Good of the Public.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Roxbury</hi> in the Year 1675, was the Grandſon of THOMAS DUDLEY, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the firſt Governors of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colony, and the eldeſt ſurviving Son of the late Governor DUDLEY, to whoſe
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008354_0034_102F3ADF1076C090"/>
Eſtate, as he was principal Heir, ſo he inherited a large Share of thoſe ſuperior Talents that enrich'd the Mind of that great and accompliſh'd Gentleman.</p>
            <p>At the Age of eleven Years he was found qualified for an Admiſſion into <hi>Harvard</hi>-College, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Batchelor of Arts in the Year 1690, and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Arts in the Year 1693. Soon after which he went over to <hi>England,</hi> and was enter'd a Student in the Inner-Temple. After he had finiſhed his Studies there, and had been called to the Bar, he return'd to his native Country, to the Service of which he had early devoted himſelf.</p>
            <p>As his natural Endowments were uncommon, ſo he had abundantly furniſhed his Mind by great Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cloſe Study. His Knowledge (far from being confin'd to the Law) was great in moſt Parts of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He was well verſed in Natural Philoſophy; an honourable Proof of which was his being a Member of the ROYAL SOCIETY: He had thoroughly ſtudied Divinity: And in Hiſtory, both civil and ſacred, he had ſcarce an equal. Theſe were ſome of the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments which ſo well qualified him for public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which was the conſtant Buſineſs of his Life.</p>
            <p>Upon his Return to <hi>New-England</hi> he was appointed Attorney-General for the Province, and for ſeveral Years he ſerved the Public in that Capacity. He was ſome time a Repreſentative for his native Town in the General Court; and ſate for many Years at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Board: In all which important Offices he acquitted himſelf with great Fidelity and Honour. But it was in the Seat of Juſtice he was moſt generally known, and therefore moſt admir'd. To that he was advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Year 1718, being then appointed one of the Juſtices of the Superior Court, of which, upon the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008354_0035_102F3AE0AA0ACD58"/>
Death of the Honourable Judge LYNDE, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated the Chief-Juſtice: And in this high and important Station he ſerved the Province till his Death. Here it was that he diſplay'd ſo eminently his admirable Talents, eſpecially his quick Apprehenſion, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Strength of Memory, and extenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and at the ſame time his great Abhorrence of Vice, together with that impartial Juſtice which neither reſpected the Rich, nor countenanced the Poor Man in his Cauſe. Thus while with pure Hands and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Heart he adminiſtred Juſtice in his Circuit through the Province, he gain'd the general Eſteem and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the People. As his Preſence always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Reſpect, ſo it might juſtly be ſaid of him that he ſcatter'd Iniquity with his Eyes, which ſtruck with Awe the moſt daring Offenders. When he ſpake, it was with ſuch Authority and peculiar Energy of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as never fail'd to command Attention, and deeply impreſs the Minds of all who heard him; and his Sentiments of Law and Evidence in all Cauſes before the Court, had generally a determining Weight with thoſe who were charged with the Trial of them.</p>
            <p>The Powers of his Mind retain'd their Vigour to a remakable Degree in his advanced Age; though he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd under great Indiſpoſitions of Body: Theſe were often heavy upon him while attending the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Court, which perhaps occaſioned his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſome Impatience, when Arguments at the Bar were drawn out to a great Length, and his expreſſing himſelf with ſome Appearance of Severity: But if hereby he gave any Diſguſt in public, he made full A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for it in private; where all who enjoy'd his Company were charm'd with his entertaining and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Converſation: For, with all his other Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he had naturally a moſt happy Turn for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; in which he always ſhew'd the Gentleman, the Scholar, and the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:008354_0036_102F17FCDD609588"/>As he early made a Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo he was ever careful to adorn it by a ſuitable Conduct in the ſeveral Relations of Life. He always expreſs'd a tender Concern for the Intereſts of his Country, both civil and religious, and greatly lamented any ill-boding Aſpects upon either. He was a Friend and Patron to Men of Learning and Religion, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Clergy, to whom he always ſhew'd a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reſpect. The Intereſts of our College he tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded while he lived; and at his Death he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd it by a generous Donation.</p>
            <p>All who had the Honour of an Acquaintance with him and his Family, knew him to be one of the moſt tender Huſbands, a kind and indulgent Maſter, a good Neighbour, and an affectionate Friend. As in his own Houſe his Behaviour was truly exemplary; ſo he was an eminent Pattern of juſt Deportment in the Houſe of GOD: His unaffected Gravity and devout Attention, while engag'd in Divine Service there, ſhew'd him to be what he was at Heart, a Man of real Religion. This Religion was his Support and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the Hour of Death. He had the Exerciſe of his Reaſon during the whole of his Sickneſs; and all along diſcover'd that Humility, Patience, Charity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his GOD and SAVIOUR, which one would wiſh to ſee in a dying Friend.</p>
            <p>His vertuous Conſort, (to whom he owed no ſmall Part of the Happineſs of his Life,) was one of the Daughters of Colonel JOHN WAINWRIGHT of <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> By her he had ſeveral Children, who all died in their Infancy. This Lady ſtill lives to deplore her great Loſs, and mingle her Tears with thoſe of the Public.</p>
