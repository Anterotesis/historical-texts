            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">In a<hi> SERMON </hi>preached at<hi> Horſlydown, </hi>the 24th day of December 1738, in a meeting of the people called<hi> Quakers, </hi>by Mr.<hi> Thomas Story.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is written in the holy ſcripture. That "without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God," which I think plainly implies, that by faith we may pleaſe him. And if we ſhould be ſo injurious to the divine attributes, and hurtful to ourſelves in our higheſt intereſts, as to think of the Almighty, that he is ſuch a Being as that we can never pleaſe him, or to conceive an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty incumbent upon us to pleaſe him, and yet that to remain impoſſible for us, would be the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Thought, and we ſhould be the moſt miſerable of all creatures.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Lord is to be pleaſed by faith, and not to be pleaſed without it, we may hope and expect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the attributes of his infinite goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; that he hath, or will afford the means of faith; and it is expreſsly ſaid, that faith is the gift of God.</p>
            <p>As to the means of faith towards God, that he is, That is afforded to mankind in general; though there is an order of perſons among them of whom the Lord doth not require faith, that is of infants, becauſe they are not capable of it in this ſenſe; theſe, through his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he hath taken into the arms of his mercy, and his own protection, they are under his own care: But as to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:046881_0005_1022439003886758"/>the reſt of mankind, who are arrived at a rational ſtate, and capable of believing in God, he juſtly expects that all ſuch ſhould believe in him.</p>
            <div n="1" type="means">
               <p>As the Almighty hath made us rational creatures, and beſtowed upon us proper ſenſes, whereby we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and perceive the viſible Creation of God, in that beautiful manner and order in which it appears.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt means of faith that God hath afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto mankind, and it is univerſal, and altogether ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the ends propoſed by it; for every rational perſon, in every nation under Heaven, looking upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars, himſelf, and the reſt of the Creation of God around him, is compelled even by his own underſtanding, under a due conſideration of the great and wiſe work of the Creation, to refer back from the creatures to the Creator, and determine poſitively and abſolutely that he is, and is eternal and infinite in his Being, and that he hath in himſelf, eternally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably, all thoſe attributes commonly aſcribed unto him; that he is almighty in power, and all-wiſe; for nothing leſs than infinite almighty power and unlimited wiſdom, could produce the viſible creation, and ſupport it in that order in which we ſee it. And the ſenſes which God hath given us are ſo well adapted to the cognizance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and perceive them as they really are.</p>
               <p>And to remain a little longer upon the ſame ſubject; the Apoſtle ſaith, <q>That whoſoever cometh to God muſt arſt believe that he is,</q> and that he is a rewarder of all thoſe who diligently ſeek him; this is a very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional poſition; for he who doth not firſt ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Being of God, will never ſeek to know him, nor conſider him as a rewarder of thoſe who ſeek him.</p>
               <p>He therefore who believes the Being of God muſt ſeek him, and that not coldly and indifferently, but with a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:046881_0006_102243918C8E2838"/>real concern, and engagement of mind, and true deſire to know him; for the knowledge of God is of the higheſt importance to us. For if we were able to know our own bodies, and every particular particle of them; and the cauſe and manner of the connection of them; and the manner of the connection of our bodies and minds, which are of Natures very different one from the other; or the gradations and medium in which they do meet; or the mode of the exiſtence of the mind, in a ſtate of ſeperation from the body; or if we could know the whole creation of God, and every particular part of it; and yet ignorant of the Lord himſelf, and deprived of the enjoyment of his divine preſence, that knowledge would not ſatisfy the ſoul; nothing can do that rightly but the knowledge of the Lord himſelf, in a ſtate of eternal life with him, and in him.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo ſeek to know the Lord in his moral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and character: By his mercy, juſtice, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, truth, goodneſs, patience, long-ſuffering, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; in all which if we are duly exerciſed and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, we ſhall know the Lord God in his divine eſſence, as he is love. And that exerciſe is known after this manner. As all have ſinned and come ſhort of the knowledge of the glory of God ſome one way and ſome another, but all againſt the one true and living God. And as we have ſinned againſt him in various inſtances, doing that which is not juſt before him, for which the ſpirit of Chriſt, who is his witneſs and righteouſneſs, hath judged and condemned us in our own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereby we know, in our own experience, the Lord is juſt and righteous; likewiſe, in ſome inſtances in the courſe of life we have been untrue, and partial in our own favour, and reſpecters of perſons in unjuſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of others; for which we have ſuffered condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the ſpirit of truth in our own hearts, by which we know he is truth, ſince our untruth and falſhood are reproved by him and judged. And ſo far as we have ſinned in any ſort, we have defiled ourſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:046881_0007_10224393B9B5AE80"/>in mind and body, and offended againſt the holineſs of God; and yet, through his infinite unſpeakable love and goodneſs he hath had mercy upon us, and exerciſed patience and long-ſuffering towards us, ſhown us our ſins, by the light of his divine grace, and thereby taught us repentance unfeigned, and pardoned all our ſins, through Chriſt the beloved, whereby we are aſſured for ever, that our God is infinitely perfect in mercy, juſtice, truth, righteouſneſs, goodneſs, long-ſuffering, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; to the endleſs and never ceaſing praiſe of his eternal name: and that by the holy influence and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his divine love, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the ſcriptures of the new teſtament do likewiſe witneſs, that the very ſame perſon, attended with all thoſe various circumſtances, did come into the world, according to the very letter of thoſe predictions, and did the things predicted of him, in the ſight of the people, of the Jews in that age, (to whom he was ſent) and made his departure out of the world according to thoſe prophecies.

               <p>Would ſuch men be ſo ſerved by the reſt of mankind? Would they not be believed when they relate matters of fact of which they are eye witneſſes, or what they have heard? Would any of them have another to ſay he is no witneſs of what he ſaith, but a forger of falſehood, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of lies? I may reaſonably conclude they would
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:046881_0010_102252993A52F820"/>not, even in minute things; if then they themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be believed in what they ſay or witneſs, though in things of little conſequence, why ſhould they pretend to ſuſpect the veracity of others equally creditable, and much more ſo than they? Surely the prophets of God, and apoſtles of Chriſt, and their teſtimonies, with the concurrence of the beſt and wiſeſt of men through ages, in the affirmative, ought, in common reaſon, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and take place, againſt all the negative diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and wranglings of a few bold and ignorant men, who neither know or believe any thing of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truths of the goſpel, or what themſelves affirm or deny concerning them: Would ſuch think it reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that a few men born blind, ſhould oppoſe the reſt of mankind, and deny that any ſee becauſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are blind.</p>
               <p>Common credit is to be given among mankind one to another, in things of the higheſt as well as the loweſt conſequence; or elſe no innocent perſon could be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the falſehood and oppreſſion of the blackeſt and moſt envious calumny. No wronged perſon righted: No buſineſs of any moment carried on: No criminal, how guilty ſoever of the greateſt crimes laid to his charge, could be convicted, and brought to condign puniſhment, unleſs credit can be given to thoſe who are eye and ear witneſſes of matters of fact, which they have heard or ſeen.</p>
               <p>The judges among the Jews, according to their judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial law and national order, could not judge of any crime, but by the teſtimony of two or three witneſſes. And according to the conſtitution of our own nation, no judge is witneſs of any matter of fact, or offence, by words, objected againſt any criminal, or offender; but muſt judge according to the report of a jury, before whom matters and things have been proved, by witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es furniſhed with proper credentials, and duly qualified.

                  </gap>ite, much more is it neceſſary, that due credit be given by the children of men with reſpect to thoſe great and important facts we read of in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth, concerning the ſtupendous miracles wrought by Chriſt the Son of God, ſo openly done in many inſtances, before ſo many people, and in divers times and places, and authenticly reported unto us by proper witneſſes.</p>
               <p>But to command all diſtempers to be gone: To mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply natural food to ſo great a degree, and that in two great inſtances, before ſo great multitudes of people, who themſelves did partake thereof: to call the dead out of the grave, and the like, in the ſight of multitudes of people, things ſo far tranſcending the underſtandings and knowledge of poor mortals, that they are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there cannot be any ſuch things; and being blinded by corrupt deſires and appetites, ſenſual luſts and liberties of divers kinds, deſtructive of a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the things of God, and ruinous to the ſoul, they reject the truth.</p>
               <p>This is the foundation of all infidelity, concerning theſe matters and things recorded in the holy ſcriptures, touching Chriſt the Lord, and ſo reaſonably proved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying of Chriſt to the like ſort in that day, "Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtify that we have ſeen; and ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not our witneſs. If I have told you carthly things, and ye believe not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath aſcended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man which is in Heaven. And as Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be liſted up: That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:046881_0012_1022529D0E6BC1D8"/>eternal life. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life, For God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world: but that the world through him might be ſaved. He that believeth on him is not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But he that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God." John 3.11 to 21.</p>
               <p>Again, how canſt thou comprehend by thy reaſon, or all the faculties of thy mind, that a pure, infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit as God is, free from all corporiety, could produce ſuch a mighty ſubſtance as the dead and ſolid earth, ſo contrary in nature to a ſpiritual being. This may be above thy capacity to conceive, and yet if thou doſt not believe it, thou art ſcarce a rational creature, ſince (as ſuch) thou art compelled to believe, that the earth did not produce itſelf, but that its being is owing to another and more excellent cauſe.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing theſe things are above the reach of thy underſtanding, how and after what manner it could be ſo produced, yet, ſince thy ſenſes declare and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge its real being, that it is what it appears to be, and thou muſt believe thy ſenſes, againſt all the perverſe reaſonings thou or others can advance. Why then canſt thou not believe, that

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:046881_0013_1022529EE7854B58"/>the ſame wiſdom and power of God by whom all things were made and do exiſt, who gave being and life to mankind, and ſo well and reaſonably atteſted.</p>
               <p>Was it not the ſpirit and power of the Almighty Creator of all worlds that dwelt in that holy perſon, who acted in him and by him? And what other wiſdom or power could do them? For he aſſumed not the glory ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe works or his ſayings to himſelf as a man; but he told the people plainly, and often,(and it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our inſtruction <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Thus God, in his great goodneſs and mercy, hath afforded us the teſtimony of the holy ſcriptures in our own language, as inſtrumental MEANS of faith in the Son of God, and, by his good providence, given and continued them hitherto, unto all Chriſtendom, in their ſeveral tongues, for the ſame end (theſe only excepted who have yielded themſelves captives and ſlaves to an antichriſtian power, by which they are deprived of them, and of the information to be had therein, and of their ſenſes and underſtandings in the things of God as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures.)

               <p>They who walk and dwell in the divine light of the Son of God, cannot be deceived concerning the things of God, but they who dwell in darkneſs, the prince of the power of the darkneſs of this world can come upon them unaware, and ſurpriſe them; even all thoſe (as well as others) who profeſs to believe in the light of the Son of God (and to be born of God) who is the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the eternal and never changing day, and yet walk in darkneſs and in its gloomy ſhades and ways.</p>
               <p>O! then, take the ſaving counſel of Chriſt the Son of God, which he gave of old and ſtill giveth, <q>Believe in the light.</q> In God who is the light, and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt who is the eternal emanation of the Father's glory, that ſo you may become children of that light and holy day of God, which even now, in ſome degree, ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in your hearts and minds, and gives you knowledge of the true and living God, which you can never acquire

               <p>The true God therefore is come near unto mankind, even in our own hearts and in our own nature, that as the Son is made partaker of human nature by the will of the Father, and therewith cloathed, ſo we likewiſe by the ſame will, through the glorious work of regeneration, might be cloathed with the divine nature, in our inner man, and made partakers thereof in him: That as we could not do the will of God, nor pleaſe him as we ought, in our firſt and animal ſtate and nature, becauſe of the weakneſs, ignorance, darkneſs and uncleanneſs

               <p>But though this divine light, thus veiled, is glorious, ſo that we cannot behold him with open face, ſo long as we are ſinful and impure, and his appearance, through our own darkneſs, ſeems then but ſmall and glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hardly perceptible; yet if we ſincerely believe in the leaſt appearance thus of the Son of God, and follow the views we have thereby, in abſtaining from evil things, and in ſaying, doing, or ſuffering, as he calleth and leadeth, though in ſmall things, according to our ſtrength, we ſhall then, ſtill more and more, proceed and increaſe in the knowledge of him, and the Father in and by him, to our complete redemption and ſalvation in due time, to the glory of God and the Lamb, and to our own eternal and unſpeakable peace and joy.</p>
               <p>And if we make right uſe of the underſtanding which God hath thus given unto us, unto his glory, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it to our comfort, and give us more and more the knowledge of himſelf, and of his ways.

Many of us, in the times of our convincement of the truth of God, having a glimpſe of him who we had pierced by our tranſgreſſions, were ſorrowful and wept abundantly, becauſe of our ſins, and the offences of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, againſt the pure, holy, juſt and good God, our Creator; but then, ſuperexalted glory be given, as due to our God, all our ſins being forgiven, through his mercy declared by Chriſt the Lord, and the ſtains and pollutions of our tranſgreſſions wiped away, by the ſoul-baptizing ſhames of Divine Love, the tears of joy flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the eyes many times, in a ſolid ſenſe of that love moving in our hearts, far tranſcended the tears of ſorrow. The miniſtration of condemnation is glorious in its time, but the miniſtration of juſtification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation unto our Creator, through divine and heart-melting love, is more glorious, and in that holy love, and the life of it is God, who is love, moſt acceptably adored.</p>
               <p>The minds of mankind have departed from the true and living God, and gone a whoring after other gods of their own ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore, O ye young ones, and of all ranks and ſexes here to-day, abſtain from all vain and hurtful things, and labour with holy and ſervent zeal, more and more after the knowledge of God, and to pleaſe him by all the means which he hath afforded, that you may not be ſound wanting: that there may not be ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſcription found againſt any of you as againſt ſome of old, who were ſporting themſelves in their exceſſes,

               <p>Yet there is a more excellent kingdom, even the kingdom of Heaven, offered unto us: For in that day when the inhabitants of this land were greatly departed from Charity, the bond of Chriſtian peace, and gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Enmity, ſect againſt ſect, party againſt party, and one againſt another, contending unto a ſea of blood, for various opinions, about what they called Religion, theſe works ſo contrary to the nature and end of the Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then it was that the Almighty aroſe in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his divine light, and therein manifeſted himſelf to a hidden People ſcattered among the multitudes in the Nations who were ſincerely ſeeking the Lord with all their ſouls, and unto them it pleaſed him to reveal his kingdom, and by the cogent force of his Divine Grace and Love, to draw them together into one mind the mind of Chriſt, and to ſettle them therein, as one Body, a Holy Nation, a Royal Prieſthood, and Peculiar People unto himſelf, zealous of goods Works, in a ſtate of innocence and holineſs of his own working in them; freed from the blind, furious and deſtructive zeal of the frenzy multitude in that day, and by the example doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and nature of the Prince of Peace, their divine Holy Head and Law-giver, renounced the deſtructive carnal weapons of war and blood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Is God therefore a reſpecter of perſons, or Nations, or parties, that it pleaſed him to make choice of that people, and paſſed by the main body of thoſe in the land, and many more worthy in the ſight of men than they? No, that I do not mean; but the Moſt High, in the council of his wiſdom and goodneſs, and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and exaltation of his power, and purpoſes of his own glory, and their ſalvation, called them by his grace to believe in his only begotten Son, the Word of Life, as revealed in their hearts.</p>
               <p>And according to the courſe of the good Providence of God, and his way of working in the earth, now as of

               <p>And, notwithſtanding the goodneſs of God to the laſt generation, who believed in his eternal word, and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and the offers of ſalvation unto this preſent age, the offspring of the laſt, and unto the people of this land in general, as alſo unto other Nations; if we, or they who now profeſs the ſame truth and Saviour in words before men, and keep together in one body or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in any outward manner only, under any forms of worſhip, or rules of diſcipline left by them, if we, or any among us, ſhould apoſtatize from the grace, light and Spirit of the Son of God, and proceed, or ſet up in our own ſtrength, craft and earthly wiſdom, and become rich therein, in our own eyes: then the Lord will
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:046881_0031_10226046634FEEA8"/>leave us to our own blind conduct, as he hath ever done all ſuch, and ever will throughout all generations, and then we ſhall juſtly fall, as they have done, below the world, as the unſavory ſalt, and be trodden under the feet of men.</p>
               <p>But if you, who are of this preſent Generation, and profeſs the truth of God by tradition only, and not by convincement by the Spirit of Chriſt in your own hearts, will anſwer the invitation of God, who is ſtriving with you, immediately; and inſtrumentally by his miniſters, who have no pay from you, nor deſire any of any kind, who ſeek not yours but you, and that not unto ourſelves but to the Lord, and embrace the eternal and preſent Truth freely, the Lord will exalt all ſuch above the world, and all the vain glories, and ſinful luſts, and pleaſures therein.</p>
               <p>But bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, he ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues us as a people to his own glory; for as the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the firſt generation under this diſpenſation came up from their childhood in nature, embraced the traditions of their fathers, before they know the truth, yet being in God's appointed time, convinced in their own hearts, of the holy Spirit of Chriſt, of the truth and of the diſpenſation of God unto his people at that time, it then became the Religion of their judgment and experience, and not by tradition only.</p>
               <p>And if we, in this preſent age, continue to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto God, and the teſtimony of truth which came unto them and unto us, and grow up higher and higher in virtue, and in the nature of Chriſt and his kingdom of peace and love, the ages ſucceeding, embracing and remaining in the ſame faith, peace and love, will ſtill aſcend higher and higher in the ſame, as one man, from ſtature to ſtature, faith to faith, grace to grace, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory, until the whole body, and all who ſhall be gathered thereunto, by the Spirit and Power of the Lord, ſhall arrive, through the infinite power and wiſdom of the Higheſt, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:046881_0032_10226048030CDA70"/>of Chriſt, as the church, which is his Body and Spouſe, the fulneſs of him who filleth all in all.</p>
               <p>But once more I ſay, if we ſhould be ſo unhappy as to apoſtatize from the life of Chriſt in us, and ſit down under an empty ſhow and form of religion and worſhip, without the thing itſelf, we ſhall fall ſhort of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God (which God forbid) as many communities, who began well in their days, and ran well for a ſeaſon, though their ſucceſſors have profeſſed the ſame truths according to the degrees of manifeſtation, have fallen ſhort of the truth, and utterly failed; from which the Lord himſelf, our only help, ſupport and aid, preſerve us, and I hope he will, for his own name and glory, preſerve us.</p>
               <p>My friends, God Almighty is not to be ſtopt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his common courſe; he will always have a people to believe in him, obey him, wait upon him and worſhip him in the Spirit of his Son, Chriſt the Lord, the Eternal Truth; as a holy elect ſeed, to love, fear and ſerve him.</p>
               <p>O, ſaith my ſoul, that we may ſo behave ourſelves, as that we may ever be and remain in the favour of God, and every name under the divine and peaceable govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy Truth, in the whole courſe of their lives, in our morals and every thing we do or ſay, then the Lord will cauſe his righteouſneſs to go before us, and his day more and more to ariſe upon us, even the Son of Righteouſneſs, with divine healing virtue as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wings.
