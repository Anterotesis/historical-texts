            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS you profeſs to know the Scriptures, I need not inform you that the Character of young <hi>Elihu</hi> ſhines in the 32d Chapter of the Book of <hi>Job</hi> with a ſuperiour Luſtre, above thoſe other three Friends that came to converſe with him. The Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Modeſty wherewith he firſt addreſſes himſelf to them is peculiarly amiable—<q>I am young, ſays he, and ye are very old, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was afraid, and durſt not ſhew you my Opinion—I ſaid, Days ſhould ſpeak, and Multitudes of Years ſhould teach Wiſdom.</q>—But knowing by Experience, <q>that Great Men are not always wiſe,</q> neither do the aged underſtand Judgment, he ſaid, <q>hearken unto me, and I alſo will ſhew my Opinion</q>—And that they might not cenſure him for Raſhneſs in ſpeaking, he aſſures them, Verſes 11, and 12, that he had well weighed the Matter before he broke Silence—<q>Behold I waited for your Words; I gave Ear to your <hi>Reaſons,</hi> whilſt you ſearched out what to ſay—Yea, I attended unto you: and behold there was none of you that convinceth <hi>Job,</hi> or that anſwered his Words</q>—And that they might not be offended at his <hi>plain Speaking,</hi> or expect that he wou'd be over awed from delivering his Soul, by their Superiority in Age, Learning or Circumſtances of Life, in the two laſt Verſes of the Chapter, He bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but honeſtly tells them what they were to expect from him—<q>Let me not I pray you, accept any Man's Perſon, neither let me give flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Titles unto Man, for I know not to give flattering Titles—In ſo doing my Maker wou'd ſoon take me away</q>—And its very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remarkable
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005713_0003_1026CEA6864F0168"/>
that tho' we are told this young Man's Wrath was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Job</hi> and his three Friends, Verſes 2, and 3, and tho' (as it appears from the enſuing Chapters) He ſpoke very cloſe and cutting Things, yet at the End of the Book, we find no blame laid on him by the Great Heart-Searching God—whereas the other three are ſeverely reprov'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to apply to <hi>Job</hi> for the Benefit of his Prayers.</p>
            <p>Animated by and willing to Copy after ſo bright an Example, I now ſit down to write you this Letter; in which I wou'd beg Leave to make ſome Remarks on your Right Reverend Dioceſan's late Charge againſt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm</hi>—Had I continued in my native Country, I ſhou'd have taken the Freedom to have written to his Lordſhip himſelf; but as I heard that he was very aged, and probably before this cou'd reach <hi>England,</hi> might be call'd to give up his Account to the great Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls, I thought it moſt adviſeable to direct this Letter to you, at whoſe Requeſt, as appears by the Title Page, this Charge was printed—</p>
            <p>It is not my Deſign to enter upon a critical Examination of every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph—I would obſerve in general, that his Lordſhip's main Deſign from the Beginning to the End of it is to prove, <q>that the indwelling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Witneſſing of the Spirit in Believers Hearts (if there were ever any ſuch Things at all) as alſo praying and preaching by the Spirit, are all the extraordinary Gifts and Operations of the Holy-Ghoſt, belonging only to the Apoſtolical and primitive Times, and conſequently all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to ſuch Favours in theſe laſt Days are vain and <hi>Enthuſiaſtical</hi>
               </q>—In order to evince this, his Lordſhip ſelects ſeveral Paſſages of holy Writ, which in his Opinion are miſapply'd by thoſe whom his Lordſhip is pleaſed to ſtile <hi>modern Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and undertakes to ſhew, Page 11th <q>that they are to be interpreted chiefly, if not only of the State of the apoſtolical and primitive Church, and that they very little if at all relate to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Chriſtians</q>—Whether or not, his Lordſhip hath ſucceeded in his undertaking, will beſt appear by a candid and impartial Review of it—</p>
            <p>The firſt Attempt of this Nature which we meet with in his Lordſhip's Charge is Page the 12th. His words are theſe—<q>That I may proceed in a regular Manner, with regard to thoſe Paſſages of Scripture that I ſhall ſelect on this Occaſion, I chuſe to begin with the original Promiſe of the Spirit, as made by our Lord a little before he left the World—It occurs in the 14th and 16th Chapters of St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel; in which he uſes theſe words: <hi>when the Spirit of truth is come</hi> (whom Chriſt had juſt before promis'd to ſend from the Father) <hi>Chap.</hi> 14<hi>th, verſe</hi> 16<hi>th, He will guide you into all Truth, and be will ſhew you Things to come</hi>
               </q>—And again, <q>
                  <hi>the Comforter, which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all Things, and bring all Things to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> It is very clear (proceeds
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005713_0004_1026CEE2233EEF18"/>
his Lordſhip) from the bear recital of theſe Words, that as they were ſpoken to the Apoſtles, ſo they Peculiarly belong to the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to the inſpired Perſons in the primitive Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But granting that theſe Words do belong <hi>peculiarly</hi> to the Apoſtles, does it therefore follow, that they do not <hi>at all</hi> belong to their Succeſſors, or in common to all Believers upon whom the Ends of the World are come? Were not the Apoſtles then Repreſentatives of the whole Church? And may not what was ſpoken to them in a <hi>proper degree</hi> be ſaid to be ſpoken to us and to our Children, and to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call? Does not his Lordſhip confeſs, Page 13th <q>that in one of theſe Paſſages it is added, <hi>that the Father will give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter that he may abide with you forever?</hi> And does not his Lordſhip allow, page 14th, that in <hi>the largeſt ſenſe,</hi> in which this may be underſtood it is ſynonymous with Chriſt's Promiſe to his Diſciples at his Aſcenſion, that he would be <hi>with them always even to the End of the World</hi>
               </q> that is (as himſelf explains it) <q>by the perpetual Preſence of the holy Spirit, as the Guardian of his Church 'till the end of the World?</q> But how can Chriſt be with his Church by the <hi>perpetual Preſence</hi> of his Spirit, or how can the holy Spirit <q>be the Guardian of his Church 'till the End of the World,</q> unleſs it is by opening and bringing all Things to our Remembrance whatſoever Jeſus hath ſaid to us in his revealed Will, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us thereby into all Truth, and teaching us all Things neceſſary to eternal Salvation?</p>
            <p>This Promiſe, it's true, as his Lordſhip obſerves, Page the 15th, <q>was fulfilled in a moſt ſolemn Manner by the Deſcent of the holy Spirit on the Apoſtles, and others with them at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, that is recorded ſo very particularly in the 2d. Chap. of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. And it is as true (as his Lordſhip intimates pag. 16th) that St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes an Application, of the Prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> to the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Effuſion of the Spirit on that memorable Occaſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But does not his Lordſhip by intimating that this Promiſe of our Lord was wholly compleated on the Day of Pentecoſt, prove too much? For does it not then follow that no one after the Day of Pentecoſt was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Holy Ghoſt to bring all Things to their Remembrance, to teach them all Things, and ſhew them Things to come? How then could this Promiſe be fulfilled in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who was converted ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Or how could this remain in the primitive Church in the inſpired Perſons, or abide with the Church for ever to the End of the World? And ſuppoſing the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> does make an Application of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Joel</hi> to the miraculous Effuſion of the Spirit on the Day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> the 2d. Verſes 16th, 17th, &amp;c. Does it therefore follow that this Promiſe of our <hi>Saviour</hi> extends no farther than that Day? Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

he any where intimate any ſuch Thing through his whole Diſcourſe? Or is it any new Thing for Prophecies to have ſeveral Fulfilments? Is not that Prophecy, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son,</hi> which was originally ſpoken concerning God's <hi>Iſreal,</hi> apply'd by the Evangelist <hi>Matthew,</hi> Ch. 2d Verſe 15th. to the Son of God himſelf? And therefore granting that this Promiſe was in an extraordinary Degree fulfilled in the Day of Pentecoſt, how does it follow that it is not now and will be in an ordinary Way fulfilling to the End of the World? And conſequently may not this Promiſe of our Lord, be pleaded by all his Diſciples for the Indwelling of his bleſſed Spirit, and his inward Teaching, by the Inſtrumentality of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will, now as well as formerly (eſpecially ſince his Lordſhip, Page 15th, clears us from pretending to the Operations of the miraculous Kind) without being cenſured for ſo doing as <hi>Modern Enthuſiaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this inward Teaching and Indwelling of the Spirit his Lordſhip will by no Means allow even the primitive Chriſtians to have had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and therefore, Page 35th which (I come to next for Method's Sake) He comments upon <q>another remarkable Scripture that in his Lordſhip's Opinion has been miſapply'd to later Ages, and indeed to the preſent Times by ſeveral <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> but was really peculiar to the Times of the Apoſtles. It occurs, ſays his Lordſhip, Page ibid, in the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 2d. Verſe 20th, 27th. <hi>But ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and ye know all Things</hi>—<hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: But as the ſame Anointing teacheth you all Things, and is Truth, and is no Lie; and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Unction from the Holy One, and this Anointing his Lordſhip in five or ſix Pages labours to prove, was ſome extraordinary Gift reſiding in ſome particular inſpired Perſons, and not in the Believers in general to whom the Apoſtle wrote—But with what Shadow of Argument does his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip reaſon thus? For tho' it be certain (as his Lordſhip intimates Page 37th) <q>that there were ſeveral ſuch inſpired Teachers among the firſt Chriſtians, who were endow'd with various Gifts of the Spirit, and among them with the Gift of Prayer, and Preaching, and Revelation of the true Senſe of the prophetical Parts of the old Teſtament;</q> yet how does it appear that theſe inſpired Teachers are the particular Perſons referred to by the Apoſtle in this Paſſage? If that was the Caſe, would not the Epiſtle itſelf more properly have been directed to them, as having the Overſight of the Flock? Or is it not probable at leaſt that the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle would have had ſomething to ſay to them as well as to the <hi>little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, young Men</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> Verſes 12th, 13th, to whom he writes ſo particularly? And is it not evident from the whole Context that this Unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Holy One was not an <hi>extraordinary Gift</hi> reſiding in any <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

inſpired Perſon,</hi> but the Indwelling of the Spirit, which abode <hi>in the Believers in general,</hi> whereby they had an experimental Proof, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was indeed the Chriſt, and therefore needed not that any Man ſhould teach them (that is further teach them) for the Apoſtle writes unto them as <hi>knowing</hi> Perſons, Verſe 12th, &amp;c.—Is not this Interpretation quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the whole Scope of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, which was to comfort himſelf, and Believers in general, now ſo many Antichriſts were abroad, that (ſince Jeſus Chriſt had declared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24.

            <p>Again, is not his Lordſhip greatly miſtaken in his Explanation of the 16th Verſe of the 8th of <hi>Romans,</hi> viz. <q>

               </q> This Paſſage, ſays his Lordſhip, Page 18th, <q>As it is connected with the preceeding one, relates to the general Adoption of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or their becoming the Sons of God, inſtead of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were then rejected by God, and had loſt that Title.

                  </gap> and which the Jews had not. That Spirit then which by its Gifts enabled the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians to work Miracles of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kinds, was a Demonſtration, that God <hi>was in them of a Truth,</hi> and that their Religion was own'd by him in Oppoſition to that of the Jews, whom he had deſerted in a judicial Manner.</q> The Concluſion his Lordſhip draws from theſe Premiſes we have Pag. the 20th, viz. <q>That the fore-mentioned <hi>Teſtimony of the Spirit,</hi> attended with the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our own Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Conſciouſneſs of the Sincerity and good Lives of private Chriſtians, was the publick Teſtimony of the miraculous Gifts of the Spirit which God had conferred on the Apoſtles, and many of the firſt Chriſtians; and which ſhewed that they and their Brethren were the true Church of God, and not the <hi>Jews.</hi> And this was a plain Criterion in the firſt great Controverſy, namely, to which of thoſe two Churches Men were obliged to adhere in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And conſequently, this <hi>Witneſs of the Spirit,</hi> which ſhews that we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> cannot poſſibly be appl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But does not his Lordſhip here argue from a miſtaken Suppoſition, viz. That the Apoſtle in the 8th of the <hi>Romans</hi> is ſpeaking of the miraculous Power our Lord gave his firſt Apoſtles to work Miracles in confirmation that their Doctrine was of God? Is there any ſuch Thing ſo much as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at through the whole Chapter? Is not the whole Scope of it to ſhew the Privileges of thoſe, who <hi>being juſtified by Faith</hi> alone, Chap. 5th. <hi>Have Peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Does not the Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the firſt Verſe ſay, <hi>That there is no Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> Does he not ſay Verſe the 9th, that the <hi>Spirit of God dwelt in them?</hi> Does not his Lordſhip allow, Page 16, &amp;c. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this and the preceeding Verſes treats of that <hi>ſpiritual Principle in Chriſtians which enables them to mortifie the Deeds of the Body and overcome carnal Inclinations?</hi> and what Shadow of a Reaſon can be given to prove that the <hi>ſame ſpiritual Principle</hi> is not ſpoken of in Verſe 16th. as bearing Witneſs with the Believer's Spirits that they were the Children of God? Do not the very Words imply an <hi>inward witneſs,</hi> even ſomething that bears Witneſs with <hi>their Spirits,</hi> that they are the Children of God? Is it not ſaid Verſe 15th. to be ſomething that they had received?—<hi>But ye have received the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> And is not the obvious Senſe of theſe Verſes put together plainly this viz: <q>That true Believers thoſe that are Chriſtians indeed, have the Spirit of God dwelling in them, Verſe 9th. Are led by this Spirit,</q> Ver. 14th, Have gotten an inward Witneſs from this ſame Spirit that they are God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and therefore need not be brought into Bondage and fear, leaſt God would reject them, but may have free Acceſs, and with a full Aſſurance of Faith and a holy childlike Simplicity Draw near unto him, crying, Abba Father?</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip to prove that this is not the Senſe of this Paſſage, but that the Teſtimony of the Spirit here ſpoken of, is a <hi>publick Gift of working Miracles,</hi> refers Page 19th, to <hi>Galatians</hi> 3d and 2d, where the Apoſtle puts this Queſtion to them <q>Received ye the Spirit?</q> (i. e. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Lordſhip, the Power of working Miracles) <q>by the Works of the Law, or by the Hearing of Faith, which (ſays his Lordſhip) the ſame Apoſtle preſently after explains, when he ſays at Verſe 5th, He therefore that miniſtereth to you the Spirit and worketh Miracles among you, doth he it by the Works of the Law or by the Hearing of Faith</q>? But is not here a plain Antitheſis between <hi>adminiſtring the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>working Miracles?</hi> Do they not evidently imply two diſtinct Things? And can it be ſuppoſed that the Spirit which the Apoſtles aſks, Verſe 2d, <hi>Whether they had received by the Works of the Law, or the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith,</hi> was a Power to perform ſuch Miracles, at leaſt that only? Would it not then follow, ſince he declares in the 8th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005713_0008_1026CEE6487A6130"/>
               <hi>if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his,</hi> that either all Believers did receive his Spirit in his miraculous Gifts, or that no one is a Believer that has them not? And doth not the Apoſtle in this very Epiſtle make it appear that the Spirit here ſpoken of is not this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>outward Teſtimony?</hi> For what ſays he, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. "And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your <hi>Hearts</hi> (whereby it is plain the Spirit was received into the <hi>Heart</hi>) crying, Abba Father?" And does not this quite clear up that Paſſage of <hi>Romans,</hi> Ch. 8. v. 15. about the witneſſing Spirit and the Spirit of Adoption, viz. That Believers (beſides ſeeing the Miracles which the Apoſtles wrought) had an <hi>inward Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> making an inward Application of the Merits of Chriſt to their Souls, and giving them an inward Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that they were indeed the adopted Sons of God, and therefore in a holy Confidence they might cry, Abba Father? Is there any Thing forced in this Interpretation? And conſequently (notwithſtanding what appears to the contrary from his Lordſhip's Explanation) may not Perſons aſſert that there is ſuch a Thing as a Witneſs or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit given to our own Conſciences to prove that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>May I not likewiſe venture to affirm, that his Lordſhip is equally miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his Interpretation of the 26th and 27th Verſes of the ſame Chapter, which run thus, <q>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with Groanings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered—And he that ſearcheth the Heart, knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh Interceſſion for the Saints according to the Will of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit here ſpoken of according to his Lordſhip, was the Spirit acting in the <hi>inſpired Perſon,</hi> who in the Apoſtolical Age, ſays his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Page 24th. <q>Had the Gift of Prayer, and interceded for the whole Congregation; ſo that what is here ſaid of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is by an eaſy Figure transferred to the ſpiritual or inſpired Perſon, who prayed in that Capacity, for the whoſe Chriſtian Aſſembly—It is he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Interceſſion with God for private Chriſtians with vehement and inexpreſſible Groanings of Sighs</q>—But however eaſy it may be to find out a Figure to transfer what is here ſaid of the Spirit, to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or inſpired Perſon, yet how will it be eaſy to find a Figure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this of the ſpiritual or inſpired Perſon at all? For has it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſhewn that this whole Chapter is no where ſpeaking of any ſuch ſpiritual inſpired Perſon, but of the Spirit of God dwelling in all Believers?</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005713_0009_1026CEAF52CED5A8"/>
His Lordſhip goes on, Page ibid, to comment upon the 27th Verſe. <q>
                  <hi>And be that ſearcheth the Hearts, knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit</hi> (i. e. of the ſpiritual or inſpired Perſon) <hi>becauſe he maketh Interceſſion for the Saints according to the Will of God.</hi> That is, ſays his Lordſhip, God knows the Intentions of the ſpiritual Perſon, and judges of the Vehemence of his Deſires in Prayer for the whole Aſſembly, for whom he makes Interceſſion, with Regard to the immediate Subject of Affliction, literally indeed, <hi>according to God</hi> (<hi>kata Theon</hi>) or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively to him, but by Conſtruction, conformably to the Will of God; namely that in a moſt fervent Manner, the Perſon that has the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gift of Prayer which he uſes for the Benefit of the whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; he, I ſay, leaves it entirely to God, whether it be beſt that Chriſtians ſhould ſuffer Afflictions for the Goſpel, or be delivered from them. And ſuch an Intention of his Prayer cannot but be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceptable to God, who ſearches his Heart, and approves of ſuch an Act of profound Reſignation to his Will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far his Lordſhip—But where is there thro' the whole Chapter any Mention made of <hi>an Aſſembly</hi> or of any <hi>ſpiritual inſpired Perſon</hi> praying in its Behalf? Does it not require a very profound Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ſearch it out? Is it not more agreeable to the whole Scope of the Apoſtle in this Chapter, to believe that this Spirit here mentioned as helping Infirmities, or Diſtreſſes, and aſſiſting in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is the common Privilege of all Believers? Is he not ſaid to make Interceſſion for the Saints in general? And does not his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Page 22d, in Effect own this? For what ſays his Lordſhip? <q>Now on this Occaſion, he, i. e. the Apoſtle adds another Proof of the Truth of Chriſtianity, and that Chriſtians are the adopted Sons of God, and more eſpecially with Regard to their Sufferings at that Time, for the Sake of their Religion, ſays he, Ver. 26th. Likewiſe the Spirit alſo (or rather even <hi>kai</hi>) helpeth our Infirmities (or our <hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> for the Word <hi>Aſtheneiais</hi> ſignifies both.) And then he mentions in what Inſtances he does ſo, viz. in <hi>Prayers</hi> to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout bearing Afflictions or being delivered from them; and which of theſe two is moſt profitable for us the Spirit knows better than we ourſelves, and therefore inſtructs <hi>Chriſtians</hi> how to pray with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Sufferings. <hi>We know not</hi> ſays he, <hi>what we ſhould pray for as we ought,</hi> that is, whether it be beſt for us to bear Afflictions, or to be delivered from them according to our natural Inclinations.</q> And after writing thus, how inconſiſtent is it in his Lordſhip to ſay that this is done by the Spirit acting in the inſpired Perſon only, who made Interceſſion for the whole Aſſembly? Is not the quite contrary, I could almoſt ſay, Self-evident? And how then can thoſe who from this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the 8th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> humbly claim the Gift &amp; Grace of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005713_0010_1026CEE81C50AC28"/>
now as well as formerly for ſo doing, be juſtly termed <hi>Modern En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May we not further enquire, whether his Lordſhip's Interpretation of the 4th and 5th Verſes of the 2d Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians be found and conſiſtent? The Words are theſe, Page 27th. <q>
                  <hi>And my Speech and my Preaching were not with the enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom, but in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power, that your Faith ſhould not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God.</hi>
               </q> As to the former Part of theſe Words, viz. <q>My Speech and my Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not with the enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom,</q> his Lordſhip ſeems to agree with the Interpretation put upon them by thoſe whom he is pleaſed to term <hi>Enthuſiaſts;</hi> but the latter, viz. <q>
                  <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit and of Power,</hi>
               </q> His Lordſhip in Pages 29th, 30th, 31ſt, &amp; 32d, would fain ſhew means no more than that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle proved Jeſus to be the Meſſiah by Proofs out of the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament and evinced the Truth of Chriſtianity, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Miracles.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſing this may be one Senſe of the Words, yet if this be the <hi>ſole</hi> Meaning of the Apoſtle's Expreſſion, would it not have better become ſuch a Scholar as <hi>Paul</hi> was to have ſaid, he came to them in the Demonſtration of the Scriptures rather than of the Spirit? Can any parallel Paſſage be produced where the Word Spirit, is thus put for the Scriptures? And therefore by <hi>the Demonſtration of the Spirit,</hi> may we not underſtand that the Spirit of God himſelf whilſt the Apoſtle was preaching wrought a demonſtrative Conviction in the Souls of his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; not only that what he ſpake was of God, but alſo that he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſpeaking by the Spirit of God? Does not this agree with what he ſays, 2d Epiſtle, <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle, written in our Hearts, known and read of all Men: Foraſmuch as ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtered by us, written not with Ink, but the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhly Tables of the Heart.</hi>—And though it ſhould be allowed that the Word <hi>Dunamis</hi> (as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip obſerves, Page 30th) <q>in its ordinary Senſe in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt ſignify the Power exerted in miraculous Operations;</q> yet how is it foreign to the Apoſtle's Purpoſe to interpret it alſo of a divine Power or Energy which ordinarily attended the Word preached by him; I mean ſuch a Power as accompanied the Word when the Lord opened the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and when ſo many were pricked to the Heart and made to cry out, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> Does not the Word <hi>Dunamis</hi> ſeem to carry this Senſe with it, 2 Cor. 7th. <hi>But we have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels that the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Power</hi> (<hi>Dunameos</hi>)
 <hi>may be of God and not of Men</hi>—And is not <hi>Apollos</hi> ſaid to be (<hi>Dunatos en-graphais</hi>) <hi>mighty,</hi> or powerful,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005713_0011_1026CEB195FD0B28"/>
               <hi>in the Scriptures,</hi> though we do not hear that he performed any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at all? And tho' his Lordſhip is pleaſed to ſay Pag.ibid, <q>For by this Power of God here ſpoken of, (i.e. a Power to work Miracles) appears expreſly from the immediately following Verſe, in which is aſſigned the Reaſon for uſing this Method of proving Chriſtianity to be true, viz- <hi>That your Faith ſhould not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God.</hi>
               </q> Yet will it not equally hold good that their Faith ſtood not in the Wiſdom of Men but in the Power of God, if by the Power we underſtand a divine Power attending the Word preached in convincing the Conſcience, and changing the Hearts of Men, excluſive or beſides a Power of working Miracles?</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip in the ſame Page proceeds thus—<q>By <hi>the Power of God</hi> therefore muſt neceſſarily be underſtood the miraculous Operations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles as a divine Teſtimony of their Authority. He goes on in the 7th, 10th and following Verſes, to explain this <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power.</hi> And tells us that this Wiſdom of God is a Myſtery, or Wiſdom formerly hidden from the World, was couched in the Types and Prophecies of the Meſſiah in the old Teſtament under the Title of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pſalms and all the Prophets that were actually fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt—For ſays he <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all Things even the deep Things of God. Now we have not received the Spirit of the World</hi> (viz. of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory and Philoſophy) <hi>but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> That is, that we might learn of the Spirit the true Meaning of thoſe Writings which he dictated himſelf, and which none but the Spirit of God could know, ſince the Goſpel is the Contrivance of God alone for Man's Salvation; and the Benefits of it are freely and of his mere Grace conferred upon us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in all theſe Paſſages where is there a Shadow of a Proof that by the Word <hi>Power</hi> the Apoſtle meant only that he worked Miracles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? Is there any ſuch Thing ſo much as hinted at in thoſe Verſes? Or what greater Reaſon is there to infer from hence that the <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit</hi> means no more than proving Chriſt to be the Meſſiah from the Books of the Old Teſtament?</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip goes on Page 31ſt to comment upon the 13th Verſe of the 1ſt Cor. 2d. thus, The Apoſtle adds <q>
                  <hi>Which Things alſo we ſpeak not in the Words which Man's Wiſdom teacheth,</hi> (viz. as before by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory and Philoſophy) <hi>but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth; comparing ſpiritual Things with ſpiritual.</hi> From which laſt Paſſage it appears that the Words which the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to teach muſt be propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Revelations made of Jeſus Chriſt in the old Teſtament which were clearly diſcovered to the Apoſtles and explained by them to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005713_0012_1026CEEB9FF215D8"/>
the World by the ſame Holy Spirit, that perfectly knew thoſe deep or myſterious Things of God in the holy Scriptures which related to and were fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt: and whoſe Expoſitions of his Doctrine were authorized by the Miracles they wrought in Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing this be in Part tree, have not the Words a farther <hi>Meaning?</hi> And by Words which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth may we not underſtand, Words which the Holy Ghoſt did immediately put into this and other Apoſtles Minds whilſt they were Preaching, ſpeaking or writing? Was there not ſuch Aſſiſtance promiſed the Apoſtles? Did they not ſpeak as the Spirit gave them Utterance? And ſince Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed in an eſpecial Manner to be with his Miniſters even to the End of the World, may they not humbly claim the divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to aſſiſt them in a Degree in preaching now as well as formerly, by bringing to their Remembrance the Words and Things he had taught them in the holy Scriptures before, and ſo opening a Door of Utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to them without being for ſo doing juſtly ſtiled <hi>Modern Enthuſiaſts?</hi>

               </q>—Since by writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>the Witneſs of the Spirit</hi> he ſo nearly ſymbolizes with the one, and by crying down all <hi>ſupernatural Operations</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, joins Hands with the other? Beſides, if there are no Proofs of the Truth of our Religion by the inward Teſtimony of the Spirit, as his Lordſhip affirms, Page 52d, or even by the infallible Application of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Marks of Truth in it by the Holy Spirit to the Minds of Men, and his making ſo ſtrong and violent an Impreſſion on them as to form (<hi>horreſco referens</hi>) a new unintelligible Sort of divine Faith, Pa. 53. How ſhall we diſtinguiſh true and divine Faith from that which is falſe and barely hiſtorical? Are not the Devils capable of ſuch a Faith? Nay, have they not as real Faith, as Chriſtians themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if there be no other Faith, but what is wrought by external Revelation and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Miracles? Do they not thus believe and tremble? And can it be ſuppoſed that all the Miracles that the Apoſtles wrought and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sermons that they were enabled to preach, were only to ſhew People of what Communion they were to be of? Is not this bringing the Goſpel down to a mere Hiſtory, which one may read, as we read of the Exploits of an <hi>Alexander,</hi> and making Faith to be a bare Aſſent of the Underſtanding, which a Perſon may have and yet be no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by the Death of Chriſt, than <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in believing that he was crucified?</p>
            <p>But further; Suppoſing his Lordſhip had ſhewn that every one of thoſe Paſſages he has commented upon had been miſapplied by <hi>Modern Enthuſiaſts;</hi> yet are there not beſides a great Cloud of Witneſſes to be fetched from the lively Oracles to prove that the indwelling, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Witneſs of the Spirit are the Privileges of all Believers? Will you permit me to inſtance only in a few? What think you of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in St. <hi>John'</hi>s Goſpel, Chap. 7. 37, 38, 39. <hi>In the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood up and cried, ſaying, if any Man thriſt, let him come unto me and drink</hi>—<hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Waters. But this ſpoke he of the Spirit which they that believe on him ſhould receive?</hi> How, I pray you, are we to underſtand that Petition of our Lord for his Diſciples juſt before his Paſſion in the ſame Evangeliſt, Chap. 17. 20, 21. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their Word: That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one:</hi> And again, Verſes 22, 23. <hi>That they may be one, even as we are one, I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one?</hi> How would you explain that Queſtion of the Apoſtle's to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> (a Church famous for its Gifts above any Church under Heaven) <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you unleſs you be Reprobates?</hi> How do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

How do you inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that Paſſage, 2 Cor. 6. 16. Or what ſay you to that Exhortation of St. <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 20. <hi>But ye Beloved, building up your ſelves on your moſt holy Faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, keep yourſelves in the Love of God?</hi> Can any of theſe Paſſages with any Manner of Conſiſtency be interpreted of the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, or be confined to the primitive Church? Do they not ſpeak of an indwelling, witneſſing Spirit which all Believers in all Ages have a Right to expect, till Time ſhall be no more?</p>
            <p>And now my Rev. Brethren if theſe Things be ſo, may not that Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be very juſtly put to you which our Lord on a like Occaſion, asked <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ruler of the Jews, "Are ye Maſters of Iſrael, are ye Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and know not theſe Things? What has his Lordſhip been doing ſo many Years in profeſſing to confer the Holy Ghoſt by Impoſition of Hands on ſo many Miniſters, ſaying unto them, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt in the Impoſition of our Hands,</hi> if there are <hi>none</hi> of thoſe Aſſiſtances from the bleſſed Spirit to be expected now, which were conferred when our Saviour firſt ſpoke theſe Words to his Diſciples? How can his Lordſhip in Conſcience make Uſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination Office? Or how could you before many Witneſſes publickly confeſs that you were inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon you the Adminiſtration of the Church, when you openly deny him in his moſt powerful, and in Believers, common Operations? Should you not tremble to think how much this looks like belying the Holy Ghoſt, and acting the dreadful Crime of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> over again, or lying not only unto Man, but unto God? And why are you ſo zealous for the Church and continually crying out <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> and yet trample her Offices, Collects &amp; Articles in Effect under your Feet? With what Conſiſtency can you uſe the Baptiſmal Office, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſay unto God, <q>We yield thee hearty Thanks, moſt merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it it hath pleaſed thee to regenerate this Inſant with thy Holy Spirit.</q> And yet agree with his Lordſhip, Pag. 61, in aſſerting that <q>to that federal Rice of Baptiſm is annexed the preventing or preparatory Grace of God, as is likewiſe (on a due Improvement) that of the aſſiſting Kind.</q> Is this all that is implied in the Baptiſmal Office? And is Regeneration no more than this? What a miſerable Condition then are thoſe in who have only their baptiſmal Regeneration to depend on? For who is there that has improved, nay who is there that has not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away this preparatory Grace? Is not this directly contrary to the whole Baptiſmal Office? And are not thoſe to be reckoned Friends to Mankind who bid them look for a better Regeneration than this amounts

And if theſe Things are not to be <hi>inwardly felt,</hi> and we are not to be <hi>ſupernaturally</hi> aſſured of our Salvation, wherefore do you make Uſe of thoſe Words in the Viſitation of the Sick, <q>The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lord, who is a moſt ſtrong Tower to all them that put their Truſt in him, to whom all Things in Heaven, in Earth, and under the Earth, do bow and obey, be now and evermore thy Defence, and make thee <hi>know</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> that there is none other Name under Heaven given to Man, in whom and through whom thou mayſt receive Health and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but only the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</q> Or with what Propriety can you ſubſcribe to the 17th Article wherein we are told <q>That the godly Conſideration of Predeſtination and our Election in Chriſt, is full of ſweet, pleaſant, and unſpeakable Comfort to godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſuch as <hi>feel in themſelves</hi> the Working of the Spirit of Chriſt?</q> And if there be no ſuch Thing as <hi>Inſpiration</hi> at all, how can you conſiſtent with your Principles, uſe the Church Collect before the Communion Office and pray, <q>Almighty God to cleanſe the Thoughts of our Hearts by the <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of his Holy Spirit.</q>—Or how can you agree with the 13th Article, which affirms that Works done <q>before the Grace of Chriſt, and the <hi>Inſpiration of the Spirit,</hi> are not pleaſant to God?</q> Are not all theſe Things againſt you? Do they not all concur to prove that you are the Betrayers of that Church you would pretend to defend? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what Strangers muſt you be to a Life hid with Chriſt in God, and the bleſſed Fruits of the Spirit; ſuch as <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance,</hi> when you know of no other firſt Fruits of the Spirit than the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt conferred on ſome particular Perſons in the primitive Church, which a Man might have ſo as to propheſy and caſt out Devils in the Name of Chriſt, and yet be commanded to depart from him in the laſt Day? How miſerable muſt the Congregations be of which you are made Overſeen? And how little of the Divine Preſence muſt you have felt in your Adminiſtrations, that utterly deny the Spirit of Prayer, and the Spirit's helping you to preach with Power, as Things that have long ſince ceaſed?

For verily no Man hath loſt Houſes or Lands for Chriſt's Sake and the Goſpel, who ſhall not receive a Hundred-fold in this Life with Perſecution, and in the World to come Life everlaſting—Perſecution is your Privilege, it is a Badge of your Diſcipleſhip, it is every Chriſtian's Lot in ſome Degree or other—Only be ye careful to give no juſt Offence, either to Jew or Gentile, or the Church of God—And as you profeſs to have received the Holy Ghoſt in his ſanctifying Gifts and Graces, and to have the Spirit of God dwelling in you, be ye ſtudious to bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit in your Lives, that all who are acquainted with you may take Knowledge that you have been with Jeſus—Call no Man Maſter but Chriſt—Follow others only as they are Followers of him—Be fond of no Name but that of CHRISTIAN—Beware of making Parties or calling down Fire from Heaven to conſume your Adverſaries—<hi>Bleſs them that curſe you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you.</hi> Labour to ſhine in common Life by a due conſciencious Diſcharge of all relative Duties, and ſtudy to adorn the Goſpel of our Lord in all Things—If you are good Chriſtians, you will fear God, and for his Sake honour the King—Be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the many Bleſſings you enjoy under the Government of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty King <hi>George,</hi> and continue to pray to him by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice, to keep a Popish Pretender from ever ſitting on the Engliſh Throne—Be cloathed with Humility—And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways count yourſelves Beginners in Religion—Let it be your Meat and Drink to do and ſuffer the Will of your Maſter, and forgetting the Things which are behind, reach forward to the Things which are before, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe ſtriving 'till you are filled with all the Fullneſs of God—Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to know nothing but Jeſus and him crucified—Remember his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony and bloody Sweat, his ſhameful Croſs and Paſſion—Chearfully

Think of his laſt and new Commandment, and love one another with a pure Heart ſervently—Looking and preparing for that bleſſed Hour, when he ſhall come and call you to ſit down with him at the Marriage-Feaſt in the Realms of Light and Love, where the Wicked ſhall ceaſe from Troubling, and where your weary Souls ſhall be at Reſt.—</p>
            <p>Finally, I would drop a Word to you who have been lately called out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the High-ways and Hedges, and have been honoured as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to compel many poor Sinners to come in—Againſt you my Brethren his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Charge ſeems to be particularly leveled—But I am perſuaded you will be nothing terrified thereby, ſince you know I believe by happy Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what it is to have the hidden Myſteries of the Kingdom of God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your Souls, and to have the Comforter come and abide with you—And you have often felt his bleſſed Influences whilſt you have been pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that God whom you ſerve, dealing out the Bread of Life in his Name to the People—Ye are highly favour'd—Having believed, ye ſpeak, and in your Degree can ſay with our Saviour, <hi>We ſpeak the Things that we know</hi>—<hi>God who hath commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs hath ſhone into your Hearts with the Light of the glorious Goſpel</hi>—Put not therefore this Light under a Buſhel, but preach the Word, be ye <hi>inſtant in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, rebuke, reprove, exhort with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine</hi>—<hi>Do the Office of Evangeliſts, and make full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Proof of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
