            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <q>LIBERTY it ſo precious in the Eye of the Law, it is of ſo tender a Regard, that it has reſerv'd the whole Diſpoſe thereof to its own immediate Direction, and left no Part of it to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Judges, and what the Law will not ſuffer to be done directly, it does forbid that it be done indirectly, or by a Side-Wind. <bibl>Caſe of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>

            <q>As great a Lawyer as Judge <hi>Hale</hi> was, he would never ſuffer the Strictneſs of Law to prevail againſt Conſcience; as great a Chancellor as he was, he would make uſe of all the Niceties and Subtilties in Law when it tended to ſupport Right and Equity.—He governed himſelf indeed by the Law of the Goſpel, of "doing to others what he would have others do to him."—<bibl>See his LIFE.</bibl>

               <hi>THE following Appendix was prepar'd for the Preſs immediately after the Publication of my ſufferings, and was deſign'd to have been made public then, but by the Advice of Friends, I was perſuaded to defiſt for a while, to ſee how my Affair would operate: Having now delay'd it above nine Months, I venture it abroad, conſidering,</hi> That the different Capacities and Reliſhes of Perſons makes a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety uſeful, if not neceſſary—<hi>And often gives a meaner Performance the Advantage with ſome, as to uſefulneſs above others that are more ſprightly and elaborate—not that I am fond of appearing in Publick, Obſcurity and Retirement being much more agreeable to me:—And tho' I thought at firſt this bold Attack upon Liberty concern'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general as well as myſelf and I had no Reaſon to think but there was a laudable Reſentment enkindled in almoſt every Breaſt, yet no one feeling the Effects in ſo ſenſible a Manner as Mr.</hi> Tyler <hi>and myſelf, it form'd by Degrees to cool off a little, and made good that old Sayings,</hi> What is every Body's Buſineſs is no Body's Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, <hi>and no Doubt ſome Politicians have taken the Advantage of this, and put off the</hi> Evil Day, <hi>by the</hi> Stifles of Conſcience, <hi>imagining a</hi> late Repentance <hi>will made Atanement at laſt, without conſidering a great</hi> Injuſtice <hi>was done, as is almoſt univerſally acknowledged, which "ſeems to be one of thoſe Crimes that are never forgives in this World, nor in the next.—Indeed a Man may repent, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions an ſo hard, ſo mortifying, that not one of a thouſand will ſign them—For an Injuſtice (eſpecially in ſuch a Caſe) is not pardoned, without a full Reflitution, and Reparation of Damages, and theſe run often high" ſays an excellent Author—Notwithſtanding all I have ſaid, ſome who hope I ſhall ſucceed, yet are amuſed with a Notion then I ſet myſelf in Oppoſition to Government, when I am only endeavouring that good Government, and the real Deſign of it be ſupported againſt the Invaders of our Liberties and Privileges; and do not pretend to</hi> kick againſt the Pricks, <hi>as ſome have ſaid—No Man is oblig'd to ſacrifice his own Reputation, to preſerve other Peoples, ſays the moderate Dr.</hi> Tillotſon.—</p>

            <head>APPENDIX To the TOTAL ECLIPSE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS I promiſed in my late Piece, entitled, <hi>A</hi> TOTAL ECLIPSE or LIBERTY, &amp;c. to give the Publick ſome Thoughts on the <hi>Original of Civil Government,</hi> The <hi>Rights of the People,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall now proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Engagement: although I am ſenſible there is a large Field opens, I muſt be Very ſhort upon each Particular, diveſting my ſelf of all Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as I go along, continually keeping in my Eye theſe Maxims—<hi>Juſtice</hi> is juſtly represented <hi>blind;</hi> becauſe ſhe ſees no Difference in the Parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—She has but one Scale and Weight, for Rich and Poor, Great and Small—Her Sentence is not guided by the Perſon, but the Cauſe—Impartiality is the Life of Juſtice, as that is of Government—But to proceed—</p>
            <p>I will ſuppoſe in the firſt Place, That all Men are <hi>ſo juſt,</hi> that not any <hi>one individual</hi> would do any Thing he imagin'd <hi>injurious</hi> to his Neighbour, but that they were only liable to ſome Miſtakes about their own and others Rights, and that this would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Diſputes among them.—And I will further ſuppoſe, that theſe <hi>honeſt Men,</hi> are too ſuſpicious to leave their Diſputes to the Arbitration of others, each fearing the Intereſt his Adverſary has with the Perſon they leave their Affairs to—Now it ſeems neceſſary from theſe Conſiderations, that there ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007664_0004_102DBA5751C42C08"/>
be CIVIL GOVERNMENT, a State of civil Society, of Freemen united under Government for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt. If any ſhould ſay, How muſt this Government be formed, and by whom? I anſwer, certainly by theſe very Men whoſe Intereſt and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are to be preſerved;—"As the common Intereſt of the whole Body is the End of all Civil Polity, is owned by all. This, all Subjects <hi>inſiſt upon,</hi> and all Governors <hi>glory in,</hi> as their Dignity, except ſome vain <hi>Monſters,</hi> who forgetting their mortal State, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themſelves the <hi>Rights</hi> of Almighty GOD."</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Internal Structure</hi> of States, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the <hi>ſupreme Power,</hi> 'tis obſerved, "No Governors are the natural Parents or Progenitors of their People,—Nor has GOD by any Revelation no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Magiſtrates, ſhewed the Nature, or Extent of their Power, or given a Plan of Civil Polity for Mankind."—'Tis alſo allow'd, "To conſtitute a State or Civil Polity in a regular Manner, theſe three Deeds are neceſſary: Firſt, A <hi>Contract</hi> of each <hi>one</hi> for <hi>all,</hi> that they ſhould unite into one Society to be govern'd by one Counſel. And next a <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the People concerning the Plan of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the Nomination of the Governors. And laſtly, another <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Contract</hi> between theſe Governors and the People, binding the Rulers to a <hi>faithful Adminiſtration</hi> of their Truſt, and the People to <hi>Obedience."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may talk of a peculiarly divine Right; which is only a meer Dream of Court Flatterers; 'Tis true, in a Senſe every Right is divine; but then it cannot be meant in any other Senſe than as it is conſtituted by the Law of GOD and Nature.—The
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007664_0005_102DBA58E5038A48"/>
Rights of the People are <hi>certainly divine</hi> as well as the Rights of Magiſtrates; and I hope no one will diſpute, but that the Rights of the People the <hi>more divine</hi> than the Rights of their Repreſentatives, as the latter has no more than a <hi>delegated</hi> Power from the <hi>Fountain,</hi> choſe for the Defence and Protection of the People; and they receive and hold that Power <hi>only from</hi> them, and <hi>by</hi> them—So that it's natural, nay a Duty, when the common Rights of this Community is trampled upon, or only the Liberty of <hi>one</hi> is attempted againſt, and that made a <hi>Precedent</hi> of, then they are perfidious to their Truſt, and that Moment forfeit all the Power committed to them; the <hi>Alarm</hi> then ought to be given, but with <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> for if but one Member ſuffers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, the <hi>whole</hi> Community is wounded <hi>through his</hi> Sides, and the Body Politick really ſuffers as much as the Body natural does by looſing a Limb.—</p>
            <p>It is obſerved by an excellent and approved Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, "That in all Ages there has been too much Patience in the Body of the People, and too ſtupid a Veneration for their Rulers, which has produced many monſtrous Herds of miſerable abject Slaves or Beaſts of Burden, rather than civil Polities of rational Creatures, under the moſt inhuman and worthleſs Maſters, trampling upon all Things human and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine with the utmoſt Effrontery.—A People enjoy Liberty, when each one is allowed to act as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, within the Bounds of Civil Law, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Caprice of any other."—The <hi>Romans,</hi> in ſpeaking of a <hi>free People,</hi> generally mean a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical State, a Form of Government, where the ſupreme or legiſlative Power is lodged in the <hi>Common
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007664_0006_102DBA5CB4A8D9A8"/>
People,</hi> and have their Turns of Commanding as well as Obeying—</p>
            <p>And though I might ſay much upon the <hi>Downfall</hi> of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and ſhow wherein the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> has been vindicated and acknowledged even by their <hi>chief Rulers;</hi> but as I am in Hopes it will never be ſuffered to arrive at any great Heighth here, without a noble Stand and Check, ſhall only bring a few Inſtances to the preſent Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> who ſucceeded him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in an Oration he made to his People, uſeth theſe Words, "I have often, and do ſtill affirm, that a good and virtuous Prince, whom you have intruſted with ſo great and large Authority, ought to ſerve the Senate, and all the Citizens often, and many Times particular Perſons, neither do I repent of what I have ſaid; and I have acknowledged you for my very good and favourable Lords, and do ſtill acknowledge the ſame."—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor confeſs'd, that he was <hi>inferior</hi> to the People; for when the <hi>Praetor</hi> delivered him the Sword at his Inauguration, he returned it to him again with theſe Words, "Take this Sword, uſe it for me; and that ſo much the more, becauſe it is the <hi>more wicked</hi> for one that rules over all, to <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> the Law himſelf."—</p>

neither does GOD, Nature, Law or Reaſon oblige us to it—And though he is Independant and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and accountable to none, he ever acts agreable to the eternal Reaſon and Nature of Things, and even ſometimes, as it were diſrobes himſelf of his Majeſty, and appeals to his People to teſtify againſt him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has not done them Juſtice: ſo great is his Condeſcention to his rational Creatures; and then, after having ſet <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> before them, adviſes them to chuſe <hi>Life,</hi> but leaves them to their own Choice—</p>

GOD calls a Man to the Government, by and with the Conſent of the People.

            <p>In the ſecond Part of my Lord <hi>Coke's</hi> Inſtitutes, Chap. xi. on <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> he tells us, leaſt any Party that hath a Right, ſhould be without Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or that there ſhould be a Failure of Juſtice, therefore Statutes are always ſo to be expounded, that there ſhould be no Failure of Juſtice, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that ſhould fall out, that Caſe, (by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) ſhould be excepted out of the Statute."</p>

            <p>I muſt make this Remark, That if any one breaks the Laws, even a Murderer, he has all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion that is poſſible for any one to deſire, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he is not oblig'd even in this Caſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf; but every Thing is <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>open;</hi> Circumſtances in the firſt Place, muſt give juſt Cauſe of Suſpicion; the Grand Jury of 24 Men muſt find a Bill againſt the Criminal; then tried in open Court, and allowed the Privilege of Lawyers to ſave him if they can, Arguments for and againſt him; the Opinion of impartial Judges to ſum up the Evidences to a Jury of 12 Men upon Oath, to give their Opinion, whether the Criminal is guilty or no, and after that is done, the chief Judge in a ſolemn Manner, puts it to the Criminal, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has any Thing to ſay why Sentence ſhould not be paſs'd upon him?

            <p>But how contrary to this was the Proceeding of a late extraordinary Houſe of Repreſentatives, who arraign'd the Author of the foregoing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks before them, examin'd, judg'd and condemn'd by their own ſovereign, independant Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Accuſers, except the very Perſons who look'd upon themſelves as injur'd—</p>
            <p>I wiſh the Advice of the Town-Clerk of <hi>Epheſus</hi> relating to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> had been thought of at that Time, then perhaps I ſhould have been diſmiſs'd;—<hi>If there's a Matter againſt any Man, the Law is open, and there are Deputies; let them implead one another</hi>—Then ſaid <hi>Paul, ſitteſt thou to judge me after the Law, and commandeſt to be ſmitten contrary to the Law?—Is it lawful to ſcourge a Man that is uncondemn'd?</hi>

            <p>What was the Conſequence of the raſh Procedure of that Houſe?—The Author of this Piece was thrown, or hurried at Midnight into a Stone Goal, which ſtunk to that Degree, that it almoſt ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him, where he lay <hi>ten Hours</hi> before his Friends or Relations knew it:—Upon their hearing of this, his Wife was ſeiz'd with the moſt violent Fits; but I ſhall not here give a particular Account of the bad Conſequences with which this was attended—and the Death of the poor little Infant, who even <hi>anticipated its Birthright,</hi> by beginning its Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before it was capable of ſeeing the Light,—as

            <p>When we conſider the Tranſactions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Scene of Things will be ſtrictly examin'd into in the future State, how does it become us to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy in this State of Trial, either the wilful or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Affairs of Life, and make all the Satisfaction and Reſtitution we can, which goes into the very Nature of true Repentance?—Whatever the Great, and Mighty may think, and however they may boaſt of their pretended Power, and juſtify their illegal Actions, they will all be very ſoon and fairly Scan'd, when they are oblig'd to appear before the ſupreme Judge of All, when the condemn'd would be glad to Shrink into their primitive Nothing—If any ſhould ſay, there is no Occaſion for thefe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Reflections—I anſwer, they would have been of another Mind could they have had but a true Idea of this unheard of Scene—</p>

Our natural Parents have not a Right over their Children, either to command them to do any Thing that is inconſiſtent with Reaſon or Religion, or even to treat them in ſuch a Manner as to provoke them; much more have they any Right to abuſe them; ſhould they do thus, they ceaſe to be, or at leaſt do not deſerve that endearing Character of Father and Mother, but juſtly forfeit it, and may be look'd upon as Monſters in human Shape.—Now to apply this to the Political Parents of a Country; when ever they act inconſiſtent with the high Character they have confer'd upon them by the People, the Glory immediately departs from them; Obedience of the Subject to them; ceaſes to be a Duty. It is quite a wrong Notion which ſome have of Government: Even the Deed of Gift made to <hi>David</hi> and his Seed, was not abſolute, but conditional,; and they were to hold it in no other Senſe, but upon Condition of keeping the Law of God, and executing his Judgment.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>King,</hi> vi. 12. and viii. 25. and ii. 3, 4.</note>

            <p>It has been the Wiſdom of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation heretofore, not to allow too much Power to any particular Sett of Men, eſpecially in one Branch: For this Reaſon it is not ſuppos'd a Right in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to oppreſs the Subject: was this once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, it would then be eſtabliſh'd as a Rule—So that when they could agree, might not only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, judge and condemn whom they pleaſe, but alſo execute all who dar'd to oppoſe their Meaſures; after this, they might in their Wiſdom think it but reaſonable, not only to take away Life, but Eſtate too, as juſtly forfeited, and perhaps a numerous Family become Beggars at once.—And would any then dare to be ſo bold and preſumptuous as to complain? No ſurely, the very Perſons who were ſerved in this Manner might juſtly be retorted upon, as they gave that Power which they might have kept in their Hands—</p>
            <p>This is one Conſequence that might follow, and no doubt would, when for <hi>Political Reaſons,</hi> a Point was ſtrain'd, and ſtrongly urg'd, that it would be for the publick Good; but ſhould not this be the Caſe, and no Man was immediately depriv'd of Life; but were ſo moderate as only to put him into Goal, and to remain there during Pleaſure; this might actually be worſe than Death itfelf; for it

it certainly better not to have Life than to be pretty well aſſur'd we muſt remain in Miſery du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Pleaſure of thoſe Perſons whoſe <hi>tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> are evidently ſo very cruel—and all upon SUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PICION—"If <hi>unſupported Suſpicions</hi> are to have Weight at the <hi>Bar of Juſtice,</hi> no Innocence can be ſafe—Why muſt we ſuffer the <hi>Penalty</hi> of Guilt, when even <hi>the Charge</hi> could admit of <hi>no Proof!</hi>—and confin'd in the Manſions of <hi>Infamy,</hi> under Locks and Bolts?"</p>
            <p>"If the <hi>Prerogative</hi> be ſet above the <hi>Law,</hi> it will quickly devour it.—God will not authorize that which he has declared to be unjuſt, <hi>for juſt and righteous are his Ways: Oppreſſion will make a wiſe Man mad,</hi> which ſhews that Subjects have a Right in their <hi>Properties,</hi> as well as Kings have to their Crowns: If there were not ſome ſuch Right, there could be no Oppreſſion or Injuſtice, for Oppreſſion or Injuſtice, is when that which is another's Right is detained or taken from him againſt his Conſent. If <hi>Naboth</hi> had not had a Right in his Vineyard, <hi>Ahab</hi> need not to have capitulated with him to have it for a Garden of Herbs, neither would God have viſited <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Family for the Blood of <hi>Naboth,"</hi> ſays a true Patriot.—</p>
            <p>I endeavoured with Honeſty and Truth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them Gentlemen, that I knew not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that Pamphlet, thinking it would be moſt to my Advantage to be open and free in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Mind, well knowing that Tricking never anſwers with honeſt Men, and will hardly bear with Rogues—</p>
            <p>"The Rights of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> depend not on the Will of the Prince or the Will of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but they are the <hi>inherent</hi> natural Rights of

               <hi>Engliſhmen:</hi> ſecured and confirmed they may be by the Legiſlature, but not derived <hi>from</hi> nor depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>on</hi> their Will. It has commonly been the Caſe, that <hi>Civil Liberty</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> has been loſt by <hi>little</hi> and <hi>little;</hi> and Experience has taught, that it is not eaſy to recover it again.</p>
            <p>If it be allowed, That the Repreſentatives have an independent Power, and can impriſon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject when they pleaſe, I think, with Submiſſion, there is no middle State betwixt <hi>Slavery,</hi> and <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> The Point in Hand is very ſhort, either they were limited in their Power, or they were not—If they were not limited, we were as much under the Subjection of their <hi>Paſſions</hi> as their <hi>Reaſon;</hi> but if they were limited, then certainly it was, the <hi>Law</hi> that ſat their Bounds; and the Exerciſe of any <hi>Power</hi> beyond what that allows, is <hi>unlawful,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Underſtanding. "Neither can it be ſuppoſed that God would ſubject the World to the Will and Paſſions of particular Men, becauſe it is inconſiſtent with his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi>—The Will of Man is a wild uncertain Thing, and a very falſe Guide to follow in <hi>governing</hi> People; but to make the Law the Meaſure of all his <hi>Actions,</hi> and the Welfare of the People the End of all <hi>public Deſigns,</hi> is that alone which will make a Man <hi>ſafe, eaſy</hi> and <hi>powerful."</hi>—</p>
            <p>Should any now flatter themſelves, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives have an <hi>inherent Power,</hi> pray what ſhould we get by eſtabliſhing this Principle? Why certainly, in the ſpace of one Year, which Time they have to exerciſe this Power in, they might build a Number of Goals, and fill them with the People, who were ſo ſtupid as to give them this
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007664_0022_102DBA7FC21D61C0"/>
unlimited Power, and they may all be put in upon Suſpicion; and I think even the Clergy would then ſtand but a poor Chance; for if in their Prayers or Preaching they ſaid any Thing, that was ſuſpected, againſt Perſons in Government, away they muſt go to the Place appointed, and there remain during Pleaſure—The People muſt now all ſet down eaſy in their Slavery; there is no Help for it—Well this Principle being fully eſtabliſh'd, I will ſuppoſe, for Inſtance, the <hi>Pretender</hi> ſhould again land in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and he ſhould give out that they might have all the Privileges of Freeborn Subjects, and this mighty Piece of Slavery, ſhould be wholly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nothing would give ſo great a Shock, to the Engliſh Conſtitution; and therefore for the Security of our ſelves and Families, let us conſtantly proclaim the Liberties of Engliſhmen, as it were upon the Houſe-Tops; and let no Man, or Number of Men take this Crown from us, but ſtand to our juſt Rights.</p>
            <p>If there is any Thing in the foregoing, that is <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with Truth, or that I have been <hi>unfair</hi> in any of my Quotations, and wrong'd the Authors from whom I extracted any Thoughts, I ſhall take it friendly, to have them pointed out to me; and can aſſure them I will thank them in a publick Manner, but ſhould any incline to keep behind the Curtain, and act the Part of <hi>ill natur'd Criticks,</hi> I ſhall take no Notice of them, which will be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſufficient, and Puniſhment enough.—</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd with Truth and Sincerity to impreſs the Mind with a due Senſe, and the great Neceſſity of good Government, and the proper Reſpect which is due to all in Authority; and ſhown wherein the abſolute Power is lodg'd, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007664_0023_102DBA82BAFCF3C0"/>
from whence all <hi>delegated</hi> Power flows—If I am Miſtaken, ſhall always lay open to Conviction—I have alſo ſhown that the People, the whole Body of them, who have the <hi>inherent Power</hi> muſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſubmit to the <hi>Standard,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Law;</hi> and I can truly ſay, I with they were as well obſerved, as the Laws were in the Days of <hi>Alfred</hi> the Great, King of <hi>England,</hi> who reigned above 800 Years ago; and was as Hiſtory informs us, "a comely Prince, of graceful Behaviour, ready Wit and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, a Lover of good Men, very careful in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding good Laws, moſt of which are extant. In ſhort, <hi>Juſtice did not only flouriſh, but even triumph'd in his Days; inſomuch that he cauſed Chains of Gold to be hung in the high Roads, daring, as it were, the boldeſt Thieves to take them away. He was a great Soldier, and may be juſtly ſtiled,</hi> The Founder of our Laws and Liberties."—</p>
            <p>I heartily rejoice, amidſt my Grief, that this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair cannot be charg'd upon the Government, as his Excellency, whoſe Knowledge in the Law, and Acquaintance with human Nature, as well as their Honours, the Council, and many of the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, I have Reaſon to think, abhor'd the Thing in their Hearts; and had not an Opportunity of ſhewing it any other Way; and therefore ſhall conclude the whole with my hearty Wiſhes, that every one may enjoy that Liberty only, which is agreable to Law, Reaſon, and the true Principles of Chriſtianity; but at the ſame Time have as "high an Eſteem for it as the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had, that they made it one of their Goddeſſes; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all ſorts of Men are ſo averſe to Slavery, and ſo tenacious of their Freedom, that they will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go

the greateſt Hardſhips, expend all their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and expoſe their Lives to the moſt imminent Dangers, in order to preſerve it; nay, when all theſe Means were like to prove ineffectual, we have Inſtances of People who have voluntarily deſtroyed themſelves, rather than ſubmit to a Yoke, which they had not been uſed to bear;" but this was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Matter too far; but at the ſame Time ſhews as the natural Averſion we have to Slavery; For let us only compare the Courage of an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who has always been bred up in the Principles of Freedom, with the Courage of a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who has been uſed to the contrary, and we ſhall find the former as ſuperior to the latter, as Light is to Darkneſs, or Freedom to Bondage.</p>
            <p>We are not under a Neceſſity of giving up our Privileges, conſidering His MAJESTY has ever made the Laws of the Land the Rule of his Actions, and exerciſed the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of the Crown with that Mildneſs, Juſtice, and Propriety, as on all Occaſions to make them, what they were by our excellent Conſtitution of Government intended for <hi>a Bleſſing to the People,"</hi> ſays a late Writer.—</p>
            <p>"The Houſe of Commons are our Sanctuary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Oppreſſion of Princes, the Nation's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and the Defenders of their Liberties.—</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons alſo are mortal, as a Houſe; a King may diſſolve them, they may die, and be extinct; but the Power of the People has a kind of Eternity with reſpect to Politick Duration: Parliaments may ceaſe, but the People remain; for them they were originally made, by them they are continued and renew'd, from them they receive their Power.—</p>
