            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THERE is often found a truth in that which has been by many obſerved, <hi>viz. That the Names of thoſe who lived much in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whileſt they were on Earth, Live on Earth after they are in Heaven.</hi> We ſee an Inſtance of it in your <hi>Faithful Teacher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wiggleſworth,</hi> who now, <hi>is not, for God has taken him.</hi> As it was ſaid of righteous <hi>Abel, being dead he yet ſpeaketh</hi>; ſo dos your deceaſed Paſtor <hi>Speak</hi> to you, as by his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Poems,</hi> which are (I ſuppoſe) in many of your Houſes, ſo by the <hi>SERMONS</hi> which he Preached to you, which will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Live</hi> in ſome of your Hearts as long as you your ſelves ſhall <hi>Live</hi>: and by that
<pb facs="unknown:001212_0003_0FB131D65F990128"/>
Holy <hi>Example</hi> which he ſet before you. For as the Apoſtle ſaid to his <hi>Theſſalonians, You are Witneſſes how holily, and juſtly, and unblameably he behaved himſelf among you</hi>: And in the <hi>Memorials of his Piety</hi> here put into your hands, his <hi>Example</hi> will ſtill be <hi>Living</hi> among you.</p>
            <p>The Providence of God was in ſeveral things Remarkable towards him, <hi>e. g.</hi> In his being favoured with a Learned Education, after his Father had deſigned otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, (as it alſo was with Mr. <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſworth</hi>'s Tutor, our famous <hi>Mitchel,</hi> who proved a great bleſſing to all the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi>:) And in his being reſtored to ſuch a meaſure of <hi>Health,</hi> as to be able to Preach for many years twice every <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> after he had been for a long time in a Languiſhing condition. And although in ſome of the Reformed Churches, they do not permit a Miniſter of the Goſpel to practiſe as a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> left he ſhould thereby be too much diverted from his Sacred Employments, one of theſe Callings being ordinarily as much as one man can duely attend; nevertheleſs the Lord enabled <hi>him</hi> to manage both with good Succeſs: So that in being bereaved of him you have loſt an able Phyſitian both for Soul

and Body. Nor are the People in <hi>Maldon</hi> the only Perſons who have ſuſtained a loſs by his Death.</p>
            <p>He was moreover in his young years a bleſſing as a <hi>Tutor</hi> in the <hi>Colledge.</hi> It was an honour to <hi>Corderius,</hi> that the great <hi>Calvin</hi> had been his Scholar, and to Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt,</hi> that the Learned <hi>Juel</hi> had been under his Inſtruction and Tuition, who afterwards took great delight to behold the Sparkling of that <hi>Diamond,</hi> which himſelf had firſt pointed, as one Expreſſeth it. Thus ſome who were once the <note n="†" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Pupils</hi> of this worthy man have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Eminent in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. It will not at all add greatneſs or reſpect to his Name for <hi>Me</hi> to ſay, That I was his Scholar at my firſt Admiſſion into the <hi>Colledge,</hi> above three and fifty years ſince; but I have on that account reaſon to honour his Memory.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (from which yours receives its Name) was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for <hi>the great Men</hi> who ſometimes dwelt there; it having been the place where ſome of the <hi>Britiſh Kings</hi> had their Reſidence. The Lord grant that your <hi>Maldon</hi> may be
<pb facs="unknown:001212_0005_0FB131D9E2714E78"/>
famous for <hi>the good Men</hi> that ſhall be in it. And it will be ſo, if the Lord help you to follow the Doctrine, and Example of your late Paſtor, as he followed Chriſt. It is the duty of Churches not to forget, but to <hi>Remember thoſe that have ſpoken to them the Word of God, whoſe Faith they are to follow, conſidering the End of their Converſation.</hi> This will be the way for you to obtain from the Lord <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> (whoſe gift it is) another <hi>Paſtor after his own heart,</hi> who ſhall <hi>Feed you with knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> To His Grace and Guidance I commend you, and reſt,</p>

The <hi>Hiſtorical Interpretation</hi> ſuffices the more Judicious Interpreters.

            <p>We have before us, a DOCTRINE, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us; a DOCTRINE, which may not only Encourage us, but even Aſtoniſh us.</p>
            <p>Our Lord IESUS CHRIST, will with a Glorious Crown of Life moſt Gloriouſly Reward them, who Faithfully adhere unto Him &amp; His Intereſts, as long as they Live.</p>

It is to be preſuppoſed, That we <hi>Believe</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; Rely on Him, for <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> &amp; <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>Holineſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>Redemption.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands this; Joh. 20.27. <hi>Be not Faithleſs, but Believing.</hi> 'Tis for this cauſe, that the People of God, are ſo often ſtyled, <hi>The Faithful,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. The Spirit of God has wrought in them, the <hi>Faith</hi> to Receive the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and His <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> as tendered in the Goſpel. But <hi>Then,</hi> there is a <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, which muſt attend and aſſert our <hi>Faith</hi> in Him. This <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> is not ſo much <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Obedience.</hi> 'Tis not our <hi>Truſt</hi> in Him; 'Tis our <hi>Truſtineſs</hi> to Him. 'Tis what the Word of God calls, <hi>Good Fidelity. Allegiance</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in our Allegiance, is called for, in this call; <hi>Be thou Faithful unto Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. He that would be an <hi>Happy Chriſtian,</hi> muſt be a <hi>Faithful Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then; <hi>Who is the Faithful Chriſtian?</hi> We will Deſcribe him; God grant, we may anſwer the Deſcription; God grant, the Deſcription &amp; the Character may be <hi>our own.</hi> It very much belong'd unto ONE, that lately Shone among us.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Faithful Chriſtian</hi> is One, who has the <hi>Heart</hi> of a Chriſtian, as well as the <hi>Name</hi> of a Chriſtian.

He is not meerly, <hi>Dealbatus nomine Chriſtiani,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> Expreſſes it; Superficially <hi>Whitened</hi> with the <hi>Name</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Of ſuch an one, [and, <hi>The Father of the Faithful</hi>:] We read, Neh. 9.8. <hi>Thou foundeſt his Heart Faithful before thee. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> is oppoſed unto <hi>Falſehood.</hi> Every Chriſtian does profeſs himſelf to be, <hi>A Lover of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi>; and, <hi>A Servant of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian, is one that is not <hi>Falſe</hi> in his Profeſſion. He <hi>Loves</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and it is, <hi>In Sinceriy.</hi> He <hi>Serves</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and it is, <hi>With a Perfect Heart and a Willing Mind.</hi> They that are <hi>Faithful</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, can ſay, as Gen. 42.11. <hi>Thy Servants are True men.</hi> A <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian is one who <hi>is truly,</hi> what he <hi>Seems</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>And hence, it muſt be a Stroke in the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of a <hi>Faithful Chriſtian,</hi> That he does <hi>Practiſe,</hi> what he does <hi>Profeſs.</hi> He will not <hi>Say</hi> one thing, and <hi>Do</hi> another, in the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. He is none of thoſe, whom our Lord ſets that black mark upon, <hi>They Say and they Do not.</hi> We read, 1 Sam. 2.35. <hi>I will raiſe me up a Faithful Prieſt, and he ſhall Do according to that which is in mine Heart, and in my Mind.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian is one to whom our Lord may ſay, <hi>Well Done, Good and Faithful Servant.</hi> And he is one to whom all may ſay, <hi>Thou doeſt Faithfully whatever thou doeſt.</hi> The Difference between a <hi>Talker,</hi> and a <hi>Doer</hi>; the Difference between <hi>Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Well,</hi> and <hi>Well-Doing</hi>: This is the Difference between the <hi>Formal Chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001212_0011_0FB131E41D51A168"/>We will carry on the Lovely Repreſentation. A <hi>Faithful Chriſtian,</hi> is a Chriſtian <hi>Mindful</hi> of the <hi>Obligations,</hi> which are laid upon him, to Glorify the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. There is no Chriſtian, but what is under many <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> to Glorify the Lord. The <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian is one, who does not Forget the <hi>Vows</hi> of God that are upon him. The Study, and the Language of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Chriſtian is that, Pſal. 116.14. <hi>I will pay my Vows unto the Lord.</hi> A Chriſtian has Entred into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God. A <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian is a <hi>Covenant-Keeping</hi> one; he is one who may ſay, <hi>Lord, I have not forgotten thee, nor have I dealt falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy Covenant.</hi> Having been Waſhed in the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the Lord, the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves; <q>Let me now never <hi>Defile</hi> my ſelf with Sin, from which I have been <hi>Purified;</hi> Let me now always cleave to that God, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> unto whom I have been <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated;</hi> Let me now carry on the <hi>Wars of the Lord,</hi> under the <hi>Banners,</hi> to which I have been Liſted.</q> Having been Sitting at the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian reſolves, <q>I am now under an <hi>Oath</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Law</hi> of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt: I have taken the <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon it, that the <hi>Commandment</hi> of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall always give <hi>Awe</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> unto me: I have Sworn the <hi>Death</hi> of my <hi>Sin,</hi> that my <hi>Soul</hi> may <hi>Live, O my Soul,</hi> How canſt thou do <hi>ſo great a Wickedneſs, as to Sin againſt God</hi>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover; A <hi>Faithful Chriſtian,</hi> is a Chriſtian careful to make a <hi>due Improvement</hi> of the <hi>Talents,</hi> which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has committed unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001212_0012_0FB131E58EFA3A80"/>A <hi>Faithful Servant</hi> is one who ſticks to the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi> which his <hi>Maſter</hi> has given him to do: Even ſuch is the <hi>Faithful Chriſtian</hi>: And the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is He, of whom the Faithful Chriſtian ſays, <hi>He is my MASTER; To Him I ſtill remember my ſelf accountable.</hi> There is no Chriſtian, but what is be truſted with <hi>Talents,</hi> by and for the Lord. Our OPPORTUNITIES to <hi>Render,</hi> or <hi>Procure,</hi> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS unto our Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST; Theſe are our TALENTS. A <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian, is very Sollicitous, that he may know and uſe his precious <hi>Opportunities,</hi> and that the Lord may have Service from him in them all. Hence, of him that made a Good uſe of his <hi>Talents,</hi> we read, Matth. 25.21. <hi>He is a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> The Soul of a <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily concerned upon it. He often thinks; <q>What <hi>Good</hi> may I do? What are my Capacities to do <hi>Good</hi>! How ſhall I do the <hi>Good</hi> whereof God hath made be capable? Which way ſhall I be <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable</hi>?</q> Do but Inform him, how he may be <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,</hi> you need ſay no more: He will thank you for the Information: He will thankfully &amp; chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſet himſelf to do all the Good that ever he can.</p>
            <p>It follows; A <hi>Faithful Chriſtian,</hi> is a Chriſtian that Labours to acquit himſelf well in the ſeveral <hi>Relations,</hi> wherein the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has placed him. The <hi>Place</hi> wherein God ſets a man, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſidered, by one that would be found <hi>A Faithful Man.</hi> Are we in <hi>Publick Relations</hi>? We read of a <hi>Preacher</hi>; Jer. 23.28. <hi>Let him ſpeak my word Faithfully.</hi> We read of a <hi>Ruler</hi>; Neh. 7.2. <hi>He was a Faithful Man, and feared God above many.</hi> Are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001212_0013_0FB131E84714C650"/>
we in <hi>Private Relations</hi>? We read of <hi>Children;</hi> Tit. 1.6. They muſt be <hi>Faithful Children.</hi> We read of <hi>Servants;</hi> Tit. 2.10. They muſt <hi>ſhew all Good Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> Accordingly; A <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may ſtand <hi>Related,</hi> he conſiders with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>What may my Lord Jeſus Chriſt Expect of me in this Relation</hi>? And he endeavours to conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the <hi>Expectations</hi> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Finally; A <hi>Faithful Chriſtian,</hi> is a Chriſtian that will own the <hi>Truths,</hi> and <hi>Wayes,</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whatever may be the <hi>Trouble</hi> or <hi>Hazard</hi> of doing ſo. What is a <hi>Faithful Chriſtian,</hi> but a <hi>Faithful Witneſs</hi> for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? The <hi>Truths</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; a <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian will never Deny any of them. The <hi>Wayes</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; a <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will never Deſert any of them. Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt has a <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in the World; a <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian will ſtick to that People, and never betray them, never forſake them. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Intereſt of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt calls for the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of a Chriſtian, a <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian will openly, zealouſly, courageouſly appear, to bear his <hi>Teſtimony.</hi> We read, Hoſ. 11.12. <hi>Judah was Faithful with the Saints.</hi> What is the meaning of that? There were <hi>Faithful</hi> Miniſters of God, who could not <hi>conform</hi> to the Superſtitions Eſtabliſhed by <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Theſe, with other <hi>Saints</hi> of their Conſcientious Principle, were kindly entertained by <hi>Judah: Judah</hi> ſtood by thoſe Non-conformiſts of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This was to be <hi>Faithful with the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus are we to be <hi>Faithful.</hi> But, <hi>How Long</hi> muſt we be ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001212_0014_0FB131E96297BA68"/>Secondly. A <hi>Faithful Chriſtian</hi> muſt maintain his <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> as long as he Lives: He muſt <hi>never ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faithfulneſs unto Death,</hi> implyes, That we muſt be <hi>Faithful</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, until the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Lives.</hi> As the <hi>Faithful</hi> man ſaid, Pſal. 119.112. <hi>I have inclined my heart, to perform thy Statutes always, even unto the End;</hi> Thus, We muſt be <hi>Faithful</hi> unto the Lord, and the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the Lord, <hi>Always, even unto the End.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is the <hi>perpetual Servant</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; He has his <hi>Ear bored</hi> for Him: He muſt be <hi>Faithful</hi> unto his Lord, until he <hi>Dies.</hi> It was propoſed; Pſal. 146.2. <hi>While I Live will I praiſe the Lord; I will ſing praiſes unto my God while I have any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Even ſo; While we <hi>Live,</hi> we muſt be <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> unto the Lord, &amp; Serve Him <hi>Faithfully</hi> while we have any Being. How Reſolute was he? Job 27.3, 4. <hi>All the while my Breath is in me, &amp; the Spirit of God is in my Noſtrils; my Lips ſhall not ſpeak wickedneſs, nor my Tongue utter Deceit.</hi> Thus, While our <hi>Breath</hi> is in us, &amp; the Spirit which God gives us is in our <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> there muſt be with us, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Faithfulneſs;</hi> we muſt never deal <hi>Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> with the Lord. Our Song muſt be that; <hi>We will Serve our Lord in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs and Faithfulneſs before Him, all the Days of our Life.</hi> I do not know, but that the famous <hi>Polycarp,</hi> [the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church in <hi>Smyrna,</hi>] might have in his mind, this very word, <hi>Be thou Faithful unto Death,</hi> when he ſo anſwered thoſe that preſs'd him to Renounce Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>I have Served my JESUS, till I am now Fourſcore &amp; ſix years old; &amp;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001212_0015_0FB131EAF8A8D260"/>
I have always found Him a good Maſter; I will not now Renounce him: He ſhall be my Maſter as long as I Live!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea; <hi>Faithfulneſs unto Death,</hi> implies, That we muſt be <hi>Faithful</hi> unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be with the very <hi>Loſs</hi> of our <hi>Lives.</hi> Our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, may coſt us very dear: It may coſt us all the comforts of our <hi>Lives</hi>; It may coſt us our very <hi>Lives.</hi> But we muſt venture the loſs of all; and loſe our very <hi>Lives</hi> rather than loſe our <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> Thus thoſe <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> ones; Rev. 12.11. <hi>They loved not their Lives unto the Death;</hi> They were willing to part with their Lives, before the Term to which they might have lived by the courſe of Nature. The <hi>Work</hi> we have to do for our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, muſt be Dearer to us, than our very <hi>Lives.</hi> If our Lord Jeſus Chriſt call us to part with our very <hi>Lives</hi> upon His Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we muſt be Ready to do it. As that <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> man Expreſſed himſelf; Act. 20.24. <hi>I count not my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with Joy</hi>: Thus we ſhould ſay; <q>I ſhall not count my Life dear unto my ſelf, if I may but <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Diſcharge and <hi>Finiſh</hi> the Work, whereto my Lord Jeſus Chriſt has called me.</q> 
               <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, in all the Terrors of it, muſt never Terrify us, from our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Faithful</hi> ſaid of old; Pſal. 44.18, 19. <hi>Our Heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way; Tho' thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and covered us with the ſhadow of Death.</hi> So ſhould we be able to ſay; <q>Tho' all the <hi>Dragons</hi> in the <hi>Valley of the ſhadow of Death,</hi> may ſeek to Sting
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001212_0016_0FB131EC8AE45098"/>
me to Death, yet I will never <hi>Decline</hi> taking any Step that my Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall call me to.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> and Conſtancy <hi>unto Death,</hi> tis Demanded by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is Demanded, <hi>That we be ſtedfaſt and Immoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> It is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>That by patient continuance in well-doing, we ſeek for Eternal Life. Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves on <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.28. The Lord Promiſes the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> not unto thoſe that <hi>Followed</hi> Him only, but unto thoſe that <hi>Continued</hi> with Him. The Demand is infinitely Reaſonable. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST was <hi>Faithful unto Death</hi> in His Appearing for us; And ſhall not we be <hi>Faithful unto Death</hi> in our Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Him? <hi>Ibi tu, Chriſtiane, fige Curſus tui pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuſque metam, ubi Chriſtus poſuit Suam,</hi> as one of the Ancients well Expreſſed it. Our Lord gave not over, till He was the <hi>Finiſher of our Faith;</hi> our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to Him, it muſt not be <hi>Finiſhed,</hi> until we come, as He did, unto the <hi>Grave, Obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death.</hi> A man may <hi>Do much</hi> and <hi>Bear much</hi> for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; But if he be not <hi>Faithful unto Death,</hi> it is all thrown away: Gal. 3.4. <hi>So many Things in Vain</hi>! It is a Rule in the Civil Law; <hi>Factum non dicitur, quod non perſeverat</hi>; That is not <hi>Done,</hi> which does not <hi>Hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> God will not accept a <hi>Maimed Sacrifice</hi>: a <hi>Curtail'd Sacrifice.</hi> A <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> which is not <hi>unto Death,</hi> is a <hi>Maimed Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> The <hi>Race</hi> is Run to no purpoſe, if it be not Run to the very <hi>Goal.</hi> Our <hi>Goal</hi> is our <hi>Death.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it can be no <hi>Real Faithfulneſs,</hi> that is not a <hi>Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faithfulneſs.</hi> A <hi>Fainting Piety</hi> is but a <hi>Feigned Piety.</hi> The Heathen could ſay, <hi>He never was a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001212_0017_0FB131EEF016F190"/>
True Friend, that ever ceaſes to be a Friend.</hi> He never was a <hi>Faithful Friend</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is not a <hi>Conſtant Friend</hi>; Who does not <hi>Love Him at all Times,</hi> unto the End of Time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Time.</p>
            <p>And now, if we are thus <hi>Faithful</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, what will be the conſequence? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, There will be a <hi>Recompence.</hi> And it is no Fault in a Chriſtian, to have <hi>Reſpect unto the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</hi> Let us now Enquire after it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has <hi>Reſerv'd</hi> for us; Tis, A <hi>Crown of Life</hi> in the <hi>World to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of the <hi>Faithful Chriſtian!</hi> He is Diſgraced, Reproached, <hi>Vilified,</hi> for his <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi>: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt has a <hi>Crown</hi> to beſtow upon him. He Shortens, he Reſigns his <hi>Life,</hi> to pleaſe the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. <hi>Life, Life,</hi> ſhall be his Portion.</p>
            <p>We will proceed, Step after Step, unto the Conſolation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian ſhall at laſt be <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> from all the Grievous and Heavy Things, which he may ſuffer for his <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> All our <hi>Sufferings</hi> in and for our <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> come under the Name of <hi>Death.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian ſhall be brought into a State, wherein he ſhall ſee no more <hi>Death.</hi> He ſhall Enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Life</hi>; and that <hi>Life</hi> will be a State, wherein he ſhall ſee an End of all the <hi>Adverſity</hi> which his <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> was once Encumbred withal. We read, Rev. 21.4. <hi>God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, &amp; there ſhall be no more Death.</hi> We ſhall come into a State, wherein we ſhall meet with no <hi>Temptation</hi> to abate of our <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> There will be no <hi>Fleſh</hi> crying unto us, <hi>Maſter, Spare thy ſelf.</hi> There will be no <hi>Devil</hi> ſhooting at us his <hi>Fiery Darts</hi> to diſcourage us. There will be no <hi>Meſſenger of Satan</hi> to buffet us. As we read, Pſal. 31.20, 21 <hi>Thou ſhalt hide them from the Pride of man; from the ſtrife of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001212_0018_0FB131F02FFF6E08"/>
Tongues; Bleſſed be the Lord, for He hath ſhewed me His marvellous Kindneſs in a ſtrong City. — The Lord preſerveth the Faithful.</hi> Hold out, O <hi>Faithful Chriſtian</hi>; Thou wilt ſhortly be in that <hi>Strong City</hi> of God, where thy <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> will meet with nothing to Damp it, either from any <hi>Luſt</hi> within, or from any <hi>Strife</hi> without. Yet a little while, and thou ſhalt ſee an <hi>End</hi> of all that was uneaſy to thee: <hi>Faithful Servant,</hi> Thou ſhalt <hi>Enter into a Joy</hi> that ſhall never have an <hi>End</hi>!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian ſhall find his <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> lead him unto a <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> which is called <hi>Life;</hi> which will be an <hi>Excellent,</hi> yea, an <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Tis moſt certain, That our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will <hi>End</hi> in <hi>Endleſs Bleſſedneſs.</hi> Wherein will conſiſt that <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi>? In the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, we have it after that manner Expreſſed: Pſal. 17.15. <hi>I ſhall behold thy Face in Righteouſneſs; when I awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi> In the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, we have it Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after that manner; 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>We know, that when He ſhall appear, we ſhall be like Him, for we ſhall ſee Him as He is.</hi> That incomparable, that incomprehenſible <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs,</hi> which is intended for the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian, will be in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt; and in the <hi>Image</hi> of that Glorious Lord imparted unto him; and in a moſt intimate <hi>Communion</hi> with the glorious Lord; and in unutterable Satisfactions produced by the <hi>Spirit of Glory</hi> for ever poſſeſſing of him. This <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, LIFE; and in that Name very precious things are intimated. A <hi>Faithful</hi> man may have his <hi>Death</hi> haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> No; His <hi>Life</hi> is not loſt. <hi>Non homo moritur, ſed peccatum hominis:</hi> There <hi>Dies</hi> nothing of him, except that which is his very <hi>Death.</hi> His <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> only brings him to a <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> which is the Trueſt <hi>Life.</hi> The <hi>Separate Soul</hi> of a <hi>Faithful</hi> man puts on the <hi>Garments of Light</hi>; and flies away to a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and there waits in <hi>Reſt</hi> and Peace, and Hope for the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> [Rev. 14.13.] There ſhall at length arrive, [But, <hi>Oh Lord, How Long</hi>!] a <hi>Reſurrection
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001212_0019_0FB131F1D282E828"/>
of the Dead</hi>; The <hi>Faithful</hi> man ſhall then receive his <hi>Body</hi> again. His <hi>Body</hi> ſhall be an Incorruptible, Agile, Splendid Manſion for him. He ſhall in that <hi>Body,</hi> live as a Citizen of the Heavenly City, till the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be no more. When a <hi>Faithful</hi> man <hi>Dies,</hi> tis to <hi>Live</hi> better than he did before. The <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> will be <hi>Life</hi>; Becauſe it will be <hi>Deſireable.</hi> It was ſaid, <hi>What man is he, who deſireth Life</hi>? Indeed, what man is he, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it not? There are few things, but what we part withal, to prolong our <hi>Life.</hi> Men are naturally and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally loth to <hi>Dy. Nature</hi> is never willing to <hi>Dy.</hi> The cry is, <hi>Life is Good</hi>! The <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> intended for us, may well be Styled <hi>Life</hi>: Becauſe indeed it is, [the Jews do well apply the Text unto <hi>this:</hi>] Pſal. 63.3. <hi>Better than Life.</hi> And the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> will be <hi>Life</hi>; Becauſe it will be <hi>Durable.</hi> T'will <hi>Endure</hi>; T'will be <hi>Everlasting.</hi> A <hi>Living Thing</hi> may <hi>Dy</hi>; But <hi>Life</hi> never can <hi>Dy.</hi> We ſhall ſee <hi>Life,</hi> and never ſee any thing but <hi>Life.</hi> Our <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> will be <hi>Life</hi>; Becauſe it will be, 1 Pet. 5.10. <hi>An E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian ſhall after all his <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> be Rewarded and <hi>Advanced,</hi> even as with the <hi>Crown</hi> of an Illuſtrious <hi>Conqueror.</hi> The Reward of the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian will be, A CROWN: 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>A Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> It is to tell us, That a very high <hi>Advancement</hi> ſhall be the Reward of the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. There is no higher <hi>Advancement</hi> propounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ambitious Children of men, than that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Crown.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian may meet with much <hi>Reproach,</hi> and much <hi>Contempt</hi> in the World. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man will be <hi>Faithful</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and His Churches, that man ſhall <hi>hear the Defaming of many.</hi> They that are <hi>Grievous Revolters</hi> from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will <hi>walk with Slanders</hi> againſt the <hi>Faithful</hi> Champions of the Lord. As it was complained; <hi>When I wept and chaſtened my Soul with Fasting, that was to my Reproach.</hi> Even ſo, If the <hi>Faithful</hi> Servants of God are after the moſt Holy manner, only <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi> before the Lord, on the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001212_0020_0FB131F310A00AE0"/>
behalf of His Churches, Men that are full of Satan, will invent ſomething of <hi>Reproach</hi> againſt them, it may be, on that very occaſion. Be patient, O Faithful ones. God intends an inconceivable Advancement for you. You ſhall come to that Advancement; Rev. 5.10. To <hi>be Kings and Prieſts for God, and Reign, over the earth. High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Advanced</hi> ſhall the <hi>Faithful</hi> be, when they ſhall <hi>Sit on Throne</hi> in the <hi>Heavenly places</hi> with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and they ſhall have <hi>power given them over the Nations</hi> of the Earth, <hi>to Rule</hi> them. <hi>Highly Advanced</hi> ſhall they be, when they ſhall <hi>Shine as the Brightneſs of the firmament, and as the Stars,</hi> and be employ'd in <hi>Turning many to Righteouſneſs. Highly Advanced</hi> ſhall they be, when they ſhall be companions of <hi>Angels,</hi> and be <hi>Raiſed out of the Duſt,</hi> and be ſet with thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi>; and they ſhall indeed be the <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Rulers</hi> and the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the <hi>Saved Nations.</hi> Oh! How <hi>highly Advanced,</hi> when all their <hi>Faithful</hi> Endeavours and Atchievements, will be Proclaimed with Honour in the <hi>City</hi> of God. The <hi>Streets</hi> of that <hi>Great City,</hi> ſhall doubtleſs have the Inſtances of our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> publiſhed in them; and thoſe things will be done to us, which muſt be done to the Men, <hi>whom the King of Heaven delights to Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why ſo! Becauſe the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian ſhall then be conſidered as a <hi>Conqueror.</hi> A <hi>Crown</hi> of old, was a <hi>prize</hi> after a <hi>Combate</hi>; the Reward of a <hi>Combate.</hi> We read, 1 Cor. 9.24, 25. of them who <hi>Run,</hi> and <hi>Strive; They do it to obtain a corruptible Crown, but we an Incorruptible.</hi> This, This will be one thing in the Reward of a <hi>Faithful</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. When he comes to <hi>lay hold on Eternal Life,</hi> it ſhall be openly acknowledged: <q>This Man has got the <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>! Unto many a <hi>Combate</hi> was this Man called in his Time; He Combated with the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi>; He Combated with unknown <hi>Vexations</hi> and <hi>Confuſions</hi>: But he has been Victorious over all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O ye <hi>Saints,</hi> O ye <hi>Angels,</hi> Glorify, Glorify that <hi>Grace</hi> that made him ſo!</q> The <hi>Faithful unto Death,</hi> are all of them, <hi>Overcomers.</hi> They meet with many things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001212_0021_0FB131F559E800F8"/>
them, and debauch them, from the work whereto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has called them. They <hi>Overcome</hi> all obſtructions; They <hi>Overcome</hi> the tempters, and hold faſt their Integrity. This will be acknowledged with <hi>moſt glorious Praiſes,</hi> when the <hi>Crown of Life</hi> ſhall be put upon their Heads. We ſhall then be <hi>Crowned</hi> in our Triumphs among them that are, <hi>Conquerors and more than Conquerors, thro' him that has loved us.</hi> T'will not be with a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Lawrel,</hi> or a Garland that will Fade and Dy. No; T'will be with a <hi>Crown of Life.</hi> Our Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bleſſed <hi>Conquerors</hi> will be a living and a laſting Honour; It ſhall not be ſaid of us, <hi>Being in honour they abide not.</hi> No; 1. Pet. 5.4. <hi>Ye ſhall receive a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away.</hi> But from whom?</p>
            <p>Laſtly. The <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> which is to be the <hi>Reward</hi> of our <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> will be the <hi>Gift</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST unto us.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Crown</hi> comes to us as a <hi>Gift.</hi> There is no <hi>Deſert</hi> in our <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> We cannot by our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> ever <hi>Deſerve</hi> a <hi>Crown.</hi> We never earn'd a <hi>Crumb</hi> and much leſs can we earn a <hi>Crown.</hi> After all our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and our <hi>Fruitfulneſs,</hi> we muſt confeſs, <hi>Lord, we have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants.</hi> We read, Rom. 8.18. <hi>I reckon, that the Sufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the glory that ſhall be Revealed.</hi> And upon a due <hi>Reckoning</hi> we ſhall find, that there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> under all our <hi>Sufferings in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> in the <hi>Crown of Life</hi> that ſhall be conferred. Tho' <hi>Death</hi> be the <hi>Wages</hi> of our <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi>; Yet <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is not the <hi>Wages</hi> of our <hi>Faithfulnſs</hi>: No; <hi>Tis the Gift of God.</hi> One of the Beſt men that ever <hi>New-England</hi> ſaw; [Our famous <hi>Hooker</hi>] Lying on his Death-Bed, unto one that ſaid unto him, <hi>Sir, You are going to Receive the Reward of all your Faithful Services,</hi> made this fit Reply, <hi>Brother, I am going to Receive Mercy</hi>! 'Tis <hi>Mercy</hi> that gives the <hi>Crown</hi> unto the <hi>Faithful</hi>; The <hi>Crown of Juſtice</hi> is a <hi>Crown of Mercy</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:001212_0022_0FB131F72B018198"/>Well; But this <hi>Gift</hi> comes from our Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. Indeed, no Perſon in the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> is excluded from the <hi>Glory,</hi> of giving us our <hi>Crown of Glory. If every good Gift come</hi> from God; ſurely, this <hi>Gift,</hi> the <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> muſt come from Him. Yet our Lord JESUS CHRIST is very particularly concerned, in giving the <hi>Crown</hi> unto the <hi>Faithful</hi> Chriſtian. 'Tis the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> who gives the <hi>Crown of Life.</hi> 'Tis He that ſays, Rev. 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh, I will grant to ſit with me in my Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST hath by His <hi>Death purchaſed</hi> for us the <hi>Crown of Life.</hi> Tis a <hi>Crown</hi> of a vaſt value. All the <hi>Crowns</hi> of all the Monarchs under Heaven, are but vile <hi>Caps</hi> &amp; <hi>Rags,</hi> when compared with the <hi>Crown of Life.</hi> But our Lord JESUS CHRIST has paid a <hi>Price</hi> for the <hi>Crown</hi>; Yea, tho' it be worth more than Heaven and Earth, we may ſay, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has paid for the <hi>Crown,</hi> as much as 'tis worth. His own precious <hi>Blood,</hi> is what He has paid for it. He bore a <hi>Croſs,</hi> that we might have a <hi>Crown</hi>; He wore a <hi>Crown of Thorns,</hi> that we might wear a <hi>Crown of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> has all <hi>Dominion</hi> in His Hands. He is the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi> The <hi>Crown of Life</hi> is at His <hi>Diſpoſe.</hi> He may cauſe whom He pleaſe, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the <hi>Throne of Glory.</hi> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, has <hi>all power in Heaven and Earth given</hi> unto Him, &amp; ſo this <hi>Power</hi> of giving the <hi>Crown of Life</hi>; and bringing to Heaven thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Him, God has <hi>given Him power over all Fleſh,

that He ſhould give Eternal Life,</hi> where He ſhall pleaſe to give it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> We muſt all caſt all our <hi>Crowns</hi> at the <hi>Feet</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. It is HE that ſets our <hi>Crowns</hi> on our Heads.

               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> 'Tis plain, We ſhall be no Loſers by our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to our Lord JESUS CHRIST. Let us then make it the great Prayer and Care of our <hi>Lives, That we may he Faithful unto Death.</hi> We read, Prov. 28.20. <hi>A Faithful man ſhall abound with Bleſſings.</hi> In the <hi>Abundance of Bleſſings,</hi> that will Reward us, can we not ſee, <hi>Abundance of Motives,</hi> to be very <hi>Faithful!</hi> Surely, In a <hi>Crown of Everlaſting Life,</hi> there is an <hi>Abundance of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</hi> Dreadful, Dreadful muſt be the <hi>Death,</hi> of them that are not <hi>Faithful</hi> to the Intereſts of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If a <hi>Crown of Life</hi> ſhall be given unto the <hi>Faithful, What ſhall be given unto thee, or what ſhall be done unto thee,</hi> O Soul that art Falſe unto the Lord? What? but a <hi>Death</hi> infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Sharp Arrows of the Almighty;</hi> a <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> worſe than Lying amidſt <hi>Coals of Juniper?</hi> Not a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> but <hi>Chains</hi> of Everlaſting <hi>Darkneſs!</hi> Terrible, very Terrible, will be the puniſhment of <hi>Deſerters.</hi> How Terribly it Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders! Heb. 1O.38. <hi>If any man draw back, my Soul
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001212_0026_0FB131FEE7171480"/>
ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> No pleaſure! The meaning is, That the Soul of the Lord will be infinitely <hi>Diſpleaſed</hi> at him. The <hi>Crown</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> will be Life; The Doom of the <hi>Fearful,</hi> will be in the <hi>Lake</hi> of the Wrath of God. Oh! Be <hi>Fearful</hi> of incurring ſuch a Doom!</p>
               <p>It was bowayled; Pſal. 12.1. <hi>The Faithful fail from among the Children of men!</hi> Let it be deſired by us; <hi>Lord, Let not me fail of being found among thy Faithful Children.</hi> Wherefore; Be <hi>Prayerful,</hi> O Chriſtian, That thou mayſt be <hi>Faithful.</hi> We read, 1 Cor. 7.25. Of, <hi>One that has obtained mercy of the Lord, to be Faithful.</hi> Tis a <hi>Mercy,</hi> to be asked of the Lord!</p>
               <p>And then; To <hi>Supplication</hi> joyn <hi>Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Often think; <hi>What are the Priviledges, What the Capacities, wherewith my Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>has Entruſted me!</hi> We read, 1 Cor. 4.2. <hi>It is required in Stewards, that a man be found Faithful.</hi> Remember we, that we are bur <hi>Stewards</hi> of all that we have; And then be full of anxious Thoughts, How to acquit our ſelves with <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> in our <hi>Stewardſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; Often think; <hi>What ſpecial Intereſt of my Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>now calls for a ſpecial Witneſs from me.</hi> We read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.5. about, <hi>A Faithful Witneſs.</hi> The Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſometimes is moſt oppoſed in one Article, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another. Our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, in our bearing <hi>Witneſs</hi> to the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in that Article, where unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men are moſt buſy at undermining it. <hi>There, There,</hi> Let us fall in, tho' we may never ſo much Expoſe our ſelves by doing ſo.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001212_0027_0FB131FFD18609C8"/>The <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> will make amends for all.</p>
               <p>Finally. Let us Tread in the Steps of them that have been <hi>Faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was of old ſaid; Prov. 20.6. <hi>A Faithful man who can find</hi>? Some <hi>Faithful Men</hi> have been <hi>found.</hi> We have Lately <hi>Loſt</hi> ſuch an One; Such an One was our WIGGLESWORTH, <hi>Who hath an good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all men.</hi> One who ſo <hi>Faithfully</hi> demeaned himſelf, that (as <hi>Jerom</hi> directed of old,) <hi>De illo male Loqui nemo Potuit Sine mendacio.</hi> Becauſe, it may contribute unto the <hi>finding</hi> of more Such, I ſhall give you ſome ſhort Account of his <hi>Faithfulneſs;</hi> &amp; <hi>Proclaim his Goodneſs</hi>: but, as tis moſt Reaſonable, my Account ſhall be given with the moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unſpotted <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may truly affirm concerning him, That <hi>Faithfulneſs, Faithfulneſs,</hi> was the very thing that remarkably Characterized him, Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed him.</p>
               <p>He was deſcended of Eminently Religious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who were great Sufferers for that which was then, The <hi>Cauſe of God,</hi> and of <hi>New-England.</hi> While he was yet a Youth, he was marvellouſly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he might have an Heart filled with the Spirit of God. This concernment upon his mind appeared eſpecially in his Watchful Endeavours to have <hi>Spiritual Sins,</hi> chaſed out of his cleanſed Heart. PRIDE, the Sin of <hi>Young</hi> men, yea, of <hi>all</hi> men; PRIDE, the Sin which few men Try or Trouble themſelves about; this Devout Youth, was full of Holy and Watchful Trouble about it: And he <hi>then</hi> wrote a very Savoury Diſcourſe, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Conſiderations againſt Pride.</hi> And another
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001212_0028_0FB132014EC693D8"/>
Entituled, <hi>Conſiderations againſt Delighting more in the Creature than in God.</hi> This was to mortify in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Sins rarely minded by the moſt of men.</p>
               <p>Having had a Pious and a Learned Education, the firſt Publick Station wherein I find him, was that of a <hi>Fellow,</hi> and a <hi>Tutor,</hi> in <hi>Harvard-Colledge.</hi> With a rare <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> did he adorn the Station! He uſed all the means imaginable, to make his <hi>Pupils</hi> not only good <hi>Scholars,</hi> but alſo good <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and inſtil into them thoſe things, which might render them rich Bleſſings unto the <hi>Churches</hi> of God. Unto his Watchful and Painful Eſſayes, to keep them cloſe unto their <hi>Academical Exerciſes,</hi> he added, Serious Admonitions unto them about their Interiour State, and (as I find in his Reſerved Papers) he Employ'd his <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> to God for them, &amp; had ſuch a flaming zeal, to make them worthy men, that, upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, he was afraid, Leſt his <hi>cares for their Good, and his affection to them, ſhould ſo drink up his very Spirit, as to ſteal away his Heart from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Star made his Remove, till he comes to diſpenſe his Sweet Influences, upon thee, O <hi>Maldon</hi>: And he was thy <hi>Faithful</hi> One, for about a <hi>Jubilee</hi> of years together.</p>
               <p>It was not long after his coming to <hi>Maldon,</hi> that a Sickly Conſtitution ſo prevailed upon him as to confine him, from his Publick Work, for ſome whole Sevens of years. His <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> was thus interrupted. The Kindneſs of his Tender Flock unto him, was anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered in his Kind concern to have them Served by other Hands. He took a Short Voyage unto
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001212_0029_0FB13203C0DAB060"/>
another Country, for the Recovery of his Health; which tho' he Recovered not, yet at his Return, I find him comforting himſelf, with inſerting of this Paſſage, in his Reſerved Papers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peradventure the Lord removed me for a Seaſon, that He might ſet a better Watchman over this His Flock, and a more Painful Labourer in His Vineyard. This was one thing that I aimed at in Removing (to help the Peoples Modeſty in the Caſe,) and I believe the Lord aimed at it, in removing me for a Seaſon.</hi>

               <p>His <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> now appeared, in his <hi>Edifying Diſcourſes,</hi> to thoſe that came anear him; A Thing wherein he was very <hi>Careful</hi> and <hi>Fruitful</hi>; much bewayling the want of a Profitable and Religious Converſation, in ſo many that Profeſs Religion.

               <p>How <hi>Faithful</hi> was he to the <hi>Work</hi> of God in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> and Grieved at every thing that he thought had any Tendency to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode that glorious Work?</p>

               <p>For ſuch things, his Flock Loved him. Your <hi>Love,</hi> ſhow'd it ſelf, when a Dangerous Fit of <hi>Sickneſs</hi> was upon him, above Seven years ago.

               <p>From his Exemplary Life, I will ſingle out one thing, to be peculiarly inculcated. That one thing is, His <hi>Early Religion.</hi> Oh! That the Young Ones of the Flock, would but follow their Aged Paſtor, in this amiable and admirable Excellency! His <hi>Early Religion.</hi> I have known it a <hi>Temptation,</hi> buzz'd by Satan into the minds of Children; That if they feared God, and ſought Chriſt, &amp; zealouſly made ſure of <hi>Heaven</hi> betimes, they ſhould not <hi>Live Long</hi> upon Earth. If it were ſo! —Certainly, <hi>Heaven</hi> is better than <hi>Earth.</hi> But it is a <hi>Fooliſh</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our <hi>Wiggleſworth</hi> was a Godly Child; and he held on Living to God &amp; Chriſt, until the Seventy Fourth Year of his Age. When
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001212_0032_0FB1320839AF5D50"/>
he then lay a Dying, Some ſpoke to him, about his having Secured, his <hi>Interest</hi> in the Favour of Heaven, and his <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of that Intereſt. He replyed, [methoughts, like my <hi>Polycarp</hi>:] <hi>I bleſs God, I began that work betimes; And e're I was Twenty years old, I had made thorough work of it. Ever ſince then, I have been preſſing after the Power of Godlineſs, the Power of Godlineſs!

               </p>
               <p>Follow your <hi>Paſtor,</hi> as he followed our <hi>Saviour.</hi> Then, all you that have been brought nearer to God, by his <hi>Faithful Miniſtry,</hi> will one Day meet him in the <hi>City of God.</hi> Oh!

            <p>THE Survivers have often received incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Benefits, from the <hi>Reſerved Papers</hi> of Good Men; which they have Written only for the Help of their own <hi>Memories</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Imagination, that they would ever get from under that Character of <hi>Reſerved Papers.</hi>

                  <hi>III.</hi> It is very hard for me, to ſet my Heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God Himſelf, and not reſt in the Creature; (or elſe to be reſtleſs and diſconſolate:) altho' I ſee, God is willing to have me come into His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and to ſatisfy my Soul in ſweet Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Himſelf; and infinitely mere willing, than I am, that any of thoſe I Love moſt, ſhould be near me, and that I could be communicating the greateſt Good unto them; which certainly is one of the main things I deſire upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> Some comfort God gave me in Himſelf; finding my Love to Man, not Rewarded with like Love again. He helped me to Rejoyce in the Teſtimony of a Good Conſcience, and Looking unto Him, not unto Man, for the Reward of my Labours.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>V.</hi> I thought, if God would not Save me at Laſt, yet there was <hi>ſomething that pleaſed</hi> me in this; <hi>That my Lord ſhould ſtill have Glory.</hi> Hereupon I Reflected, Saying, <q>And whence haſt thou any ſuch Endearedneſs of Affection to the <hi>Glory</hi> of Chriſt?

Then making with me a <hi>Covenant, Ordered in all things &amp; ſure.</hi> This remains, tho' I can't find ſuch ſenſible Qualifications in my ſelf; which I deſire, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bewail it before God that I can't. Yet, whilſt I Live, I will not Let Him Go. Moreover, I appeal to God Himſelf, the Searcher of Hearts, to ſee whether there be, or have been, no prizing of God above other things. What elſe means, my Reſtleſsneſs after Sin committed, until I have made my Peace with God? Or, if that be from <hi>Fear</hi> of Puniſhment, rather than <hi>Love,</hi> to thy ſelf, <hi>Lord,</hi> yet what means that Subſtantial <hi>Soul-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment</hi> I have found in thy ſelf, when Creatures have failed; and which I never found any where but in thy ſelf ? What is it but that gives me Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, when Creatures frown? When I cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what I deſire from thee?

I have <hi>Daily Sins,</hi> and therefore, I want Him for my Daily Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that my Sins may not Separate between me and my God, and Provoke Him, and His Spirit, whoſe Viſitations preſerve my Spirit, to Depart from me; That's my <hi>Death</hi> which I am afraid of! And that I may be accepted for His Sake, who in and of my ſelf, deſerve only Condemnation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Let it be to thy poor Creature, according to thy Word. Let Chriſt be mine; Let me be His alone. I come to thee, to make me every day more willing that it ſhould be ſo.</p>

                  <hi>XV.</hi> It is a Death, to think of being left by Gods Spirit in His Ordinances, and left to ſet light by them.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <hi>XVI.</hi> Yeſterday, I was in a Doubt, Whether I ſhould go to <hi>Watertown</hi>-Lecture, or not; becauſe of multiplicity of Buſineſs. I went nevertheleſs. And this Day, thro' Gods Aſſiſtance I have done as much as I uſed to do in two Dayes.</p>
               <p n="17">

Which was evidenced to me, by my longings and reachings of Heart after the Lord, not finding Satisfaction any where elſe. And in my deſiring and promoting the Glory of God, that He may be advanced by my ſelf and many others. How can I Love the Lord, or His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, except He have Loved me?

Yea, I have ſinned unto Death, the Lord JESUS! This moſt affected me, That I have Crucified the Lord

                  <hi>XIX.</hi> I was afraid, leſt my Soul never reſted in Chriſt, and found ſatisfaction in Chriſt alone.

                  <hi>XX.</hi> The Lord affects my Heart with ſome ſhame, that I ſhould ſo Diſhonour my Fathers Houſe, as to feed upon Husks, when He has Bread Enough for me: That I ſhould promiſe my ſelf any Paradiſe under the Sun, when as I have experimentally found all to be vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit; That I ſhould mind or deſire the love of the Creature, more than take contentment in the love of Chriſt, who loveth me better than any Creature can do, and who is more able to do for me, what I ſtand in need of, than any, yea, than all beſides.</p>
