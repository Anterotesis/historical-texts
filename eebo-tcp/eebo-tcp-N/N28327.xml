            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of March following. — Since which time he has not been heard of, but is supposed to have lost both his ships among the Ice Islands, in his run towards the South Pole, on discovery. His journal from 1785 to 1788, has since been published at Paris by order of the Directory, and lately translated in London. The Corvettes</hi> La Recherche, <hi>and</hi> L'Esperance, <hi>sailed from France in 1790, under the command of Captain Entrecasteux, and returned in 1793, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having gained their object; which was, to search for the unfortunate Count</hi> DE LA PEYROUSE.</p>

                  <p>THE fog clears away — still combating with the sun — still darkening the surface of the sea — thus calumny covers virtue, creates romantic appearances, and is finally swallowed up by the force of truth. — Ah! what a spectacle! already the peak of a mountain on the nearest island raises itself out of the vapours — thin clouds only are seen to hover yet around it. — Now the fog forms itself into balls on the deep, the beautiful surface of the sea becomes visible — the circle expands every moment — my breast becomes fuller — the view brighter — and the Creator forces from me a tear of high affliction as my morning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers! — Do I not see at a distance some white point? — A small cloud — no — a sea bird — a swan — no — God! — What deception! — A sail! — A ship! — Poor forsaken! do not rejoice too soon! — An image of your dream juggles hope before your eyes. — And yet — it moves — it proceeds — not so the course of clouds — the flight of birds — away from my eyes you clouds of fog!

God! you send me a vessel! — <hi>(rises hastily, takes a white handkerchief from his pocket, and swings it in the air)</hi> Ah! they do not perceive me! — they will pass by — not hear my anxious cries — Oh! now my fate perhaps depends on the eye of a single man — God! throw but one glance this way! May but one glance of the sailor on the top be fastened to this rock, that he may call to the helmsman: halt! there lives an unfortunate man! — In vain! — I will light a fire — a thick smoke shall rise to the clouds — <hi>(a cannon shot is heard far in the sea)</hi> Ah! What can that mean? Was it an answer to my signal? Was it a promise to save me? — Yes! yes! triumph! the ship alters its course — it steers towards me! — Away! away! down to the bay! <hi>(With joyful emotion, he leaps down the rock and will run off.)</hi>

If he could hear how much I have learned of my friend, if he could know the goodness of the God he has given me; if he could see how we love each other, how we continue in love, and always are contented in storm and sun shine — I don't know what this ship can have to do here? we don't want it. — But my friend seemed to rejoice so much, then I must rejoice too; neither of us has ever rejoiced <hi>alone.</hi>

                     <p>Ah my good child! I had a lover, a husband, thirst for glory tore him from my arms! he was my all! my world, but he went in search of a new world; he placed the globe between him and his wife. My sighs swelled his sails, prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling children kneeled on the sea shore, almost orphans al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>

                     <p>Seven years I waited with impatience for him like a bride — he came not!</p>

                     <p>The love of gain drove many to distant seas; many returned richly laden; but no one knew any thing of him, no one had seen him! not a piece of wreck nor a corps, was any where driven on shore.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Malv.</speaker>

                     <p>Love is always rich in nourishment for hope. Two vessels were fitted out to go in search of the forlorn. I beg'd for a place in one of them, and should it be in the worst part of the ship. They spoke of fatigue, of dangers — they little knew what love can suffer. Yes, I am ill, my strength is exhausted — but if I find him again, the recollection of my sufferings will vanish! and if I find him not, what matters it in what region grief terminates the sorrows of a disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wife!</p>

                     <p>Humanity at last succeeded, they granted my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to embark. My youngest son threw himself into my arms, I took him with me. During thirteen months we have been swimming from one sea to another, landed on ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited and uninhabited coasts, searched and enquired every where — Ah! none has any knowledge of him!

                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>Impatience drove me on shore. My brother is with me too. A great fog some days ago separated his ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel from our's, yet we look every moment for his arrival.</p>

                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>It is not a dream! I possess you again! Love chains all the quarters of the globe together, and converts the ocean into a drop of water. There is no desert, no uncultivated shore, from which one time or other, the thanks of love do
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037755_0013_100F45A964E51568"/>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peyr.</speaker>
                     <p>Ah! how this soft well-known voice leads me, as by an enchantment, back to my domestic bliss. I hear you, I throw a glance upon those inhospitable rocks, and ask my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in surprise: Where are we?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it then so extraordinary, that a loving wife should defy the elements? — The national assembly ordered two ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels to be fitted out, to restore the circumnavigator La Pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse again to his country. Love commanded me to go in search of the lost husband, the bemoaned father. Without me, in what language could those people enquire for you among the savage nations? Love created for me a language. Who could better than me discover the slightest traces of you? A lost piece of cloth, a name written by you upon a tree, who could have sooner discovered it than me? And if you, perhaps, were roving about in deserts and wildernesses, whose ears would your voice have sooner reached than mine?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peyr.</speaker>
                     <p>Noble wife! Do I deserve this exalted heavenly love?</p>

                     <p>Hear me and judge. On yonder rock the waves drove us, with all the furies of the elements. The ship went to pieces. Through every crevice entered death. The corps soon were swimming about the miserable wreck. I combated swimming against the fury of the waves, and thought to reach the shore, but the stream baffled my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. My strength died away — I thought once more of you — of my children — of God! and, exhausted with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, my arms dropped. When I recovered I lay stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the moss, a savage girl kneeled at my side, and at the first sign of life, she made a cry of joy.</p>

                     <speaker>Peyr.</speaker>
                     <p>Three times she threw herself into the foaming waves, and three times she was thrown back on the rocky shore. Death roared in vain; in vain the abyss menaced to swallow her up, or to dash her to pieces on the rocky cliffs. With the courage of a hero, and the strength of a savage, she threw herself the fourth time into the waves, caught her prize by the hair, and snatched it from the combating ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Listen farther. This small island is uninhabited. But rarely the savages come here from yonder group of islands, to fish. Malvina was here with her father and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who threatened to kill the stranger; the tears of Malvina only saved him. Under cocoa trees she prepared for me a place of rest, and linked the twigs over me for a roof. I slumbered sweetly. Before midnight she waked me trembling. Be quick and follow me! she said, and drew
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037755_0015_100F45ADF2F4E818"/>
me away. She led me through the thicket to the sea side. There she crept with me into a cavern, embraced me ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and rejoiced at my second preservation. Her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had concluded to kill me during the night. They thought Malvina to be asleep, but Malvina listened, and perceived their intentions. Favored by the darkness she stole away, and saved me from the assassins.</p>

                     <speaker>Peyr.</speaker>
                     <p>Still more! The next morning they sought Malvina. The woods re-echoed their menaces and their prayers. We heard her old father above us on the cliff, he called mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: Malvina! my daughter! will you leave me? — The girl wept, and remained.</p>

                     <p>When, after a long fruitless search, the boat went off with her father and brothers, she listened between the bushes, and her tears dropped from leaf to leaf, but not a sound betrayed her grief. And when the boat appeared on the distant sea like a white point only, she pressed me weeping to her heart, and exclaimed: Now I have neither father nor brother! You are my all! Leave me not!</p>

                     <p>From that moment I have to thank her for my life a thousand times! Without her I would have died of hunger. She taught me to catch birds and fish in nets; she taught me the knowledge of the eatable roots and herbs, and warned me of the poisonous; she made for me these clothes of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and skins; she ornamented my habitation with shells. — Speak — What could I do? — Separated from the inhabited world, exiled forever to this place of solitude, without hope ever to see you or my native country again, what reward could I offer to my benefactress? — to her, who voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiled herself with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alleviated my misery, and, when

                     <p>Yes, she spoke a word of comfort. It is on this solitary place only that we can enjoy content; without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offence to any weak mind. Ambition's flame has long since been extinguished in my breast. The sighs, which I often sent from this rock to my native country, betrayed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my heart's desire, not the love of glory. You have arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed — love has led you here to my arms — what more can I wish? — My heart is silent. Blessing to him who can contract all that he loves into a small circle! Blessing to him who from his small piece of land, looks contented at the world, which became to him as strange as the firmament that moves above his head. Here I have but to stretch out my hand, to touch a being by whom I am beloved. Then let us remain, Adelaide! Let us take possession of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which God has created for us in the midst of the sea. Love will cultivate yonder naked rocks, will ornament yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grot, and convert yonder gloomy woods into smiling groves.</p>

Are these the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a sinner?—Forgive me, God!

                  <p>Better <hi>one</hi> voluntary sacrifice, than grief's slow death of all. If I saw him surrounded by enemies, I would throw myself between their swords to save him. Despair is the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemy! It gnaws the body, and deadens the soul — <hi>(a pause.)</hi> — This good girl was happy without me; and so was La Peyrouse. He thought of me but with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as if we had been separated by death. My arrival was to him the appearance of a spirit; though the form of a once beloved person, yet still a spirit. — <hi>(a pause.)</hi> This girl is young and handsome — my blooming time is past—I am no more beautified by my tears — gratitude will attach him to me — every tie is oppressive to love which is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by its own power.—I shall not make him any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; but he will expect them, and avoid me. My too feeling mother will torment him with complaints; and me, the innocent cause, he will hate.—He hate me? No, no! but can we love the person whose presence oppresses us? Courage, Adelaide! as far as your eye-sight reaches, the horizon is obscure. Drop the curtain — but do it soon — do it now — in this moment whilst this attraction strains your nerves — whilst this fire expands your veins — who can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure me, that in a few hours the love of life will not reason away every future grief? I then would have to empty the cup drop by dop — better pour it down at one draught.—Well then! <hi>(she rises hastily, and picks up the fruit which she had thrown away.)</hi> How soon is such a fruit eat up. It will quench my feverish thirst — forget, what more it will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>(looking at the fruit.)</hi> How beautiful, how alluring—poor human beings! in how many delightful forms death lurks for you.—Thanks to you, chance, for this last favor! No dagger makes me shrink; no nauseous poison excites disgust.—Who could be afraid of this apple?</p>

                     <p>She has departed, like us, to another part of the world. She has left us nothing but her compass, virtue. Sister, let us take possession of the valuable inheritance. Confidence in God rewards the honest, even in a dungeon. Look around you! Is this island a dungeon? — A blossom invites you here, a fine fruit there.

with the stream of blood, or fruitless work against it? You have seen so much of the world, and know not yet the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of repose?—I know it. They may promise me golden mountains, and I will rather flee to the naked summit of Caucasus, than take part in a revolution; which, though it may be just, spreads death and discord, that posterity may earn a liberty, which is covered with the corps of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Yes, I am an Egotist. I live, and will enjoy my life; without rest there is no enjoyment.—My flag is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hoisted; to-morrow I'll set sail for England, whither my wife with your and my children have fled. I'll take them all on board; will freight my ship with all what here is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: masons, carpenters, utensils and farming tools — surely, I shall find honest people enough, who will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to the small country of quietude. There are poor exiles without number, who wander about without a roof to shelter them. Till my return, I will leave you all I can spare for your accommodation. If the winds and weather permit, I shall soon return; we then lay the foundation of a colony, as the Greeks did after their flight from Egypt; and who knows, whether our names are not as renowned after a few thousand years, as those of Inachus and Cecrops.</p>
