            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE honorable judge DUDLEY
<q>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem'd the method of ordination, as practiſed in Scotland, at Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, among the diſſenters in England, and in the churches in this country, to be ſafe, ſcriptural and valid.</q>
And he firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed,
<q>that the great head of the church, by his bleſſed ſpirit, had own'd, ſanctified and bleſt the adminiſtration of goſpel ordinances by perſons ordained in this way; and that he would continue ſo to do to the end of the world.</q>
It
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009089_0004_10311C45ECF4AEA8"/>
was accordingly his intention, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at this lecture ſhould be adapted to the purpoſe of "explaining and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing" this kind of ordination. Not that he queſtioned "the validity of what is commonly called epiſcopal ordination, as performed in the church of England," or had it in his heart to encourage the ſaying any thing that would inſinuate as tho' God had not bleſt, and would not go on to bleſs, the miniſtry of thoſe who were thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Had none of the friends to eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſuperiorities, according to the preſent epiſcopal form, been leſs wanting in candor and charity towards thoſe who differ from them, we ſhould never have heard of this lecture. It took riſe, in the honorable founder's mind, from the narrow principles of thoſe anathamatiſing zealots, who would confine ſalvation to their own church, by confining the validity of goſpel ordinances to the adminiſtration of them by perſons, upon whom the hands of a biſhop, in their ſenſe of the word, have been impoſed. And he wiſely ordered the preaching of it in this place, that our ſons, who are ſent here, from all parts of the land, to be trained up for public ſervice, might be under advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to hear and know the reaſons, upon which they may, with all good conſcience, join in communion with theſe churches,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009089_0005_10311C48C9635200"/>
and officiate as paſtors in them, ſhould they, when fitted for it, be called thereto in the providence of God.</p>
            <p>YOU are, by this time, at no loſs to know the deſign of the preſent diſcourſe; that it is to vindicate the New-England churches in their method of ordination by preſbyters: or, in other words, to aſſert and maintain the ſafety and validity of what is commonly called preſbyterian ordination, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the goſpel miniſtry.</p>
            <p>ONLY, before I come to the argument upon this head, it may not be amiſs to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a few things, in which we agree with our opponents.</p>
            <p>WE agree with them, it is the will of Chriſt there ſhould be officers in his church to preach the word, to adminiſter the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to exerciſe diſcipline, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe powers to other faithful men; and that this will of his extends to all ages, till time ſhall be no more. "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world." Whether it be his will, made known in the new-teſtament-revelation, or elſe-where, that this work of the ſacred miniſtry ſhould be divided, and differently lodged in the hands of two diſtinct orders of men, the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009089_0006_10311C4D9FDC3830"/>
one ſuperior, the other inferior, we ſhall hear afterwards.</p>
            <p>WE agree with them, that none ſhould take upon them the miniſterial office, unleſs they are qualified for it conformably to the apoſtolic directions in the epiſtles to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus; and, if they are thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that they have no right to officiate as paſtors in the church of Chriſt, till they are called hereto. "No man taketh this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to himſelf, but he that is called of God as was Aaron." This call, in the opinion of the church of England, includes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an ability given by God for the work of the miniſtry, but the excitement of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual readineſs in the perſons who have it freely to devote themſelves to the goſpel ſervice. We go farther, and add hereto, the voice of the church. And herein the advantage lies undeniably on our ſide, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an appeal be made to ſcripture, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive antiquity. Even after the diſtinction between biſhops and preſbyters took place, it was by the ſuffrage of the people that this or that perſon was ſelected for this or the other cure. In this way, Alexander was choſen biſhop of Jeruſalem <note n="†" place="bottom">Euſeb. Lib. 6. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009089_0007_10311C4F24781328"/>
as was alſo his ſucceſſor Cornelius <note n="†" place="bottom">Cyprian. Epiſ. 67.</note>; and it was by the ſame favor and ſuffrage of the people, "plebis favore," <note n="§" place="bottom">Pontius in vita Cypriani.</note> "populi ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio," <note n="*" place="bottom">Cyprian. Epiſ. 55.40.</note> that Cyprian was elected biſhop of Carthage. — But inſtead of miſpending the time to prove that which is ſo well known to all, in any meaſure acquainted with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, it may rather be lamented, that the churches of Chriſt have ſo generally had wreſted from them, in one way or another, this invaluable privilege. The people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the epiſcopal church at home, ſcarce know what it is to have paſtors of their own chuſing. And the caſe is much the ſame with moſt of the proteſtant chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Europe. The right of nomination is almoſt univerſally lodged, not with the people, but with princes or patrons, either clerical or ſecular, in conſequence whereof their miniſters are not of their own chuſing, but ſuch as others chuſe for them. The New-England churches, bleſſed be God, poſſeſs and exerciſe the right of electing their paſtors in the moſt ample manner of any in the whole chriſtian world. May they ever "ſtand faſt in this liberty" where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he who is "head over all things," has "made them free"! And may their glory, in this reſpect, be never taken from them!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009089_0008_10311C51028CEC70"/>WE agree with them, that, beſides the call to, their muſt be an inveſtiture in, the miniſterial office, before perſons may, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes, regularly undertake to do the work that is proper to it: And we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreed, that ordination, meaning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by impoſition of hands with ſolemn prayer, is the ſcripture-mode of this inveſtiture. By the uſe of this rite, with prayer, Paul and Barnabas were ſeparated to the work to which God had called them. So was Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy; and ſo were thoſe ſeperated by him to the like work. And this has been the rite of miniſterial inveſtiture in uſe in the church all along from the beginning to this day.</p>
            <p>ONLY, let it be remembered here, if, by ordination, our opponents ſuppoſe any moral gift, or ſpiritual power, inherent in the ordainers, is conveyed from them to the perſons upon whom they lay their hands, we beg leave to diſſent from them in this: Apprehending, and, as we judge, upon good grounds, that the authority of goſpel miniſters comes ſolely from Chriſt; while the ordainers are nothing more than his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in inſtating the perſons they ordain in the regular exerciſe of this authority. As in the caſe of the mayor of a city, the king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> charter of incorporation grants the power;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009089_0009_10311C53784F8700"/>
the burgeſſes and recorder only indigitate the proper recipient of it, and put him legally into the execution of his office. So here, Chriſt, in the goſpel-charter, gives the power to act as his miniſters; it only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the ordainers to point out the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with whom this power is intruſted, and regularly admit them to the exerciſe of it. The ordainers are to be conſidered, not as granting this power, but as acting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially in introducing capable perſons, according to goſpel-order, into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and uſe of it; the power itſelf having already been granted by Chriſt, the alone fountain of all power in the church, which is properly jure divino.</p>
            <p>IT follows from hence, as we judge, very obviouſly and juſtly, that thoſe who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly veſted with the miniſterial office may fairly claim, and warrantably exerciſe, all the power that belongs to it, be the words of their inveſtiture, or the intention of their ordainers, what they will. For as their office is from Chriſt his inſtituting will, not the intention or words of their ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, muſt be the true and only meaſure of their power.</p>
            <p>IN fine, we agree with our opponents, that the inveſtiture by ordination muſt be
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009089_0010_10311C55EC500268"/>
the act of thoſe, and only theſe, who are authoriſed to perform it. It is not left, in the ſacred ſcriptures, a work common to all, and that may be done by any; but is the appropriate truſt of ſome, in diſtinction from others. The brethren may not impoſe hands in conſecrations to the goſpel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Nothing occurs in the new-teſtament that can be conſtrued to countenance ſuch a practice. The buſineſs belongs to thoſe only who are officers in the church of Chriſt; tho' not to theſe indiſcriminately. For dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, no more than more brethren, may be allowed to lay on hands in ordination. The goſpel officers who may do this are only thoſe, who are authoriſed hereto; that is to ſay, they are only thoſe whoſe office contains in it this, among other miniſterial powers.</p>
            <p>BUT who are thoſe officers? This is the grand queſtion: And the true anſwer to it will be deciſive in the preſent diſpute.</p>
            <p>OUR opponents ſay, biſhops, conſidered as an order of men diſtinct from, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to, preſbyters, are the only church-officers, who are veſted with a right to ordain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:009089_0011_10311C595A037068"/>WE ſay, on the contrary, the ſcripture knows of no ſuch order of officers in the church; and that goſpel-preſbyters, or ſuch miniſters of Chriſt as are allowed to have a right to preach the word, and adminiſter the ſacraments, are true ſcripture biſhops, and cloathed with authority to do every thing that is to be done in the buſineſs of ordination.</p>
            <p>AND this is the point I am to make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to you. In order whereto I might call your attention to thoſe various argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have commonly been made uſe of upon like occaſions with this: but, as I am confined within too narrow limits to do them proper juſtice, I ſhall wholly paſs them over, though they carry in them, as I imagine, concluſive force, that I may leave room to enlarge on the following conſiderations, namely,</p>
            <p>THAT the apoſtles of Chriſt, in ſettling the churches, conſtituted (beſides the order of deacons) no more than one order of ſtanding paſtors; That theſe paſtors, in their day, were called ſometimes biſhops, ſometimes preſbyters, and promiſcuouſly pointed out by either of theſe names; and finally, that theſe biſhops or preſbyters were endowed with all the ordinary powers that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009089_0012_10311C5BD28FE460"/>
were to be exerciſed in the church of Chriſt, particularly with that of ordination.</p>
            <p>THESE premiſes will, if ſet in a juſt point of light, unavoidably juſtify us in concluding, that preſbyterian ordination, or, as it might with equal propriety be called, ordination by ſcripture-biſhops, is ſafe and valid.</p>
            <p>IT ſcarce needs to be previouſly remark'd here, that the apoſtles, conſidered as ſuch, were immediately ſent by God, and this under the infallible guidance of inſpiration, to preach the goſpel to Gentiles as well as Jews, to gather churches in all parts of the world, and to appoint the officers, both for inſtruction and government, which were to be perpetuated in them for their edification in faith and holineſs, till the time of the appearing of our Saviour to put an end to the preſent goſpel-oeconomy. This being taken for granted, I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>THAT the apoſtles, in virtue of this plenitude of power, which they received immediately from Chriſt, conſtituted no more (beſides the order of deacons, with which we have nothing to do at preſent) than one order of ſtanding officers in the goſpel-church. It is not my buſineſs, in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009089_0013_10311C5D5AFD4570"/>
this part of the diſcourſe, to ſay who theſe officers are: This will be done afterwards. At preſent I am concerned only with the fact itſelf; the proof of which is to be fetched from the ſacred writings. And the proof from hence is as full as could reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be deſired.</p>
            <p>NEITHER Chriſt nor his apoſtles have any where given inſtructions, deſcriptive of the perſons fit for the work of the miniſtry, that are adapted to the ſuppoſition of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of order in the paſtoral office. Had there been ſuch a difference, different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications would have been requiſite to the ſuitable diſcharge of the different truſts ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing therefrom; and it might juſtly have been expected, that the ſcriptures would have diſtinguiſhed between the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſpectively proper for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each of theſe truſts. But they no where thus diſtinguiſh. They no where intimate, that ſuch different endowments were neceſſary. Far from this, they have ſpecified the qualifications of one order of paſtors only; as may be ſeen at large in the epiſtles to Timothy and Titus. And what is ſtrange, they have been very particular in diſcribing the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of this one order, while they are totally ſilent with reſpect to the other that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009089_0014_10311C5FD4BC1330"/>
is pleaded for, tho' that other is ſaid to be by much the moſt honorable and important of the two.</p>
            <p>IN like manner, no rules are any where laid down for the guidance of ordainers in veſting ordinary miniſters with different degrees of honor and power. They are no where told of the inſtitution of two diſtinct orders of ſtanding paſtors; they are no where inſtructed to exerciſe their ordaining right conformably to this diſtinction, by placing ſome in an higher, others in a lower rank in the church. The ſacred writings of the apoſtles ſay nothing to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as this. On the contrary, they preſent to our view a very full and explicit directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ordination of one order only of ſtanding paſtors. This we have in the Pauline inſtruction, referring to the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the churches in Crete. The great apoſtle of the Gentiles gives it in charge to Titus, whom he left in this iſland with a direct view "to ſet in order the things that were wanting," to ordain fixed paſtors in the ſeveral churches there. But what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were they? Of a different rank, ſome ſuperior, others inferior? Not a word leading to ſuch a tho't is to be found thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole epiſtle. No; but the paſtors he directs ſhould be ordained were preciſely
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009089_0015_10311C634BF8FCB8"/>
of the ſame rank or degree: Nor did Titus ordain any other. He could not indeed have done it, unleſs he had acted counter to the direction he had received from the inſpired Paul.</p>
            <p>THE plea here is, Titus was himſelf, at this time, the ſole biſhop of Crete, and as ſuch entruſted with the power of ordaining inferior paſtors. But this is a plea that can't be ſupported upon juſt and ſolid reaſons; as we ſhall have occaſion, by and by, to make plain to you. In the mean time, we go on and ſay further,</p>
            <p>THAT, in the churches ſettled in apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic times, no ordinary goſpel-miniſters are to be found but of one order only. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were in Lyſtra, Iconium and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och. The apoſtle Paul, with Barnabas, conſtituted ſuch paſtors in all the churches in theſe places, but no other. Tis ſaid, <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts, xiv. 23.</note> "they ordained elders," officers of one and the ſame rank, "in every city." Should the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be rendered, not, "when they had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them elders in every city"; but, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dr. Hammond's <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Hammond in loc.</note> mind, "when they had ordain'd them elders church by church"; meaning, that a plurality of elders was conſtituted in theſe churches collectively
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009089_0016_10311C66196C7410"/>
taken, not that there was this plurality in each individual church: I ſay, ſhould this be allowed to be the ſenſe of the words, it would notwithſtanding remain the truth of fact, that one order of officers only was here ſpoken of; which is all I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proving from this text. Tho' I ſee not but a plurality of elders might be ordained "from church to church," in one church after another, and ſo in every church, as well as a ſingle one in each church. And this is undoubtedly the true ſenſe of the place, as it beſt accords with what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually done in other churches.</p>
            <p>AT Epheſus, as in the place we have juſt been conſidering, no paſtors had been ſettled but of equal degree. No other are mentioned by the apoſtle Paul, when he ſent from Miletus to Epheſus to call to him the paſtors of that church. He ſpeaks of them in the ſtile of elders, <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts, 20. 17.</note> evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them as officers of one and the ſame rank. Had there been a biſhop in this church, a ſingle perſon of a ſuperior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to whom theſe elders were in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis ſtrange he did not ſend for him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Or if, at this time, he had been ſo far diſtant from his cure as not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in call, it is equally ſtrange he ſhould ſay nothing relative to him; eſpecially, as he
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009089_0017_10311C679F9B4B18"/>
was now to take his final leave of this church, <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xx. Ver. 38.</note> "knowing that they ſhould ſee his face no more." This, if ever, was a fit ſeaſon to mind them of their duty to their principal paſtor. And it might the rather have been expected now, as he ſpeaks of it as a thing known to him, "that after his departure, grievous wolves would enter in among them, not ſparing the flock." <note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 29.</note> Who ſo proper to have received inſtructions, in this caſe, as the chief ſhepherd? He tells them alſo, "that of their own ſelves men ſhould ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things to draw away diſciples after them." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ver 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> And who ſo ſuitable to be charged with the care of withſtanding theſe men as the biſhop? And yet, the whole care of this church, now the apoſtle was going from them to return no more, he devolves on the elders; and this, tho' he knew they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hazards, both from within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and from abroad. This conduct is ſo unlike to the manner of after times, when biſhops were advanced to ſuperior dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power, that it muſt be ſuppoſed, either that the church of Epheſus had no ſuch biſhop, or that the apoſtle was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgetful of him. Ignatius, a primitive father, who lived in this ſame century, if his epiſtles are genuine, as they are ſaid to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009089_0018_10311C6A13D247A0"/>
be by our opponents, did not treat the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of this, or any other of the churches he wrote to, with ſuch neglect. He rather eſteemed them officers ſo highly important as to make obedience to them an article worthy of his inculcation repeated to diſguſt. If the apoſtle Paul had been of the like ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he could not have omitted mentioning the biſhop of Epheſus, if there had been one in the church there, in his day.</p>
            <p>AT Philippi likewiſe there were no fixt paſtors but of one order. Very obſervable to this purpoſe is the inſcription of the epiſtle to the church there. "To all the ſaints in Chriſt Jeſus which are at Philippi, with the biſhops and deacons." <note n="†" place="bottom">Philip. I. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Beſides the deacons, no goſpel paſtors but of one order are here taken notice of. And the ſame ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence runs thro' the epiſtle itſelf. Theſe paſtors, 'tis true, are called biſhops; but they were biſhops of the ſame claſs with the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at Lyſtra, Iconium, Antioch and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus. To be ſure, they were not biſhops in the ſenſe of the church of England; and for this very good reaſon, becauſe there was a plurality of them in this church at the ſame time; which flatly contradicts that eſſential article in the epiſcopal ſcheme, "one church one biſhop."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:009089_0019_10311C6D82990DE8"/>NO pains have been wanting to evade this difficulty. Some, in order to it, have adopted the ſenſe, the counterfeit Ambroſe, but the true Hilary, would put upon the inſcription, and read it thus, "Paul and Timothy, with the biſhops and deacons, to the ſaints at Philippi." Should this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be allowed to be juſt it would not ſolve the difficulty. For it would ſtill remain true, that there was a plurality of biſhops in this church, unleſs it ſhould be ſaid, that theſe were the biſhops, not of the church of Philippi, but of other churches happening to be there at this time; which is a meer random-conjecture, arbitrarily made without the leaſt proof. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction itſelf is forc'd, and incapable of being juſtified. Should the inſcriptions prefixt to the two epiſtles to the Corinthians be thus read and interpreted, no epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, however zealous, would venture to ſay, we ſhould have the true ſenſe. And why any ſhould pretend, that this is the ſenſe of the inſcription in diſpute, no imaginable reaſon can be aſſign'd, ſetting aſide that of ſerving an hypotheſis; as the mode of dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is preciſely the ſame in all theſe inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Beſides, as ſome of the beſt critics have obſerved, if the apoſtle had intended to have taken in the biſhops and deacons with him in ſaluting this church, he would
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009089_0020_10311C6FF3428730"/>

            <p>THE learned Dr. Hammond, to avoid the ſuppoſition of more biſhops than one in this church, makes Philippi a metropolitan city, and the biſhops of it, not the biſhops of that ſingle city only, but of the cities under that metropolis. <note n="§" place="bottom">Hammond's note on Philip.

This is fairly and freely ſaid.</p>
            <p>I SHALL only add here, the apoſtle is as forgetful of the biſhop of this church, as he was of the biſhop of Epheſus; for he takes no notice of any ſingle paſtor ſuperior in rank to the other paſtors. And the ſame ſilence is obſervable in Polycarp's epiſtle to this church a few years after. Will any pretend, that non-reſidency was a common cuſtom in thoſe primitive times? It is far more likely there were no ſuch ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or paſtors, than that they ſhould be thus
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009089_0022_10311C73F3A7F7F0"/>
abſent from their cures. And yet, this muſt have been the caſe, or it can't eaſily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, that no mention is made of them; eſpecially when inferior paſtors are applied to, and even the deacons are not neglected.</p>
            <p>THERE is yet further evidence, that paſtors of one order only were ſettled in the churches, in the firſt times of the goſpel, from the apoſtle Peter's firſt epiſtle, which he directs to the chriſtians <note n="*" place="bottom">

But, inſtead of this, he mentions only ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as were of equal rank; and theſe, while ſilent about others, he is expreſs in urging to the faithful diſcharge of their duty as officers in the church of Chriſt.

            <p>IN the next place, that the names, biſhop and preſbyter, were, in apoſtolic times, reciprocal terms, and accordingly uſed as ſuch to point out this conſtituted order of paſtors. The text to this purpoſe are full and ſtrong. Thus, the elders, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>AND if the names were then common, and, as we have proved, promiſcuouſly uſed to point out the ſame church-officers, it is obvious, and yet juſt to conclude, that theſe are the officers always intended, whether they are called biſhops or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. And upon the truth of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, we may warrantably affirm, that the biſhops, whoſe qualifications are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the epiſtle to Timothy, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame with the elders Titus was directed to ordain in Crete; as alſo, that the biſhops of the church at Philippi were the ſame with the elders ſpoken of in other churches, and, è contra, the elders in other churches the ſame with theſe biſhops. And in this view of the ſcripture-language a perfect harmony runs thro' the whole new-teſtament upon this head of ordinary paſtors.</p>

Perhaps, the argument would have been valid, could we have reaſoned only from the reciprocal uſe of theſe names; but, as we reaſon not meerly from this, but from the appropriation alſo of the ſame work, and the ſame moral endowments, to the ſame perſons under theſe different names, the arguing is unexceptionably ſtrong and concluſive. And ſo it is confeſſed to be by ſome of the beſt writers in favor of epiſcopacy, particularly by the late celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted biſhop Hoadly, who, far from calling in queſtion the ſtrength of this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, acknowledges it's force, <note n="*" place="bottom">"Reaſonableneſs of conformity to the church of England." page <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

But, previous

to this, we ſhall go on to the laſt branch of the preſent argument, and ſay,</p>
            <p>THAT theſe officers of equal rank, who are promiſcuouſly called either biſhops or preſbyters, were endowed with all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary powers proper to be exerciſed in the church of Chriſt, with that of ordination, as well as thoſe of teaching, baptiſing and adminiſtering the Lord's ſupper.</p>
            <p>THAT they were authoriſed to preach and adminiſter the ſacraments, our opponents do freely allow. And from hence it might be conſequentially argued, á fortiori, that they were empowered alſo to ordain. For theſe are miniſterial acts more excellent and important in their nature, than that of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. — But the limits to which I am confined oblige me to paſs over this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>IT is alſo allowed, and even inſiſted on, by epiſcopal writers, that the ſame perſons who are authoriſed to govern, are in like manner, empowered to ordain. Now, it were eaſy to ſhow, from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the former of theſe powers was given to preſbyters; from whence it might be inferred, that they were veſted with the latter. But this argument alſo I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009089_0028_103119CAD8FF46D8"/>
that I may have time more fully to lay before you the direct proof we have, that the power of ordination was lodged with ordinary paſtors or preſbyters.</p>
            <p>AND we prove this from ſcripture-inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind of ordination.</p>
            <p>IF the ſacred books of the new-teſtament preſent to our view examples of ordination by preſbyters, we ſhall take it for granted, this will be eſteemed a good reaſon why we ſhould think, they were veſted with ordaining power; and that preſbyters now will act warrantably, while they copy after the pattern that is ſet them in the inſpired writings. It only remains therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe inſtances.</p>
            <p>THE firſt is that of the ſeparation of Barnabas and Paul to the work to which God had called them; the account whereof is recorded <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> in theſe words, "There were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers.—As they miniſtered to the Lord, and faſted, the holy Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate me Barnabas and Paul to the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had faſted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they ſent them away." This is the moſt circumſtantial account
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009089_0029_103119CDD84C2378"/>
given in ſcripture of an ordination. The perſons ordained were previouſly called of God; they were ſet apart to the ſpecial work to which they had been called; all the miniſterial acts any where mentioned, in the new-teſtament, as accompanying the ſeparation of perſons to the ſervice of the church of Chriſt, were performed, impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, faſting and prayer; and what is more directly to our purpoſe, the ordainers were "the prophets and teachers" of the church at Antioch. Theſe teachers were its ordinary paſtors, the ſame officers that are elſewhere promiſcuouſly called biſhops or preſbyters. Moſt certainly, they could not be biſhops, in the ſenſe of the church of England, becauſe there was a plurality of them in this church. What more can be wanting to make this a compleat inſtance in our favor?</p>
            <p>THE objections againſt it only ſerve as ſo many occaſions to place it in a ſtronger point of light.</p>
            <p>'TIS ſaid, by Turrianus, biſhop Bilſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome others, that this ſeparation of Barnabas and Paul was the act, not of the teachers, but of the prophets (extraordinary officers) who impoſed hands with them. But this is only ſaid not proved; nor can
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009089_0030_103119CFE9E98DA0"/>
it be proved. The divine order, "ſeparate me Barnabas and Paul," was as truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to theſe teachers, as to the prophets; they as certainly laid hands on theſe perſons; and prayed over them, in ſeparating them to their work: and as much is attributed to them, relative to their ſeparation, as to the prophets. And conſequently, if it can be argued, from any thing that is here ſaid to theſe prophets, or that is ſpoken of as done by them, that they were veſted with the power of ordination; it may, in the ſame way, and with equal ſtrength, be argued, that the teachers alſo were endowed with the ſame power; for there is nothing ſaid to the prophets, but what is equally ſaid to the teachers; nor was any thing done by the former but the ſame was done by the letter.</p>
            <p>IT is pleaded, by the whole body of epiſcopal writers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Barnabas and Paul were, before this, commiſſioned miniſters of Chriſts and that their preſent ſeparation was only to a ſpecial ſervice among the Gentiles. It is acknowledged; but, at the ſame time, denied that this makes any real alteration in the caſe. For it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, the thing intended by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not, that the ordainers ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion perſons to do the work of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009089_0031_103119D2E97BF308"/>
This is done by Chriſt. It only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them to declare who theſe perſons are, and ſeparate them to the work to which Chriſt has commiſſioned them. They don't make them miniſters; but, being authoriſed hereto, give them an authentic character as ſuch in the eye of the world. They don't confer upon them their authority in the goſpel-kingdom; but let them into the exerciſe of the authority proper to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, with the ſolemnity the ſcripture eſteems regular and decent. And it might ſeem good to the holy Ghoſt to order, that Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas and Paul, tho' before commiſſioned and ſent by Chriſt, ſhould yet, at this time, be ſeparated to their work by man, in the common and ordinary way. Neither of them, from any thing ſaid of the matter in the ſacred books, appear to have been thus ſeparated before now; and as they were now ſeparated to the work to which they had been called by impoſition of hands, with faſting and prayer, it may with all reaſon be affirmed, that this ſeparation was a true ſcripture-ordination. All the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions common to an ordination were performed upon this occaſion, and particularly that of laying on of hands. They were, in a word, ſeparated to the ſervice aſſigned them in the ſame way that Timothy was ſeparated to the miniſterial
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009089_0032_103119D8F7DD6FF8"/>
work, and afterwards ſeparated others to it; in the ſame way Titus was directed to ordain elders in the churches at Crete; yea, in the ſame way they themſelves ordained elders at Lyſtra, Iconium, and Antioch in Piſidia, and this, while upon the very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they were now ſeparated to. And why their ſeparation, at this time, ſhould not be eſteemed as proper a ſcripture-ordination as their's, which was effected by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame outward actions, no better reaſon can be given, than that it will not fall in with the ſcheme of our opponents.</p>
            <p>IT is further objected, this ſeparation of Barnabas and Paul was in conſequence of an immediate order from the holy Ghoſt, and therefore a precedent not pleadable but in like circumſtances. The anſwer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. Both Timothy and Titus were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately directed by an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, ſpeaking to them under the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghoſt, to ordain paſtors at Epheſus and Crete; and yet, the objectors themſelves plead theſe inſtances in ſupport of the right of biſhops, in their ſenſe of the word, to ordain; and this, to the excluſion of preſbyters. And if the plea is good on their ſide, it is equally ſo on our's. I would ſay further, this objection, inſtead of ſetting aſide the inſtance before us as a precedent,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009089_0033_103119DA84C344D0"/>
makes it the more ſtrongly valid. For it cannot be ſuppoſed, if ordinary teachers were unſuitable church-officers to perform the buſineſs of ordination, that the holy Ghoſt would have ordered them to do it. And, by his committing this work to them, we have an authentic precept, as well as example, for ordination by common tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ſtanding ordinary paſtors of the churches. And let me add here, it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, this direction from the holy Ghoſt, giving riſe to this inſtance of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by ordinary teachers, was intended for a precedent to the Gentile churches in all after times. This was the judgment of the learned Dr. Lightfoot. "No better reaſon, ſays he <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. page 18<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>, can be given of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent action, than that the Lord did hereby ſet down a platform of ordaining miniſters to the church of the Gentiles in future times."</p>
            <p>ANOTHER inſtance to our purpoſe we have in the caſe of Timothy, who was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to the goſpel-miniſtry with the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the hands of the preſbytery; as is evident from that exhortation of the apoſtle Paul addreſſed to him, in my text, "Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery:" The
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009089_0034_103119DC1287E580"/>
meaning of which words, compared with what is ſaid upon the matter in 2 Tim. i. 6. may, I think, be fully expreſſed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paraphraſe, "Improve the gift of the holy Ghoſt, which I imparted to you in an extraordinary meaſure, according to the propheſies which went before concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, when you was ſeparated to the work of the miniſtry with the laying on of the hands of the conſiſtory of preſbyters."</p>
            <p>YOU obſerve, I do not interpret the gift here ſaid to be in Timothy of his office as a miniſter, but of the communication of the holy Ghoſt, in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner qualifying him for it; which appears to me the moſt eaſy and natural ſenſe. You obſerve likewiſe, I ſpeak of this gift of the holy Ghoſt as imparted to Timothy, thro' the hands of the apoſtle Paul, not the hands of the preſbytery. There is no certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch a communication to be met with in the new-teſtament. Perhaps, the holy Ghoſt, in the days of the apoſtles, was never imparted thro' any hands but thoſe of an apoſtle. But ſhould it have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, this was the way of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the preſent caſe. For the apoſtle Paul expreſsly ſpeaks of this gift <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. i. 6.</note> as a gift that was in Timothy "by the putting on of his hands." Theſe preſbyters therefore did
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009089_0035_103119DD9D2BA2D8"/>
not impoſe hands on Timothy with a view to communicate to him this gift. It was imparted wholly thro' the hands of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul. And yet, the presbytery as certainly impoſed their hands on Timothy as Paul impoſed his. And why? No good reaſon can be aſſigned for it but this, that they might ſeparate him to the goſpel-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in the ordinary way, by uſing the ſcripture-rite common upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And if it be ſuppoſed, that this gift of the holy Ghoſt was imparted to Timothy thro' the hands of Paul, about the time that he was ſeparated to the miniſtry by the laying on of the hands of the conceſſus of preſbyters, we ſhall have an eaſy and conſiſtent ſenſe of this whole affair.</p>
            <p>THE truth of the caſe ſeems plainly to be this. The apoſtle Paul impoſed his hands on Timothy to communicate to him the gift of the holy Ghoſt; and either with the apoſtle, or, as I rather think, afterwards, the council of preſbyters laid on their's, ſeparating him, by this rite, to his work, as Paul himſelf, with Barnabas, ſome time before, had been ſeparated to their's. And very obſervable, it may be proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark here, is the analogy between this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Timothy, and that of Paul and Barnabas. They were ſeparated by expreſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009089_0036_103119E0AAA9C0C0"/>
direction from the holy Ghoſt; ſo was Timothy, for he was pointed out by prophecy, that is, by holy men propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpeaking of him by inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, as a fit perſon to be employed in the ſervice of the goſpel. And it was probably owing to this, that he was ſo ſoon ſeparated to this work, being, at this time, a very young man, and in danger, on that account, of being deſpiſed. They were ſeperated alſo by the laying on of the hands of the prophets and teachers, that is, the ordinary paſtors of the church at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och; ſo was Timothy, by the laying on of the hands of the company of preſbyters, reſiding where he now was.</p>
            <p>BUT the pertinency of this inſtance will appear with a brighter luſtre, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the objections that are made to it; as, by this means, we ſhall have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of going more critically into the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it.</p>
            <p>IT is objected, the word preſbytery, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here uſed, means the office ordained to, not the conſiſtory of ordaining preſbyters. This was Calvin's interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he wrote his inſtitutions <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <bibl>In loc</bibl>
               </note>. The other, by whomſoever it is given, will exhibit a down-right piece of nonſenſe, unleſs the ſubſtantive <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and the text be accordingly read, "Neglect not the gift of the preſbyteratus which was given thee by the laying on of hands." But this grammatical tranſpoſition is arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary beyond all reaſonable bounds. And ſhould the like liberty be taken in other caſes, we might make the ſcripture ſpeak, in any place, juſt what we pleaſe. Beſides, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is never uſed in this ſenſe in the new-teſtament; but always as ſignifying "conceſſus, ſenatus preſbytero<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rum." This alſo is it's meaning in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the fathers, as may be ſeen in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Blondell's "apologia pro ſententia Hveronimi." <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 89, 90.</note> And this is its meaning particularly in Ignatius's epiſtles, whoſe authority will not be queſtioned by thoſe we are at preſent concerned with. He often uſes this word, and never in any other ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:009089_0038_103119E9438A8650"/>BUT ſhould we allow this pretended ſenſe of the word to be the true one, and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence hereof, that Timothy was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by an aſſembly of preſbyters, but to the degree of the preſbyterate; inſtead of helping the cauſe of our opponents, it would, unluckily for them, very much ſerve our's. For Timothy, according to this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, at the time, when this epiſtle was wrote, nothing more than a preſbyter, whatever he might be afterwards: And yet, he is particularly apply'd to, in the epiſtle itſelf, as one intruſted with the power of ordination, and accordingly inſtructed to uſe caution and prudence in the management of this truſt, "not ſuddenly laying hands on any man." And if Timothy, while a meer preſbyter, was ſpoken of, by an inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apoſtle, as one veſted with ordaining power, it is as good a proof of the power we are eſtabliſhing, as if he was ordained by a conſiſtory of preſbyters.</p>
            <p>'TIS again ſaid, by the preſbytery here is intended, not an aſſembly of presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but the college of apoſtles. So ſpeak Chryſoſtom, Theophilus, Theodoret, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius, and after them ſuch learned men as Dr. Hammond, Mr. Drury, and ſome others; but, as we imagine, without any ſufficient reaſon to ſupport this ſenſe of the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009089_0039_103119EC3A2646B8"/>
word. It is indeed a ſenſe that carries with it not the leaſt probability of truth. The apoſtle Peter, 'tis true, introduces an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Preſbyters, by taking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſtile of a fellow-preſbyter, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. v. 1.</note>; but the apoſtles, in a collective view, are never once ſpoken of, in the new-teſtament, as a preſbytery; nor is the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ever uſed by any ancient writer (as Mr. Boyſe obſerves) to ſignify the bench of apoſtles. Far from this, when met together in council at Jeruſalem, upon a ſpecial occaſion, with the elders, they are carefully and particularly diſtinguiſhed from them, every time they are mentioned.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xvth chap.</note> Nor can it well be imagined, if the other apoſtles had joined with Paul in laying their hands on Timothy, either for imparting the holy Ghoſt, or ſeparating him to the goſpel-miniſtry, that this humble apoſtle would have omitted mentioning their names, ſince he ſo expreſsly mentions his own. Beſides, there is not the leaſt reaſon to think, that either all, or moſt, or any conſiderable number of the apoſtles were together at this time. 'Tis far more likely, from the hiſtory we have in the acts of their travels, and diſperſions from each other, that Paul only was now preſent, and that the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery that laid their hands on Timothy was not the company of apoſtles, but ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009089_0040_103119F0024C68D0"/>
presbyters as they had conſtituted in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral churches.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould it be ſuppoſed, that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were now together, and that this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery was the aſſembly of apoſtles, it would be of no real ſervice to the epiſcopal cauſe. For 'tis plain, they acted not, in their apoſtolical character, but as presbyters. Why elſe are they called a presbytery? It cannot reaſonably be thought, if the holy Ghoſt intended to declare, in this text, that Timothy was ordained by apoſtolical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not that which is veſted in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, he would ſo expreſsly have ſpoken of the apoſtles as acting in this affair as a presbytery. It ſhould rather ſeem evident from hence, that the work they now did was common and ordinary, and ſuch as might be done by theſe officers, under whoſe ſtyle they are repreſented as perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this action.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, it is pleaded, that Timothy was veſted with his office by the laying on of the apoſtle Paul's hands, while the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory of presbyters, by impoſing their's, only gave their concurring approbation. And for the proof of this we are turned to 2 Tim. i. 6. where Paul, calling upon Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy "to ſtir up the gift that was in him,"
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009089_0041_103119F271B95EC0"/>
adds, "which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."</p>
            <p>THE anſwer is eaſy. This ſame apoſtle attributes as much to the hands of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in 1 Tim. 4.14. as he does to his own hands in the place referred to in his ſecond epiſtle; and conſequently there is juſt the ſame reaſon to ſay, that the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery ordained Timothy, as that Paul or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him. Beſides, it cannot be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſuppoſed, that an inſpired apoſtle ſhould permit a number of presbyters to join with him in the ſacred ſolemnity of impoſing hands, if they had not a right, as officers in the church of Chriſt, to perform this action; and their performing it is a ſure argument of their right to do the thing intended by it, that is, to ſeparate a perſon to the work of the goſpel-miniſtry: As they that have a right to apply water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, have a right to baptiſe; and they that have a right to ſet apart bread and wine, and diſtribute it to the people, have a right to adminiſter the Lord's ſupper.</p>
            <p>BUT the truth of the matter is, it is far from being evident, that Paul impoſed hands with the presbytery in Timothy's ordination; and I am ſtrongly inclined to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009089_0042_103119F3FA2E7860"/>
think he did not. The gift the apoſtle ſpeaks of, in his ſecond epiſtle to Timothy, which, ſays he, "is in thee by the putting on of my hands," was undoubtedly the gift of the holy Ghoſt in miraculous powers; but whatever the gift was, it was imparted by the apoſtle's own hands. Not a word is ſaid of the presbytery, or any perſon whatever, as joining with him, not ſo much as in a way of concurring approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas, in the paſſage we are now conſidering, recorded in the firſt epiſtle, the thing that was done, whatever it was, was done with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Their hands only are mentioned, not a word is drop'd inſinuating that Paul's hands were joined with theirs. It is therefore highly probable, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Paul impoſed hands on Timothy to confer the gift of the holy Ghoſt, which was uſually, if not always, done by ſome apoſtle in this way; and that the presbytery afterwards laid on their hands for another purpoſe, that of ſeparating him to the work of the miniſtry, which alſo was uſually done in this way.</p>
            <p>OR if it ſhould be ſtill ſaid, that Paul laid hands on Timothy at the ſame time the presbytery impoſed their's, he did it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally that through his hands, being an apoſtle, the holy Ghoſt might be imparted
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009089_0043_103119F67287CE68"/>
to him; they, that he might, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary method, be ſeparated to the goſpel-miniſtry. So that, in either of theſe ways, we have an evident inſtance of ordination by presbyters. In the former, they were ſole ordainers; in the latter, ordainers in partnerſhip with the apoſtle Paul.</p>
            <p>I CAN'T help ſaying here, if, inſtead of, "the laying on of the hands of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery," it had been wrote, "the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the hands of the epiſcopate," our opponents would have triumphed in having an unexceptionable inſtance of epiſcopal ordination. But this occaſion of glorying is happily taken away. And it is remarkable, tho' we have examples, in ſcripture, of ordination by both extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ordinary officers, by apoſtles, by prophets, by evangeliſts, by teachers or common paſtors and presbyters; yet we no where read of an ordination by any perſon under the name of a biſhop. There is a total ſilence throughout the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this head. This obſervation, to uſe the words of your worthy Divinity-profeſſor, in a book of his, relative to this controverſy, wrote near 40 years ago, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, "ſober remarks," and which I would recommend to your diligent peruſal, "This obſervation, ſays he, <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 115.</note>
               <q>may perhaps draw
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009089_0044_103119FA17A9F3F0"/>
ſome weak perſons into doubts about the validity of epiſcopal ordination.—But the truth of the caſe is, that biſhops and presbyters are one and the ſame order by divine inſtitution; and that they ſucceed the apoſtles, in all their ordinary powers, of which that of ordination is one; which is warrant enough for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by presbyters, and the very ſame warrant which thoſe have for it, who are now, by cuſtom and human conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, dignified and diſtinguiſhed with the title of biſhops.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE now conſidered the argument at firſt propoſed, in all its parts. And the ſum of what has been ſaid, that we may have it in one view, is this; that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Chriſt, in conſequence of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him, and as acting under the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, conſtituted and ſettled in the church, beſides the order of deacons, no more than one order of fixed paſtors; that they promiſcuouſly point out the paſtors of this one order by the names biſhop and presbyter, ſometimes uſing the former, ſometimes the latter, and meaning by either preciſely theſe paſtors of one and the ſame order; and finally that they give us abundant reaſon to believe, that theſe paſtors of this one order were
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009089_0045_103119FC8E2886E8"/>
endowed particularly with the power of ordination, inſtances whereof they have left upon ſacred record. The concluſion from which premiſes, if they have been clearly and fully evidenced to be true, as I truſt they have, is unqueſtionably this, that ordination by presbyters, according to the uſual method in theſe churches, is ſafe and valid, becauſe agreeable to the holy ſcriptures, and warranted by them.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding all that has been offered in proof of the point we have been upon, it ought not, it is acknowledged, to be received as truth, unleſs the contrary evidence can fairly be ſet aſide. This therefore makes it neceſſary to conſider what is pleaded on the other ſide of the queſtion. And this I ſhall now do, giving what is ſaid its full ſtrength, ſo far as I am able. For if the counter-evidence, in it's full weight, will not admit of a juſt and ſolid anſwer, we ought, in all reaſon, to eſteem the above proof to be defective, how plauſible ſoever it may appear in a ſeparate view.</p>
            <p>THE firſt thing ſaid in favor of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of biſhops to presbyters, and in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their claim to the powers of ordination and government is, that they
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009089_0046_103119FE44B2C628"/>
are ſucceſſors to the apoſtles, and derive from them this ſuperiority of order and power.</p>
            <p>THE anſwer is ready. The apoſtles, as ſuch, were extraordinary officers, and had no ſucceſſors. They received their commiſſion immediately from Chriſt, their charge was unlimited, their province the whole world. They were, by office, the teachers of all nations, had power to gather churches every where, to ſettle them with proper officers, to inſpect over them, and give binding rules and orders for the good government of them; and all this, under the infallible guidance of the holy Ghoſt. It will not be pretended, I truſt, that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in theſe reſpects, are ſucceſſors to the apoſtles. In their proper apoſtolic cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, they were far exalted above all bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. As the great Dr. Barrow expreſſes it, (to adapt his words to the preſent caſe)
<q>It would be a diſparagement to an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to take upon him the biſhoprick of Rome; as it would be to the king, to become mayor of London; or to the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of London, to become vicar of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſs.</q>
The apoſtolic office, as ſuch, was perſonal and temporary; not ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and communicable: Neither did the apoſtles communicate it. Thoſe parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009089_0047_103119FFCAD3ED48"/>
of their office which were ordinary, and intended for perpetual uſe, ſuch as feeding the church of God with the word and ſacraments, and reſtraining them within the rules of good order, were communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them to others. We have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſeen, that they appointed ſtanding paſtors in the churches, veſting them with all the powers proper for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying the body of Chriſt. And in a lax ſenſe, theſe may be called ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to the apoſtles, as having derived their power from them in Chriſt's name. And in this looſe ſenſe only may biſhops be ſaid to be ſucceſſors to the apoſtles. They certainly do not ſucceed them in their office, conſidered as apoſtolic; but in ſuch powers of it only as are ordinary and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And here they are perfectly upon a par with common paſtors or preſbyters, unleſs it can be proved, that the apoſtles in communicating theſe powers, made a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, committing ſome to a ſuperior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der called biſhops, and others to an inferior one deſcribed by the name of preſbyters. This is what we may reaſonably expect to ſee evidenced. The new-teſtament is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. If it contains any ſuch evidence, let it be produced. We imagine it contains clear evidence of the contrary, and that we have given ſuch evidence. Meerly the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009089_0048_10311A06DEA99048"/>
biſhops ſucceſſors to the apoſtles won't prove their ſuperiority; tho', by the way, they are never ſo called in the ſacred books. And ſhould it be allowed, that the fathers, in after times, ſpeak of them in this ſtile, it can be in a looſe ſenſe only; meaning, that apoſtolic power had been communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, tho' what that power was, can never be determined meerly by their being called the apoſtles ſucceſſors. The bible only can ſettle this point.</p>
            <p>IT is further ſaid, in defence of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſcheme, that Timothy and Titus were biſhops, the one of Epheſus, the other of Crete, meaning hereby officers of a rank ſuperior to the other paſtors of the churches in thoſe places, with whom, as ſuch, were lodged the powers of ordination and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>'TIS reply'd, they are neither of them called biſhops any where in the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This name, 'tis true, is given them in the poſtſcripts to the epiſtles that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to them. But I need not ſay, that theſe poſtſcripts are after-additions, and not very ancient ones neither. This is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known to all men of learning, who accordingly lay no ſtreſs upon them. 'Tis true likewiſe, that they are called biſhops,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009089_0049_10311A0867CC1470"/>
the one of Epheſus, the other of Crete, by the fathers; but not by the more primitive ones. Dr. Whitby honeſtly confeſſes, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Preface to the epiſtle to Titus.</note> that "he could not find, within the three firſt centuries, any intimations that they bore this name." He adds indeed, "this defect is abundantly ſupplyed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current ſuffrage of the 4th and 5th centuries." But theſe were times too far diſtant from Timothy and Titus to be rely'd on for the truth of this fact; eſpecially, as, in theſe times, they had greatly departed from the ſimplicity of the goſpel. And 'tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Euſebius, the great ſource of primitive eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, only ſays, "it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported," <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. III cap. 4</note> dicitur, "that Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy was biſhop of Epheſus, and Titus biſhop of Crete." And he has himſelf taught us, how far we may depend upon this report, by what he tells us a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note n="§" place="bottom">Lib. I. cap. 1</note> "that he could trace no foot-ſteps of others going before him, only in a few narratives." And the ſuffrage of theſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies is the leſs to be regarded, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, becauſe it does not agree with the ſcripture-account of Timothy and Titus. Timothy is expreſsly called "an evangeliſt," 2 Tim. iv. 6. And his work, as ſuch, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his being the biſhop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, or any other church. The buſineſs of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009089_0050_10311A09FA595508"/>
an evangeliſt, as Euſebius <note n="‡" place="bottom">Lib. III. cap. 37.</note> juſtly repreſents it, was,
<q>to lay the foundation of faith in ſtrange nations, to conſtitute them paſtors; and, having committed to them the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating thoſe new plantations, to paſs on to other countries and nations.</q>
And this deſcription of evangeliſts perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with what the ſcripture ſays both of Timothy and Titus. They evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been itinerant miſſionaries, not ſettled paſtors. To be ſure, they ſuſtained no fixed relation to the churches of Epheſus and Crete, and conſequently were not the biſhops of them; for they continually went about from place to place, as the ſervice of the churches made it neceſſary, and were as long, and it may be longer, in other churches than thoſe that are ſaid to be their ſettled charge. And would any man, as Mr. Boyſe expreſſes it,<note n="†" place="bottom">"Account of the ancient epiſcopacy," page 331.</note> "call him the fixt biſhop of London that ſhould only perform the epiſcopal functions there for a year or two, but for twenty or thirty years is found to perform the ſame epiſcopal functions in moſt other dioceſes of England, nay in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dioceſes in France, Spain and Italy?" Can ſuch an itinerary miniſtry as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with a man's fixt relation to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church, which enjoys no more of his labors and care than twenty or thirty churches more?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:009089_0051_10311A0C74C5CBD0"/>BUT the ſtrength of the argument from Timothy and Titus chiefly lies in this, that they were charged with the management of ordination at Epheſus and Crete. Titus particularly was left in Crete with a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed view to his ordaining elders in the cities there. The anſwer is, it will not from hence follow, that they were veſted with an excluſive power of ordination. I argue upon the matter thus; either elders had been ſettled before this in the churches at Epheſus and Crete, or they had not; and whether our opponents proceed upon the former, or latter of theſe ſuppoſitions, their reaſoning is inconcluſive.</p>
            <p>IF elders had been ſettled in theſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the conſequence is far from being juſt, Timothy and Titus were particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the affair of ordination in theſe churches, therefore the power was in them excluſive of the ſtanding paſtors. By this way of arguing, they muſt have been ſole preachers, as well as ordainers; for they are as particularly charged to do the work of preaching, as that of ordaining. And by this ſame method of reaſoning, the church of Rome muſt be juſtified in their plea for Peter's ſupremacy; for there are not wanting texts of ſcripture, in which he is particularly apply'd to, and charged with
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:009089_0052_10311A102C81FF48"/>
inſtructions and orders without mentioning the other apoſtles. The plain truth is, as theſe evangeliſts were aſſiſtants to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and left in thoſe churches extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily qualified to ſupply their place, it was proper they ſhould have particularly committed to them the chief management of ordination, and all other affairs pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the kingdom of Chriſt, while they continued among them. But how does this prove, that, when they were gone, as was ſoon the caſe, this ſame work might not be done by the ſtanding paſtors? Or that the ſtanding paſtors might not, or that they did not, join with them in doing it, while they were actually preſent? 'Tis far more probable that they did, than that they did not. Timothy's ordination by the conſiſtory of presbyters would natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put him upon going into the like prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. To be ſure, ſome poſitive good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ought to be given, that he did not, and that the power of ordination was ſolely and excluſively veſted in him.</p>
            <p>THE other ſuppoſition was that of there being no ſettled paſtors in theſe churches, when theſe inſtructions were given to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus. And in this view of the fact, I ſee not but the diſpute muſt be at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ended; for their being directed to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:009089_0053_10311A11B1FDDDE8"/>
paſtors in churches that as yet had none, can't poſſibly prove, that theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, when ordained, might not ordain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo. And perhaps this is the real truth of the caſe. I am well aſſured, it will be found, upon trial, to be an inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable taſk to make it appear, that either of theſe churches, at this time, were ſettled with paſtors. They were, moſt probably, in the ſame imperfect ſtate with the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Lyſtra, Iconium, and Antioch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Barnabas and Paul, upon their return to them, ordained them elders. And, it may be, as Dr. Benſon well obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay at the end of his paraphraſe and note on the epiſtle of Paul to Timothy, page 8<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> moſt of the churches the apoſtle Paul writes to were in the ſame imperfect unſettled ſtate, at the time when he wrote to them.</p>
            <p>I SHALL only add here, as Timothy and Titus were evangeliſts, they had no ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; or if they had, fixed biſhops could not be their ſucceſſors. Nor will it follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe evangeliſts were left at Epheſus and Crete to manage the affair of ordination, that therefore biſhops, any more than preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, have this power. It muſt firſt be proved, and upon the foot of good evidence, that biſhops, meaning hereby officers in the church ſuperior to presbyters, were fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:009089_0054_10311A148280ABB8"/>
in thoſe places, and that the ordaining power was lodged with them, to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of presbyters; which has never yet been done, and I am fully perſuaded never will.</p>
            <p>IT is pleaded yet further, that the angels of the ſeven Aſian churches, in the book of the Revelation, were biſhops; that is, ſuch biſhops as the preſent argument is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with, or they are mentioned to no purpoſe. But how does it appear, that theſe angels were biſhops in this ſenſe? If the word is here uſed collectively, meaning the paſtors of theſe churches, and not a ſingle one in each church, the argument is at once ſuperſeded. And it ought to be thus underſtood. Such an expoſition beſt agrees with the manner of ſpeaking thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this whole book, in which like words are commonly uſed in this collective ſenſe. Nor, unleſs the word is thus interpreted, will the other paſtors of theſe churches have any concern in the meſſages that are ſent to the churches, which it would be highly unreaſonable to ſuppoſe. But, if every one of theſe angels ſhould be allowed to mean a ſingle perſon, how will it follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, that they were biſhops veſted with the ſole power of ordination and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe churches? The word angel
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009089_0055_10311A170126EC00"/>
carries in it's meaning nothing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports this; nor is there any thing ſaid, in the epiſtles themſelves, from whence it can be deduced. The argument therefore muſt be wholly grounded on this, that theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſingled out, and particularly wrote to. But this they might be, ſuppoſing there was no greater diſtinction between them and the other paſtors, than between Peter and the other apoſtles; between rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and curates; between an aſſembly of equal miniſters and their praeſes. In ſhort, it muſt be proved by other evidence than what is contained in the word angel, or the application of this word to a ſingle perſon, if proved at all, that biſhops were hereby intended, meaning by biſhops of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in theſe churches endowed with the ſole power of ordination and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which evidence has never yet been produced.</p>
            <p>THE laſt plea, and that which is trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in as deciſive, is the ſuffrage of all antiquity in favor of biſhops, as an order of men in the church ſuperior to presbyters, to whom belonged the powers of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government.</p>
            <p>BUT, before I come to this plea, it may be proper juſt to obſerve, that we are now
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009089_0056_10311A1A6D686F78"/>
diſputing againſt the epiſcopal ſcheme, and particularly that branch of it, the confining ordination to biſhops, not as a meer eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical appointment, a prudential expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; but as an inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and an inſtitution of his eſſentially connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the validity of goſpel-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And in this view of the matter, the demand, we imagine, is highly reaſonable, "what ſaith the ſcripture?" It is to little purpoſe to tell us of the fathers, and that it is uninterruptedly handed down from them as a fact, that biſhops were ſuperior to preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and had the ſole right of ordination. This cannot make epiſcopal-ordination ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the validity of goſpel-ordinances. It muſt be conſtituted neceſſary, if ſo at all, by the revelations of God, and in fair and legible characters too. We may, with all reaſon, expect to find both the conſtitution itſelf, and it's neceſſity, delivered in the ſacred books, not by innuendoes, far-fetch'd arguments, or probable conjectures; but with ſo much poſitive clearneſs, and expreſs affirmation, as to leave no reaſonable room for doubt. And there would now be no need of teſtimonies from the fathers. It would indeed be diſhonorary to the ſacred ſcriptures, and a groſs reflection on them as not being a perfect and ſufficient rule, if we might not, without traditionary helps from
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009089_0057_10311A1D40A89C10"/>
the elders, depend on them for the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of ſalvation. And, conſidering the ſentiments of our Saviour concerning the traditions handed down to the Jews from their elders, this kind of tradition ſeems to be one of the laſt things ſuitable to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to, in order to our knowing what is neceſſarily connected with true chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>HAVING remark'd this, I come to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the plea that is ſo much gloried in, as carrying with it even demonſtration. And, that it might loſe none of its ſtrength, I ſhall give it you in the words of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated biſhop Hoadly, who has wrote, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in as maſterly a way, upon this ſide of the controverſy, as any who have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it. In his book entitled, "The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of conformity to the church of England," in order to prove, "that the apoſtles left the power of ordaining preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the hands of fix'd biſhops," he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And here— I think I may ſay, that we have as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and as unanimous a teſtimony of all writers, and hiſtorians from the apoſtles days, as could reaſonably be expected, or deſired: Every one who ſpeaks of the government of the church in any place, witneſſing that epiſcopacy was the ſettled form; and every one who hath occaſion to ſpeak of the original of it, tracing it up to the apoſtles days, and fixing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their decree; and what is very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, no one contradicting this, either of the friends or enemies to chriſtianity, either of the orthodox, or heretical, thro' thoſe ages, in which only ſuch aſſertions concerning this matter of fact could well be diſprov'd.</q>
—
<q>Were there only teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be produc'd, that this was the government of the church in all ages, it would be but reaſonable to conclude it of apoſtolical inſtitution; it being ſo highly improbable that ſo material a point ſhould be eſtabliſhed without their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:009089_0059_10311A2149338F70"/>
advice or decree, when we find the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches conſulting them upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and upon matters not of greater importance than this. But when we find the ſame perſons witneſſing not only that the government of the church was epiſcopal, but that it was of apoſtolical inſtitution, and delivered down from the beginning as ſuch, this adds weight to the matter, and makes it more undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that here are two points to which they bear witneſs, that this was the government of the church in their days, and that it was of apoſtolical inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And in theſe there is ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and unanimity, that even St. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome himſelf (who was born near 250 years after the apoſtles, and is the chief perſon in all that time whom the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians cite for any purpoſe of their's) traces up epiſcopacy to the very apoſtles, and makes it of their inſtitution; and in the very place where he moſt exalts preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, he excepts ordination as a work always peculiar to biſhops.</q>
— He ſays, a little further on <note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 338.</note> —
<q>The teſtimony we ſpeak of, is not concerning the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolical inſtitution of the exorbitant power claimed by later biſhops, or of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal enſigns of worldly grandeur, or riches appropriated to them: But meerly
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:009089_0060_10311A2619A1D420"/>
of the inſtitution of one perſon to ordain and govern preſbyters, within ſuch or ſuch a diſtrict, and according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and rules of chriſtianity.</q>
—He adds, <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 339.</note>
               <q>All churches and chriſtians, as far as we know, ſeem to have been agreed in this point, amidſt all their other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as univerſally as can well be imagined.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HAD I met with this repreſentation of ancient teſtimony in a declamatory ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand writer, who knew little himſelf, and only retailed, in a flouriſhing manner, what he had heard from this and the other party-zealot, it would not have been ſurpriſing; but it really was ſo, to find a truly great and deſervedly renowned author bringing in the ancient fathers, univerſally, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, and conſtantly affirming it to be fact, and this in all ages from the apoſtles, that "the government of the church was epiſcopal," and "of apoſtolical inſtitution;" yea, and that it was "of apoſtolical inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution too, that one perſon ſhould ordain and govern preſbyters within a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict." One would imagine, from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, that, if the writings of the fathers were conſulted, epiſcopacy, both the thing, and the divine inſtitution of it, would ſo glaringly appear to have been
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:009089_0061_10311A279F3F09E8"/>
acknowledged by all the fathers, in all ages from the beginning, that there would be no room left for the leaſt debate upon the matter.</p>
            <p>AND is this the truth of fact? We ſhall ſoon ſee whether it is, or no. In order whereto let it be obſerved.</p>
            <p>A DISTINCTION ought always to be made between the two firſt centuries, and the ſucceeding ones for the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the writers in theſe centuries, as witneſſes in the preſent cauſe, is both obviouſly and certainly very great. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, due attention has not been given to this diſtinction by the diſputants on either ſide of the queſtion in debate. Sir Peter King's "account of the primitive church," is, it may be, as impartial an one as any extant; but it would, as I apprehend, have been leſs faulty, and more perfect, if he had kept in his eye this diſtinction thro' the whole of his work. Nor have any of the writers on our ſide of the diſpute, ſo far as I have had opportunity to read them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the cauſe with the advantage they might have done, if they had particularly pointed out the difference between the two firſt and following centuries, and made the uſe of it they might have done to their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:009089_0062_10311A29626FEB00"/>IT is readily acknowledged, the name biſhop, towards the cloſe of the ſecond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury began to be an appropriated term; ſignifying ſomething more than the word preſbyter. In the third century, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the appropriation was common. Biſhop and preſbyter pointed out officers in the church diſtinct from each other; tho' to ſay preciſely what, and how great, this diſtinction was, will, I believe, be found to be exceeding difficult. It was undoubtedly ſmall at firſt. The biſhop was no more than "primus interpares," the "head-preſbyter," the "praeſes" of the conſiſtory. And it was by gradual ſteps that he attained to that dignity and power with which he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards veſted. Thoſe eccleſiaſtical ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorities and inferiorities which have, for a long time, been viſible in the chriſtian world, were unknown in the firſt and pureſt ages. Nor did they at once take place. It was the work of time. From prime-preſbyters aroſe city-biſhops; from city-biſhops, dioceſan ones; from dioceſan biſhops, metropolitans; from metropolitans, patriarchs; and finally, at the top of all, his holineſs the pope, claiming the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of univerſal head of the church. But to return to the diſtinction between biſhops and presbyters in the centuries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following the ſecond. And it is
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009089_0063_10311A2C0F10B080"/>
own'd, there was a diſtinction between them; but, at the ſame time, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that the fathers are univerſal, and unanimous, in affirming it for fact, that it was a diſtinction importing a ſuperiority of order, or that it was of apoſtolical inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The learned profeſſor Jameſon, in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

More full to our purpoſe is what I find related, in Calamy's defence of non-conformity,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 87, 88.</note> from the renowned Dr. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds. The account is, "Dr. Bancroft, afterwards Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, preaching at Paul's croſs, told his auditory, that Acrius was condemned of hereſy, with the conſent of the univerſal church, for aſſerting that there was no difference, by divine right, between a biſhop and a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter; and that the puritans were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the church, in Aerius. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sir Francis Knolls, being ſurpriſed at ſuch doctrine, to which they were not in that day, ſo much uſed as we have been ſince, wrote to the learned Dr. John Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, who was univerſally reckoned the wonder of his age, to deſire his ſenſe about
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:009089_0064_10311A30229E1750"/>
the matter. The Doctor wrote him word in anſwer, that even Bellarmine the Jeſuit owned the weakneſs of the anſwer of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius to the argument of Aerius; that Auſtin eſteemed the aſſertion of Aerius he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, meerly becauſe he found it ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by Epiphanius; and that Auſtin himſelf owned, that there was no difference between a biſhop and a presbyter by divine right. He cites alſo biſhop Jewel, who, when Harding had aſſerted the ſame thing as Dr. Bancroft, alledged againſt him Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Auſtin, Jerom, and Ambroſe. He mentions, from Medina, ſeveral other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers; and further adds himſelf, Oecumenius, Anſelm arch-biſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, another Anſelm, Gregory, and Gratian."

was ſettled by the practice of the primitive church, in the ages following the apoſtles, to be of unalterable divine right." If any regard is to be paid to the judgment of theſe celebrated writers, who had made it their buſineſs to ſtudy the fathers, one would think there was reaſon, at leaſt, to ſuſpect, whether the evidence in favor of epiſcopacy, as an apoſtolical inſtitution, is ſo univerſal and conſtant as has been affirmed.</p>
            <p>BUT, leaving theſe later centuries, let us go back to the two firſt. And we may, with the more pertinency, do this, as the famous biſhop, whoſe plea we are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has ſaid, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 349.</note>
               <q>We do not argue meerly from the teſtimony of ſo late writers as theſe (meaning Jerom and Auſtin) that epiſcopacy is of apoſtolical inſtitution.

But wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all ages in the church witneſs, that this was the government in their days; that it was inſtituted by the apoſtles, and delivered down as ſuch. All that we produce St. Jerom for in this caſe, is that it was in his time, and that he believed it to be apoſtolical, and received it as ſuch: But without the teſtimony of the ages before him, I ſhould not eſteem this a ſufficient argument that it was really ſo.</q>

               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:009089_0066_10311A341F50BD28"/>AND do the fathers, in the two firſt ages, witneſs what they are thus peremptorily ſaid to do? I was at the pains, in my younger years, to read theſe fathers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with a view to this controverſy, and am obliged to ſay, upon my own knowledge of the matter, that the above repreſentation is really a miſtake, and a very great one too; which I candidly attribute to inattention, or ſome undiſcerned preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of mind. Would the time permit, I could give you the whole of what is ſaid, relative to the plea before us, by Barnabas, Hermas, Polycarp, Clement of Rome, Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Clement of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, all writers in the two firſt centuries, and ſatisfy you from the very words of theſe fathers themſelves, that they give no ſuch evidence as is here pretended. But it muſt ſuffice to ſay at preſent,</p>
            <p>THAT, Ignatius only excepted, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, within the two firſt centuries, united<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur in ſpeaking of biſhops and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters much in the ſame language with the ſacred ſcriptures. They never once ſay, either in ſo many words, or in words from whence it can fairly be collected, that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were an order in the church ſuperior to that of presbyters; they never once ſay, that ordination was the work of biſhops in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:009089_0067_10311A3749B67340"/>
diſtinction from presbyters; they never once ſay, that epiſcopacy was the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the church, or that it was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either by Chriſt himſelf, or any of his apoſtles; nor do they ever ſay, that it was ſo handed down to them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Far from this, unleſs it ſtrangely ſlipt my obſervation, which I do not in the leaſt ſuſpect it did, Clement of Alexandria, who flouriſhed towards the cloſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond century, is the firſt father (Ignatius excepted) who uſed that mode of ſpeech, "biſhops, presbyters and deacons." And the terms ſeem not even then to have loſt their promiſcuous uſe; for this ſame Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſpeaking of one under the name of a biſhop, calls him, in the ſame ſentence, the presbyter.<note n="*" place="bottom">Blondelli Apol. Sect. xi. page 36.</note> Irenaeus, 'tis true, a few years before, once uſes that form of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "biſhops and presbyters." His words are,<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib.

<pb n="70" facs="unknown:009089_0068_10311A3AF78B5858"/>
verſes, and ſo took biſhop and presbyter ſynonimically (as the apoſtle Paul did) for one and the ſame."</p>
            <p>I MADE the remark, while upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from ſcripture, that no inſtance was to be met with there of an ordination, by any perſon under the name of a biſhop. I now add, neither have I been able to find an inſtance of ordination under the like name and meaning by it a biſhop as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a preſbyter, in any writer till we come to the times when it is owned, a diſtinction obtained between theſe officers of the church. Epiſcoparians have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with an air of triumph, called for an inſtance of preſbyterian ordination for ſome hundreds of years after Chriſt. If they will be pleaſed to favor us with only one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of epiſcopal ordination, in their ſenſe of it, within the time above-deſcribed, which is a very conſiderable ſpace; longer, counting from Chriſt, than from the firſt ſettlement of this country to the preſent day, we will take it into conſideration, and give ſo notable a diſcovery all the weight it deſerves. In the mean time, we hope to be excuſed, if we do not believe it to be a fact, either univerſally, or unanimouſly, or conſtantly handed down from the days of the apoſtles, that ſingle perſons, meaning
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:009089_0069_10311A3DAC41AE70"/>
hereby biſhops as diſtinguiſhed from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, exerciſed the ordaining power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch and ſuch diſtricts, or that they were ever veſted with a right, by apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inſtitution, ſo to do. We rather think, there is no juſt reaſon to affirm this to be fact, upon the teſtimony of any one genuine writer whatever, within the limits we are now ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p>THE plain truth is, no more can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the writings of the fathers, till toward the cloſe of the ſecond century, or the coming in of the third, in favor of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, than from the ſcriptures themſelves. And were it proper to ſettle the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy by an appeal to the general ſuffrage of theſe writers, I ſhould willingly put it on that iſſue; as being fully perſuaded, that the advantage would lie on our ſide of the queſtion, as much as if it was to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the ſcriptures only.</p>
            <p>IT is readily owned, the epiſtles aſcribed to Ignatius, a truly primitive father, do as certainly, as ſtrongly, and as conſtantly diſtinguiſh biſhops from presbyters, as any of the writings of the third or fourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies. But this we eſteem of little weight in the preſent cauſe, as there is ſo much reaſon to think, that theſe epiſtles are not
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:009089_0070_10311A3F36489370"/>
his genuine works. If he wrote theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles (which, by the way, is far from being a point beyond diſpute) it is not in the leaſt probable, that they came out of his hands as they now appear. The Uſſerian and Voſſian copies, the only ones their great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, biſhop Pearſon, pretends, in his "Vindiciae Ignatianae," <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o defend, carry in them too many, and too notorious, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of interpolation to induce a belief, in any unprejudiced mind, that it is always the true primitive Ignatius that is the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For my own part, I eſteem it an eaſy thing to reduce it to an high degree of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral certainty, that theſe epiſtles, even in their pureſt editions, contain ſuch unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable marks of a later date than the times of Ignatius, that they ought never to be mentioned in this, or any other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, unleſs to prove that religious cheat and knavery were in practice ſo far back as the days of the fathers. Inſtead of going into the proof of what I have now ſaid, which would put me upon trying your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience beyond all reaſonable bounds, I ſhall refer you to the two celebrated French mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Daille and L'arrogue, on our ſide of the queſtion, and the celebrated biſhops, Beveredge and Pearſon on the other; in whoſe writings you will find antiquity ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack'd, and every thing ſaid upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

that learning or good ſenſe can ſuggeſt. Read them carefully (they are to be found in the College-library) and judge for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>I TRUST, I may now ſay, it has been made ſufficiently clear, from the poſitive evidence that has been exhibited in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this diſcourſe, and from its not being invalidated, but rather ſtrengthened, by the counter-evidence we have examined in the latter part, that the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was not depoſited in the hands of biſhops as diſtinguiſhed from presbyters; but that biſhops or preſbyters, meaning by theſe terms one and the ſame order of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, were veſted with power to ordain in the church of Chriſt; and conſequently that ordination by a council of preſbyters, as practiſed by theſe churches, is valid to all the ends of the goſpel-miniſtry.</p>
            <p>THE inſtitution of a lecture, on purpoſe to vindicate the New-England churches in this method of ordination, may, perhaps, be repreſented to their diſadvantage. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be taken herefrom to inſinuate, that the method is novel and peculiar, not practiſed or approbated by the other reformed proteſtant churches, any more than by the church of England.</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:009089_0072_10311A46BA39CAD0"/>IN order to guard againſt ſuggeſtions of this kind, it it may be proper to let you know, that the proteſtant churches abroad, in common with our's, far from owning the jus divinum of epiſcopacy, aſſert a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between biſhops and preſbyters, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latter, equally with the former, to perform the work of ordination.</p>

on the divine right of epiſcopacy; as may be ſeen in quotations, from their writings to this purpoſe, by the celebrated Stillingfleet. <note n="*" place="bottom">Irenicum, pag. 394, and onwards</note> And it is worthy of of ſpecial notice here, in Henry the eighth's time, when things were tending to a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the arch-biſhops, biſhops, arch-deacons, and clergy of England, in their book intitled, "the inſtruction of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man," ſubſcribed with all their hands and dedicated to the king an. 1537; and king Henry himſelf, in his book ſtiled, "a neceſſary crudition for any chriſtian man," approved by both houſes of parliament, prefaced with his own epiſtle, and publiſhed by his command, expreſsly reſolve, "that prieſts and biſhops by God's law are one and the ſame, and that the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and excommunication belongs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to them both." <note n="†" place="bottom">Calamy's "defence of moderate non conformity," p 90, 91.</note> Herewith, it may be further noted, agrees the manuſcript mentioned by biſhop Stillingfleet, in which archbiſhop Cranmer, one of the aſſembly, called together by the ſpecial command of king Edward ſixth, in anſwer to his queſtions, has theſe words, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Irenicum, page <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

the ſame opinion with the arch-biſhop; and the two latter expreſsly cite the opinion of Jerom with approbation. Upon which the learned writer, to whom we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for this account obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Stillingfleet, in his Irenicum, page 393.</note> "Thus we ſee by the teſtimony chiefly of him, who was inſtrumental in our reformation, that he owned not epiſcopacy, as a diſtinct order from preſbytery, of divine right, but only a prudential conſtitution of the civil magiſtrate for the better governing in the church." This ſame arch-biſhop Cranmer was "the firſt of ſix and forty, who, in the time of king Henry the eighth, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (in a book called "the biſhop's book," to be ſeen in "Fox's martyrology") that "the difference of biſhops and presbyters was a device of the ancient fathers, and not mentioned in the ſcripture." <note n="‡" place="bottom">J.

            </p>
            <p>IT is indeed beyond diſpute, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal form of government was ſettled, at the reformation, upon a very different foot from that of a jus divinum. How elſe can it be accounted for, that not only in king Henry the eighth's reign, but likewiſe in king Edward the ſixth's, the biſhops took out commiſſions from the crown, by which they were to hold their biſhopricks only during the king's pleaſure, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:009089_0082_10311A60401AC390"/>
powered in the king's name, as his dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, to perform all the parts of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal function? Archbiſhop Cranmer, that excellent and holy martyr, ſet an example to the reſt in taking out one of them. <note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet's abridg. of the hiſt. of the reform. Vol. II. p. 7.</note> This method of acting is certainly better adjuſted to a conſtitution, ſounded on poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than divine right. Nay, as far from the beginning of the reformation as the days of queen Eliſabeth, in the articles of religion agreed upon, the Engliſh form of church-government was only determined "to be agreeable to God's word;" which <note n="†" place="bottom">Irenicum, page 393, 394.</note> had been a very low and diminiſhing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, had they looked on it as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſcribed in ſcripture, as the only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary form to be obſerved in the church.</p>
            <p>THE truth is, ſays Mr. Owen, this notion of the jus divinum of epiſcopacy, as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior order, was firſt promoted in the church of England by arch-biſhop Land. Dr. Holland, the king's profeſſor of divinity in Oxon, was much offended with him, for aſſerting it in a diſputation for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. He checked him publicly, and told him, "he went about to make a diviſion between the Engliſh, and the other refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churches." <note n="‡" place="bottom">"Plea for ſcripture-ordination," page 115.</note>

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:009089_0083_10311A62D4A7B070"/>AND it was in this archbiſhop's time, that the point of re-ordination began to be urged. Through his influence, as Mr. Prin tells us, <note n="*" place="bottom">"Plea for ſcripture-ordination," page 117.</note> biſhop Hall re-ordained Mr. John Dury, a miniſter of the reformed church. But the old church of England did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or practiſe re-ordination. In king Edward the ſixth's time, Peter Martyr, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Bucer, and P. Fagius had eccleſiaſtical preferments in the church of England with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out re-ordination.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid page 118.</note> Mr. William Whiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was made dean of Durham, about 1563; tho' ordained by preſbyters only. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid page 121.</note> In like manner, Mr. Travers, ordained by a preſbyter beyond ſea, was ſeven years lecturer at the temple, and had the biſhop of London's letter for it. <note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid page 122.</note> And even in the reign of king James the firſt, the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ordination by preſbyters was not ſet aſide; as appears from the caſe of the three preſbyters that were conſecrated biſhops for Scotland at London. Before their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, Dr. Andrews, biſhop of Ely, moved the queſtion, "whether they ſhould not be firſt epiſcopally ordained preſbyters, that they might be capable of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the order of biſhops?" Upon which arch-biſhop Bancroft (a moſt rigid aſſertor of epiſcopacy) anſwered, "there
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:009089_0084_10311A682AD49D68"/>
was no need of it, ſince ordination by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters was valid." The biſhop of Ely yeilded; and without repeating their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination as preſbyters, they were conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted biſhops. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pierce's vindication, part I. page 167.</note>
            </p>
            <p>HOW far this practice, in the epiſcopal church, at home, in thoſe days, would be countenanced at preſent, I don't pretend to determine; but thus much has been ſaid by your highly eſteemed divinity-profeſſor, upon a proper occaſion; whoſe words are well worth tranſcribing here,
<q>I cannot learn, whether there has been even in England, to this very day, properly any public and expreſs aſſertion of the "di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right" of prelacy, either by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or convocation. I think no ſuch thing can be found in the thirty-nine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, or in the homilies, or in the form of ordination, or in the common prayer-book, &amp;c. Unleſs it may be thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the preface to the book of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, where there is a hint that ſeems to carry ſuch an aſpect; but, I believe, will appear too ſlender a foundation to build upon, in the preſent caſe; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we remember who were the chief compilers of that book; and what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have to conclude, they were of the judgment, that "prieſts and biſhops
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:009089_0085_10311A69B232C4E0"/>
are, by God's law, one and the ſame"; and that the epiſcopal dignity is rather by cuſtom, than by divine inſtitution.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">"Sober remarks," page 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT has been offered will, I believe, be tho't ſufficent to make it evident, that ordination by presbyters is no new thing under the ſun, a ſingularity peculiar to the New-England churches; ſince we have ſeen it approved by ſo many of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reformed churches, and by the church of England itſelf, at leaſt in its firſt proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and reformed ſtate, and for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time afterwards. And had there been an eſtabliſhment, in thoſe days, putting the power of ordination into the hands of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, it would have been, according to the then general opinion, as agreeable to ſcripture, as that which put it into the hands of biſhops. Poſſibly, the latter would not have been the eſtabliſhment, had it not been for eccleſiaſtical dignities and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; which enter not into the jus divinum of the thing.</p>

And it beautifully repreſents the ſtrength of a people's attachment to the religious ſentiments and practices of their fore-fathers, the difficulty with which they are wrought upon to depart from them. Even the nations, who have been taught by their anceſtors, to worſhip idol-gods, which, in reality, are no gods, will not eaſily change the object of their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <head>APPENDIX, GIVING a brief hiſtorical account of the epiſtles aſcribed to IGNATIUS; and exhibiting ſome of the many reaſons, why they ought not to be depended on as his uncorrupted works.</head>
            <p>IF we form our judgment of Ignatius from the accounts that are given of him by ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern authors, we muſt conceive of him as FIRST among the oriental worthies, not only in eccleſiaſtical dignity, but in piety, learning, and every other endowment, whether natural or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. And, poſſibly, ſuch ſentiments concerning him may be juſt; tho' there is no way in which, at preſent, we can know them to be ſo. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who lived in the two or three firſt centuries, ſay but little about him. They don't ſo much as tell us, where he was born, how educated, when brought over to the chriſtian faith, or by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of what perſons or means They have indeed left nothing upon record, ſave the manner of his going out of the world, from whence his character, as diſtinguiſhed from that of others of the ſame age, can be particularly drawn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:009089_0090_10311A7608413860"/>HE is ſpoken of, in after-times, as biſhop of Antioch. <note n="*" place="bottom">ORIGEN, a writer in the third century, is the firſt that mentions him under this character. He is herein followed by the ſucceeding fathers: Tho' they differ in the place they give him in the line of ſucceſſion; ſome putting <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uodius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and others Ignatius next to the apoſtle Peter, or Paul, or both. This makes a difficulty not unlike to that of Clement's ſucceſſion in the ſee of Rome. The epiſcoparians take different methods to ſolve it; which it is not my buſineſs, at preſent, to examine.</note> But it would lead us into wrong tho'ts of this ſtile, ſhould we take our idea of it from that ſuperiority to which biſhops were then exalted. 'Tis probable, the fathers, who call him biſhop, eſteemed him ſuch in the ſenſe the word was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in their day; but as the ſenſe of this word was different then from what it was in the age in which Ignatius flouriſhed, they might take more into it's meaning, than it at firſt intended. Prime-paſtor, head-preſbyter, is the moſt that was meant by his being biſhop of Antioch, at the time when he ſuſtained this relation to that church.</p>
            <p>IF there is no room to queſtion his dying a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, the manner and circumſtances of the fact, as they are related in "the acts of his martyrdom," may reaſonably be diſputed. The ſtory of Trajan's ſending him to Rome, after his condemnation at Antioch, that he "might be thrown to wild beaſts," does not ſeem, however defended with his epiſtles, to be any of the moſt probable. "For wherefore ſhould Ignatius of all others be brought to Rome to ſuffer, when the "Proconſuls," and the "Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides provinciarum," did every where, in time of perſecution, execute their power in puniſhing chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at their own tribunals, without ſending them
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:009089_0091_10311A7900A57378"/>
ſo long a journey to Rome, to be martyr'd there. And how came Ignatius to make ſo many, and ſuch ſtrange, excurſions as he did, by the ſtory, if the ſoldiers that were his guard were ſo cruel to him, as he complains they were." <note n="*" place="bottom">"Iren." pag. 298.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT however it might be as to circumſtances, the thing itſelf, his dying for the ſake of Chriſt, is not denied; tho' the year of his martyrdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certainly fix'd. Baſnage ranks it among the obſcurities of chronology.<note n="†" place="bottom">Annal. 107.</note> Biſhop Pearſon, biſhop Loyd, Pagi, LeClerc and Fabricius place it A. D. 115 or 116. But Du Pin, Tillemont, and Dr. Cave, in the 10th of Trajan, 107. Perhaps, this laſt period is by far the more probable.</p>
            <p>AS to the epiſtles that have been aſcribed to this primitive father, and given riſe to ſo much diſpute in the proteſtant world, the moſt perfect account of them, I have been able to collect, is briefly this.</p>
            <p>THE firſt edition of them came out in the year 1494 or 5; containing only three latin epiſtles, one to "the Virgin Mary," the other two to "St. John." A. D. 1497 or 8, Faber Stapulenſis publiſhed ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more latin epiſtles, which were ſeveral times reprinted at Stratſburg, and once at Baſil. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perius afterwards impreſſed the above three and eleven epiſtles, with the addition of another "ad Mariam Caſſabolitam." This was done at Cologn in 1536, and made in all fifteen epiſtles. They were as yet extant only in latin, and thus they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, in ſtill repeated impreſſions, till 1557, when Pacaeus printed them in greek, with the latin tranſlation of Perionius. The following year Geſner
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:009089_0092_10311A7D8660C830"/>
publiſhed them in greek likewiſe, with the verſion of Brunnerus. This Geſner aſſumed the honor of being the firſt, who had made theſe epiſtles public in greek. But Pacaeus is allowed, both by DuPin, and biſhop Pearſon, to have been the firſt editor of them in this language. [N. B. Theſe greek editions contain only twelve of the fifteen epiſtles.] In the year 1608, the edition of Meſtraeus came forth; and finally that of Vedelius in 1623, with large commentaries.</p>
            <p>THIS was the ſtate of the "Ignatian epiſtles," when arch-biſhop Uſher firſt ſaw them. Upon reading them, he took notice, that three ancient Engliſh divines <note n="*" place="bottom">Wodeford, Robert Lincolnienſis, and Tiſſington. "Hammond's anſw. to animadver. on his defence," pag. 5</note> had formerly quoted a paſſage from them in the very ſame words, in which it had been quoted by Theodoret, which words were not to be found in the preſent editions, either greek or latin; and from hence he concluded, there muſt be ſome manuſcript-copy of theſe epiſtles in England. He made diligent ſearch, and at length found two copies, one at Cambridge in the library of Caius college, the other in the private library of biſhop Montague; containing an ancient verſion different from the vulgar. He compared it with the paſſages cited by the fathers, and, finding a good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, tho't fit to put out an edition of "the Ignatian epiſtles," from this verſion; which was printed in 1644. Not long after this, the learned Voſſius found, in the duke of Tuſcany's library at Florence, a greek manuſcript, containing ſix of theſe epiſtles, ſuppoſed to be the ſame that are mentioned by Euſebius and Jerom; which,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:009089_0093_10311A80C8CAEA60"/>
agreeing with arch-biſhop Uſher's copies, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at Amſterdam in 1646, with the addition of a ſeventh, that to "the Romans," much amended from the latin verſion. This laſt epiſtle, in 1684, was publiſhed at Paris, by Mr. Ruinart, from a ſuppoſed uninterpolated copy.</p>
            <p>FROM this account of the epiſtles that go under the name of Ignatius, 'tis obvious to divide them into three claſſes.</p>
            <p>THE firſt contains thoſe three that are extant only in latin, inſcribed to "the Virgin Mary," and "St. John." But they are of ſo little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that learned men ſcarce think it worth while to be at the pains to prove them ſpurious.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond comprehends the epiſtles that are printed in greek, but not mentioned by Euſebius, or Jerom. And theſe are five in number. The firſt, to "Mary Caſſabolita;" the ſecond, to "the inhabitants of Tarſus;" the third, to "the Antiochians;" the fourth, to "Hero the deacon of Antioch;" the fifth, to "the Philippians." Bellarmine, Baronius, Paſſevin, and a few others, give credit to theſe epiſtles as the real works of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius; but they are herein oppoſed by almoſt the whole body, eſpecially, of proteſtant writers, who look upon them to be evidently ſuppoſititious.</p>
            <p>IN the third claſs are compriſed the ſeven epiſtles, which are ſuppoſed to be mentioned by Euſebius and Jerom; which are as follow. The firſt, to "the Epheſians; the ſecond, to "the Magneſians;" the third, to "the Trallians;" the fourth, to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:009089_0094_10311A82516C3098"/>
"the Romans;" the fifth, to "the Philadelphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans"; the ſixth, to "the Smyrnaeans"; the ſeventh, "to Polycarp." It may be obſerved here, arch-biſhop Uſher, and others after him, reject this laſt; looking upon the ſix former as the only ones com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated by Euſebius: Tho' there are thoſe, on the contrary, who, perhaps not with ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, conclude he takes notice of the whole ſeven.</p>
            <p>AS for the ſeven greek epiſtles, in this laſt claſs, they may be conſidered as extant in the editions of them before, or ſince, the days of Uſher and Voſſius.</p>
            <p>IN the former conſideration of them, they are ſtiled "the larger epiſtles," and generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded as unworthy of ſo primitive a father as Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius. Calvin, the Century-writers, Whittaker, Parker, Scultet, Rivet, and others, always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this to be their opinion of them: Tho' the advocates for prelacy, ſuch as Whitgift, Bilſon, Dounam, Heylyn, Taylor, and others, profeſſed a belief of them as truly genuine. And as ſuch they were, in thoſe days, appealed to, in the cauſe of epiſcopacy, with as much zeal and frequency as they have been ſince. But theſe "larger epiſtles" are now, I may ſay, univerſally given up as inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of defence. The learned biſhop Pearſon freely owns, that they are corrupted and interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: And tho' he commends the induſtry of Vedelius in what he has done to diſtinguiſh between what is genuine, and interpolated, in them; yet he thinks, at the ſame time, that he has not ſufficiently done it; and, in a word, does not undertake their defence, in theſe editions of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:009089_0095_10311A854ABAF6A8"/>THESE epiſtles, conſidered in the latter view, as publiſhed from the "Cantabrigian" and "Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine" copies, are called the "ſhorter ones," and repreſented by the epiſcoparians to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted works of Ignatius; and, as ſuch, we are turned to them, upon all occaſions, as containing full evidence of the ſuperiority of biſhops to preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in order and power.</p>
            <p>UPON which, I can't but put you upon minding the conduct of, at leaſt, ſome of our opponents. The "larger epiſtles" of Ignatius they once ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contended for againſt all that oppoſed them, and conſtantly repaired to them as the great ſupport of their cauſe. But now they are willing to throw them by as uſeleſs; the "ſhorter editions" of Uſher and Voſſius being the only ones to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. They could not be prevailed with, by any methods of reaſoning, to give up Ignatius in the "former editions," till they had got others, from other copies, to ſupply their place. And now they readily ſee the force of the arguments, they before eſteemed as nothing better than meer cavils. It certainly looks as tho' they imagined their cauſe ſtood in abſolute need of Ignatius, and were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part with him in "former editions," only becauſe they have others to ſubſtitute in their room, that they can better manage: Nor can one well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear thinking, if "other editions," from ſtill other manuſcripts, ſhould come forth, more defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible than theſe they now have, they would as readily quit "theſe," and cry up "them.".</p>
            <p>BUT however uncorrupt the "ſhorter Ignatian epiſtles" are ſaid to be, there are ſome, and of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:009089_0096_10311A8932BE99C0"/>
the firſt rank too for learning, who have openly declared their opinion of them as ſpurious; and a ſtill greater number look upon them as interpolated, and to a degree that renders them unfit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to, in order to know the mind of the true Ignatius.</p>
            <p>THE ſtrange ſilence of primitive antiquity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning epiſtles under the name of Ignatius is given, by the learned Daille, as a good reaſon to ſuſpect, that he never wrote any. There is no controverſy about the fact itſelf, namely, that none of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe works are ſtill remaining, mention e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles wrote by Ignatius, either a leſs or greater number, till we come into the fourth century, three only excepted. And 'tis really a diſputable point, to ſay the leaſt, whether any of theſe three, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered, are to be looked upon as proper vouchers in the caſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">Polycarp, Irenaeus, and Origen, are the three fathers, who are ſaid to mention epiſtles wrote by Ignatius. The ſentence in Polycarp, which takes notice of theſe epiſtles, is that which concludes his own epiſtle. 'Tis an independant paragraph, and may be conſidered, either as an original part of the epiſtle, or an after-addition without the leaſt damage to its connection or ſenſe. In this view of it, Daille and L'arroque look upon it as an interpolation; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it ſpeaks of Ignatius as yet alive, and not come to his laſt ſufferings; while, in the ninth ſection, he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly mentioned as dead, and gone to the Lord; which, as they argue, is an inconſiſtency, it would be a diſhonor to charge upon Polycarp. So far as I am able to judge, neither biſhop Pearſon, nor arch-biſhop Wake have ſaid that which is ſufficient to take off the force of this arguing. As for Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, the manner of his introducing what he gives us from Ignatius is this, "quemadmodum quidam de noſtris dixit," as one from among us ſaid; which is as properly applicable to a VERBAL, as WRITTEN ſaying: For which reaſon I can't but think, notwithſtanding all that has been offered in favor of this teſtimony, that Mr. Lardner ſpeaks the exact truth, when he ſays, "'Tis diſputable, whether he cites a paſſage of a WRITING, or only mentions ſome WORDS or EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSIONS of Ignatius, which might be ſpoken by him upon the near view of his martyrdom." The teſtimonies from Origen (who by the way, was a writer in the third century) are two. The firſt is taken from "the prologue to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on Canticles," that goes under his name. If he was the real author, (which is tho't queſtionable) we have it only in the verſion of Ruffin, who is repreſented as taking a ſhameful liberty in all his tranſlations of Origen, to alter, add or diminiſh; inſomuch that there is no knowing what is his, and what is Origen's. 'Tis, I conclude, for this reaſon, that neither arch biſhop Uſher nor Dr. Hammond do make uſe of this Origenical teſtimony in the evidence they exhibit in favor of the "Ignatian epiſtles." The other teſtimony is cited from "his homily on Luke." This alſo is ſuſpected to be the work of ſome latin author; but if Origen really wrote it, 'tis extant only in latin: And if it was tranſlated by Jerom, as is pretended, there is no knowing what is truly Origen's. DuPin ſays, the verſions of Jerom are not more exact than Ruffin's. And Ruffin complains of the liberty Jerom took in his tranſlations, as Jerom complains, in like manner, of him. And certainly no great credit ought to be given to tranſlations which were done with unbounded licence. I may pertinently as here, 'tis a ſhrewd circumſtance, giving reaſon to ſuſpect that Origen never mentioned the "Ignatian epiſtles" in his writings that he is ſilently paſſed over by Euſebius. For no one was a greater admirer of Origen, nor was any one more particularly verſed in his writings. And as he expreſsly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the above paſſages in Polycarp and Irenaeus, 'tis ſtrange he ſhould take no notice of thoſe in Origen, if they had, in his day, been contained in his writings.</note> But ſhould they be
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:009089_0097_10311A8D04688E28"/>
allowed to be ſo, 'tis notwithſtanding an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing, that, for the full ſpace of two hundred years, no more notice ſhould be taken of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of this primitive father, if he left any. For let it be conſidered,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:009089_0098_10311A8E92EDA460"/>IGNATIUS was a perſon that lived in the firſt age of chriſtianity; was perſonally known to, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, at leaſt, ſome of the apoſtles, and many of thoſe who had been converſant with them; and he was (as is generally ſuppoſed) fixed, by the apoſtle Peter, or Paul, or both, in the paſtoral office at Antioch, a noted city in itſelf, and the more ſo on account of its being the place, where believers were firſt diſtinguiſhed by the name of chriſtians. Theſe are conſiderations that open to us ſo much of the character of this ancient father, as to leave it paſt doubt, that he was not ſo obſcure a perſon as to be unknown in thoſe days. Beſides, he was a glorious martyr for the cauſe of Chriſt; and, if he really wrote theſe epiſtles, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his martyrdom were more ſignally illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, than ever attended any other martyrdom before, or ſince, that we have any record of. For he was condemned at Antioch to die at Rome; and, in order to the execution of this ſentence, was conveyed by a band of ſoldiers, as a priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt, through all the goſpeliſed places, that lay between theſe two greatly diſtant cities. Such circumſtances could not well fail of ſpreading his fame, and occaſioning his being univerſally known, and talk'd of, among chriſtians. A primitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and firſt-paſtor of one of the moſt celebrated chriſtian churches, to be carried, as it were, thro' the world, in bonds for the name of Chriſt; — it could not but be taken notice of, by all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as he paſſed along: Nor is it conceivable, but that his name upon this account, ſhould be had in remembrance. If he had been an obſcure perſon before, theſe obſervables would have "ſet him on a hill," and put him under an advantage, beyond
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:009089_0099_10311A910E9788E0"/>
any of the fathers of the ſame age, of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated in after-writings. Such are the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances under which we are to conceive of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed author of theſe epiſtles.</p>
            <p>AND extraordinary ones attend the epiſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For they were wrote, if at all wrote by Ignatius, in the capacity of a "priſoner of death," and while actually on his journey to be "devoured by wild beaſts": Nor were they wrote to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friend, upon ſome private concern; nor yet to here and there an obſcure church, but to as noted ones as had then been formed; and this, if we may credit the epiſcoparians, upon matters of the greateſt importance: Which are conſiderations that won't ſuffer us to think, that "theſe epiſtles" were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown to the world, or eſteemed worthy of no notice. Six epiſtles wrote and ſent to as many famous churches, by the head-paſtor of Antioch, upon the moſt momentous affairs, and at ſo ſolemn a time as that of his being about to die for the ſake of Chriſt, could not but have occaſioned great talk in the chriſtian world; not is there room to doubt, that they would have had a very diſtinguiſhing value put upon them: Nay, they muſt have been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt celebrated monuments of all uninſpired antiquity, and as ſuch have been univerſally known and regarded, eſpecially by the learned writers in thoſe times. And 'tis really a ſurpriſing thing, that ſo little reſpect ſhould be paid to them for the full ſpace of 200 years, after their compoſure; and what makes the matter ſtill more ſtrange is, that the writings of others of the ſame age are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly named, or quoted. And why ſhould the writings of Ignatius, the moſt famous of them all,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:009089_0100_10311A94D1AD3CF0"/>
be treated with ſuch unbecoming neglect?—There is certainly ſome reaſon, from theſe hints, to ſuſpect, whether Ignatius was the real author of theſe epiſtles.</p>
            <p>'TIS urged, if be did not pen them, they were forged before the days of Euſebius, that is, between the beginning of the ſecond, and the coming in of the fourth century; which is repreſented as a thing altogether incredible. 'Tis readily acknowledged, this religious knavery was practiſed, if at all, within the time ſpecified. And I freely own for myſelf ſtill further, that I really tho't it an incredible thing, it ſhould be practiſed within this period, till, by better acquaintance with antiquity, I was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I had been under a great miſtake. Perhaps, the knaviſh forgeries, within this term, were as numerous as they have ever been ſince, in the ſame ſpace of time. Scarce one of the apoſtles, or firſt moſt eminent fathers, have eſcaped being perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome wretched impoſtor, in ſome piece or other, they have palmed on the world under their name. Nay, our bleſſed Lord himſelf has been thus baſely uſed. And there is no one tolerably verſed in the ancient writings, but knows this to be true. Hegeſippus, (contemporary with Juſtin Martyr, who flouriſhed about the year 150) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of "apocryphal books," ſays, at leaſt, of ſome of them, that they <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſeb. lib. IV. cap. xxii.</note> "were made by the heretics of his time." Irenaeus obſerves, that <note n="†" place="bottom">Adverſ. Haereſ. lib. I. cap xvii.</note> "the heretics in his day had an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſpurious and apocryphal books, which they had forged to delude the more weak and ignorant ſort of perſons." Origen, Jerom, Epiphanius,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:009089_0101_10311A97A15399D8"/>
Ambroſe, and others, tell us of great numbers of theſe books made uſe of by the heretics in their times. Of theſe books, ſome are quite loſt, not ſo much as the names, or the leaſt part of them, remaining. Of others, there are ſome few frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the writings of the fathers, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the books from whence they were taken. Of others, there are undoubted fragments, with the names of the books out of which they are cited. Others are ſtill extant, at leaſt, in part. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſee a ſurpriſingly large catalogue of theſe forged books, in DuPin's "eccleſiaſtical hiſtory;" and a much larger one ſtill in Mr. Jones's "method of ſettling the canon of the new-teſtament": From both which authors, he may meet with what will abundantly ſatisfy him, that they are indeed forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and were impoſed on the world long before the days of Euſebius.</p>
            <p>AND not only were books forged under the name of inſpired perſons, but of ſome of the moſt famous primitive fathers. Such are the "Recognitions" fathered on Clement of Rome; the "Clementines," as alſo the "Epitome of the Clementine acts of Peter"; not to ſay any thing of the pretended "apoſtolical conſtitutions and canons," ſaid to be penned by Clement. Such are Polycarp's "let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Dionyſius the Areopagite," and his "diſcourſe on St. John's death". Theſe are all of them evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſpurious pieces, and moſt of them univerſally owned to be ſo. And yet, they were forged before the fourth century. So that, be our opinion of the times before Euſebius as it will, ſome there were, even in thoſe times, who were both impudent and knaviſh enough to be guilty of ſuch a fraud, as that
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:009089_0102_10311A9967EA6240"/>
we ſuppoſe might have been practiſed, under the name of Ignatius: And the ſuppoſition of his being thus fraudulently dealt by is ſo far from being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing, that it only adds one to the many religious frauds, which were committed in thoſe days, and under the names of much better men than he can be pretended to be.—</p>
            <p>AFTER all, 'tis poſſible, I own, Ignatius might be the writer of theſe epiſtles: Nor will I pretend to determine, that he was not: Tho' I am inclined to think, moſt unprejudiced perſons, from what has been offered, will be diſpoſed to queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are ſo certainly his, as to leave no reaſonable room for, at leaſt, ſome doubt in the caſe.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould it be conceded, that theſe epiſtles were certainly wrote by Ignatius, we ſhall, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, hope to be excuſed, if we lay no great weight upon what is cited from them; and for this very good reaſon, becauſe we judge they are ſo interlarded with corrupt mixtures, as not fairly to exhibit the real ſentiments of the primitive father, whoſe name they bear. <note n="*" place="bottom">IT ſhould be remembred here 'tis not only the truth of fact, that Ignatius has been baſely and fraudulently dealt with, no leſs than eight of the fifteen epiſtles that bear his name being FORGERIES, and owned to be ſo; but 'tis fact likewiſe, and acknowledged as ſuch, that the other ſeven, in all the editions of them, before Uſher and Voſſius, have been so CORRUPTED by ſome knaviſh interpolator, as that they ought not to be received as his genuine works. We don't argue from hence, that the "later editions" muſt be corrupted alſo; but thus much is obviouſly and certainly deducible herefrom, that they MAY be ſo; that the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is quite eaſy and natural, as falling in with what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been practiſed upon theſe epiſtles.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:009089_0103_10311A9AF44F0D60"/>WHAT we have to offer in ſupport of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, takes in ſo many particulars, that it would require a vaſt deal more room than can at preſent be ſpared to conſider them. I ſhall therefore wholly paſs them over, and confine myſelf to one thing only, viz. what is here ſaid concerning the officers of the churches he writes to. And I the rather pitch upon this, becauſe the diſcourſe upon this head ſo runs through all the epiſtles, (one only excepted, the epiſtle to the "Romans" <note n="*" place="bottom">'TIS obſervable, this epiſtle is the only one that is perfectly uſeleſs to the epiſcopal cauſe. For it differs from all the reſt in this, that it don't once diſtinguiſh biſhops from preſbyters; and, if I don't miſremember, the word biſhop is but once uſed throughout the whole epiſtle.</note>) bears ſo great a part in them, and is ſo mingled with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every paragraph, that if what is offered upon this point is not worthy of the true Ignatius, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently exhibits the marks of an age POSTERIOR to that in which he lived, they will have faſtened on them the charge of corruption, unfitting them to be depended on in the preſent, or indeed any other, debate.</p>
            <p>THREE things I have here to ſay, which I eſteem worthy of particular notice, and ſhall diſtinctly mention.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THERE is vaſtly more ſaid upon the head of church-officers, than might be expected from the true Ignatius. The ſeven epiſtles, in the tranſlation of arch-biſhop Wake, take up about 50 pages in octavo; and the extracts I have made from them, as they relate only to biſhops and preſbyters, will fill at leaſt ten; tho' they are made from but ſix
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:009089_0104_10311AA2327A68B8"/>
of the ſeven epiſtles. Now, conſidering the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Ignatius, when he wrote theſe epiſtles, 'tis highly improbable, he ſhould have his heart ſo much ſet upon the honor and power of the clergy, as, in all of them, to be ſo very laviſh in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this point. He was now a "priſoner of death," and on "his journey to the place of execution": And if he found within himſelf a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to write to the ſeveral churches, as he went along, 'tis really ſtrange, he ſhould be ſo large in his encomiums, exhortations, directions, cautions, and inſinuations, all tending to exalt the clergy, and beſpeak for them the higheſt reverence, and moſt profound ſubjection. Had he thus wrote in one or two only of his letters, the ſpecial cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the churches to whom he wrote might, perhaps, be pleaded in his excuſe: But it cannot be ſuppoſed, ſo many churches ſhould be ſo ignorant of their own conſtitution, or of the duty they owed to the officers ſet-over them; or that they had been ſo faulty in their behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the clergy, as to make it proper for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned paſtor, juſt going out of the world, ſo to write to them, as if the main thing ſuitable to be ſaid was, "that they had very worthy, and God-becoming biſhops and preſbyters, whom they ought to revere and honor as God the Father, and his ſon Jeſus Chriſt." There is plainly much more ſpoken upon the ſubject of the clergy, and their rights, than upon any other, tho' of the moſt fundamental importance; which looks very ſtrange. It would certainly do ſo in epiſtles, wrote at preſent, under like circumſtances; and the rather, as the ſame things are not only mentioned in all the epiſtles, but in moſt of them needleſsly repeated,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:009089_0105_10311AA41A283678"/>
and in ſome of them repeated over and over again ſo as to be quite fulſome. Should a biſhop, at this day, while in the near view of death for religion's ſake, write epiſtles to the churches after this pattern, I ſcruple not to give it as my opinion, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral thought of the world concerning him, in this day of chriſtian liberty, would be, that over-heated zeal for clerical honor and power had put him out of the poſſeſſion of himſelf. This leads</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO the next conſideration, namely, the "lofty deſcriptions" that are given, in theſe epiſtles, of the officers of the chriſtian church, with the "exorbitant claims of power and dominion" made on their behalf. The language to this purpoſe is truly extraordinary, not at all conſonant to the age of the true Ignatius, nor indeed worthy of ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive a father and martyr. What other thought can we entertain of thoſe numerous expreſſions, which repreſent biſhops as "preſiding in the place of God": which compare them to "God the Father, and to Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of the Father": which declare it our duty to "receive them as the Lord, to reverence them as Jeſus Chriſt," yea, "to follow them even as Chriſt does the Father": which caution againſt "reſiſting the biſhop, leſt we ſhould diſobey God": which command us "ſo to obey the biſhop, and ſubject ourſelves to him, as to do nothing without him": which, "without the biſhop", deem it "unlawful either to baptiſe, or celebrate the ſacrament, or indeed do any thing, however reaſonable it may appear to us": which exhort to be "ſo one with the biſhop, as Chriſt is one with the Father; and ſo to do nothing without him, as Chriſt did nothing without the Father":
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:009089_0106_10311AA5B2A92978"/>
which make ſo great account of "obedience and ſubjection to the biſhop," that they who "do any thing without him" are eſteemed "doing the devil a ſervice"; and "thoſe that remain with him" are, upon this account only, thought worthy of the character "of belonging to Chriſt"; and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented "as walking not as men, but according to Chriſt": Yea, in ſo high eſtimation is obedience to the officers of the church, with the author of theſe epiſtles, that he even "pawns his ſoul for thoſe who obey the biſhop, preſbyters and deacons," and deſires "his portion in God may be with ſuch."</p>
            <p>THESE, and like, expreſſions, ſo frequently to be met with in theſe epiſtles, can't eaſily be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been penned by the true Ignatius. In their literal ſtrict ſenſe, they are unworthy of any pious writer; much more of the celebrated father, to whom they are aſcribed: Nor can it be denied, that they aggrandiſe biſhops beyond all reaſonable bounds, and plead for the moſt blind, implicit and abſolute obedience, as that which is properly due to them. And, in a qualified ſenſe, they are ſome of them very unguarded; others ſcarce capable of being at all juſtified; and, in general, all of them do much rather ſavour of the language and ſpirit "of after times," than of the age in which Ignatius is known to have lived.</p>
            <p>THERE is, perhaps, no fact more notoriouſly evident, than that none of the ſacred writers, nor primitive fathers, either of the ſame age, or near the ſame age, in which Ignatius flouriſhed, do hold the leaſt affinity with him, in his ſtrange talk (if it be his) about the officers of the chriſtian church.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:009089_0107_10311AA8BB0A8468"/>
If we look into the "Paſtor of Hermas," the "epiſtle of Polycarp," or any other genuine piece, near the time in which theſe epiſtles are ſaid to be wrote, we ſhall find in them all the diſcoveries of a quite different ſpirit. Theſe unitedly concur in the like plain language; ſpeaking of the officers of the church in a manner becoming the ſimplicity of the goſpel, and the purity and humility of thoſe early days: Whereas, when we turn to the "Ignatian epiſtles," the reverſe is clearly viſible through them all; little being here to be ſeen but ſuch high ſtrains of language, as are evidently adapted, if not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely contrived, to exalt the clergy, and ſecure to them all power, reverence and ſubjection. And how ſhall this be accounted for? Why ſhould there be ſuch a ſignal difference between the manner of writing in theſe epiſtles, and all the other extant books of the ſame age?</p>
            <p>TO this it is ſaid, that the ſtile of authors is very different, and the turn of expreſſion, in every writer, as peculiar to him, as his countenance or gate: For which reaſon, its thought to be no ways ſtrange, that the manner of Ignatius's writing is not like that of his contemporaries.</p>
            <p>IT is readily acknowledged, that the particular turn of language, in different authors, is different, as is pleaded; but at the ſame time, denied, that this at all removes the difficulty. For a number of authors, writing upon the ſame ſubject, may each of them write in his own peculiar ſtile, and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in exhibiting the like account. The ſtile of Hermas widely differs from that of Clement, as Clement's does from that of Polycarp; and yet,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:009089_0108_10311AAC5D9A3388"/>
they all lead us to think much the ſame thing about the clergy; and this, very evidently, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ſeverally expreſs themſelves in a turn peculiar each one to himſelf. And why might not Ignatius, with the reſt of his contemporaries, have wrote in his own ſtile, and yet have concurred with them in a like account of the officers of the church? 'Tis certain he might. And it muſt be aſcribed, not to meer difference of ſtile, but to ſome other cauſe, that he ſo ſtrangely differs from them.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore further pleaded, Ignatius was a SYRIAN, and its no other than might be expected to find him writing in a "ſwelling turgid ſtile." To which it is eaſy to reply,</p>
            <p>HIS being a SYRIAN may poſſibly account for his ſometimes barbarous Greek, as well as uncouth compound words peculiar to himſelf; but how it ſhould account for his ſentiments concerning the clergy, as differing from thoſe of his contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is not ſo eaſy to ſay. For not only is the high language in theſe epiſtles, but the thing intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, quite different from that which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the other writings about the ſame age. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius is alone, not in ſtile only, but in real mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Unclothe the metaphors, qualify the hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles, bring down the rhetorical ſtrains uſed in theſe writings, and put them into ſimple language, and their true ſpirit, their genuine intendment, will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the honor and power of the clergy much higher, than it is carried by all the phraſes of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary writers united together: Nor can a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who reads the epiſtles of Ignatius, help having excited in his mind a far more exalted idea of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:009089_0109_10311AAF82269D08"/>
as well as biſhops, than by reading all the other writers, till we come to the third and fourth centuries.</p>
            <p>THE plain truth is, there is ſo little reſemblance between theſe epiſtles, upon the head under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and the other writings of the ſame age; and, I may add, ſo great a reſemblance between them, and the writings of a POSTERIOR DATE, that one can ſcarce help thinking, the real author of them was alive in the world, long after the death of the truly primitive Ignatius.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER the diſpute about the ſuperiority of biſhops to preſbyters be determined, nothing is more evident, than that the language relative to the clergy, beſpeaking the reverence and ſubmiſſion due to them, was very different after the ſecond century, from what it was before. And as the language, in the "Ignatian epiſtles," is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, upon this head, from the language of the age in which this father lived; ſo it well agrees with that, which was in fact uſed afterwards.</p>
            <p>THIS is particularly obvious, upon a compariſon between the books that go under the name of the "apoſtolical conſtitutions, and canons," and "theſe epiſtles." Before their appearance in the editions of Uſher and Voſſius, the agreement between them, not in ſpirit only, but in words and phraſes, was ſo obſervable, that ſome have not ſcrupled to ſay, that they had both one author. That great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary, the arch-biſhop of Armagh, was clearly of the opinion, that the ſame hand interpolated the Ignatian epiſtles, that interpolated the apoſtolical
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:009089_0110_10311AB1238CEFD8"/>
conſtitutions; and is ſomewhat large in offering the reaſons of his entertaining ſuch a thought. And ſince the publication of the new, and (as is tho't) very much purged editions, the reſemblance is ſtill viſible; ſo clearly ſo, that I can't ſuppoſe, but prejudice itſelf will own, there is a much greater analogy between them, in their high deſcriptions of biſhops, and the honor and obedience due to them, than between theſe epiſtles, and any other piece that is not of a much later date.</p>
            <p>AND what ſhould be the reaſon of this? Why ſhould the Ignatian epiſtles be thus different from all the contemporary writings, and ſo much like thoſe which did not appear till many years after his death? Why ſhould they be wrote with a ſpirit, and in language, that are well ſuited to the claims made by the clergy, and the honor and obedience that were in fact yielded to them, not at the time when they were wrote, but LONG AFTER the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed author of them was gone out of the world? This ſurely looks ſuſpicious, and is a ſhrewd ſign of unfair dealing ſome how or other.—To proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE moſt weighty conſideration of all is, the APPROPRIATION of the names, biſhop and preſbyter, ſo commonly and certainly to be met with in theſe epiſtles. The learned Daille diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes this from all his other arguments, calling it "argumentum palmarium"; as well he might, it being an argument that is founded on one of the beſt and ſureſt rules in criticiſm, evidencing a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended genuine writing to be ſpurious, or corrupted; namely, it's uſing words in an APPROPRIATED ſenſe, which words were not ſo uſed at the time
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:009089_0111_10311AB2AAB190C0"/>
when this writing is known to have been penned, but were ſo uſed in AFTER-AGES. The greateſt critics ever recur to this as the ſureſt teſt: Nor is its ſufficiency, as ſuch, in matters of this nature, diſputed by any. In applying therefore this teſt to the point in hand, let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p>THE words, biſhop and preſbyter, are, in the "Ignatian epiſtles", APPROPRIATED terms; not uſed in a looſe and promiſcuous manner, but in a ſenſe particularly aſcertained and fixed. Biſhops are not here called preſbyters, nor are preſbyters called biſhops; but the officers, ſtiled biſhops, are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are ſtiled preſbyters, and, on the other hand, thoſe that are ſtiled preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are, in like manner, diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are ſtiled biſhops. And the terms, biſhop and preſbyter, are the APPROPRIATED ones, pointing out theſe different church-officers. And this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of the words is not accidental, but runs thro' all the epiſtles, and all the editions of them, the Uſherian and Voſſian, as well as thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded them. And 'tis ſo ſacred and inviolable, that, in no caſe, at no time, upon no occaſion, is this uſe of the words departed from. Not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is to be met with, where the word biſhop is confounded with the word preſbyter; or the word preſbyter, with the word biſhop: But theſe terms are accurately and religiouſly applied to different perſons, in a fixed and appropriated ſenſe. That is the manner of diction in theſe epiſtles, "obey your biſhop, and the preſbytery." — "I have been judged worthy to ſee you by Damas, your biſhop; and your preſbyters, Baſſus and Apollonius."— "The biſhop preſiding in the place of God, your
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:009089_0112_10311AB532D30838"/>
preſbyters in the place of the council of the apoſtles." — "Let all reverence the biſhop as the Father, and the preſbyters as the Sanhedrim of God." — "Attend to the biſhop, and the preſbytery." — But I have no need to multiply citations here. 'Tis the very thing pleaded, in favor of epiſcopacy, that Ignatius ever diſtinguiſhes biſhops from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. This he has been ſaid to do (if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory don't fail me) thirty-ſix times: Which, I am ſatiſfied, is not an enlargement; tho', I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I have not been ſo curious as to adjuſt the preciſe number.</p>
            <p>WHAT agreement now is there between the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Ignatius, and his contemporaries, upon this head? Do they likewiſe uſe the words, biſhop and preſbyter, in an appropriated fixed ſenſe? The plain anſwer is, they do not. Far from ſo doing, they differ as much from him in their uſe of theſe terms, as they do from any of the writers of the third or fourth centuries: Nor is there an author extant, that wrote either before Ignatius, or at the time when he wrote, or even afterwards till we are got into the third century and onwards, that uſes theſe words as he does, in a ſenſe ſo certainly, ſo commonly, and ſo invariably fixed and determined.</p>
            <p>IT is plain, there is no manner of affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the apoſtolic, and Ignatian uſe of theſe words; tho' Ignatius was perſonally known to, at leaſt, ſome of the apoſtles. With HIM they are always appropriated terms; but with THEM, they are promiſcuouſly uſed, as may be ſeen in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe. It evidently appears from hence, that biſhop and preſbyter were not yet ſettled
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:009089_0113_10311ABA57ACDA20"/>
names, ſignifying diſtinct officers. And this, as Daille ſays, was the unanimous opinion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, who ſpeak of the uſe of theſe words in this primitive age. And Dr. Whitby, an epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal writer, affirms the ſame thing; as was obſerved in the diſcourſe to which this is annexed. Nay, Bellarmine himſelf, a Roman-catholic-writer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the ſenſe of the fathers upon this point, ſays, as he is quoted by Daille, "In the apoſtolic times, the names, biſhop and preſbyter, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the prieſts, both to the greater, whom we now call biſhops; and to the leſs, whom we call preſbyters." I don't bring theſe teſtimonies by way of proof, that theſe names were thus uſed in the firſt age; but only to ſhow, that this tho't of the matter is not confined to thoſe, who live in theſe latter days, and may be ſuſpected of prejudice againſt the order of biſhops; but that it was the opinion of the ancient fathers themſelves, even thoſe of them who flouriſhed after epiſcopacy took place, and were hearty friends to this kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the church.</p>
            <p>AND as theſe names are promiſcuouſly applied in the apoſtolic writings, ſo are they in the other writings before thoſe of Ignatius. In Hermas's "Paſtor" the word, biſhops, is explained to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify <note n="*" place="bottom">Apud "Apoſt. Pat. Coteler." pag. 123. Simil. ix. cap. xxvii.</note> "thoſe that preſide in the church", and thoſe that preſide in the church are the <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. pag. 78. Viſi. II. cap. iv.</note> "preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that preſide in the church." And in Clement's "epiſtle to the Corinthians," the ſame officers that are called "preſbyters," are expreſsly ſpoken of as "caſt out of their epiſcopacy." <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. pag. 173. cap. xliv.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:009089_0114_10311ABBE225CA70"/>AND if we turn to Polycarp, the ſuppoſed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the "Ignatian epiſtles," and the next and neareſt writer to him, he ſays nothing from whence it can be gathered, that biſhop and preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were, in his day, appropriated terms, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as ſuch, to diſtinct officers in the church. Preſbyters and deacons are the only officers he ſpeaks of; and he undoubtedly means by them the ſame church-officers that are called by Clement, and by the apoſtle Paul, in his epiſtle to this ſame church, biſhops and deacons. And 'tis remarkable, Polycarp no where uſes the word biſhop, nor does he ſay a word of the biſhop of Philippi, much leſs of his diſtinction from the preſbyters of this church: Wherein he widely differs from Ignatius; which is really unaccountable, conſidering how lately Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, under very extraordinary circumſtances, had wrote his epiſtles, and how particularly acquainted Polycarp (as is pretended) was with them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering ſtill further, that Ignatius had wrote one epiſtle to Polycarp himſelf, and another to his church at Smyrna, in one of which he "pawns his ſoul for them that were obedient to the biſhop and the other clergy"; and, in the other, makes the biſhop ſo neceſſary, "that no adminiſtration could be valid without him, but whatever he ſhould approve would be pleaſing to God."</p>
            <p>NO more is to be ſeen of an appropriated uſe of the terms biſhop and preſbyter in Juſtin Martyr, than in Polycarp. Irenaeus frequently uſes theſe terms, but in the looſe and promiſcuous ſenſe; as is well known to all who have read him: Nor do the terms appear to be appropriated ones, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the ſecond century; and even
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:009089_0115_10311ABD6A5C6FC8"/>
then the appropriation (as was obſerved in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſe) was not ſteadily fixed. We muſt get into the third century, and the middle of it too, before we ſhall find it, after the manner of Ignatius, ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p>UPON which the enquiry is obvious and juſt, how comes it to paſs, that Ignatius ſhould CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTLY uſe the terms, biſhop and preſbyter, not in the ſenſe, in which they were uſed, in the age in which he wrote, but in the ſenſe in which they were uſed in OTHER AGES, LONG AFTER HIS DEATH? This ought certainly to excite our jealouſy, and put us upon caution leſt we ſhould take ſome knaviſh impoſtor for the worthy and primitive Ignatius. Words, we know, often vary in their meaning; and ſometimes particular words are as ſure marks of ſuch a particular age, as particular garbs or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions. And this is the caſe here. Before the days of Ignatius, about the time of his flouriſhing and dying, and for ſome conſiderable time afterwards, the words, biſhop and preſbyter, were UNAPPRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIATED terms, and promiſcuouſly applied to the ſame perſons: Whereas, towards the going out of the age in which he lived, or rather the coming in of the next, they loſt their promiſcuous uſe, and became APPROPRIATED terms, and were as ſuch applied to different perſons, who were accordingly now diſtinguiſhed from each other by being ſpoken of under theſe names. And as theſe names, in the epiſtles aſcribed to Ignatius, in their pureſt editions, are ever uſed in the APPROPRIATED ſenſe, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing biſhops from preſbyters, we are preſented with a moſt evident mark of time POSTERIOR to that, in which the true Ignatius is known to have lived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:009089_0116_10311AC030564098"/>ENOUGH, I truſt, has now been ſaid to anſwer the deſign I had in view, which was to juſtify thoſe who pay no great regard to what is bro't from the "Ignatian epiſtles," in ſupport of epiſcopacy. And I would flatter myſelf, that even our opponents, while they judge impartially, will not think, we herein act as tho' we had nothing to ſay in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ourſelves. Bigotry itſelf muſt confeſs there is good reaſon, at leaſt the plauſible appearance of it, to ſuppoſe, either that Ignatius did not write the epiſtles that are aſcribed to him; or, if he did write them, that they are handed down to us so MINGLED WITH CORRUPTION, as not to deſerve a reception as his genuine works.</p>
