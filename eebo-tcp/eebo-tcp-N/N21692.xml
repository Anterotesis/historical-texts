            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>How to paſs the Balls through the Cups.</head>
               <p>You muſt place yourſelf at the farther end of the table, and then you muſt provide your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf three cups, made of tin, and then you muſt have your black ſticks of magic to ſhew your wonders withal; then you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide four ſmall cork balls to play with; but do not let more than three of them be ſeen upon the table.</p>
               <p>Note. Always conceal one ball in the right hand, between your middle finger and ring finger: and be ſure make yourſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to hold it there, for, by this means, all the tricks of the cups are done.</p>
               <p>Then ſay as followeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Gentlemen, three cups—'tis true</l>
                  <l>They are but tin, the reaſon why,</l>
                  <l>Silver is ſomething dear,</l>
                  <l>I'll turn them in gold, if I live, &amp;c.</l>
                  <l>No equivocation at all:</l>
                  <l>But if your eyes are not as quick as my hands</l>
                  <l>I ſhall deceive you all.</l>
                  <l>View them within,</l>
                  <l>View them all round about,</l>
                  <l>Where there is nothing in,</l>
                  <l>There's nothing can come out.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Then take your four balls privately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your fingers, and ſo fling one of them upon the table, and ſay thus,
<q>
                     <l>The firſt trick that e'er I learn'd to do,</l>
                     <l>Was, out of one ball to make it into two</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:028540_0006_0FD939F42CC1AC10"/>Ah! ſince it cannot better be,</l>
                     <l>One of theſe two, I'll divide them into three,</l>
                     <l>Which is call'd the firſt trick of dexterity.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So then you have three balls on the table to play with, and one left between the fingers of your right hand.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The Operation of the Cups is thus.</head>
               <figure/>
               <p>Lay your three balls on the table, then ſay, Gentlemen, you ſee here are three balls, and here are three cups, that is, a cup for each ball, and a ball for each cup. Then, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ball that you had in your right hand, (which you are always to keep private) and clapping it under the firſt cup, then taking up one of the three balls, with your right hand, ſeeming to put it into your left hand, but retain it ſtill in your right, ſhutting your left hand in due time, then ſay, <hi>Preſto, be gone.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028540_0007_0FD939F6C43C80D0"/>Then taking the ſecond cup up, ſay, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you ſee there is nothing under my cup; ſo clap the ball that you have in your right hand under it, and then take the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ball up with your right hand, and ſeem to put it into your left, but retain it in your right hand, ſhutting your left in due time, as before, ſaying, <hi>Verda, be gone.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Then take the third cup, ſaying, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you ſee there is nothing under my laſt cup; then clapping the ball you have in your right hand under it, then take the third ball up with your right hand, and ſeeming to put it into your left hand, but retain it in your right; ſhutting your left hand in due time, as before, ſaying, <hi>Preſto, make haſte;</hi> ſo you have your three balls come under your three cups, as thus: and ſo lay your three cups down on the table.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Then with your right hand take up the firſt cup, and there clap that ball under, that you have in your right hand; then ſaying,

Gentlemen, this being the firſt ball, I will put it into my pocket; but that you muſt ſtill keep in your hand to play withal.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>So take up the ſecond cup with your right hand, and clap that ball you have concealed under it, and then take up the ſecond ball with your right hand, and ſay, this likewiſe, I take and put into my pocket.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Likewiſe, take up the third cup, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the cup down again, convey that ball you have in your right hand under the cup, then taking the third ball, ſay, Gentlemen, this being the laſt ball, I take and put this into my pocket. Afterwards ſay to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Gentlemen, by a little of my fine powder of experience, I will command theſe balls under the cups again. As thus,

                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:028540_0009_0FD939FADBD49688"/>So lay them all along upon the table to the admiration of all the beholders.</p>
               <p>Then take up the firſt cup, and clap the ball you have in your right hand under it, then taking the firſt ball up with your right hand, ſeem to put the ſame into your left hand, but retain it ſtill in your right, then ſay, <hi>Vade, quick be gone when I bid you, and run under the cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Then taking that cup up again, and fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you have in your right hand under it, you muſt take up the ſecond ball, and ſeem to put it into your left hand, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in your right hand, ſaying, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſee how the ball runs on the table.</p>
               <p>So ſeemingly fling it away, and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>So taking the ſame cup again, then clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ball under again, as before, then taking the third ball in your right hand, and ſeem to put it under your left, but ſtill

retain it in your right, then with your left hand ſeem to fling it in the cup, and it will appear thus; all the three balls to be under one cup.</p>
               <figure/>

               <p>You ſhall ſee a juggler take four kings in his hand, and apparently ſhew you them, then after ſome words and charms, he will throw them down upon the table, taking one of the kings away, and adding but on other card; then taking them up again, and blowing upon them, will ſhew you them transformed into blank cards, white one both ſides, then throwing them down as before, with their faces downwards, will take them up again, and blowing upon them, will ſhew you four aces. This trick, in my mind, is not inferior to any of the reſt, and being not known, will ſeem very ſtrange to the beholders, and yet after you know it, you cannot but ſay the trick is pretty. Now

to do this feat, you muſt have cards made for the purpoſe, half cards we may call them; that is one half kings and the other half aces, ſo laying the aces one over the other, nothing but kings will be ſeen, and then turning the kings downwards, the four aces will be ſeen; but you muſt have two whole cards, one a king, to cover one of the aces, or elſe it will be perceived; and the other an ace, to lay over the kings, when you mean to ſhew the aces; then, when you would make them all blank, lay the cards a little lower and hide the aces, and they will appear all white. The like you may make of four knaves, putting upon them the four fives; and ſo of the other cards.</p>
