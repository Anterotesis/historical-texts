            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IN ſubmitting the following memorials to the public eye, the Academy of Medicine have been influenced by a sense of what they conceive to be their duty, not only to themselves, but to their fellow citizens. Persuaded, that, where candour and good temper prevail, a collision of sentiments is by no means unfavourable to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of truth, they have ventured, with the less reluctance, to controvert the opinion of the College of Physicians, respecting the origin of our late Epidemic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In support of all the facts, principles, and opinions, which their memorials contain, the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy are possessed of ample and satisfactory docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Of these, they have not thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to publish any, except such as relate to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points, which have, unfortunately, become subjects of misrepresentation. To remove the errors and prejudices resulting from this occurrence, the publication of a few of their documents was found to be essential. The rest are carefully preserved among the records of the Academy, and will, if called
<pb facs="unknown:034352_0003_0FFF0B0EA4B7D760"/>
for, by the circumstances of any future emergency, be, in like manner, submitted to the examination of the public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Academy are unwilling to neglect the present opportunity, of begging the College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians to be aſſured, that, in the following inves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, they have been actuated by no sentiments of unkindness towards them, either in their associate or individual capacity. Their only motive has been, in common, as they presume, with that of the College, an earneſt wiſh for the ascertainment of truth, on a subject, in which the interests of both are equally involved. Notwithstanding, therefore, the difference of opinion which prevails between them on several important particulars, it is the desire of the Academy still to cultivate and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with that learned body, such a degree of good understanding and harmony, as ought ever to characterize both societies and individuals, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the promotion of the same branch of science.</hi>

               <p>I AM deſirous to obtain, for the information of the Legiſlature, the moſt correct account of the origin, progreſs, and nature of the diſeaſe that has recently afflicted the city of Philadelphia, with a view that the moſt efficacious ſteps ſhould be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a recurrence of ſo dreadful a calamity. I have requeſted the opinion of the College of Phyſicians on the ſubject; but, as I underſtand that you and many other learned members of the Faculty do not attend the deliberations of that inſtitution, the reſult of my enquiries cannot be perfectly ſatisfactory without your co-operation and aſſiſtance. Permit me, therefore, Sir, to beg the favour of you, and of ſuch of your Brethren as you ſhall be pleaſed to conſult, to ſtate, in

               <trailer>Dr. BENJAMIN RUSH.</trailer>
            </div>
            <div type="letter">
               <head>Anſwer to the foregoing.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN compliance with your requeſt, the ſubſcribers have devoted themſelves to the inveſtigation of the origin, progreſs and nature of the fever which lately prevailed in our city, and we have now the honor of communicating to you the reſult of our enquiries and obſervations.</p>
               <p>We conceive the fever which has lately prevailed in our city, commonly called the yellow fever, to be the bilious remitting fever of warm climates excited to a higher degree of malignity by circumſtances to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hereafter.</p>
               <p>Our reaſons for this opinion are as follows:</p>
               <p>I. The ſameneſs of their origin; both being the offspring of putrefaction. Of this there are many proofs in the hiſtories of the yellow fever in the Weſt-Indies. Where there is no putrefaction, the Weſt-India
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:034352_0006_0FFF0A9E19B20C78"/>
iſlands enjoy a perfect exemption from that diſeaſe in common with northern climates.</p>
               <p>II. The yellow fever makes its appearance in thoſe months chiefly in which the bilious fever prevails in our country, and is uniformly checked and deſtroyed by the ſame cauſes, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> heavy rains and froſts.</p>
               <p>III. The ſymptoms of the bilious and yellow fever are the ſame in their nature. They differ only in their degree. It is no objection to this aſſertion that there is ſometimes a deficiency or abſence of bile in the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever. This ſymptom is the effect only of a torpid ſtate of the liver, produced by the greater force of the diſeaſe acting upon that part of the body. By means of depleting remedies this torpor is removed and the diſeaſe thereby made to aſſume its original and ſimple bilious character.</p>
               <p>IV. The common bilious and yellow fever often run into each other. By depleting remedies the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant yellow fever may be changed into a common bilious fever and by tonic remedies, improperly applied, the common bilious fever may be made to aſſume the ſymptoms of the moſt malignant yellow fever.</p>
               <p>V. The common bilious and yellow fevers are alike contagious, under certain circumſtances of the weather and of pre-diſpoſition in the body. That the common bilious fever is contagious, we aſſert from the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034352_0007_0FFF0AA04957A5B8"/>
of ſome of us, and from the authority of many Phyſicians, who have long commanded the higheſt reſpect in medicine.</p>
               <p>VI. The yellow and mild bilious fevers mutually propagate each other. We conceive a belief in the unity of theſe two ſtates of fever, to be deeply intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humanity, inaſmuch as it may lead patients to an early application for medical aid, and Phyſicians to the uſe of the ſame remedies for each of them, vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe remedies only according to the force of the diſorder. It is no objection to this opinion, that that ſtate of bilious fever called the yellow fever, is a <hi>modern</hi> appearance in our country. From certain revolutions in the atmoſphere as yet obſerved only, but not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by Phyſicians, diſeaſes have in all ages and countries alternately riſen and fallen in their force and danger. At preſent a conſtitution of the atmoſphere prevails in the United States which diſpoſes to fever of a highly inflammatory character. It began in the year 1793. Its duration in other countries has been from one to fifty years. It is not peculiar to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bilious fever to have put on more inflammatory ſymptoms than in former years. There is ſcarcely a diſeaſe which has not been affected in a ſimilar way by the late change in our atmoſphere, and that does not call for a greater force of depleting remedies than were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to cure them before the year 1793.</p>
               <p>VII. And LASTLY. The yellow fever affects the ſyſtem more than once, in common with the bilious
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034352_0008_0FFF0AA26CE40CD8"/>
fever. Of this there were many inſtances during the prevalence of our late epidemic.</p>
               <p>The fever which lately prevailed in our city appears from the documents which accompany this letter to have been derived from the following ſources.</p>
               <p>I. Putrid exhalations from the gutters, ſtreets, ponds and marſhy grounds in the neighbourhood of the city. From ſome one of theſe ſources we derive a caſe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. Caldwell on the 9th of June—one attended by Dr. Paſcalis on the 22d July, and two caſes attended by Dr. Ruſh and Dr. Phyſic on the 5th and 15th of the ſame month; and alſo moſt of thoſe caſes of yellow fever, which appeared in the northern parts of the city, and near Kenſington bridge, in the months of Auguſt, September and October. We are the more ſatisfied of the truth of this ſource of the fever, from the numerous accounts we have received of the prevalence of the ſame fever, and from the ſame cauſes, during the late autumn in New York, and in various parts of New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina, not only in ſea ports, but inland towns. The peculiar diſpoſition of theſe exhalations to produce diſeaſe and death, was evinced early in the ſeaſon by the mortality which prevailed among the cats, and during every part of the ſeaſon, by the mortality which prevailed in many parts of our country among horſes. The diſeaſe which proved ſo fatal to the latter animals, is known among the farmers by the name of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034352_0009_0FFF0AA3FAB21B98"/>
the <hi>Yellow Water.</hi> We conceive it to be a modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>II. A ſecond ſource of our late fever appears to have been derived from the noxious air emitted from the hold of the ſnow Navigation, capt. Linſtroom, which arrived with a healthy crew from Marſeilles on the 25th of July, and diſcharged her cargo at Latimer's wharf after a paſſage of eighty days. We are led to aſcribe the principal part of the diſeaſe which prevailed in the ſouth end of the city to this noxious air, and that for the following reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fever appeared firſt on board this veſſel and in its neighbourhood, affecting a great number of perſons nearly at the ſame time, and ſo remote from each other that it could not be propagated by contagion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was in the hold of this veſſel a quantity of vegetable matters, ſuch as prunes, almonds, olives, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſeveral other articles, ſome of which were in a ſtate of putrefaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A moſt offenſive ſmell was emitted from this veſſel, after ſhe had diſcharged her cargo, which was perceived by perſons ſeveral hundred feet from the wharf where ſhe was moored.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A ſimilar fever has been produced from ſimilar cauſes, in a variety of inſtances: we ſhall briefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a few of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034352_0010_0FFF0AA6E7A7C778"/>
At Tortola, a fever was produced in the month of June, in the year 1787, on board the ſhip Britannia, capt. James Welch, from the noxious air generated from a few buſhels of potatoes, which deſtroyed the captain, mate and moſt of the crew, in a few days.</p>
               <p>Two ſailors were affected with a malignant fever, on board the—, capt. Thomas Egger, in the month of March, 1797, from the noxious air produced by wine that had putrified in the hold of the ſhip, one of whom died ſoon after her arrival at Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>In the month of June, 1793, the Yellow Fever was generated by the noxious air of ſome rotted bags of pepper on board a French Indiaman, which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the port of Bridgetown, by the Britiſh letter of marque Pilgrim. All the white men and moſt of the negroes employed in removing this pepper, periſhed with the Yellow Fever, and the foul atmoſphere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the town, where it proved fatal to many of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>On board the Buſbridge Indiaman, a Yellow Fever was produced in the month of May, 1792, on her paſſage from England to Madraſs, which affected above two hundred of the crew. It was ſuppoſed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from infection, but many circumſtances concur to make it probable that it was derived from noxious air. The abſence of ſmell in the air does not militate againſt this opinion, for there are many proofs of the

moſt malignant fevers being brought on by airs which produced no impreſſion on the ſenſe of ſmelling. This is more frequently the caſe when the impure air has paſſed a conſiderable diſtance from its ſource, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes diluted with the purer air of the atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>Several caſes are related by Dr. Lind, in his treatiſe upon fever and infection of the Yellow Fever, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating at ſea under circumſtances which forbade the ſuſpicion of infection, and which can only be aſcribed to the impure air generated from putrid vegetables.</p>
               <p>So well known, and ſo generally admitted is this ſource of Yellow Fever in warm climates, that Dr. Shannon, a late writer upon the means of preventing the diſeaſes of warm climates, in enumerating its various cauſes, expreſly mentions <q>the putrid effluvia of a ſhip's hold.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We wiſh due attention to be paid to theſe facts, not only becauſe they lead to the certain means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the ſources of this fever, but becauſe they explain the reaſons, why ſailors are ſo often its firſt victims, and why from this circumſtance the origin of the diſeaſe has been ſo haſtily, but erroneouſly aſcribed ſolely to importation.</p>
               <p>The fever which prevailed along the ſhore of the Delaware, in Kenſington, and which proved fatal to Mr. Joſeph Bowers and two of his family, we believe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034352_0012_0FFF0AAC028C8AC8"/>
originated from the noxious air emitted from the hold of the ſhip Huldah, Capt. Wm. Warner. This air was generated by the putrefaction of coffee, which had remained there during her voyage from Philadelphia to Hamburgh, and back again.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See appendix letter A.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the courſe of our enquiries, we were led to ſuſpect one ſource of our late fever, to be of foreign origin. The fails of the armed ſhip Hinde, on board of which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons had died of the Yellow Fever, on her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from Port au Prince, and which arrived on the 4th of Auguſt, were ſent to the ſail ſtore of Mr. Moyſe. Four perſons belonging to the loft were ſoon afterwards affected, with ſymptoms of a bilious Yellow Fever. We ſhall not decide poſitively upon the origin of the fever in theſe caſes; but the following facts render it probable that it was not derived from the perſons who had died of it on board the ſuſpected veſſel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſails emitted an offenſive ſmell; 2. three of the caſes of the perſons affected in the ſail loft were of a mild grade of the fever; 3. the fever was not propagated by contagion from any one of them; 4. the ſail loft was within the influence of the noxious air, which was emitted from the hold of the ſnow Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being not more than fifty yards, and was in the direction of the wind which blew at that time over her. The extent of this air has not been accurately aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034352_0013_0FFF0AAE84B231B8"/>
but many analogies give us reaſon to believe that it may be conveyed by the wind, in its deleterious ſtate from half a mile, to a mile.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of the opinion we have delivered of the origin of our late fever, we muſt add further, that in that part of the city which lies between Walnut and Vine ſtreets, and which appeared to be free from the effects of exhalation and the noxious air of the ſhips, there were but few caſes of the fever which appeared to ſpread by contagion, even under the moſt favourable circumſtances for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Having pointed out the nature and origin of our late fever we hope we ſhall be excuſed in mentioning the means of preventing it in future. Theſe are,</p>
               <p>FIRST, A continuance of the preſent laws for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the importation of the diſeaſe from the Weſt-Indies, and other parts of the world where it uſually prevails.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, Removing all thoſe matters from our ſtreet, gutters, cellars, gardens, yards, ſtores, vaults, ponds, &amp;c. which by putrefaction in warm weather afford the moſt frequent remote cauſe of the diſeaſe, in this country. For this purpoſe we recommend the appointment of a certain number of Phyſicians whoſe buſineſs it ſhall be to inſpect all ſuch places in the city, the Northern Liberties and South wark, as contain any
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034352_0014_0FFF0AB019315B28"/>
matters capable by putrefaction, of producing the diſeaſe and to have them removed.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, We earneſtly recommend the frequent waſhing of all impure parts of the city in warm and dry weather, by means of the pumps, until the water of the Schuylkill can be made to waſh all the ſtreets of the city; a meaſure which we conceive promiſes to our citizens the moſt durable exemption from bilious fevers of all kinds, of domeſtic origin.</p>
               <p>FOURTHLY, To guard againſt the frequent ſource of Yellow Fever from the noxious air of the holds of ſhips, we recommend the unlading all ſhips, with cargoes liable to putrefaction, at a diſtance from the city, during the months of June, July, Auguſt, September and October. To prevent the generation of noxious air in the ſhips, we conceive every veſſel ſhould be obliged by law to carry and uſe a ventilator, and we recommend in a particular manner the one lately contrived by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop.—We believe this invention to be one of the moſt important and uſeful, that has been made in modern times, and that it is calculated to prevent not only the decay of ſhips and cargoes, but a very frequent ſource of peſtilential diſeaſes of all kinds, in commercial cities.</p>
               <p>In thus deciding upon the nature and origin of our late fever, we expect to adminiſter conſolation to our fellow citizens upon the cauſe of our late calamity,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034352_0015_0FFF0AB25C740308"/>
for in pointing out its origin to the ſenſes, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled immediately and certainly to prevent it. But while the only ſource of it is believed to be from abroad, and while its entrance into our city is believed to be in ways ſo numerous and inſidious, as to elude the utmoſt poſſible vigilance of health officers, we are led in deſpair to conſider the diſeaſe as removed beyond the prevention of human power or wiſdom. It has been by adopting meaſures, ſimilar to thoſe we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for preventing peſtilential diſeaſes, that moſt of the cities in Europe, which are ſituated in warm lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, have become healthy in warm ſeaſons, and amidſt the cloſeſt commercial intercourſe, with nations and iſlands conſtantly afflicted with thoſe diſeaſes. The extraordinary cleanlineſs of the Hollanders was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impoſed upon them, by the frequency of peſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fevers in their cities. This habit of cleanlineſs has continued to characterize thoſe people, after the cauſes which produced it, have probably ceaſed to be known.</p>
               <p>In thus urging a regard to the domeſtic ſources of the Yellow Fever, we are actuated by motives of a magnitude far beyond thoſe which determine ordinary queſtions in ſcience. Though we feel the ſtrongeſt conviction that the value of property, the increaſe of commerce and the general proſperity of our city, will be eminently forwarded by the adoption of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going propoſitions, yet theſe are but little objects in our view, when compared with the prevention of the immenſe maſs of diſtreſs, which never fails to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034352_0016_0FFF0AB5EDCC0B78"/>
a mortal epidemic. We conſider ourſelves moreover as deciding upon a queſtion, which is to affect the lives and happineſs, not only of the preſent inhabitants of Philadelphia, but of millions yet unborn, in every part of the globe.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>To the Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Pennſylvania, the Memorial of the College of Phyſicians of Philadelphia reſpectfully repreſents:</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THAT your Memorialiſts, deeply affected with the calamities produced by the diſeaſe which has recently occurred amongſt us, are impelled by a ſenſe of duty to their fellow citizens and themſelves, to inform you, that they conſider the laws which were enacted for the purpoſe of preſerving this city from malignant, contagious diſorders, as very imperfect.</p>
               <p>The ſubject being of immenſe importance, they hope to be excuſed for ſtating their ſentiments with reſpect to it at large.</p>
               <p>They are of opinion, that the diſeaſe which produced ſo much mortality and diſtreſs in the year 1793, was imported into this city from the Weſt-Indies; and they are confirmed in this ſentiment, by the circumſtances attending the diſeaſe of this year, which they conſider as of the ſame nature, and derived from the ſame ſource.</p>
               <p>Some of their moſt important reaſons for this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are as follow:—The diſeaſe in queſtion is eſſentially
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034352_0018_0FFF0AB91478A190"/>
different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which originate from domeſtic cauſes. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference particularly regards the general progreſs of the ſymptoms, and the mortality, as is evident upon a compariſon of its hiſtory with that of the ordinary diſeaſes of this city.</p>
               <p>A diſeaſe which reſembles the fever of 1793 and of this year, in many important points, has long been known in the Weſt-Indies, and thoſe parts of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ſituated between the tropics; and in ſeven or eight different inſtances in which a ſimilar diſeaſe has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the United States, in the courſe of this century, there is good reaſon to believe that it was derived from thoſe countries. In moſt of the inſtances, the original hiſtory of the diſeaſe contains the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it was imported. In ſome caſes, the infection can be traced to the imported clothing of perſons who died in the Weſt-Indies. In moſt of the caſes where the importation cannot be aſcertained, the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the diſeaſe has been, as in the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in the neighbourhood of the ſhipping, or among perſons connected with veſſels.</p>
               <p>The circumſtances attending the fever of this year are extremely in point; and the narrative which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies this, will, we truſt, ſatisfy you that it was imported.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe in queſtion, commences invariably in our ſea-ports, while inland towns, equally expoſed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034352_0019_0FFF0ABB4BD43E78"/>
to the ordinary cauſes of fever, eſcape; and in the two laſt inſtances of its occurrence in Philadelphia, the ſuburbs and the country adjacent, were more healthy than uſual at the ſame ſeaſon; and at the commencement of the diſeaſe, all the parts of the city, excepting the ſmall ſpaces to which it was confined, were remarkably healthy.</p>
               <p>It exiſts in the Weſt-Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of ſtrangers are to be found there; and reference to dates will ſhew, that in moſt of the inſtances of the occurrence of the diſeaſe in the United States, there has been war in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
               <p>Your Memorialiſts are aware, that caſes may be adduced where the diſeaſe has occurred in perſons, who were not known to have been expoſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported contagions, but ſuch is the ſubtile nature of this power, that it often exiſts unſuſpected; and ſimilar difficulties occur reſpecting the ſmall-pox, and other contagions, allowed by all to be of foreign origin. There alſo occur, although very rarely, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary caſes of malignant remitting fevers, the ſymptoms of which reſemble ſo much the diſeaſe in queſtion, that they are often ſuppoſed to be the ſame; but there is this eſſential difference, that a malignant remittent fever has never been to our knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious in this climate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:034352_0020_0FFF0ABF081FAE70"/>
The difference of ſentiments among phyſicians, now ſo much regretted, reſembles that which almoſt always takes place, when the plague is introduced into any of the civilized parts of Europe, where it is not well known. The identity of the diſeaſe, its origin and its contagious nature have been often the ſubject of controverſy. Some phyſicians have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as of domeſtic origin; but proper health laws, ſtrictly enforced, have latterly protected the commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial parts of Europe from its ravages.</p>
               <p>With theſe ſentiments of the nature of the diſeaſe, your memorialiſts cannot but regard a proper law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſubject, as a matter of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and although they are perfectly ſenſible of the imperfection of the ſcience of medicine, yet from a conviction that phyſicians are the beſt informed, as well as the moſt intereſted in the ſubject, they approach you with that reſpect which is due to your legiſlative authority, and declare their belief, that the exiſting health laws of this Commonwealth are not ſuch as are beſt calculated to obtain the deſired end, and that they ought to be improved.</p>
               <p>Having lately communicated in writing to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor their ideas reſpecting the beſt methods of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the introduction of contagious diſeaſes, they beg leave to refer you to that communication. At the ſame time they tender you their profeſſional

               <head>Narrative of Facts relative to the probable Origin, and Progreſs, of the Malignant Contagious Fever which lately appeared at the junction of Penn and Pine Streets.</head>
               <p>THE ſhip Arethuſa, Captain Keith, ſailed about June 1, 1797, from Port Royal in Jamaica for the Havannah, with ſlaves; during the paſſage two men died with a fever, which Mr. Stephen Kingſton, a gentleman of this city, who was a paſſenger on board, and has frequently ſeen the diſeaſe, believes to have been the Yellow Fever, one having the black vomit. After remaining ſome days at the Havannah, the veſſel proceeded for Philadelphia, and arrived in the ſtream oppoſite to Pine Street, July 23, 1797. At the Capes of Delaware ſhe took on board a Pilot, and performed a quarantine of five days at State Iſland.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034352_0022_0FFF0AC2906DFE60"/>
The Pilot was attacked with a fever, the day of their arrival at the city, and went on ſhore the ſame day, when he was viſited by Dr. Currie, who has been much converſant with the Yellow Fever, and was ſo ſenſible of the reſemblance of his ſymptoms to thoſe of that diſeaſe, that he mentioned the caſe as ſuſpicious, to one of his friends.</p>
               <p>The Arethuſa was moored at Mr. Joſeph Ruſſell's wharf, outſide of two veſſels which lay there when ſhe arrived, her crew left her immediately after ſhe was moored, and the next day returned for their cloathing, &amp;c. when they croſſed and re-croſſed the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſhips. Two boys only and the captain (who was on board occaſionally) compoſed the crew of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt ſhip, or that immediately contiguous to the Arethuſa; but the innermoſt veſſels, the brig Iris from Oporto, had a crew of the uſual number. On the twenty ninth day of July, five men of this crew were taken ill with fever, and attended by Dr. J. Stuart, who ſtates in his report to the College of Phyſicians, that the ſymptoms were ſimilar in all, tho' varying in the degree of violence; four of theſe recovered, but one died with unequivocal marks of the malignant Yellow Fever. A ſervant of George Latimer, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> who lived about 100 yards to the north of this veſſel, and was frequently on the wharves, was attacked, July 30, with a fever which was highly contagious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, of which he died in a few days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:034352_0023_0FFF0AC71F410D88"/>
Mr. N. Lewis, who kept a compting room which was about the ſame diſtance from the Arethuſa, was attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the ſame time, and died alſo in five days, of a fever which was ſuppoſed to be of the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dominick Joyce, who was much engaged on board a ſhip near the Arethuſa, was attacked, Auguſt 3d. with a fever of the ſame kind, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. A man who lived in a ſtore on the South ſide of Pine Street, about 150 yards from the river, was attacked with a malignant fever about this time, and died in a few days.</p>
               <p>About the ſixth of Auguſt, Mr. Ferguſon, whoſe yard adjoined the wharf where the Arethuſia and Iris lay, was attacked with a malignant fever, and the ſame day Mr. John Plankinghorn's girl, who lived nearly oppoſite to Mr. Ferguſon's acroſs Penn Street, and worked in a yard which was ſituated very near to the above mentioned ſtore in Pine ſtreet, was alſo attacked with fever, they both died on the fifth or ſixth day after the attack, Mrs. Ferguſon with very ſuſpicious, and Mr. Plankinghorn's girl, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and unequivocal ſymptoms of the Yellow Fever. In this manner the diſeaſe continued to ſpread, ſo that by the middle of Auguſt, or within three weeks from the arrival of the Arethuſa, above ten perſons had died, who either lived or were engaged in buſineſs within 300 yards of the Arethuſa, and this at a time when the other parts of the city were ſo healthy, that it is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034352_0024_0FFF0AC8A3A55DC0"/>
probable all the other deaths which occurred in it were not equal in number to thoſe which occurred in this ſmall diſtrict. After this the diſeaſe gradually extended itſelf to Southwark, and at the ſame time became thinly ſcattered through the city, where its deſtructive effects are but too well known.</p>

               <head>Facts relative to the ſickly ſtate of the ſhip HIND.</head>
               <p>It appears from the depoſitions of Francis Tow, Nicholas Benſon, and William Cooper, ſeamen on board the armed ſhip Hind, taken before Chief Juſtice M'Kean, that about the beginning of July 1797, the Hind ſailed from Port-au-Prince, bound to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, with a cargo of ſugar and coffee, and with 43 paſſengers; of which number 23 were whites and twenty coloured perſons, that they touched at Cape Nichola Mole, where they remained eight days and diſcharged a part of their cargo, in lieu thereof taking in a quantity of ſtone ballaſt; during the time they lay at the Mole the paſſengers were occaſionally on ſhore. It would appear that they left the Mole between the 12th, and 15th, of July, and arrived at this port, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a paſſage of twenty or twenty one days. About three or four days after their departure from the Mole, five or ſix white perſons and one negro of the paſſengers were attacked with fever, the white perſons ſo attacked were obſerved to become very yellow.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034352_0025_0FFF0ACA28A6F3B0"/>
During the paſſage four other coloured perſons and five of the crew fell ill of fever: on or two of the latter number, after the veſſel entered the capes of Delaware; but only a coloured boy and child died during the paſſage, and were thrown overboard after the veſſel entered the river. Upon the arrival of the veſſel oppoſite the Marine Hoſpital, in conſequence of orders from the captain, four ſick perſons were ſecreted and did not come under the inſpection of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of the Port; excluſive of theſe, two women were ſick in the cabin. After paſſing the Fort one of the ſeamen was taken ill, went on ſhore, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried to the Marine Hoſpital; and two other and perſons were taken on ſhore ſick. So far go the depoſitions.</p>
               <p>From information obtained from the Health Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it appears, that the Hind was examined at the Fort on the ſecond, and arrived at Philadelphia on the fourth of Auguſt; and that Mr. Doughty, one of the Inſpectors of the Health Office, ſent to the Marine Hoſpital on the 13th of Auguſt, Peter Malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio, one of the crew of the Hind then reſiding in Love Lane, and on the 14th a Portugueſe from near the junction of Penn and South Streets, who had been landed there; and that another perſon was ſick of a ſuſpicious fever at Mrs. O'Connor's, in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond near Front Street. Both theſe were from on board the Hind, and the Portugueſe above-mentioned had been viſited by Dr. Currie, who declares his diſeaſe to have been Yellow Fever.</p>

               <p>THE Phyſicians, who anſwered your letter of the ſixth of November, reſpecting the origin and nature of the epidemic fever which lately prevailed in the city of Philadelphia, having, with others of their medical brethren, aſſociated themſelves under the name of "The Academy of Medicine of Philadelphia," beg leave, in that capacity, to addreſs you again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intereſting ſubject of the ſaid letter.</p>
               <p>The Academy have ſeen, with regret, a memorial, from the College of Phyſicians of the city, to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, accompanied with a "narrative of facts" in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to eſtabliſh an opinion contrary to that, which the ſubſcribers of the anſwer to your letter, conceive they had therein proved in the moſt irrefragable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>As the opinion appears to us replete with danger to the lives of our fellow citizens, and to the proſperity of our city, we deem ourſelves bound by the principles of humanity, and the obligations of patriotiſm, to make a few remarks upon it; and to ſhew that it is founded upon partial inveſtigations, and miſtaken ideas of the nature of the Yellow Fever.</p>
               <p>

The College have aſcribed the origin of the late epidemic to the ſhips Arethuſa, captain Keith, from Havanna, and Hind, captain Patot, from Port-au-Prince. The memorial ſets forth that, <q>the ſhip Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſa, capt. Keith, ſailed about the firſt of June, from Port Royal in Jamaica, for the Havanna with ſlaves; during the paſſage two men died with a fever, which Mr. Stephen Kingſton, a gentleman of this city who was a paſſenger on board, and has frequently ſeen the diſeaſe, believes to have been the Yellow Fever, one having the black vomit.</q> Admitting the fact, which reſts merely upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a perſon not medically educated, yet the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereafter to be adduced, it is preſumed, will deſtroy the probability of its being introduced by this ſhip. That the iſland of Jamaica was healthy at the time the Arethuſa ſailed, appears from the anſwers given by the captain of the ſaid ſhip, to the official in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories filed in the Health-Office relative to this ſubject; and from thoſe of capt. Henry Latimer, of the Brig Maria, who ſailed from the above port about the ſame day. That the diſeaſe of which the men died was not contagious is rendered probable by its not having ſpread among the paſſengers or crew who amounted to ſeventy, all of whom arrived in good health at the Havanna on the twenty-firſt of June. But ſuppoſing the diſeaſe to have been of a contagious nature, the precautions taken after the deaths, would have been ſufficient to have deſtroyed any remains of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034352_0028_0FFF0AD1F341B828"/>
the contagion. From Mr. Brien's depoſition it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that <q>The cloathing, bedding and articles belonging to the deceaſed were thrown overboard, and their births cleanſed and well ſprinkled with vinegar.</q> And we are authorized further to aſſert, that the ſhip underwent ſuch a complete cleanſing while at the Havanna, after landing the ſlaves, as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would dictate to a ſhip-maſter, in every ſimilar caſe. The ſhip, moreover, after lying at the Havanna fourteen days, during which time all on board remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well, arrived oppoſite the Health-Office on State iſland, on the eighteenth of July. During the whole of this paſſage her hatches were conſtantly open, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the moſt ample means for a free current of air were afforded, which could not fail to diſſipate any remains of contagion which could poſſibly have continued after her former purifications. The ſhip performed five days quarantine oppoſite the Health-Office, on State-Iſland, during which time the bedding was every day expoſed upon deck and was once waſhed by a rain. The crew moreover remained well, except the captain, who was affected with a rheumatiſm, and the mate, with a lax, both of whom ſoon recovered. The pilot who conducted this ſhip was attacked on the twenty-third of July, and allowing three days for the time he had been expoſed to the contagion before his fever appeared, there will remain forty ſix days from the time the ſhip left Kingſton till her arrival in our river. From the known laws of the contagion of the Yellow
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034352_0029_0FFF0AD378E82938"/>
Fever, and the diſtance of time at which it uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, after perſons have been expoſed to the contagion, the Academy conceive it ſcarcely poſſible, if any porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of contagion had been left by the before-mentioned perſons, that it would have remained inactive for above forty ſix days, expoſed as the crew were to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cauſes of fatigue, night watching and the viciſitudes of the weather. The perfect freedom from diſeaſe which all on board enjoyed, muſt therefore be admitted as proof that no contagion did exiſt, and conſequently that the pilot and others could not have derived their diſeaſe from that ſource.</p>
               <p>The College further ſtate that <q>The pilot was attacked with a fever, the day of his arrival with the ſhip at the city and went on ſhore the ſame day, when he was viſited by Dr. Currie, who has been much converſant with the Yellow Fever, and who was ſo ſenſible of the reſemblance of his ſymptoms to thoſe of that diſeaſe, that he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the caſe as ſuſpicious to one of his friends.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In addition to the arguments, before adduced, for ſuppoſing that the pilot could not have taken his diſeaſe from any remains of contagion on board, the Academy further remark, that the ſource from whence he derived his diſeaſe was probably, and as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, from a current of cold air during the night, while ſleeping in the open cabbin of the ſhip, after a warm day, which preceded that on which the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034352_0030_0FFF0AD509B86740"/>
of the ſhip was ended. His indiſpoſition came on the next morning, and ſoon after his arrival in this city, a violent fever ſucceeded, of a kind, which we every year obſerve in Philadelphia, from ſudden changes of the weather, in the ſummer and autumnal months, and eſpecially from ſimilar expoſure on the river. It may be added, that he was but a few days confined, and that none of his friends who nurſed him, or others who daily viſited him were affected by him; neither were there any precautions taken to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, nor the leaſt intimation of danger given to thoſe who conſtantly attended him. Under all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which have been mentioned, it is impoſſible to believe that the pilot's diſeaſe was derived from an imported contagion.</p>
               <p>The College in their memorial have inſinuated that the crew of the Brig Iris were infected with the Yellow Fever by the crew of the Arethuſa paſſing acroſs her deck to the wharf. If this had been true or even poſſible, it muſt have been in one of the three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ways: 1ſt. By the actual ſickneſs of the crew; 2d. By the contagion blowing off their cloaths in paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the decks; or, 3d. By the contagion, which had adhered to the timbers of the Arethuſa, being conveyed by the wind over two intermediate veſſels to the Iris.</p>
               <p>It is not pretended that any of the crew of the Arethuſa were indiſpoſed, therefore the firſt ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034352_0031_0FFF0AD9CC42FE08"/>
muſt be rejected. They could not have infected the crew of the Iris in the ſecond mode, becauſe it is not alledged that they ſtopped a moment when paſſing over her deck. But admitting they did, it cannot be believed, that a diſeaſe could be conveyed by their cloaths, to the crew of the Iris in the open air, when it is well known, that thoſe cloaths when worn, and even waſhed in confined lodging houſes afterwards, did not infect a ſingle perſon, in any part of the city. Laſtly, it is highly improbable that the crew of the Iris could have been infected by the timbers of the Arethuſa, becauſe, we have no proofs that the contagion of the Yellow Fever ever adheres to wood; but admitting this to be poſſible, we reject the probability of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as we before obſerved, the ſhip had been well cleanſed and freely ventilated on her voyage from the Havanna to Philadelphia. We are the more diſpoſed to aſcribe the deſtruction of contagion, if any had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, to the pure air of the ocean, from having ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly obſerved the effects of country air in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening or deſtroying it in the United States. The Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy are moreover authoriſed by Dr. Stewart to aſſert, that none of the family, with whom the five men of the Iris boarded, were infected; but that they preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their health the whole time of the prevalence of our late epidemic.</p>
               <p>As the Iris lay at Pine-ſtreet wharf, and entirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the exhalations from the ſnow Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034352_0032_0FFF0ADB4FD19368"/>
to which we formerly referred, it is highly probable that they were infected thereby, and that the diſeaſe was excited by their intemperance in the uſe of Port wine, with which the brig was loaded, and by the practice of bathing themſelves in the river while under the influence of liquor, and heated by labour. From this conduct it is conceived by the Academy, the peculiar violence of their diſeaſes can be accounted for, as a ſimilar cauſe is always ranked among the moſt powerful, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of malignant caſes of bilious yellow fever; and Dr. Stewart authoriſes the Academy to aſſert his belief, that the Fever, in the caſes he communicated to the College, proceeded from exhalation; and he thinks moſt probably, that of the ſnow Navigation<note n="*" place="bottom">Though at an early period of our late epidemic, Dr. Stewart ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the crew of the brig Iris were infected by an intercourſe with that of the ſhip Arethuſa, yet, a farther inveſtigation and aſcertainment of facts, have ſince ſatisfied him that this was not the caſe, but that they moſt probably, as above ſtated derived their diſeaſe from foul air iſſuing from the hold of the ſnow Navigation.</note>.</p>
               <p>Two of the other perſons mentioned by the College, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> Mr. Lewis and Mr. Latimer's man, ſaid to have been infected by the Arethuſa, were much nearer the ſnow Navigation than the Iris was, and were expoſed to the exhalation from the former veſſel. With regard to Mr. Lewis, we ſhall obſerve, that he was abſent from the city when the Arethuſa arrived, and did not return until ſix days afterwards, which was on the thirtieth of July. On the firſt of Auguſt, the day of his attack, it is known that he complained very much of the ſtench
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034352_0033_0FFF0ADCD308B610"/>
of the ſnow Navigation, which had now pervaded the whole neighbourhood, and expreſſed great concern at her being permitted to remain at the wharf. The Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy are authoriſed, by Mr. Dominick Joyce, to expreſs his ſurpriſe at the aſſertion of his having taken his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the Arethuſa; for, though his buſineſs led him to the neighbourhood of that ſhip, yet he was ſtill within the ſphere of the extent of the foul air from the ſnow Navigation, and he acknowledges he was almoſt every day upon the wharf at which this veſſel lay, and from which he, in all probability, derived his diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>As all the other perſons whoſe caſes are mentioned by the College, lived within the extent of the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſnow Navigation, there can be little doubt, but that they derived it from the ſame air which affected the perſons, whoſe names they have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is remarkable, that the diſeaſe was in no inſtance propagated from any of them.</p>
               <p>The Academy have good reaſon to believe, that the perſons who were indiſpoſed on board the armed ſhip Hind, after her arrival, derived their diſeaſes from the noxious air of the ſnow Navigation, in common with the perſons who were affected on board the Iris, and in the neighbourhood of Mr. Latimer's wharf. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that none of them propagated the diſeaſe to any of their attendants in the city, or in the hoſpital at State Iſland, to which place ſome of them were ſent,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034352_0034_0FFF0AE4C9A7F838"/>
It is well known, moreover, that many citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly viſited and ſpent whole days on board this veſſel, none of whom were indiſpoſed in conſequence of it.</p>
               <p>From the depoſitions of the ſupercargo and of the pilot of the Hind, it will likewiſe appear, that the whole of the teſtimony of the three boys is diſproved, except as to ſome unimportant particulars<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, (B.)</note>.</p>
               <p>We are unable to give credit to the traditional ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the foreign origin of the Yellow Fever, in any part of the United States, inaſmuch as from the inaccuracy of the few records which have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, of the places from whence it was ſaid to be derived, and of the manner in which it was ſaid to have been introduced into our country, we have reaſon to conclude they were aſſumed without ſufficient inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation. Had the proper ſteps been taken at all times to inveſtigate its origin, it is probable it would have been diſcovered, in moſt caſes, to have been the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of domeſtic putrefaction. We cannot cloſe the arguments againſt the importation of the Yellow Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, without remarking, that many recent facts and obſervations render it probable, that the reports of its contagious nature have been exaggerated, and that it is not ſo often propagated by contagion as has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, more eſpecially in warm weather, when ſick
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034352_0035_0FFF0ADF598F3298"/>
rooms are open night and day, to the conſtant acceſſion of freſh air.</p>
               <p>We obſerve in the memorial of the College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians an aſſertion, that the Yellow Fever <q>Is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially different from the fevers that occur in this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and which originate from domeſtic cauſes:</q> but as no proofs are adduced in favour of that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhall reſt our opinion of the original ſameneſs of both thoſe ſtates of fever, upon the facts and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were ſtated in our former communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We ſhall only obſerve, that the idea maintained by the College, has been exploded by ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed writers upon tropical diſeaſes; and by moſt of the American phyſicians of the ſouthern ſtates, who conſtantly conſider and treat both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bilious fever, and its higher grade, called Yellow Fever, as the ſame diſeaſe, varying only in violence.</p>
               <p>The Academy obſerve alſo, with ſurpriſe, another aſſertion made by the College, that <q>The diſeaſe in queſtion, invariably commences in our ſea-ports, while inland towns, equally expoſed to the ordinary cauſes of fever, eſcape.</q> To this we reply, it is well known, that in various parts of the United States, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from ſea-ports, preciſely the ſame diſeaſe, with all its characteriſtic ſymptoms, has frequently prevailed.</p>
               <p>The College in their narrative have taken no notice of the origin of the Yellow Fever in Kenſington, nor at
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034352_0036_0FFF0AE1AC6F4A38"/>
and near Red-Bank upon the eaſtern ſhore of the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. Its origin in the former of thoſe places from the noxious air emitted from the putrid coffee of the ſhip Huldah, and in the latter from marſh exhalation, we conceive to be fully eſtabliſhed by the documents communicated in our appendix<note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix (C.)</note>. The College have alſo obſerved a total ſilence in their report reſpecting thoſe caſes of Yellow Fever, which appeared in our city, before the arrival of the Arethuſa, Hind or Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Theſe caſes were evidently derived from ſome of the numerous ſources of exhalation, from putrid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in and about the city. They were attended by Doctors Ruſh, Phyſic, Caldwell, and Paſcalis.</p>
               <p>We cannot take leave of this important ſubject without expreſſing our earneſt deſire for its candid and cloſe examination, by the Legiſlature of the State.</p>
               <p>Facts and arguments ſimilar to thoſe we have urged, have produced a conviction of the domeſtic origin of the Yellow Fever, in Boſton, New York, Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleſton, and many of the other towns of the United States. This conviction has been followed by meaſures, in New York, which promiſe in future years an exemption from the diſorder.</p>
               <p>With ardent wiſhes for the prevalence of truth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this important ſubject, in the capital of the United

               <p>IN ſeveral intereſting particulars, reſpecting the origin of the epidemic of ninety-ſeven, miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of facts, have much deceived the public mind. Theſe miſrepreſentations, we believe to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the reſult of an eaſy credulity, diſpoſed to reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with popular report, and not of any ſettled intention to miſlead. They have been moſt ſtriking and fallacious in the accounts propagated, reſpecting the origin of the diſeaſe in Kenſington, and at Red-bank, on the Jerſey ſhore, of the river Delaware<note n="*" place="bottom">On the ſubject of the true ſource of the epidemic, in theſe two ſituations, the public are by no means at preſent in poſſeſſion of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate information.</note>. To be able the more effectually to counteract the pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſuch miſtatements, the Academy of medicine have found it neceſſary, to ſet on foot particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigations. The reſult of theſe, they now beg permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſubmit, in the form of a few documents, to the candid conſideration of the public.</p>
               <p>It is known to have been very generally reported, and almoſt as generally believed, that the late epidemic was introduced into Kenſington by Mr. John Bruſter, who was ſaid to have received the infection by going
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034352_0039_0FFF0AECACF12080"/>
on board the armed ſhip Hind, from Port-au-Prince. It is true, that Mr. Bruſter was, at leaſt, among the firſt (if not, indeed, himſelf the very firſt) who was attacked by this diſeaſe in Kenſington, in the ſummer of ninety-ſeven; but that he could not poſſibly have derived his illneſs from any intercourſe with the ſhip Hind, is a truth unequivocally eſtabliſhed by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing documents, particularly by the affidavit of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Lynn.</p>

               <head>DOCUMENT. <hi>Proofs of the diſeaſe, occurring from exhalation in Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington; from marſhy grounds; and from the hold of a ſhip.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>From the books kept at the Merchants' Coffee-Houſe, it appears that the Britiſh armed ſhip Hind, Francis Patot Commander, from Port au-Prince, was ſeen below the Fort on the 2d. of Auguſt;—and at 10 o'clock of the ſame day ſhe came within ſight; and lay off the Fort for examination.</p>
               <p>The uſual queſtions were this day (2d. of Auguſt) propoſed, by the Health-Officer, to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as appears by the paper preſerved on the files at the Health-Office in this city. She came up to the city on the 3d; and entered at the Health-Office on the 4th of the month.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:034352_0040_0FFF0AEEDD9A00C0"/>
As no mention is made, previouſly, of her being ſeen in the river; the probability is that ſhe had a ſpeedy paſſage up the Delaware.</p>
               <p>The perſon who firſt had the Yellow Fever in Kenſington, was a young man of the name of John Bruſter. He is ſaid to have taken the diſeaſe by having been on board the Hind; and through him, the fever was ſaid to have been introduced into Kenſington. Upon an examination into dates, this is altogether impoſſible: Bruſter died on the 2d. of Auguſt, after an illneſs of 4 days and 4 hours, according to his father's account, which brings the commencement of his attack to the 29th July, or four days <hi>previouſly</hi> to the arrival of the Hind at the Fort. Excluſively of this fact, I have added the affidavit of Michael Lynn, to prove that he did not go on board of any veſſel in a voyage down the river to Reedy Iſland. Some other ſource for his diſeaſe muſt then be looked for; and this I derive from the marſhy exhalations (ariſing from the low grounds and meadows on one or both ſides of the river) to which he was expoſed in his paſſage in a ſmall Schooner, to and from Reedy Iſland in the middle and cloſe of July, aided by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent expoſure, by ſleeping upon the wet decks of the veſſel.</p>
               <p>Wm. Reed, who died on the 5th of Auguſt after 7 days illneſs, appears in all probability to have derived his diſeaſe from ſome of the <hi>local</hi> ſources which
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034352_0041_0FFF0AF06388C188"/>
are numerous in, and about Kenſington; although if common report had been credited, we ſhould have aſcribed it to the picking up of a caſk which was ſaid to have been thrown from the Hind. As how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he died on the 5th, after 7 days illneſs; the ſtory is altogether impoſſible, as it brings the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the diſeaſe to the 20th of July, or 4 days preceding the arrival of the Hind. The ſame ſources, which in Kenſington, commonly produce in the Autumnal months, remittents and intermittents, have this ſeaſon by the peculiar conſtitution of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, (whatever that may be owing to) raiſed thoſe diſeaſes to the more violent grade of Yellow Fever.</p>
               <p>To theſe <hi>local</hi> ſources I would alſo without heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſcribe many of thoſe caſes which occurred in Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington, and which were all aſſerted to be traced to contagion.</p>
               <p>In that range of houſes, extending northward from the bridge over Kohockſing creek, and to the weſt of the main York road, not leſs than ſix or ſeven people died of the Yellow Fever. Theſe houſes it will be recollected, are bounded on the weſt by that large portion of low marſhy ground to the northward of the bridge; and from this abundant ſource of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, I think it moſt rational to deduce the ſeeds of the fever which occurred there. And this is rendered much more probable by the collateral evidence, of the ſame fever having exiſted in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:034352_0042_0FFF0AF1FB33B748"/>
of Mr. Boudinot and Mr. Leaming, near the Frankfort road, where low and marſhy grounds afford ample origin to thoſe noxious miaſmata which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce intermitting and remitting fevers. The ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling manner alſo, in which the diſeaſe occurred in Kenſington, renders it more probable that it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from <hi>local</hi> ſources, than that it was introduced and ſpread through the medium of contagion.</p>
               <p>The next perſons who were attacked in Kenſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, were in the family of Mr. Joſeph Bowers. Theſe appear to have received the diſeaſe from the noxious miaſmata originating in the hold of a ſhip called the Huldah, which went up to Kenſington to clear out at Mr. Bowers' wharf, after diſcharging her cargo in this city. The following is the ſtatement which I have procured reſpecting this ſhip, chiefly from the houſe of Summerl and Brown, to whom ſhe was conſigned.</p>
               <p>The ſhip Huldah, Captain William Warner, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this port for Hamburgh, on the 18th of October, 1796, laden with coffee, ſugar, and furs. After landing her cargo, ſhe does not appear to have cleared out her ballaſt, &amp;c. but ſailed from Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh for this place on the 11th of April, 1797, laden with hemp, iron, cordage, dry goods, glaſs, and brandy. She arrived at New-York on, or about, the 1ſt day of July, where ſhe diſcharged 109 pipes of brandy. On the 13th, ſhe ſailed for Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:034352_0043_0FFF0AF58609CAA8"/>
and entered at the Health-Office on the 17th of the month, having thirteen ſeamen on board in perfect health, which had been the caſe during the whole voyage of upwards of ninety days. She diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged hercargo at Vannuxem's wharf, between Arch and Race-ſtreets, and on Sunday the 13th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, ſhe was carried to Mr. Bowers' wharf at Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington, by the mate and one of the ſailors, (Joſeph Way of Wilmington, nephew to the late Dr. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Way, of this city) aſſiſted by Nicolas Painter of Kenſington. They proceeded to clear her out the following day, Auguſt 14th. After getting through a quantity of ſand, which lay above the ballaſt, ſo nauſeous and offenſive a ſmell proceeded from her, that the mate was indiſpoſed for ſeveral days. Joſeph Way was obliged to lay by; and after drooping ſome days, he went down to Wilmington, and there died, with a ſevere attack of the Yellow Fever, on the ſame day with his uncle, in this city, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> on the 2d of September.</p>
               <p>Nicholas Painter and Chriſtopher Ruſh, who aſſiſted in cleaning her out, ſtood the effects of this exhalation till Wedneſday, 16th of Auguſt; when they were ſeized with violent head-ach, eſpecially <hi>above</hi> the eyes; ſickneſs and vomiting, and pain of the back; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by fever. Ruſh ſays, he has never completely regained his health ſince that period. He further ſays, that the ſmell of the hold of the Huldah was ſo nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034352_0044_0FFF0AF7C523B450"/>
that he could not get it out of his noſe for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days.</p>
               <p>Upon inveſtigation it appeared, that the ſmell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a quantity of coffee, (which muſt have eſcaped during the voyage to Hamburgh) mixed with the bilge water and ſand, and which was in the higheſt ſtate of vegetable putrefaction; being very black, and containing worms or maggots nearly two inches in length.</p>
               <p>Mr. Joſeph Bowers' boy was the firſt of his family who was attacked. He worked in a ſchooner which lay along-ſide of the Huldah, and was ſeized on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the 15th of Auguſt, and died on the 22d. Mr. Bowers himſelf ſeems to have received the ſeeds of the diſeaſe on Tueſday, the 15th, at which time he was on board the Huldah, and noticed the very offenſive ſmell proceeding from her hold. He ſickened on the Sunday following, the 20th of Auguſt, and died on the 25th. A maid-ſervant and two children alſo had the diſeaſe; one of the children died. It is poſſible that theſe laſt, took the diſeaſe by contagion from Mr. Bowers or his boy; though I think it more probable, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived it from the original ſource, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> the ſhip's hold; as the wharf is not very diſtant from the houſe, and as yet we know not the exact limits to which theſe noxious miaſmata may be carried, without loſing their baneful influence by dilution with the atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:034352_0045_0FFF0AF94C469FB8"/>
Many caſes which occurred in Kenſington after this period, were, moſt probably, derived from this ſource. The accounts of them are altogether wrapt in doubt and ſuppoſition. Moſt of them are ſaid to have taken it by contagion from others; but this is rendered highly improbable by the very moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which this fever has evinced itſelf to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a contagious power; and more eſpecially in ſo airy and extended a village as that of Kenſington.</p>
               <p>It would appear then, from the preceding pages, that the diſeaſe as it exiſted in Kenſington, had <hi>three</hi> different ſources, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>FIRST; By <hi>Exhalation</hi> or <hi>Marſh-effluvia,</hi> derived from the low grounds on the banks of the Delaware; as was the caſe with <hi>Bruſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY; From <hi>Exhalation</hi> or Marſh-effluvia, deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the local ſources of low grounds in, and about Kenſington; as evinced in thoſe caſes which occurred in the range of buildings, to the weſtward of the York road: and,</p>
               <p>THIRDLY; From the <hi>Exhalation</hi> or <hi>Noxious effluvia,</hi> proceeding from putrefying vegetable matter, in the hold of the ſhip Huldah; as in the caſes of Mr. Bowers and his family, and perhaps in others.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe, poſſibly, in ſome few caſes ſpread by contagion. King, a coffin-maker, who aſſiſted in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034352_0046_0FFF0AFB8DB2F928"/>
the dead into their coffins, may have derived his diſeaſe, of which he died, from this ſource. It is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever problematical; for he was with others, expoſed to thoſe cauſes which produced it in them.</p>

               <p>The Academy of Medicine cannot do otherwiſe than expreſs their ſurpriſe, that the College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, in their reſearches after the origin of our late epidemic, ſhould have thought it neceſſary to make the armed ſhip Hind an object of attention. It is a truth well known, that the fever had prevailed in our city ſeveral days previouſly to the arrival of that veſſel; and it is, in like manner, a truth which ought to be known, that none of thoſe perſons ſuppoſed to have been infected by an intercourſe with her, communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their diſeaſe to any of their viſitants or attendants. Where then, the Academy would beg leave to aſk, is
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:034352_0049_0FFF0B02E50518B8"/>
even the fainteſt evidence, of the ſhip Hind having been at all inſtrumental, in the introduction of this diſeaſe? There certainly exiſts none. Nor, in a candid inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſubject, does there appear to be ground ſufficient to authoriſe, even the mention of the name of this veſſel.</p>
               <p>As the College of Phyſicians appear, however, by their late pamphlet, to have directed to the Hind, an undue ſhare of public attention, it has become neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make their narrative reſpecting her, a ſubject of particular conſideration. The only evidence of which that learned body are poſſeſſed, reſpecting the ſickly ſtate of this veſſel, is derived from the affidavits of three common mariners belonging to her crew; two of whom were nothing more than boys. In oppoſition to the evidence delivered in theſe affidavits, we would here beg leave to ſubmit to the public, the affidavit of the ſupercargo of the Hind. The report, deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in his depoſition, is farther corroborated by the joint teſtimony of three other reſpectable characters, on board the ſame veſſel. From this document, it will at once appear, on how equivocal a foundation, the College have thought proper to reſt this part of their inveſtigation, reſpecting the origin of the diſeaſe in queſtion.</p>

That they touched at Cape Nichola Mole, and five days after, a child, about ſix months old, died from teething: that a negro boy, of about nine years of age, died of the ſcurvy, the day before the pilot came on board. That no other perſons were ſick during the voyage, except Mr. Campan a paſſenger, who had been indiſpoſed, before he came on board, with a lax, and other chronic complaints. That no orders were given to conceal any body, upon the arrival of the ſhip, by the captain, from the phyſician at the fort.</p>

               <p>By ſome, the Yellow Fever, which prevailed at or near Red-bank, is ſuppoſed to have originated from an imprudent communication with the ſhipping in the river, while others alledge, that it was derived from an intercourſe with the city of Philadelphia. That both theſe allegations, however, are equally unfounded, is a truth, which the Academy of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine conceive to be ſatisfactorily eſtabliſhed by the following</p>
            </div>
            <div type="document">
               <head>DOCUMENT.</head>
               <p>I do hereby certify, that I viſited the farms at and in the vicinity of Red-bank, ſituated on the eaſtern ſhore of the Delaware, for the purpoſe of inveſtigating the origin of the Yellow Fever, that raged ſo violently amongſt them, during the late autumn. I ſought every poſſible information from the attending phyſician, the families who had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, and from their neighbours. Knowing that a diſeaſe of this kind might have been derived from domeſtic ſources, from the city of Philadelphia, and, poſſibly, from the ſhipping performing quarantine, I was exceedingly particular upon theſe points of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and inveſtigation. After examining the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this ſubject, I do not heſitate to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it the offspring of local cauſes.</p>
               <p>The moſt valuable part of theſe farms conſiſts in meadows, which had been overflowed, for ten or
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034352_0052_0FFF0A49D91E9290"/>
twelve days, by a deluge of rain that commenced on the firſt of Auguſt. The waters gradually diſappeared, and depoſited a ſcum that was exceedingly nauſeous. The roots of the graſs were dead in many places for an acre or more in extent; even ſix inches below the ſurface of the earth, they were deſtroyed—the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble putrefaction was great, and the ſmell ariſing from it extremely diſagreeable. To this ſource I attribute the diſeaſe that prevailed amongſt them. Twenty-nine perſons were attacked in five families; but ſo local was the calamity, that, although the neighbours kept up a conſtant communication, by viſiting the ſick rooms, and rendering their ſervices, no perſon, that theſe families recollect, was affected with it, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And there is but one poſſible caſe in which it could have been communicated, by any one of theſe families to any of the others.</p>
               <p>My opinion of the local origin of the Yellow Fever, derives ſupport from its being the idea of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician who attended the ſick, and the univerſal ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who have ſuffered by it. Documents, entering into detail, to eſtabliſh theſe, and a variety of other points connected with the diſeaſe, are ſubſcribed by all the perſons alluded to, and depoſited among the records of the Academy of Medicine.</p>
