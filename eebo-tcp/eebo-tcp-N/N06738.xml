            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AS I am but a Youth, I ſhall not make thoſe Remarks on the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties I have met with, or the kind Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of a good GOD for my Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as one of riper Years might do; but ſhall leave that to the Reader as he goes along, and ſhall only beg his Prayers, that Mercies and Afflictions may be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me, and relate Matters of Fact as they occur to my Mind.—</p>
            <p>I was born in <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> near <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> in the Year 1740, and put an Apprentice by my Father to Mr. <hi>Mark White</hi> of <hi>Acton,</hi> and in the Year 1756, in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> I inliſted into Major <hi>Rogers</hi>'s Corps of Rangers, in the Company commanded by Capt. <hi>Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>—</p>
            <p>We march'd for <hi>Albany,</hi> where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Fort-Edward.</hi> I was out on ſeveral Scouts, in one of which I kill'd an <hi>Indian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:008557_0003_102F8467DBF7D210"/>On the 18th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1757, we march'd on a Scout from Fort <hi>William-Henry</hi>; Major <hi>Rogers</hi> himſelf headed us: All were Voluntiers that went on this Scout.— We came to the Road leading from <hi>Tion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga</hi> to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and on Lake <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain</hi> (which was froze over) we ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50 Sleys; the Major thought proper to attack them and ordered us all, about 60 in Number, to lay in Ambuſh, and when they were near enough we were order'd to purſue them. I happened to be near the Major when he took the firſt Priſoner, a <hi>Frenchman:</hi> I ſingled out one and follow'd him; they fled ſome one Way and ſome another, but I ſoon came up with him and took him. We took ſeven in all, the reſt eſcaping, ſome to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and ſome return'd to <hi>Tionderoga:</hi> When we had brought the Priſoners to Land the Major examined them, and they inform'd him that there were 35 <hi>Indians</hi> and 500 Regulars at <hi>Tionderoga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being a rainy Day we made a Fire and dry'd our Guns.</p>
            <p>The Major tho't beſt to return to Fort <hi>William-Henry</hi> in the ſame Path we came, the Snow being very deep; we march'd
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008557_0004_102F846BA4784208"/>
in an Indian-File and kept the Priſoners in the Rear, leſt we ſhould be attack'd: We proceeded in this Order about a Mile and an half, and as we were aſcending a Hill, and the Centre of our Men were at the Top, the <hi>French,</hi> to the Number of 400, beſides 30 or 40 <hi>Indians,</hi> fir'd on us before we diſcovered them: The Major ordered us to advance. I receiv'd a Wound from the Enemy (the firſt Shot they made on us) thro' the Body, upon which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd into the Rear, to the Priſoner I had taken on the Lake, knock'd him on the Head and kill'd him, leſt he ſhould eſcape and give bad Information to the Enemy; and as I was going to place myſelf behind a large Rock, there ſtarted up an <hi>Indian</hi> from the other Side; I threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf backwards into the Snow, and it being very deep, ſunk ſo low that I broke my Snow-ſhoes (I had Time to pull 'em off, but was obliged to let my Shoes go with them) one <hi>Indian</hi> threw his Tomahawk at me, and another was juſt upon ſeizing me; but I happily eſcaped and got to the Centre of our Men, and fix'd myſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a large Pine, where I loaded and fir'd every Opportunity; after I had diſcharged
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008557_0005_102F846DA8819548"/>
6 or 7 Times, there came a Ball and cut off my Gun juſt at the Lock. About half an Hour after, I receiv'd a Shot in my Knee; I crawled again into the Rear, and as I was turning about receiv'd a Shot in my Shoulder. The Engagement held, as near as I could gueſs, 5 ½ Hours, and as I learnt after I was taken, we killed more of the Enemy than we were in Number. —By this Time it grew dark and the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceaſed on both Sides, and as we were ſo few the Major took the Advantage of the Night and eſcaped with the well Men, without informing the wounded of his Deſign, leſt they ſhould inform the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and they ſhould purſue him before he had got out of their Reach.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Spikeman,</hi> one <hi>Baker</hi> and myſelf, all very badly wounded, made a ſmall Fire and ſat about half an Hour, when looking round we could not ſee any of our Men; Captain <hi>Spikeman</hi> called to Major <hi>Rogers,</hi> but received no Anſwer, except from the Enemy at ſome Diſtance; upon this we concluded our People were fled. All hope of Eſcape now vaniſh'd; we were ſo wounded that we could not travel; I could but juſt walk the others could ſcarce
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008557_0006_102F846F948C2D78"/>
move; we therefore concluded to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves to the <hi>French:</hi> Juſt as we came to this Concluſion, I ſaw an <hi>Indian</hi> coming towards us over a ſmall Rivulet that parted us in the Engagement: I crawl'd ſo far from the Fire that I could not be ſeen, though I could ſee what was acted at the Fire; the <hi>Indian</hi> came to Capt. <hi>Spikeman,</hi> who was not able to reſiſt, and ſtripp'd and ſcalp'd him alive; <hi>Baker,</hi> who was lying by the Captain, pull'd out his Knife to ſtab himſelf, which the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> prevented and carried him away: Seeing this dreadful Tragedy, I concluded, if poſſible, to crawl into the Woods and there die of my Wounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But not being far from Capt. <hi>Spikeman,</hi> he ſaw me and beg'd me <hi>for God's ſake! to give him a Tomahawk, that he might put an End to his Life!</hi> I refus'd him, and exhorted him as well as I could to pray for Mercy, as he could not live many Minutes in that deplorable Condition, being on the frozen Ground, cover'd with Snow. He deſired me to let his Wife know (if I lived to get home) the dreadful Death he died. As I was travelling as well as I could, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creeping along, I found one of our
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008557_0007_102F847128235078"/>
People dead; I pull'd off his Stockings (he had no Shoes) and put them on my own Legs.</p>
            <p>By this Time the Body of the Enemy had made a Fire, and had a large Number of Centries out on our Path, ſo that I was obliged to creep quite round them before I could get into the Path; but juſt before I came to it I ſaw a <hi>Frenchman</hi> behind a Tree, within two Rods of me, but the Fire ſhining right on him prevented his ſeeing me. They cried out about every Quarter of an Hour, in <hi>French,</hi> ALL IS WELL! And while he that was ſo near me was ſpeaking, I took the Opportunity to creep away, that he might not hear me, and by this Means got clear of him and got into our Path. But the Snow and Cold put my Feet into ſuch Pain, as I had no Shoes, that I could not go on; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſat down by a Brook, and wrapt my Feet in my Blanket. But my Body being cold by ſitting ſtill, I got up, and crawl'd along in this miſerable Condition the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Night.</p>
            <p>The next Day, about 11 o'Clock, I heard the Shouts of <hi>Indians</hi> behind me, and I ſuppos'd they ſaw me; within a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008557_0008_102F8476E7439708"/>
four came down a Mountain, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards me: I threw off my Blanket, and Fear and Dread quickned my Pace for a while; but, by Reaſon of the Loſs of ſo much Blood from my Wounds, I ſoon fail'd. When they were within a few Rods of me they cock'd their Guns, and told me to ſtop; but I refus'd, hoping they would fire and kill me on the Spot; which I choſe, rather than the dreadful Death Capt. <hi>Spikeman</hi> died of. They ſoon came up with me, took me by the Neck and kiſs'd me. On ſearching my Pockets they found ſome Money, which they were ſo fond of, that in trying who could get moſt they had like to have kill'd me. They took ſome dry Leaves and put them into my Wounds, and then turn'd about and ordered me to follow them.</p>
            <p>When we came near the main Body of the Enemy, the <hi>Indians</hi> made a Live-Shout, as they call it when they bring in a Priſoner alive (different from the Shout they make when they bring in Scalps, which they call a Dead-Shout.) The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ran to meet us, and one of them ſtruck me with a Cutlaſs a-croſs the Side; he cut thro' my Cloaths, but did not touch
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008557_0009_102F847A2EC3C188"/>
my Fleſh; others ran againſt me with their Heads: I aſk'd if there was no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, upon which a <hi>Frenchman</hi> cry'd, <hi>I am one:</hi> I ask'd him, if this was the Way they treated their Priſoners, to let them be cut and beat to Pieces by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians?</hi> He deſired me to come to him; but the <hi>Indians</hi> would not let me, holding me one by one Arm and another by the other: But there ariſing a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the four <hi>Indians</hi> that took me, they fell to fighting, which their commanding Officer ſeeing, he came and took me away and carry'd me to the Interpreter; who drew his Sword, and pointing it to my Breaſt, charged me to tell the Truth, or he would run me through: He then aſk'd me what Number our Scout conſiſted of? I told him 50: He aſked me where they were gone? I told him, I ſuppoſed as they were ſo numerous they could beſt tell. He ſaid I told him wrong; for he knew of more than 100 that were ſlain: I told him we had loſt but 19 in all: He ſaid, there were as many Officers. On which he led me to Lieut. <hi>Kennedy.</hi> I ſaw he was much tomhawk'd by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi> He aſk'd me if he was an Officer?
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008557_0010_102F847BCA3309C8"/>
I told him, he was a Lieutenant: And then he took me to another; who, I told him, was an Enſign: From thence he carried me to Captain <hi>Spikeman,</hi> who was laying in the Place I left him; they had cut off his Head, and fix'd it on a Pole.</p>
            <p>I beg'd for a Pair of Shoes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat; the Interpreter told me, I ſhould have Relief when I came to <hi>Tion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga,</hi> which was but one Mile and a ¼ off, and then delivered me to the 4 <hi>Indians</hi> that took me. The <hi>Indians</hi> gave me a Piece of Bread, and put a pair of Shoes on my Feet.</p>
            <p>About this Time <hi>Robert Baker,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, was brought where I was; we were extremely glad to ſee each other, tho' we were in ſuch a diſtreſs'd Condition: he told me of five Men that were taken. We were ordered to march on towards <hi>Tionderoga:</hi> But <hi>Baker</hi> replied, he could not walk. An <hi>Indian</hi> then puſhed him forwards; but he could not go, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſat down and cried; whereupon an <hi>Indian</hi> took him by the Hair, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to kill him with his Tomhawk: I was moved with Pity for him, and, as weak as I was, I took his Arms over my
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008557_0011_102F847E9BFD9E70"/>
Shoulders, and was enabled to get him to the Fort.</p>
            <p>We were immediately ſent to the Guard Houſe, and, about half an Hour after, brought before the Commanding-Officer, who, by his Interpreter, examined us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately; after which he again ſent us to the Guard-Houſe. The Interpreter came and told us, <hi>that we were to be hang'd the next Day, becauſe we had kill'd the</hi> 7 <hi>Priſoners we had taken on the Lake</hi>; but was afterwards ſo kind as to tell us, this was done only to terrify us. About an Hour after came a Doctor, and his Mate, and dreſſed our Wounds; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding-Officer ſent us a Quart of Claret. We lay all Night on the Boards, without Blankets. The next Day I was put into the Hoſpital, (the other Priſoners were carried another Way) here I tarried 'till the 19th of <hi>Feb.</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> inſiſted on having me, to carry to their Homes, and broke into the Hoſpital; but the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel call'd the Guard and turn'd them out; after which, the commanding Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer prevailed with them to let me ſtay 'till the 1ſt of <hi>March,</hi> by which Time I was able to walk about the Fort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:008557_0012_102F84831B716BD0"/>As I was one Day in the Interpreter's Lodging, there came in 10 or 12 <hi>Indians,</hi> with the Scalps they had taken, in order to have a War-Dance: They ſet me on the Floor, and put 7 of the Scalps on my Head while they danc'd; when it was over, they lifted me up in triumph: But as I went and ſtood by the Door, two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> began to dance a Live-Dance, and one of them threw a Tomhawk at me, to kill me, but I watch'd his Motion and dodg'd the Weapon.</p>
            <p>I lived with the Interpreter 'till the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> when General <hi>Rigeau</hi> came to the Fort with about 9000 Men, in order, as they ſaid, to make an Attempt on Fort <hi>William-Henry:</hi> Their Deſign was to ſcale the Walls; for which Purpoſe I ſaw them making Scaling-Ladders.—The Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they marched the General ſent for me, and ſaid, <hi>Young Man you are a likely Fellow; it's Pity you ſhould live with ſuch an ignorant People as the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>you had better live with me.</hi> I told him I was willing to live with him: He anſwer'd, <hi>I ſhould, and go with him where he went:</hi> I replied, Perhaps he would have me go to War with him: He ſaid, <hi>That was the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008557_0013_102F84862F7E14C0"/>
Thing; he wanted me to direct him to Fort</hi> William-Henry, <hi>and ſhow him where he might ſcale the Walls.</hi> I told him, I was ſorry that a Gentleman ſhould deſire ſuch a Thing of a Youth, or endeavour to draw him away from his Duty.—He added, <hi>He would give me</hi> 7000 <hi>Livres on his Return.</hi> I replied, that I was not to be bought with Money, to be a Traitor to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and aſſiſt in deſtroying my Friends: He ſmiled, and ſaid, <hi>In War you muſt not mind even Father or Mother.</hi>—When he found that he could not prevail with me, by all the fair Promiſes he made, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me back to the Fort; and had two other Priſoners brought before him, to whom he made the ſame Propoſals as he had made to me; to which they conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The next Day I went into the Room where they were, and aſked them if they had been with the General; they ſaid, they had, and that they were to have 7000 Livres a-piece, as a Reward: I aſk'd them, if that was the Value of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, and of their Country? They ſaid they were obliged to go. I ſaid, the General could not force them; and added, that if they went on ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008557_0014_102F8487C78BCEF8"/>
they muſt never return among their Friends; for if they did, and <hi>Baker</hi> and I ſhould live to get Home, we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour they ſhould be hang'd. At this Time a Smith came and put Irons on my Feet: But the General gave thoſe two Men who promis'd to go with him, a Blanket, a Pair of Stockings and Shoes. They were taken out of the Guard-Houſe, and marched with the <hi>French</hi> as Pilots.—The General did not ſucceed; he only burnt our Battoes, &amp;c. and returned to <hi>Tionder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oga.</hi>—The poor Fellows never had their Reward, but, inſtead of that, were ſent to the Guard-Houſe and put in Irons.</p>
            <p>Soon after this I was taken out of Irons, and went to live with the Interpreter 'till the 27th of <hi>March</hi>; at which Time the <hi>Indians</hi> took me with them, in order to go to <hi>Montreal,</hi> and ſet me to draw a large Sled, with Proviſions, my Arms being tied with a Rope. By the Time we got to <hi>Crown-Point, I</hi> was ſo lame that I could not walk. The <hi>Indians</hi> went aſhore and built a Fire, and then told me <hi>I</hi> muſt dance: to which <hi>I</hi> complied, rather than be kill'd. When we ſat off again, <hi>I</hi> knew not how to get rid of my Sled, and <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:008557_0015_102F84895D1D4328"/>
knew <hi>I</hi> was not able to draw it; but this Fancy came into my Head; <hi>I</hi> took three Squaws on my Sled, and pleaſantly told them, <hi>I wiſh'd I was able to draw 'em:</hi> All this took with the <hi>Indians</hi>; they freed me of the Sled, and gave it to other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: They ſtripp'd off all my Cloaths, and gave me a Blanket. And the next Morning, they cut off my Hair and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and, with Needles and <hi>Indian</hi>-ink, prick'd on the back of my Hand the Form of one of the Scaling-Ladders, which the <hi>French</hi> made to carry to Fort <hi>William-Henry.</hi> I underſtood they were vex'd at the <hi>French,</hi> for the Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>We travelled about nine Miles on Lake <hi>Champlain,</hi> and when the Sun was two Hours high we ſtop'd; they made a Fire, and took one of the Priſoners that had not been wounded, and were going to cut off his Hair, as they had done mine: He fooliſhly reſiſted them, upon which they prepar'd to burn him; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding-Officer prevented it at this Time. But the next Night, they made a Fire, ſtripp'd and ty'd him to a Stake, and the Squaws cut Pieces of Pine, like Scures, and thruſt them into his Fleſh, and ſet
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008557_0016_102F848FF08E4470"/>
them on Fire, and then fell to powwaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dancing round him; and ordered me to do the ſame: Love of Life obliged me to comply; for I could expect no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Treatment if I refus'd. With a bitter and heavy Heart I feigned myſelf merry. They cut the poor Man's Cords, and made him run backwards and forwards. I heard the poor Man's Cries to Heaven for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and at length, thro' extreme Anguiſh and Pain, he pitched himſelf into the Flames and expired.</p>
            <p>From thence we travelled, without any Thing worthy of Notice happening, 'till we came to an <hi>Indian</hi> Town, about 20 Miles from <hi>Montreal.</hi>—When we were about a Gun's-ſhot from the Town, the <hi>Indians</hi> made as many live Shouts as they had Priſoners, and as many dead Ones as they had Scalps. The Men and Women came out to meet us, and ſtripp'd me na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; after which they pointed to a Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam, and told me to run to it, purſuing me all the Way with Sticks and Stones.</p>
            <p>Next Day we went to <hi>Montreal,</hi> where I was carried before Governor <hi>Vaudreuill</hi> and examined: Afterwards I was taken into a <hi>French</hi> Merchant's Houſe, and there
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008557_0017_102F849202644248"/>
I lived three Days. The third Night two of the <hi>Indians</hi> that took me came in drunk, and aſked for me; upon which the Lady called me into the Room, and as I went and ſtood by the Door, one of them began to dance the War-Dance about me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to kill me; but as he lifted up his Hand to ſtab me, I catch'd hold of it with one of mine, and with the other knock'd him down, and then ran up Garret and hid.—The Lady ſent for ſome Neighbours to clear the Houſe of her Gueſts, which they did: It was a very cold Night, and one of the <hi>Indians</hi> being exceſſive drunk, fell down near the Houſe, and was found in the Morning froze to Death. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> came to the Houſe, and finding their Brother dead, ſaid I had kill'd him; and gathering a Number together, with their Guns, beſet the Houſe and demanded me of the Lady, ſaying, I ſhould die the moſt cruel Death: The Lady told me of it, and advis'd me to hide myſelf in the Cellar, under the Pipes of Wine; which I did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They ſearched the Houſe, and even came down Cellar, but could not find me. The Lady deſired a <hi>Frenchman</hi> to tell the <hi>Indians, That he ſaw me without the City
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008557_0018_102F8493B88FA128"/>
running away</hi>; they ſoon took after me, every Way.—The Merchant pitying my Condition, cover'd me with a Blanket, and carried me in his Conveyance about five Miles, to a Village where his Wife's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lived, in order to keep me out of the Way of the <hi>Indians.</hi> When the <hi>Indians</hi> that purſued me had returned, and could not find me, they concluded that I was concealed by the Merchant; and applied to the Governor that I might be delivered to them, in order that they might kill me for killing their Brother; adding, by Way of threatning, that if I was not delivered up to them, they would turn and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>French.</hi> The Governor told them, he had examined into the Matter, and found that I did not kill the <hi>Indian,</hi> nor know any Thing about it; but that he froze to Death. On this they ſaid they would not kill me, but would have me to live with them: The Governor then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them where I was, and they came and took me with them to <hi>Montreal</hi> again, and dreſſed me in their Habit.</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt of <hi>May</hi> we ſet off to go to the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> where my <hi>Indian</hi> Maſter belonged, and two other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008557_0019_102F84975E07E1A8"/>
with them. For ſeveral Days the <hi>Indians</hi> treated me very ill; but it wore off. We went in Bark Canoes, 'till we came to Lake <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the firſt Carrying-Place. We continued our Journey till we came to the <hi>Ohio,</hi> where General <hi>Braddock</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. Here they took one of the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and with a Knife ript open his Belly, took one End of his Guts and tied to a Tree, and then whipt the miſerable Man round and round 'till he expired; obliging me to dance, while they made their Game at the dying Man.</p>
            <p>From hence we ſet off to go to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Town about 200 Miles from the <hi>Ohio,</hi> where we arrived in 15 Days, and tarried three. The third Night one of the <hi>Indians</hi> had a mind to kill me; as I was ſtanding by the Fire, he ran againſt me to puſh me into the Flames, but I jumped over, and eſcaped being burnt: he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me round and round, and ſtruck me ſeveral Times with his Head and Fiſt; which ſo provok'd me, that as he was coming at me again, I ſtruck him and knock'd him backwards. The other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> laugh'd, and ſaid <hi>I was a good Fellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:008557_0020_102F849BA18E5500"/>The next Day we ſet off for the <hi>Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi,</hi> where we arrived the 23d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> having paſſed over thirty-two Carrying-Places from our leaving <hi>Montreal.</hi> When we came here, I was ordered to live with a Squaw, who was to be my Mother. I liv'd with her during the Winter, and was employed in Hunting, dreſſing Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being cloath'd after the <hi>Indian</hi> Faſhion.</p>
            <p>In the Spring a <hi>French</hi> Merchant came a Trading in Bark Canoes, and on his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn wanted Hands to help him; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with my Miſtreſs to let me go with him to <hi>Montreal.</hi> When we came there, and the Canoes were unloaded, I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country and liv'd with his Wife's Father, and worked at the Farming-Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for my Victuals and Cloathing; I fared no better than a Slave. The Family often endeavoured to perſuade me to be of their Religion, making many fair Promiſes if I would: Wanting to ſee what Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this would make in their Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, one Sunday Morning I came to my Miſtreſs, and ſaid; <hi>Mother, will you give me good Cloaths if I will go to Maſs?</hi> She anſwered, <hi>Yes, Son, as good as any in the Houſe.</hi> She did ſo, and I rode to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008557_0021_102F849D4B25E1C0"/>
Church with two of her Daughters; in giving me Directions how to behave, they told me, <hi>I muſt do as they did.</hi> When we came Home, I ſat at the Table and ate with the Family, and every Night and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was taught my Prayers.</p>
            <p>Thus I lived 'till the next Spring, when my Maſter's Son-in-Law, that bro't me from the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> came for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with him, as he was going again there to trade. I refus'd to go, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Governor. I was then put into Goal, where I tarried 5 Weeks, living on Bread and Water and Horſe-Beef. When ſome Priſoners were going to be ſent to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> in order to be tranſported to <hi>Old-France,</hi> I went with them: Here we laid in Goal 6 Weeks. But happening to ſee one of my Maſter's Sons, he prevailed with me to go back with him and work as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; I conſented, and tarried with him 'till the 8th of <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was at the next Houſe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lad, a Priſoner; we agreed to run away together, through the Woods, that ſo, if poſſible, we might get home to our Friends: But how to get Proviſions for the Way, we know not; 'till I was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008557_0022_102F849FACFB4DF8"/>
a Gun to kill Pigeons, which were very plenty here. I ſhot a Number, ſplit and dried them, and concealed in the Woods. We agreed to ſet off on a Sunday Morning, and were to meet at an appointed Place; which we did, and began our Journey towards <hi>Crown-Point.</hi> After we had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled 22 Days, 15 of which we had no Proviſion except Roots, Worms, and ſuch like, we were ſo weak and faint that we could ſcarce walk: My Companion gave out, and could go no further; he deſired me to leave him, but I would not. I went and found three Frogs, and divided them between us. The next Morning he died. I ſat down by him, and, at firſt, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a Fire, as I had my Gun, and eat his Fleſh, and if no Relief came, to die with him; but, finally came to this Reſolution;—To cut off of his Bones as much Fleſh as I could, and tie it up in a Handkerchief, and ſo proceed as well as I could: Accordingly did ſo, and buried my Companion on the Day I left him, I got three Frogs more the next Day. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak and tired, about 9 o'Clock I ſat down; but could not eat my Friend's Fleſh. I expected ſoon to die myſelf;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008557_0023_102F84A1484FC6F0"/>
and while I was commending my Soul to GOD, I ſaw a Partridge light juſt by me, which I thought was ſent by Providence; I was ſo weak, that I could not hold out my Gun; but by reſting, I brought my Peice to bear ſo that I kill'd the Partridge. While I was eating of it, there came two Pigeons, ſo near, that I kill'd 'em both. As I fired two Guns, I heard a Gun at a Diſtance: I fired again, and was anſwered twice. This rouſed me; I got up and travelled as faſt as I could towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Guns; and about half a Mile off, I ſaw three <hi>Canadians:</hi> I went to 'em and pretended to be a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> one of their own Regulars, that was loſt in the Woods. They brought me to <hi>Crown-Point</hi>; upon which I deſired to ſee the Commanding-Officer: He knew me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and aſked me, <hi>how I came there?</hi> I told him my Story, and what Difficulties I had met with. He ordered me to the Guard-Houſe, and to be put in Irons: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Hour after he ſent me a Bowl of Rice.</p>
            <p>After I had been at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

to <hi>Montreal,</hi> in a Battoe, and wrote a Letter (as I afterwards underſtood) to my Maſter not to hurt me.</p>
            <p>When I came to the Houſe, one of his Daughters met me at the Door, and puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me back, and went and called her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At this Houſe there was a <hi>French</hi> Captain, of the Regulars, billeted; he was a Proteſtant: He hearing my Voice, called me to him, and aſk'd me where I had been? Upon my telling him, he call'd me a Fool, for attempting a Thing ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. My Maſter coming in, took me by the Shoulder, and threatned to kill me for ſtealing his Gun when I run away: But the good Captain prevented him from uſing any Violence. The Captain aſked me if I had been before the Governor; I told him, I had not; and then he advis'd my Maſter to ſend his Son with me (who was an Enſign among the <hi>Canadians.</hi>) When We came to a ſmall Ferry, which we were to paſs, I refuſed to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and after a great deal of do, he went without me. On his Return, he ſaid he had got Leave of the Governor, that I ſhould go back to his Father and work as formerly. Accordingly I lived with him
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008557_0025_102F84A393E4A2D8"/>
'till the 19th of <hi>November</hi>; and when Col. <hi>Schuyler</hi> was coming away, I came with him to <hi>Albany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I was taken Sick, and ſome of the Light-Infantry promiſed me, if I would inliſt, that they would provide for me; and having neither Friends or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I was obliged to conſent. They or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me a Bed, and Care to be taken of me: Five Days after, they put me on board a Sloop, and ſent me to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and put me into a Hoſpital; where I was three Months.</p>
            <p>The Regiment remained here 'till <hi>May,</hi> when we went to <hi>Albany,</hi> from thence to Fort <hi>William-Henry,</hi> and then to <hi>Tion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga</hi> and <hi>Crown-Point</hi>; both of which Places ſurrendered to General AMHERST.</p>
