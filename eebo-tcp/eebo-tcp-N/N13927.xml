            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN I conſider the important occaſion from which this anniverſary derives its origin, and the reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters that have exerted themſelves to perpetuate its hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, I confeſs there is an unuſual ſecurity in my feelings; ſince no miſtaken effort of mine can injure an inſtitution, founded on ſo memorable an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſupported by names ſo juſtly claiming the applauſe of poſterity.</p>
            <p>WHILE I rely then, upon that honeſty of intention, which is it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the beſt apology for its errors, permit me to employ the preſent hour, which your united voices have annually made ſacred to the commemoration of our country's wrongs, in recapitulating the moſt injurious of her ſufferings, among which that on the tragical fifth of <hi>March</hi> is by no means the leaſt, and in recounting the bleſſings
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017606_0005_0FA1DCB7395FF918"/>which have followed from meaſures as really diſgraceful to thoſe who adopted them, as they were intentionally deſtructive to thoſe againſt whom they were levelled.</p>
            <p>A NATION falling from thoſe great principles of juſtice and virtue which had made her reſpectable; ſubverting the boaſted improvements of her arts to the ſavage purpoſes of revenge; with venality and corruption entrenched on her cabinet; affords a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle too ſerious for the amuſement of the beholder. He turns for relief to the annals of thoſe people whoſe maſculine virtues have obſtinately, will he not ſay wiſely? reſiſted the refinement of a civilized world. But from the misfortunes of ſuch a nation much is to be learned. As ſhe is hurried onwards by the vortex of that immeaſurable gulph in which empires ſink to riſe no more, let her ſerve us as a ſignal to avoid the firſt impulſe of its reſiſtleſs tide.</p>
            <p>TO trace Great Britain through the whole progreſs of her ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this country, would be to ſtep back to a very early period: for, long before ſhe avowed her ſyſtem of colonial ſlavery in the Stamp-Act, the liberties of our anceſtors had endured the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming innovations from her throne. Without cauſe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice ſhe had invalidated their charters; laid impoſitions upon their trade; attempted a moſt dangerous influence over their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal government, by endeavouring to make it independent of the people;—and all this with the ſame confidence as though her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and foreſight, and not her perſecutions, had ſettled them on this ſide the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017606_0006_0FA1DCB7C9796E28"/>
BUT the full diſplay of her deſpotic policy was reſerved to add accumulated diſgrace to the inglorious reign of the Third George. Then, intoxicated with the idea of taxing <hi>America,</hi> ſhe ſlumbered upon the tottering pillars of her own conſtitution; the hand of ſlavery rocked her at ſhe lied on the giddy height; falſhood gilded her viſions and bound her ſenſes with the enchantment of ſucceſs; while her blind ambition alone remained awake, to miſdirect the ordinary aſſiſtance of fortune, and to make her fall equally certain and complete.</p>
            <p>THE genius of Britain once interred, the firſt ſpectre which ſhot from its tomb was the Stamp-Act. This promulgation of a ſcheme ſo repugnant to the fundamental principles of the late Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conſtitution, announced the fall, but did not obliterate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that much reſpected ſyſtem in this country. <hi>America</hi> ſaw the act bore not a ſingle feature of its reputed parent, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing detected its illigitimacy, effectually reſiſted its operation. But, as though conviction muſt ever be productive of obſtinacy, Britain deſiſted not to rend in pieces the charters of her colonies, which ſerved to remind her of the violence ſhe committed on her own. Her adminiſtration affecting to realize the fables

            <p>WHERE was the citizen whoſe indignation did not fluſh at this undiſguiſed attack on his liberties? the ſoldiers pride too grew ſanguinary at the idea of contempt from the people he himſelf had been taught to deſpiſe; and, as though Heaven deſigned to effect its greateſt purpoſes by the ſacrifice of what men conceive to be the deareſt objects of its guardianſhip, the lives and rights of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were delivered over to the ſcourge of military rancour.</p>

            <p>BRITAIN having thus violated the greateſt law nations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals can be held by, to uſe the language of the ancients, threw a veil over the altars of her gods whom ſhe was too haughty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe.

On ſuch principles aroſe the memorable declaration of <hi>July</hi> 1776. A declaration which at once gave life and freedom to a nation; diſſolved a monopoly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural as unjuſt; and extended the embraces of our country to the univerſe. A declaration which heaven has ſince ratified by the ſucceſsful event of her arms. For, when we conſider the number of her victories; the diſadvantages under which they were obtained; with the chain of important conſequences which depended upon the very moment of their deciſion; who but muſt acknowledge, after allowing to our military actors every thing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm can claim, that there appeared peculiar marks of more than human aſſiſtance? The ſurrender of entire armies to a power which they affected to look upon rather as an object of their chains than of their ſwords, was a degree of glory no enemy that ever paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Roman yoke afforded to that republic. Hapleſs <hi>Britain!</hi> for even thoſe whom you injure muſt pity you, how has fortune added acrimony to her fickleneſs, in chuſing for a ſcene of your
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017606_0010_0FA1DCBDD55211A0"/>diſgrace that climate where, in a late war, ſhe ſo loudly vaunted the invincibility of your arms!</p>
            <p>AMERICA once unfettered, nobly relied upon the uprightneſs of her cauſe and the bravery of her ſons. But, as though the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of one crown were to apologiſe for the mercileſs cruelty of another, a monarch, equally wiſe in council as brilliant and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in arms, met her in an alliance which muſt ever enliven her gratitude; exalt the honor of France; and, we truſt too, promote the intereſt of both.</p>
            <p>AMONG the advantages which have ariſen from theſe great events to the people of <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> that of ſecuring their lives, their liberties, and property, the great object of all civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a conſtitution of their own framing, is not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaſt. Diſmembered from a government, which had long ſtood by the exacteſt balance of its powers even againſt the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its miniſters, they found themſelves accuſtomed to princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which age had ſtamped with authority, and patriots ſealed with their blood. The cauſe of their ſeparation had taught them the avenues through which deſpotiſm inſinuates itſelf into the community, and pointed out the means of excluding it. Under theſe circumſtances they produced a ſyſtem which, we truſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will evince to be an improvement

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017606_0011_0FA1DCC02BCE7E28"/>which each part of the government has upon the exceſſes of the other, ſeem to warrant us in placing on it all the confidence human laws can deſerve. But,</p>
            <p>LET us not truſt to laws: an uncorrupted people can exiſt without them; a corrupted people cannot long exiſt with them, or any other human aſſiſtance. They are remedies which at beſt always diſcloſe and confeſs our evils. The body politic once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered, they may indeed be uſed as a crutch to ſupport it a-while, but they can never heal it. <hi>Rome,</hi> when her bravery conquered the neighbouring nations, and united them to her own empire, was free from all danger within, becauſe her armies being urged on by a love for their country would as readily ſuppreſs an internal as an external enemy. In thoſe times ſhe made no ſcruple to throw out her kings who had abuſed their power. But when her ſubjects fought not for the advantage of the Commonwealth; when they thronged to the Aſiatic wars for the ſpoils they produced, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred proſtituting the rights of citizenſhip upon any barbarian that demanded them, to meeting him in the field for their ſupport; then <hi>Rome</hi> grew too modeſt to accept from the hands of a dictator thoſe rights which ſhe ought to have impaled him for daring to invade. No alteration in her laws merely, could have effected this. Had ſhe remained virtuous, ſhe might as well have expelled her dictators as her kings. But what laws can ſave a people who for the very purpoſe of enſlaving themſelves, chuſe to conſider them rather as councils which they may accept or refuſe, than as precepts
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017606_0012_0FA1DCC0607E2938"/>which they are bound to obey?
<note n="*" place="bottom">A conſcience more ſerupulous than it is probable <hi>Sylla</hi> ever had, would be apt to imagine this general diſpoſition of the people wiped away the guilt of enſlaving them from any hand that effect'd it.

Commerce, which makes perhaps, the greateſt diſtinction between the old world and the modern, having raiſed new objects for our curioſity, habitual indulgence hath at length made them neceſſary to our infirmities.
