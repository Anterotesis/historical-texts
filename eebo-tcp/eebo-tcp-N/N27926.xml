            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>II. SAMUEL, 1. 27.</bibl>
               <q>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE ſudden and alarming death of our venerable Father and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Citizen, who is lately fallen, is an event ſo affecting and important, that I riſe to addreſs you, on the preſent occaſion, with the mingled emotions of diffidence and ſorrow. When we conſider the magnitude of the ſubject which is to occupy our preſent attention, and the univerſal gloom it has ſpread over every mind throughout this extenſive country, it ſeems utterly beyond the power of human deſcription to paint it in a proper manner. In order, however, to accompliſh this, as far as poſſible in my preſent ſituation, and lead our minds to a ſuitable contemplation and improvement of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy diſpenſation of Divine Providence, I have choſen the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſacred ſcripture which is now before us.</p>
            <p>IT is a part of an elegant elegy, compoſed by the Poet of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; and ſung by him, to expreſs the deep ſorrow of his heart, on a mournful and ſolemn occaſion. The occaſion was this. When the royal leader of God's choſen people had received information that his country was invaded by a numerous army of the Philiſtines, he led forth the armies of Iſrael againſt them. Zealous of his country's rights, and attached to the higheſt intereſt of his people,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037199_0004_100D3A516C9CAF50"/>
like an intrepid hero, he perſonally entered the field of battle, with his brave and affectionate ſons around him. But, not with ſtanding all his military proweſs and mighty achievements, his army gave way to their formidable enemies; whoſe archers ſingled out the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al family, and preſſed hard after the valiant Saul and beloved Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and overtook and flew them on mount Gilboa.</p>
            <p>WHEN tidings of this melancholy and mournful event reached the ears of the pious David, the ſon of Jeſſe, his benevolent heart was overwhelmed with ſorrow, and he burſt forth in the pathetic language of our text. <q>
                  <hi>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>WAVING all remarks on the analogy, which may be ſuppoſed to exiſt, between the King of Iſrael and our beloved WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON—we ſhall immediately proceed to conſider the paſſage before us, with particular reference to the latter, who has ſo recently fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en under the power of death; and hold up to your view, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement which we ſhould make of it.</p>
            <p>IN this view of our ſubject, I am perſuaded that every heart in this aſſembly will reſound our text, and exclaim, <q>
                  <hi>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL conſider the word <hi>mighty,</hi> in diſcuſſing this ſubject, in the moſt extenſive ſenſe, as implying <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>excellence,</hi> as well as <hi>power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR venerable father, whoſe death we this day commemorate, was <hi>mighty,</hi> in the firſt place, in his PERSONAL TALENTS and VIRTUES.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:037199_0005_100D3A53009EEB98"/>
NOT only, my Brethren, was he peculiarly majeſtic in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form, and uniformly dignified in the whole of his deportment, but he was endowed with a mind of ſuperior talents and illuſtrious virtues, which fitted him for great and mighty achievements. He poſſeſſed a clear and comprehenſive underſtanding, which ſeemed at once to enter into the moſt intricate ſubjects, and almoſt inſtantly view them in all their connections and parts. He appeared equally formed for the field or the cabinet; and could as readily marſhal the contending army, as balance the power of civil government. His will was energetic and deciſive, and ſeemed always ſubſervient to his reaſon and judgment, and the will and ſovereignty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. His affections were pure and ardent, and glowed with one ſteady and increaſing flame of love to his friends and his country. All the powers of his mind were enlarged, noble, and dignified; far ſuperior to every thing mean, low and debaſing; and were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally employed, from early life, in the great affairs of our nation.</p>
            <p>As to his virtues, they were as ſplendid as his talents, and ſhone conſpicuous in all his conduct. He was clothed with a dignified humility as with a garment; and his great mind appeared never ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the triumphs of victory, the plaudits of his country and ſplendour of courts. He was temperate, amidſt all the luxury and entertainments of life; and made his appetite wholly ſubſervient to ſit him for more vigorous exertions, more extenſive uſefulneſs and elevated glory. He was patient under the moſt ſevere trials and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked abuſes; ſo that <q>
                  <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled not again: when he ſuffered he threatened not, but committed himſelf to him who judgeth righteouſly.</hi>
               </q> He was perſevering in the midſt of the moſt perplexing difficulties and gloomy diſcouragements, and roſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount to every obſtruction, which was thrown in his way, in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037199_0006_100D3A5605469218"/>
ſalvation of his country: And nothing was able to daunt his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or move his firm and unſhaken mind. In battle, he was the determined and invincible warrior: When victorious, the humane friend of peace. Benevolence was a diſtinguiſhing trait in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; and he was the generous benefactor of the citizen, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and the priſoner whom the fortune of war caſt into his power. The whole train of cardinal virtues appear to have reſided in our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable father, in an eminent degree. In his enlarged mind, was combined the wiſdom of a ſenate, and his majeſtic preſence ſtruck with more profound awe than a hoſt.</p>
            <p>NEITHER are theſe ſplendid virtues, which we have now been contemplating, all that embelliſhed our illuſtrious citizen. In addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe, he had others of a ſuperior nature, which adorned and finiſhed his dignified character.</p>
            <p>DEEPLY in his heart appears to have been implanted, a ſupreme veneration for the moſt high God, as well as a tender regard for his fellow-men: And he uniformly attributed all his cauſes of martial victory, and political glory, to HIS univerſal, beneficent, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence. His great mind was ſuperior to modern licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious philoſophy; and he readily diſcerned, and cordially embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Chriſtian religion, as of divine authenticity, and as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rational ſyſtem of moral truth, upon which guilty mortals can build a permanent hope of immortal life, and eternal ſalvation.—Under theſe impreſſions, he annexed himſelf to the church of Chriſt, and avowed his attachment to the glorious goſpel. Thro' all the viciſſitudes of his important life, he uniformly attended the public worſhip of God, with punctuality and reverence; and gave his higheſt ſanction to all the inſtitutions of religion. And we have ground to believe, that his elevated ſoul was embelliſhed with the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037199_0007_100D3A579DF01000"/>
grace of the goſpel; and that he was enabled, by the divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he conſtantly derived from its author, to maintain that circumſpection of conduct, that dignity of character, and majeſtic glory, for which he is ſo univerſally famed. Of ſuch vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance did real religion appear to this great and good man, that he inculcated it upon the inhabitants of the United States, in the moſt forcible manner, in his farewell addreſs. Hear it, as recorded in that ever-memorable bequeſt, which he made when he retired from public life; and let it ſink deep into our hearts, as the words of a dying father. <q>Of all the diſpoſitions and habits, (ſaid he,) which lead to political proſperity, Religion and Morality are indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, who ſhould labour to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obligation deſert the oaths, which are the inſtruments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, in courts of juſtice? And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that Morality can be maintained without Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH, my Brethren, were the religious ſentiments of our vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable father, which he bequeathed to us, his children, in his laſt legacy: And ſuch, as we have been conſidering, were the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſemblage of talents and virtues, which conſtituted his amiable character. They were early diſcovered to reſide in him: And Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident Davis, as if endowed with a prophetic ſpirit, when preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Virginian volunteers, in the year 1755, pointed him out as the probable ſaviour of his country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037199_0008_100D3A5B213C7410"/>
IN the view of all theſe great talents and amiable virtues, which adorned the character of our illuſtrious citizen, who is now mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering in the gloomy grave, we might, with the utmoſt propriety, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the language of our text, and exclaim, <q>
                  <hi>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>2. OUR illuſtrious WASHINGTON, whoſe death we this day commemorate, was <hi>mighty,</hi> in his PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS and ACHIEVEMENTS.</p>
            <p>IN deſcribing theſe, it will not be expected that a minute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail be given. This would far exceed the limits to which we are circumſcribed, and would ſwell our diſcourſe to volumes. All, therefore, that I at preſent intend, is to give a very general view of the public tranſactions and martial achievements of this great man, in order to inſtamp his memory more deeply on our hearts, and lead us to ſuitable mourning and lamentation.</p>
            <p>THE ſuperior talents and ſplendid virtues with which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by Divine Power, fitted him to ſhine in public life, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated him for great and mighty achievements. An opportunity preſented, in the morning of his days, to call them forth into vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exertion. In 1755, about the twenty-third year of his age, he marched, at the head of the American volunteers, to defend our weſtern frontiers, againſt the common enemies of our country. In the foreſts of Ohio, in General Braddock's defeat, he diſplayed ſuch martial ſkill, ſuch undaunted bravery and feats of arms, as endeared him to his country, and pointed him out as our riſing patriot, and invincible hero.</p>
            <p>

BUT a far more extenſive and important field was afterwards o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pened for the diſplay of his great talents and amiable virtues, and which gave full ſcope for his mighty achievements. When haughty Britain aſſailed our rights, and invaded our privileges; when ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed an unlimited juriſdiction over the citizens of America, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe would bind us in all caſes whatſoever, without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; when ſhe threatened the ſubverſion of both our liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by ſovereign taxation and eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhments; and when our whole country ſtood fearful and diſmayed, trembling at the iſſue of ſuch unbounded uſurpation and arbitrary power: Then, O! then it was, that our venerable father, brave patriot, and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible hero, flew to arms, organized our armies, and determined, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, that he would conquer or die. His majeſtic preſence ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated our diſheartened citizens, and called forth our forces, from every part of the country. He ſoon taught our hands to war, and our fingers to fight, and led forth our troops into the field of battle. With an army of his ſons, though inexperienced in war, yet lovers of liberty and the rights of their country, he attacked and beat the veterans of tyranny, and ſoon acquired laurels of military glory.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH, in the courſe of our revolutionary war, he was frequently placed in the moſt perplexed ſituation, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing circumſtances; although he was betrayed by ſome in whom he confided, and was deſerted by others; and although he had every difficulty to encounter, which could originate from ſcanty reſources, unequipped troops, and a formidable foe; yet his great and unſhaken mind ſurmounted the whole. He perſevered, in ſpite of every obſtacle which was thrown in his way, in obtaining our freedom and independence. Neither proſperity appeared to elevate, nor adverſity to depreſs his ſpirits: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> with one calm, unmoved,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037199_0010_100D3A5FA7B9EC00"/>
and magnanimous temper of mind, he travelled through the various viciſſitudes of eight years war; and finally led our youthful, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and brave armies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſplendid victory and glory: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently eſtabliſhed both the liberty and independence of our country.</p>
            <p>WHILE the mere recollection of the martial achievements, and public tranſactions, of our illuſtrious father and invincible hero, fires our ſouls with veneration and love for his amiable character; how are their ardour damped by theſe ſable enſigns and garments of woe with which we are ſurrounded, and by the irreſiſtible impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that ſo much greatneſs and human glory is buried in the duſt! "<hi>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!</hi>"—Mourn, O ye lofty hills, and embattled plains, which have been witneſſes to his mighty achievements! Weep, ye American heroes, who have fought and bled at his majeſtic ſide; for your illuſtrious leader, and glorious commander, is now no more! Lament, ye Brethren of Maſonic order; for your father, your brother, and the brighteſt ornament of your reſpectable fraternity, is mouldering in the ſilent duſt! Grieve, all ye ſons and daughters of America, and let tears of ſorrow ſtream down every cheek; for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of our rights, the defender of our liberties, and the glory of our land, is ſhrouded in the gloomy grave!</p>
            <p>WERE I to ſtop here, in recounting the public tranſactions of this great man, I ſhould not give you a general view of one half his worth.</p>
            <p>NO ſooner had he accompliſhed the great object of his martial career, and preſented us with our freedom and independence, than
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037199_0011_100D3A61E7E783E0"/>
he was called to concert, with the patriots and ſtateſmen of our country, the beſt means for <hi>their</hi> preſervation and perpetuity. And here his talents and virtues were not leſs conſpicuous than in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer great tranſactions. He appeared equally capacitated for fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming governments and commanding armies; and he preſided over, and took an active and deciſive part in, that auguſt body which formed the conſtitution of the United States: A conſtitution which admirably combines the claſhing intereſts of this extenſive country; which ſecures liberty with order; and which is happily calculated to promote the peace, proſperity, and felicity of all claſſes of citizens.</p>
            <p>NOR did the great tranſactions of this good man ceaſe to ſhine here. More reſplendent glory was yet in reſerve, for him, whom God delighted to honour. For as ſoon as the federal conſtitution was reduced to form, and adopted by the ſtates in the union, our venerable father was called to preſide as chief magiſtrate of our country, by the unanimous voice of the people. He filled this higheſt ſeat in the weſtern world, with the higheſt dignity and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and adminiſtered the government of the United States with an inexplicable mixture of mildneſs and energy. He adhered, with the utmoſt fidelity, to the conſtitution of our government, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcovered the leaſt ambition to overleap the bounds there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him. And he appeared uniformly to ſtudy the peace, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and happineſs of his country; and conſtantly exerted his great talents, during the whole courſe of his civil adminiſtration, to raiſe our infant empire to reſpectability, dignity, and glory.</p>
            <p>IN this elevated ſituation, he was grave, plain, and acceſſible. His great mind was ſuperior to the regalia and haughtineſs of kings, and the ſplendid trappings and pomp of courts. And his virtuous
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037199_0012_100D3A6599AF1A90"/>
ſoul ſeemed never to deſire to avail himſelf of any perſonal or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic advantage, from all his victory and glory. He loved his country;—therefore he endured the moſt painful toil, and laborious fatigue, and fought for her liberty and independence. He loved his people;—therefore he governed them with moderation and juſtice, with mildneſs and energy, and uniformly fought their higheſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. While he was at the helm, under God, we were always ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, in the midſt of the tempeſtuous political ocean. He rode out the ſtorm of both foreign and domeſtic faction—ſteered us ſafely through the raging billows of European commotion—and retired from the chief magiſtracy of his extenſive country, loaded with lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of the moſt conſummate earthly glory.</p>
            <p>3. OUR illuſtrious WASHINGTON, whoſe death we this day commemorate, was <hi>mighty</hi> in his PRIVATE CHARACTER and LIFE.</p>
            <p>AFTER our venerable father retired from the great theatre of public life, to which he had been repeatedly called by the general voice of his country, he cheerfully ſat himſelf down as a private citizen, to enjoy that freedom and independence for which he had ſo nobly fought, and to ſubmit to thoſe laws, which he himſelf had ſanctioned. In this ſituation, as a private citizen, he did not waſte away the reſidue of his days in rounds of luxury and diſſipation, like the heroes and ſtateſmen of antiquity; but he employed his time in promoting domeſtic and ſocial happineſs, and advancing the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of his country; and actually engaged, when again ſolicited, to become the commander and leader, of her armies. His private character, as far as I am acquainted, is as ſpotleſs and dignified as his public life. He was the affectionate huſband—the tender parent—the obliging neighbour—and generous friend; as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vincible
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037199_0013_100D3A67D7DF1D50"/>
hero—the wiſe legiſlator—and great ſtateſman. Of him, it may be moſt-emphatically ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>When the ear heard him, then it bleſſed him; and when the eye ſaw him, it gave witneſs to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him who had none to help him. The bleſſing of him who was ready to periſh came upon him; and he cauſed the widow's heart to ſhout for joy. He was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a father to the poor, and the cauſe which he knew not he ſearched out; and he break eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yoke.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>NOR were his moral and religious character leſs amiable, than his political and military were great. He appears obviouſly to have been endowed with that <q>
                  <hi>wiſdom which cometh down from above; which is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be entreated, without partiality, and without hypocriſy, full of mercy and good fruits. He walked not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtood in the way of ſinners, nor ſat in the ſeat of the ſcornful; but his delight was in the law of the Lord,</hi>
               </q> and his happineſs to do good to men.</p>
            <p>THE cloſe of his life was doubtleſs ſpent, as he intimates in his farewell addreſs, in preparing for his approaching diſſolution. For he was well apprized, that notwithſtanding all his greatneſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he was a frail mortal, and muſt ſoon mingle with his original duſt. He was thoroughly convinced that he was a dependant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he was an accountable being, who ſtood in need of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation; and that he was deſtined for a boundleſs eternity. To prepare for this, he retired from the buſy ſcences of human life, to his peaceful abode at Mount Vernon; where he died, in the <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eighth</hi> year of his age, with the ſame greatneſs of mind with which he lived: And from whence, we have good ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his immortal ſpirit has been eſcorted by ſhining Angels, to the regions of celeſtial glory.</p>

THUS terminated the life of our illuſtrious WASHINGTON, whoſe <hi>perſonal talents</hi> and <hi>virtues</hi>—whoſe <hi>public tranſactions</hi> and <hi>achievements</hi>—and whoſe <hi>private character</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> are without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. As he was human, he was liable to the frailties and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our degenerate nature. But whatever theſe were, they were few in him, when contraſted thoſe with which are uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to great political and military characters; and are all ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the effulgence of his virtues and excellencies.</p>
            <p>IN him were combined the Hero—the Stateſman—the Patriot—and the Chriſtian. A rare aſſemblage in a human character! He was the light of our councils—the ornament of our church—the bulwark of our land—and the glory of the world.</p>
            <p>BUT I dare not attempt his eulogium—Every tranſaction of his life—and the world, will reſound his praiſe.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding all his greatneſs, majeſty, and glory; he is fallen! he is fallen a victim to death! <q>

            <p>IN reviewing our ſubject, and reducing it to practical improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no perſon in this aſſembly, I am perſuaded, can refrain from mourning the loſs of ſo great and good a man. But while we give vent to all the feelings of our overwhelmed ſpirits, on this mournful and ſolemn occaſion; let us weep like Chriſtians, with a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the will of Heaven. Let us be thankful to the ſovereign

of the univerſe, that he raiſed up ſuch an eminent character among ourſelves, furniſhed him with ſuch illuſtrious talents, and continued him ſo long ſuch a diſtinguiſhing bleſſing to this extenſive country. Let us bleſs God, that he did not die by the hand of ſome cruel ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or fall victim to ſome inhuman mercenary; but that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired at his own peaceful retreat, ſurrounded with his affectionate friends, and furniſhed with every accommodation which could alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the agonies of diſſolving nature, and facilitate his tranſition out of time into eternity. O! let us praiſe the eternal Jehovah, that we have ſuch good foundation to hope, that he was fitted for, and has winged his way to brighter regions beyond the ſkies; where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the weary are at reſt; and where he is joining the holy heroes and patriots of Iſrael, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming <q>
