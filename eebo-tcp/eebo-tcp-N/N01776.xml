            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce the Publiſhing of my Letter, Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Diſtreſſed State of the Town of</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſton: Several pretended Anſwers have been Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, with Deſign to amuſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by inſinuating, that the State of the Town is not as I have Repreſented it; and that I have aſſigned wrong Cauſes for our Diſtreſſes. But it is a vain thing to endeavour to perſwade People contrary to what they daily Experience; Had the Gentleman who hath given himſelf the trouble to make Anſwer, projected ſomething for a <hi>Medium of Exchange,</hi> to paſs among us, which is the only way to Extricate us out of our Difficulties; he would have merited well of his Country; but to fault what others do, and propoſe nothing, (<hi>ſave the empty notions of leaving off Truſting, and allowing Intereſt on Book Debts</hi>; Things impracticable at any time, but more eſpecially in our preſent Circumſtances) ſeems to me much below the Character of him, who is accounted the Author; the Writer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thinks he hath done wonderful things in his Anſwer, but I believe I ſhall ſoon make it evident, that he hath not in the leaſt anſwered my Letter; and demonſtrate, he talks very ignorantly, and like
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002106_0003_0fbb81e0e3cd4498"/>
a man utterly unacquainted with Trade, AND THE STATE of HIS COUNTRY ALSO.</p>
            <p>He owns himſelf <hi>ſo ſhort of a common Underſtanding, that after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>il of Apprehenſion, that he cannot ſee the Evils I complain of, and the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I drive it; What Propoſal hath he made, to ſupply us with a <hi>Medium of Exchange?</hi> Without which, it is impoſſible this Town or Country can Subſiſt; What Method hath he thought on, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the vaſt number of Law-Suits? Which it is a Scandal to the Land to name. Hath he Project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any way to bring in Silver, as the Paper-Bills ſink! or hath he Contrived how to keep what doth Come in, from being Ship'd off again; Hath he ſhewn us the Art of Living without a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um!</hi> Hath he found a way to prevent Mercinary Men's Oppreſſing their Neighbours, by anticipating, as well as exacting Intereſt, or by taking their Lands at half Value! Hath he Contrived, how thoſe who Live on their Salaries, ſhall be paid without Money! But bove all, What Contrivance hath he found, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this poor Town the hard Winter approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Can they Subſiſt from day to day, without the Ready Peny! Theſe I think to be Matters of Importance, and what any man might have ſeen to be my Deſign in Writing that Letter; but he hath paſſed them over in Silence, being ſo intent I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, on ſinking the few Bills which are yet abroad, and thereby compleating the Ruin of the Land: (to gratifie the ambition of a few) That he could not ſee theſe Things. THOUGH OF THE LAST CONSEQUENCE TO US.</p>
            <p>And that I may not be Charged with being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, <hi>I ſhall next conſider his Propoſal of Leaving off Truſting, and allowing Intereſt on Book Debts,</hi> which is
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002106_0004_0fbb81e236f5bf78"/>
the only Remedy he propoſes to Extricate us out of our Difficulties; the Propoſal is ſo contrary to the Spirit of Chriſtianity, that it fills me with Horror when I think of it. For I find poor People muſt have neither Money nor Credit, it this Charitable Man might have his Will, unleſs on the hardeſt Terms he could invent. Indeed, the Gentleman will allow, <hi>They ſhall be Truſted S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x Months (provided they will from that time be content to allow</hi> Ten per Cent. <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi>; When he knows, that in the Method we are in, there will not be in (<hi>ſeven years at moſt</hi>) a Bill Abroad, to Pay either Principal or Intereſt; The Law hath wiſely limited Intereſt to <hi>Six per Cent.</hi> but that will not content him; he would be thought wiſer than the Law, and therefore is for <hi>Ten per Cent.</hi> Truly his Brain ſeems to be addled with theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he forgets the Scriptures, though (if I am not out in my gueſs) his Profeſſion is to Study them; I would adviſe him to Conſult the Divine Oracles, and ſee whether Uſury is ſo much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged there; and until he hath proved by Scripture, that <hi>Six per Cent.</hi> is too little, not to think himſelf wiſer than THE LEGISLATOR.</p>
            <p>Again he ſaith, <hi>That making the Bills a lawful Tender, would not have kept up them Value, and gives this Reaſon, becauſe our Import is more than the Produce of the Country will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay for.</hi> A very poor Argument truly! When did we Raiſe ſufficient to Pay for our Import! Doth not our Import from one place, pay for what we Import from another place? Is not our whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on Trade? Do we not Export one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and Bring in another; and then Export that, and Bring in another? And this keeps the wheel a-going, imploys our Ships, and Men Abroad, and our Tradeſ-men at Home alſo; Silver was Shipt off as much before we had <hi>Province Bills,</hi> as ſince in proportion to our Trade; and ever will, while the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002106_0005_0fbb81e5fb660a18"/>
Merchant can find it a better Return than Goods; Is it not ſo all the World over? What Place is there, from whence they do not Ship off Money, when it ſuits their Occaſions? Doth not <hi>England</hi> Ship off vaſt Sums to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? And doth not the ſcarcity or plenty of Silver there, govern the Price of it, as well as other things? Doth not <hi>England</hi> drein all the Plantations of Money, though they have <hi>Sugar, Indigo,</hi> and other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to make Returns with. I am perſwaded, if the Bills now Abroad, were all Sunk this Day, and there was ſo much Silver in its place, if the Silver were effectually ſecured from being Exported, it would not be <hi>One Peny</hi> better than the Paper Bills; neither would it have the leaſt influence on the price of any Merchandize whatſoever; for what would the Silver be better than the Paper, if it could not be Ship'd off, but remain among us. Nay, it is plain, that the Paper would be better than the Silver, becauſe of the Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> allowed thereon in Publick Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo that it is plain, Silver is no longer Money with us but Merchandize; and therefore the Bills ought not to be eſteemed of leſs value, becauſe Silver Riſes, it being no other than Merchandize; and ſought after by none but <hi>thoſe who want to Ship it off, as they do other Returns</hi> And farther, If we had as much Goods Imported from <hi>England</hi> as formerly, (in proportion to what we are grown to) can the Gentleman imagine, they would Sell for <hi>Two Hundred per Cent.</hi> No, It is a Maxim in Trade, <hi>The want of a Thing makes the worth of it</hi>; and therefore I ſay, if we had as full a Supply as formerly, Goods would be at the old Prices, and Silver would have ſtaid with us, notwithſtanding we had Province Bills; Exchange would have been as uſual, and Returns alſo; ſo that you ſee, it is the Plenty or Scarcity of Goods which over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s every thing; and if ſo, ſurely it is our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002106_0006_0fbb81e7ea28f800"/>
to court and encourage Trade; for it is the Price of <hi>European</hi> Goods that governs the Exchange, and the Price of Silver, and all other Returns; and this is very plain, for though the Bills grow ſcarcer, yet Goods of all ſorts keep up their Prices: Nay, the ſcarcity of Bills helps to advance the Prices of Goods; for there being not a <hi>Medium</hi> to pay with, the Seller, if he muſt take other things in Exchange for his Commodities will make his Price accordingly; &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen the Shops, when they come to anſwer the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Notes, are obliged to advance according to the Prices they give; and by this means the burden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s laid on the poor Trades-men &amp; there the Hardſhip CENTERS, AND THEY ARE THE PEOPLE OPPRESSED THEREBY.</p>
            <p>As I have ſaid before, Money was always Ship'd Home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet all that hath been Ship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d off, would not have Run us into theſe Difficulties, but that the Scarcity of <hi>European</hi> Goods have kept up their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and there hath not been ſufficient Returns, to pay for what hath been Imported; and the Springs from whence we uſed to have our Money, have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late, <hi>viz. Jamaica, Curizo, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that there ſeems to be a complication of Misfottunes attending us, which hath Involved us in theſe Diſtreſſes; and I can ſee no likelihood of our having a Silver <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> but by having a <hi>Paper Medium; as I ſhall ſhew you before I have done.</hi> For 1 There is no hopes of having Silver from <hi>Jamaica, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe of late years they find it more advantageous to bring Cocoa, and other Commodities from the Coaſt of <hi>New Spain,</hi> where they Trade, than Money; and this I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, by a Veſſel I had on that Coaſt, not long ſince. And 2. We muſt expect none from <hi>Old Spain,</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> or the <hi>Streights,</hi> while our Fiſh Merchants can Remit their Money to <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> and make <hi>Two Hundred per Cent.</hi> profit, on
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002106_0007_0fbb81e92522f158"/>
their Goods from thence; or if they will bring Iron direct from <hi>Bilboa,</hi> may make <hi>Three Hundred per Cent.</hi> The Treaſurer of this Province, lately gave <hi>One Hundred and Forty per Cent.</hi> for a Bill of Exchange, to pay our Agent; then ſurely there is little likelihood of Goods falling, if ſuch an Exchange be given; for as you Settle the Exchange between <hi>England</hi> and us, the Price of <hi>European</hi> Goods, and of Silver, and all other Returns will riſe and fall accordingly; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt certainly the way to make this Place flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, is to make Trade as eaſie and free as poſſible, by having a ſufficient <hi>Medium</hi> to manage it, and by encouraging every body to come to us; let them bring as much Goods as they will, the more they bring, the Cheaper it will be; it is reaſonable to believe, that if we had of late Imported as much <hi>European</hi> Goods as formerly, in proportion to our Growth, they would have been at the old Prices as in times of Peace; and then <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> would have gone almoſt as far in making Returns, as <hi>Two</hi> doth now; and the Silver would have ſtaid with us alſo. And another Reaſon is, when <hi>European</hi> Goods were plenty, we Ship'd off great quantities to other Places, and brought other Returns for them; and this ENCOURAGED OUR NAVIGATION, AND WAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE EVERY WAY.</p>
            <p>We are pritty much Circumſtanced like <hi>Holland,</hi> we Raiſe but little; if it were not for our Trade, we might Starve; and it's eaſie to ſee the advantage of our Trade, by our Neighbours; who though they Raiſe for themſelves, and ſupply us alſo; yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume none will deny, but that this Province hath grown in Riches and Strength faſter than any of 'em; and may do ſo ſtill, if it be not our own faults; for as we decline, ſo they decline alſo; ſo that it ſeems to me, as if Providence had deſigned

this Place for the Head of theſe Provinces, if we are not wanting to our ſelves. The State of <hi>Holland</hi> I obſerve, (who are allowed to ſee their Intereſt with reſpect to Trade as much as any Nation in the World) are for drawing every body to them; and their Duty's on what ever is Imported, is but a trifle from the Importer, they lay the Duty's on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; but let Trade go in a manner free; and the Reaſon is this, ſay they, we are ſure of getting by every Ship that comes to us; whether they get by coming to us, is their buſineſs to conſider, and not ours; and what I have ſaid is true, with reſpect to this Country alſo; but more eſpecially with reſpect to this Town, whoſe Flouriſhing, or Decay will have a very great influence on the Eſtates of the whole Country.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman ſaith, <hi>What I ſay about burthening Trade, with heavy Duty's, he will not call Evaſion</hi>; neither will any man, who remembers when Rum was <hi>Three Pounds Six Shillings, Eight pence per Hogſhead,</hi> Duty's, Wine, <hi>Fifty Shillings per</hi> Pipe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was it which drove away our Trade to the Neighbouring Governments; for before theſe Duties were laid, <hi>Carolina, Virginia Penſilvania, Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, Piſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Again, he ſeems more poſitive, then is conſiſtant with Prudence; <hi>He ſaith, he is ſure, that to Emit more Bills, according to any Publick or Private Schaeme, which hath been yet Projected, will, but increaſe and prolong our Miſery.</hi> I confeſs it is eaſie to Fore-ſee what may be the Conſequences of Emitting more Bills on the

Publick Scheme; for we may expect the ſame Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will be attended with the ſame Effects, but what may be the advantages, or diſſadvantages of a Private Bank. I am of opinion, no man can foreſee, until we have tried the Experiment, and ſee the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and inconveniences thereof; I am of Opinion, that a Private Bank would not have been attended with the inconveniencies the Publick hath been; and yet I don't pretend, that Silver would immediately fall in price, if there were a Private Bank; neither would it riſe; for I ſee no reaſon to think that Silver will fall in Price, until Goods from <hi>England</hi> fall in their Prices; but it is eaſie for the Government to make the Bank Bills, as good as the Province Bills; and they would not be daily Sinking as the Publick Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Again. The Gentleman <hi>is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Commodity for another; and it will be many years before it can be expected to be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Our Circumſtances are ſuch at this Day, that the Traders contrive how they can get others into their Debt, who they think will have Returns to Sell, that ſo they may ſecure to themſelves the Refuſal of the Commodities they Raiſe, or get out of the Sea, or Import from Foreign Parts, and think they ſerve themſelves by paying before-hand; becauſe thereby they purchaſe that with Goods, which otherwiſe they muſt pay Money for; Nay, they have this double advantage; by this means they are ſure in an ordinary way, to have the Commodities they ſhall want; and get off their Goods many times which would lie on hand, if they had not ſuch ways to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them; but theſe Myſteries in Trade, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is unacquainted with.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe we are to abound with Silver by and by; For the Gentleman tells us, <hi>there was</hi> Ten Thouſand Pound <hi>in Silver brought in from one place the laſt year, and the like Sum Shipt off in one Ship which Poundered.</hi> I am ſorry a man of his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be ſo weak to impoſe on the World in a matter wherein he may be ſo eaſily Detected; I have made Enquiry, and there was not <hi>One Thouſand Pound</hi> aboard that Ship, there might be a little Gold alſo; but in all there was not much above <hi>One Thouſand Pound,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Thouſand Pounds</hi> he tells us was brought in is at beſt a miſrepreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for any one who Reads his Account of that matter, would think there was ſo much Money Imported hither from a Foreign Port; whereas it was Money brought to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi>; and I have reaſon to believe, it came great part of it from the Pyrates; and Gentlemen went up from hence, and bought up the Money, Hides, and other Goods for Returns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002106_0011_0fbb81ef006ef258"/>Again, He tells us, <hi>There are Bills enough to Buy up all the Produce of the Country, and the Silver,</hi> &amp;c. but I think I have proved the contrary; but were that true, Is there enough to Buy and Sell with in the Shops, is there enough to pay Labourers and Tradeſmen, without forcing them to take Goods, which they know not what to do with, except to put them on their Backs; for which ſome people are very angry, and ſay they go beyond their degree; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the People would not Expend it in ſuch ways, if it were at their own diſpoſal; and the Merchants cannot pay them otherwiſe than by Shop Notes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Shops can't Sell for Money; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently can't pay Money to the Merchants; and thus is Trade miſerably imbarras'd, and the Poor oppreſſed, for want of a <hi>Medium</hi>; I can't but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that my Friend owns there is not enough to pay Labourers; and I muſt obſerve alſo, that he takes no care how they ſhall be paid.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſome lay the Cauſe of the Diſtreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of the Town on the People; and ſay, Pride and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs will bring any People into ſuch Circumſtances; but I think whoever gives that Character of this Town, abuſe them; they who ſay ſo of them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never did a days work in their Lives. This Town is as induſtrious a place as any, if they have Work to do; if they ſtand idle, it is becauſe no man hath hired them; not that I will ſay, there are no Drones in the Hive. There are indolent Thoughtleſs People in all Places, but the Body of the People are willing to be doing, if they can find Employment. But it is well if for want of Buſineſs, the People do not get an habit of Idle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and run into Vices, <hi>which when once accuſtomed to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is hard breaking themſelves of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he tells us, he hath found two inconſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he ſaith, if the Import be ſo ſmall, one would
<pb facs="unknown:002106_0012_0fbb81f2fb112f70"/>
think the Produce of the Country will be ſufficient for Returns; but I have told him already, that the Import being ſmall, the Goods fetch near double what it uſed to do; and that we don't Raiſe half the Returns we make, but Import it by our Trade; If we did not by our Trade to the <hi>Iſlands North and South Carolina, Virginia,</hi> &amp;c. Import Pitch, Tar, Hides, Tobacco, Rice, Skins, Sugar, Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ſhould we have to make Returns with? And if we had not occaſion for theſe Returns, <hi>what would become of our Trade, on which the Welfare of the whole depend</hi>? His other Inconſiſtency is, <hi>That it is the Intereſt of every private man to Sell his Silver to the higheſt Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> then ſaith he it is the Intereſt of the Country in general, becauſe all the private perſons contained in it, will make up the whole Country; a wiſe Speech I proteſt, worthy of ſeven years ſtudy at the Univerſity; Well, I'll venture to inform the Gentleman in this myſterious point; That which is the Intereſt of every man Collectively as a Body, is the Intereſt of the Country in general, becauſe in <hi>that</hi> Relation they are the Country; but nothing is more certain, <hi>than that</hi> it may be the Intereſt of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men to Buy up Silver, and Ship it off; and that their doing ſo, may be hurtful to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. <hi>And now what is become of my Friends Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies</hi>?</p>
            <p>Again, he tells us, <hi>Our Silver and Gold is gone already, and our Lands will go next, (if Truſting be allowed) I preſume he don't mean, that the Factors will Ship them off for</hi> England. So then, after all this mighty Tuſſel, he is come to me at laſt; for that I ſay, is what People are afraid of; <hi>That the Lands will fall into a few hands, and ſo we ſhall have a few Lords, and the Body of the People Beggars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I have met with one Clauſe <hi>that</hi> I can heartily joyn with him in and ſo will all the four
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002106_0013_0fbb81f5083764c0"/>
Provinces. He ſaith, <hi>He is of the mind, that it is impoſſible, that either Town or Country ſhould ſubſiſt without ſome Medium or other.</hi> And I'll venture to be as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive as he; I am ſure he is in the Right</p>
            <p>As to the Opinion of the Whale-men, where the Gentleman hath lately been, I confeſs I am ignorant; but of this, I am well aſſured, that it is the opinion of by far the greateſt part of the four Provinces, that unleſs there be more Bills, made on one foot or other, the Country will be ruined; and to make more on the old Scheme we ſee will never do; therefore I hope it will be done by private men, and I make no doubt we ſhall ſee the good Effects thereof: <hi>Our Anſwerer indeed tells us, a Private Bank will involve us into greater Miſchiefs than the Publick hath done, but that his is only Opinion:</hi> And I muſt tell him, that man in Trade, whom I preſume have have as much reaſon to underſtand theſe things as himſelf, are of a quite different opinion.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Well, but now my Friend ſenſible of his weakneſs, and tells us, he doubts he ſhall be playing the fool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</hi>; and I confeſs, I am very apt to believe him, for I have ſeen little elſe in his whole perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; by what he ſaith in his twelfth page; he ſeems to fear the Government being byaſſed by the Power of Money as well as the Bankers; but I have a better opinion of thoſe Worthy Gentlemen, and would hope there is no danger of that; &amp; that if ever a Bank be Erected, the Government will have a careful and jealous Eye over it, to prevent the Bankers doing any thing which may be hurtful to the Publick; and farther, I am of opinion, it always will be in their Power ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Well now I find the Gentleman anſwers a whole Catalogue of Evils which were mentioned to him by this ſhort Sentence (<hi>Leave off Truſting)</hi> this is his ſovereign Remedy to cure all Maladies: Nay, he
<pb facs="unknown:002106_0014_0fbb81f682f8e510"/>
tells us, this will bring Silver amongſt us again, but I proteſt I can't believe him, becauſe I obſerve, that ſince we have given leſs Credit then formerly, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney yet grows ſcarcer than ever; and what is worſe ſtill, Silver doth ſo as well as Bills; whereas he told us, that <hi>Silver would come in as the Bills left us, and ſtay amongſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Gentleman tells us, <hi>If People can't Live in the Town, let them go into the Country</hi>; but certainly he ſpake before he thought, when he made that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; perhaps the Gentleman is in hopes of a good Benefice in the Country in time, (<hi>though he is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Man at preſent he tells us</hi>) &amp; it may ſuit him well enough to go there, &amp; be maintained honourably, as I would have all of his Function be; But it is very hard for Tradeſmen, who have Lived all their Days in the Town, and have got Families, to pluck up Stakes, and remove into the Country, to ſeek their Subſiſtence in a way they have never been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to; and know nothing of; and again, there are abundance of People in the Town, who make a ſhift by their Labour, to maintain their Families comfortably; but lay up little afore-hand, ſuch People have nothing to carry with them into the Country; ſo that they and their Families muſt be more miſerable there, than in the Town: but I think <hi>he would have them turn Labourers</hi> (a very hard propoſal I confeſs) <hi>and ſaith, they want their Labour in the Country, if they would work at a moderate rate, and tells us, they don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t want Money to pay them</hi>; but I find the people in the Country generally differ very much from the Gentleman in this matter; and complain they can't get Money to pay Taxes to the Government, and the Miniſtry; and ſay, if there be not ſome Medium found, their Stocks muſt <hi>go quickly for theſe Uſes; and their Lands at last.</hi> I have heard that ſome ſay, it will never be good
<pb facs="unknown:002106_0015_0fbb81f914338a10"/>
times, until Labourers come to work for a Groat for Six-pence a day; but I hope it will never be ſo in <hi>New-England</hi>; and that the Poor will always live like men, as hitherto, through the good Providence of God they have done, and not as bad or worſe than our <hi>Indians</hi>; as it is in ſome parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Again, My Friend tells us, <hi>There is no danger of People getting their Neighbours Lands at half value</hi>; but we have only his bare word for it; for I am ſure, he hath not given us any reaſon to induce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the contrary; though he anſwers that matter darkly, I'll ſet it in ſo true a light, that he that runs may Read it, ſuppoſe Silver ſhould come to <hi>Twenty</hi> or <hi>Thirty Shillings per Ounce,</hi> as it is at <hi>Carolina</hi>; for it may come to be ſo ſcarce, that it can't be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at any rate; for I ſay, the plenty or ſcarcity of it, governs the Price of that, as all other things; then I ſuppoſe our good friends will value <hi>Thirty Shillings</hi> in Bills, to be worth <hi>Six Shillings</hi> and <hi>Eight Pence</hi>; and Mens Eſtates will be taken from them at a price accordingly; and ſo an Eſtate which coſt a <hi>Thouſand Pounds,</hi> will go for <hi>Two Hundred,</hi> and this is the Contrivance to keep the Eſtates in many mens hands; but the Gentleman may preach it long enough, before he will bring any body to believe him.</p>
            <p>Well, now the Gentleman comes to ſee his Error, and owns, <hi>that he hath expreſſed himſelf in too ſtrong terms, about ſhortning Credit; and allows ſome Credit is neceſſary among Traders</hi>; and therein he ſaith no more than the whole World will juſtifie him in: But yet I ſee his great averſion to Foreign Commodities clings to him; and his whole plea is for a Ready Money Trade; theſe things ſeem wonderfully to affect him; Though the Medium is ſo Exhauſted, that there is ſcarce one Eight part of the Trade
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002106_0016_0fbb81f983f55228"/>
managed with Money, and what Money is abroad, is daily going into the Treaſury, and all methods uſed which can be thought on, to prevent making more; (yet all his Propoſal is to give no Credit, but rather all hands turn Uſurers) How conſiſtent this is with a Money Trade; I leave my Anſwerer to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>Again he ſaith, <hi>That man hath a mind to think hard of the Government, who thinks that they will not (where things come to Extremities) admit Mortgages to be Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Taxes to pay in the Produce of the Country, or in Silver.</hi> A fine Speech I confeſs, as if any man were ſo ignorant to think, that the Mortgagee would Refuſe Silver, or that Silver would not anſwer for Taxes; May not I call this an amuſement, or what what will you call it?</p>
            <p>Some among us have had the advantage of Selling their Silver, and advancing thereon, until they have Raiſed it to <hi>Twelve Shillings per Ounce</hi>; by this they have advanced their Eſtates one third part, &amp; now they have no Silver to make an advantage by Selling, they are for turning the Scale; juſt now the Bills were too light for the Silver, and therefore they muſt have <hi>Twelve Shillings,</hi> for <hi>Eight Shillings</hi> worth of Silver: And now they would have every thing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by what Silver was at, when it was plenty amongſt us: And when the Bills are all in, you muſt procure 'em Silver at <hi>Eight Shillings per Ounce</hi>; nay, it may be at <hi>Six Shillings Eight Pence,</hi> to Redeem an Eſtate, becauſe you don't procure 'em Province Bills, according to the Tenor of your Mortgage, when it will be impoſſible to procure Province Bills to do it; for admit there were enough Bills abroad to redeem all the Mortgages to the Publick; what will become of the Mortgages made to Private Men, and of the Bonds abroad from man to man, <hi>on Perſonal Security; where is a Medium to Diſcharge them with?</hi> The only
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002106_0017_0fbb81fb35ea0080"/>
Method <hi>that</hi> the Gentleman hath contrived to Extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate us out of our Difficulties, is to <hi>turn Uſurers</hi>; but after all he hath ſaid thereon to ſhew the feazibleneſs of it, I believe all Trading Men will think (<hi>as he ſeems to be aware they would</hi>) <hi>that it is the moſt unhappy one he could have hit on</hi>; and had he conſulted the Prophet <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he would have known better, then to have made ſuch a Propoſal. But I think I have ſaid enough concerning our Methods in Buying and Selling, to ſhew the impoſſibility of coming into his Propoſals at preſent: Were Money as plenty as in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Days, the Government I am perſwaded, would never be brought into ſuch a Law; much leſs in our preſent Circumſtances. I am ſorry the Gentleman hath meddled in an Affair, in which he is ſo ignorant; and made himſelf a Tool to a party, ſome of whom perhaps know as little of Trade as himſelf: There are ſome who would be glad of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to paſs among us again, but will never venture any part of their own Eſtates to bring any to us. All their Cry is, when the Bills are ſunk, we ſhall have Silver, but don't conſider the Difficulties which attend bringing it in; We have a little comes in now, becauſe it fetches <hi>Twelve Shillings per Ounce</hi>; but were it at <hi>Eight Shillings per Ounce,</hi> you wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ld not have a <hi>Peny,</hi> becauſe Goods would be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Importer.</p>
            <p>I would adviſe the Gentleman to ſtick to Divinity for the future, and have done with the Myſteries of Trade, I find they are too wonderful for him; and (as he ſeems to own) paſt his Comprehenſion. I like him much better in the Pulpit, there I'll wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receive his Inſtructions; but now he is out of his Sphaere, and ſo he muſt Excuſe me, if I differ from him in Opinion.</p>

               <p>I Had Thoughts at the Meeting of the General Court to propoſe a Method for a Bank, which may anſwer the Occaſions of the Land at preſent and be a means to bring Silver to paſs among us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in time; for it is my fixt Opinion, it muſt be the work of time, and that it will be many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt expect a Medium of Silver currant with us; and the Method I would propoſe, is as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a ſuitable Sum be agreed on, and that a Land Bank be Erected, for we have no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build upon.</p>

That the whole profits, ariſing by the Intereſt, after the neceſſary Charge is defray'd, be laid out in Silver on the beſt terms it can be purchaſed, and remain in the Bank as a Fund, or colateral Security, until the profits amount unto the original Sum Emitted; this will add to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Bills, and as the Profits grow by the Intereſt, ſo will the Bills grow in value; and by this Project I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in about twenty years, the Profits will amount to the Sum firſt Emitted; and the Bank may (if it be tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For Firſt, It will be an eaſein Trade, for any man, who hath Credit in the Bank, may draw a Note on the Bank, and his Creditor, will go and receive his Bills, or have ſo much Transfer'd to his Account, by virtue of his Note, or he may Endorſe his Note to a third perſon, and he to another, and ſo from man to man; by which much time may be ſaved. And Secondly, by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he who hath Credit in the Bank runs no Riſk of his Bills, either of Fire, Thieves, or any other Caſualty; and though this being a new thing here, People at firſt perhaps may rather chuſe to receive &amp; pay their Bills away themſelves; yet in a little time the eaſe and conveniency of it would be ſo obvious to every man, that there would not be abundance of Notes, or Bills abroad: and this would be a great means to prevent Counterfeits; and I am of opinion, a ſhort note on ſtampt paper, part printed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; part written, would be ſafer than Ingraven Plates; how eaſie it is to Counterfeir thoſe plates, experience hath ſhewn us; &amp; certainly the Notes ſhould be fill'd &amp; Sign'd by good Pen men; for it is eaſier to Counterfeit bad Writng than good. As to the method of managing ſuch a Bank, it is time enough to propoſe that, when the Government are Conſenting to it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I have thought on, as a likely method to keep us alive, until Silver become again currant among us, which I fear will not be very ſuddenly; for I can ſee no way to bring in any quantity of Silver; for while <hi>European</hi> Goods continue ſo very high, we can't expect it from Old <hi>Spain</hi>; and the Iſlands who uſed to fetch it from <hi>Mew-Spain,</hi> find it their Intereſt to Trade with them for other Commodities rather than Silver; ſo we can't expect much from them: What little comes in, goes away as faſt as it comes for Returns to <hi>England</hi>; how vain then is is for us to pretend to have Silver to paſs among us; and all men agree in this, that there is no living without ſome Medium: Then ſurely what can be the deſign of thoſe who oppoſe every thing of this nature, and propoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Relieve us: We are a dependant Government, and have our bounds ſet us; our Charter carries with it

(1.) That a Law be made, that neither Buyer nor Seller, ſhall give or receive for Silver, more than <hi>Eight Shillings per</hi> Ounce, on penalty of forfeiture of the Money, and Six Months Impriſonment; the Money ſo forfeited, to go to the Informer. And (2.) That every Maſter, Sailor, or Freighter, before any Veſſel Sails, be obliged to Swear, that they neither have, nor will put an Ounce A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board their Veſſel they Sail in, or Freight on: This I confeſs would be attended with difficulty; but could it be effected, it would keep your Silver, and raiſe the Value of your Bills alſo: for what would the Silver be better than the Bills, if it could not be Ship'd off: It's plain, that the day you prevent your ſilver being bought and Sold as Merchandize that day will your Paper Bills be equal, if not ſuperiour to Silver, according to Act of Parliament: ſo that Silver being as I ſaid before, only Merchandize, the value of your Bills ought not to be regulated thereby, any more than by the Price of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, or any other Returns, did Silver paſs Currant in payment amongſt us, at <hi>Eight Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per</hi> Ounce as formerly, and the Bills would paſs in Trade but for <hi>Fourteen Shillings</hi> in the Pound, then I would own the Bills were <hi>Fifty per Cent.</hi> worſe than the Silver, and not until then.</p>
               <p>But it is a vanity I confeſs to think that a private Bank would anſwer, without the Government ſupport &amp; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it by ſuitable Laws, as they have done the Province Bills: and why they ſhould refuſe ſo to do, I muſt leave: What is the Intereſt of Private Men, ſurely is the Intereſt of the whole in a matter of this nature, it being of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick nature, tho' in the hands of particular perſons: if ſuch a Bank were allowed to go on, the Government might ſo ſteer it by their Laws, that it would never <hi>be in the power of the Bankers to do any thing prejudicial to the Publick Good,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002106_0021_0fbb8201b74f9390"/>Moſt certainly the Country would be greatly inrich'd by it: That I think I can make very plain, &amp; the Riches of a place very much ſtrengthens it, ſuppoſe theſe were <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> Emitted on Land Security, which with what Publick Bills are now out might I am of opinion, ſufficient to manage the Trade at preſent: The Intereſt thereof would be <hi>Twelve Thouſand Pounds per Annum,</hi> allow <hi>One Thouſand Pounds per Annum</hi> to Officers, and for other Charges in managing it: There remains <hi>Eleven Thouſand Pounds per Annum.</hi> This is ſo much gained, and no man hurt by it: for if a man Mortgage his Eſtate: Surely none will ſay, he is the poorer for ſo doing, ſince he Receives ſo much thereon, either to pay his Debts, or to improve in Trade, and thoſe who want it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for neither of the before mentioned Uſes, will yet be fond of being concerned in the Bank becauſe they can let their Bills out to Intereſt on perſonal Security, and be intituled to their Profits in the Bank at ſame time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the Country will be 200000<hi>l.</hi> Richer, if this Projection were ſet on foot, as ſoon as the Subſciptions are full.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, what ſignifies the Profits in the Bank, when it is propoſed, they ſhould remain there, &amp; not be divided: I anſwer, it will anſwer the end of the Perſon concerned, as well as if divided; for in a few years, when the Profits are come to be worth dividing: Any man who is minded to part with his Profits, whoſe occaſions oblige him to do may Sell it to his Neighbour, as Bank Stock is Sold in <hi>London,</hi> every day; and no doubt in a few years the Stock here would be ſo transferr'd from man to man daily as it is there, and I can ſee no harm in improving a man's Money this way, any more than in any other way: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves every man in Buying and Selling, to have a care of Sharpers: for they may be Cheated other ways, as well as by Stock Jobbing.</p>
               <p>But the grand Argument with ſome men againſt a <hi>Paper Medium</hi> is this: They ſay, Paper hath no intrinſick value in it, and ridicule it, ſaying, what value is there in a piece of Paper? But I think that a very weak argument, and indeed unfair, to compare Bank Bills, or Province Bills to blank Paper: What intrinſick value is there in Silver, or Gold, more than in Iron, Braſs, or Tinn, but only the common acceptation of it by men in Trade, as a <hi>Medium of Exchange.</hi> Is not every thing in this World, juſt as men

               <p>I have been in the Bank of <hi>England</hi> &amp; have obſerved the great Conveniencies thereof &amp; am perſwaded in the time that Bank hath ſtood: Such a Bank as I have propoſed, would anſwer our Occaſions as well as the Bank of <hi>England</hi> or the Bank of <hi>Holland</hi> anſwers with them: The only Argument which is brought againſt it, is, That they have Money; and any man may have Money for his Note on damand: There indeed we differ, they abourd with Money, but we have none at all; Had we a plenty of Silver as formerly, we ſhould have no need of a Bank: But I am perſwaded we ſhall never have Silver paſs among us again as Money, until Trade take ſuch a Turn, that <hi>Europaean</hi> Goods falls ſo in prices, that it will not anſwer to ſend away Silver, or that we by going on Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res live more independent of them for that being our main Trade: The plenty or ſcarcity of their Commodities, will govern Exchange, and conſequently the price of Silver.
