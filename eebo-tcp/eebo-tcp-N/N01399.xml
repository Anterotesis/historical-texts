            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THe Scriptures of Truth do not only clearly deliver to, and plainly teach us the Dortrine of a</hi> Future State; <hi>That we must Exiſt, and Live after this</hi> Mortal Life <hi>Expires; in our Souls</hi> Separatim, <hi>immediately upon our Diſſolution, as Written in</hi> Eccl. 3.21. So 12 7. Then ſhall the Duſt return to the Earth, as it was; and the Spirit ſhall return to God, who gave it.—<hi>And in our Whole Perſons Incorruptibly reunited at the</hi> Sound of the Laſt Trump of God, when Death ſhall be Swallowed up in Victory, 1 Cor. 15.52, 54. So 1 Theſ. 4.16. — <hi>But our Natures, and Condition in this Life do ſtrongly argue it; Our Underſtandings, tho' naturally-darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have a realizing View of it; Our Conſciences dictate it, and frequently Alarm us with it: Nothing has a deeper Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on us, nor appears with a more black, and formidable Aſpect to us than this: — Our Minds hence keep ruffled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy; Our Thoughts confuſed, and rack'd, as well they may, Till we have made up and ſetled our Accompts with GOD, and got our Evidences clear for Heaven, Happineſs and Glory.</hi>

For hereby we may <hi>Anatomize our Souls,</hi> Unveil their State, and ſo Diſcover, bring to Light, and take a Proſpect of the Truth of Grace; or its Counterfeit in us. It will give us ſome Satisfying, if not undeniable Evidence, What our Eſtate is before the All-ſeeing, and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching God: Jer. 17.10. Heb. 4.13. — Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have ever been born of God, <hi>Job.</hi> 3.3.

Even thoſe better things, as, <hi>Faith, Repentance, Love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That accompany Salvation,</hi> Heb. 6.9.</p>
            <p>Whence, we ſhall be able to make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Spiritual State, How the caſe ſtands with us before the Holy GOD; and ſo having ſet things in a true and clear Light, may have the Advantage of Rectifying all Previous Miſtakes of our Selves, if any be, Whether reſulting from a Criminal Neglect of, or Inadvertency in the Attendance of this Duty; and thereby prevent what otherwiſe might prove of Fatal Conſequence: <hi>For</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle, Gal. 6.3.) <hi>if a Man think himſelf to be ſomething, when he is Nothing, he Deceiveth himſelf.</hi>

            <p>We muſt beware, we Omit nothing Eſſential in our Tryal, nor are wanting in our particular Perſonal Applications therein. We ſhou'd Ask our Selves all Pertinent Queſtions, and Summons Conſcience to Anſwer them in Order, and Wait unwilling to paſs any over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolv'd: Gal. 6.7. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</hi>

Be the Eyes of our Underſtandings Opened? <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. So as in any meaſure to convince and ſatisfy us of the Evil of Sin? Of the vile Nature, and Monſtrous Deformity of it? This then is an happy Effect of the Spirits Office, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 9, 10, 11. Are we hence become Uneaſy under the Yoke of Sin? Are we weary of its Tyranny? and ſo made willing to part with it? Do we ſee and judge our Selves miſerable, whilſt under the Power of, and Acted by Sin? And are we truly deſirous of a Remedy? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. — Have we a Spiritual Palate?

Tis Written, 1 Joh. 1.3. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Have we any raviſhing Interviews with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? — Do we Anticipate the Joys above? And does this Wing, and Enlarge our Deſires to nearer Approaches? To more Open Views, and fairer Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects?

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001661_0014_0FB4D91906331110"/>Wiſdom of God?</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. Do we labour to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Vain Thoughts? And in no wiſe cheriſh and indulge them? We have then a glorious Title to the Beatifick Viſion, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.8. Do we deſign, and accordingly, as we can, Apply our Selves to Oppoſe ſuch Sinful Ebullitions of Heart?

Yea is it rendred Odious in our Eyes? — Do we Own and Acknowledge our Selves Sinners by Nature? Under Original Guilt before God, which binds us over to Eternal Death? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. And do we Mourn therefor? Are we Sorry for our Perſonal Tranſgreſſions? Do we with true Compunction of Soul bewaile them unto God? Do we grieve for our heart ſins, as well as our Life ſins?

And deem, and call our Selves Wretched, till we be? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. Do we treat Sin, as our Foe? and worſt Enemy? Do we knowingly, and willingly indulge no Sin?

Have we an Holy Ambition in us of blameleſsly Walking in the Commandments, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord, with them in Luk. 1.2. and ſo of being Righteous before God?
