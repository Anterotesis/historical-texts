            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHATEVER may be the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the little performance which I have the honour to preſent to your lordſhip, it will derive ſome merit, I am perſuaded, in your lordſhip's ſight, from the good meaning wherewith it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, from its ſuitableneſs to my profeſſion, and from the importance of its ſubject. Perhaps too, its author's undiſſembled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for your lordſhip may give it ſome additional value; for true reſpect, we are aſſured, can give value to the ſmalleſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from the hands of the pooreſt.</p>
            <p>But, indeed, I did not know to whom I could, with greater propriety, inſcribe a work of this nature, than to a nobleman, whoſe regular life, and punctual diſcharge of all the ſocial duties muſt render <hi>Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>From hence, my lord, we are encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promiſe the faireſt days to good let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and good manners:—They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but flouriſh under your diſcerning eye, and the foſtering patronage of our belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed MONARCH; in whoſe unſullied virtues, while his people felicitate themſelves, no grateful man can be inſenſible of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which redounds to the illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had ſo conſiderable a ſhare in forming the royal mind to virtue; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring it with thoſe great, juſt, and patriot ſentiments, which have obtained to our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, from his ſubjects, that moſt honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of all appellations,—the Good.</p>
            <p>Happy in your PRINCE'S favour, my lord, and happy in the conſciouſneſs of your own integrity, you will go on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and to obtain the eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all men of ſcience, of virtue, and religion.

the whiſpers of malevolence, and the clamours of faction, ſhall never be heard: where envy, the unfailing ſhadow of merit, ſhall never be permitted to enter: and where—when that melancholy hour is come, which no might nor greatneſs in mortality can delay—that hour in which you, my lord, ſhall be loſt to your friends, to your country, to your king, your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument ſhall proclaim the glorious truth, that <q>You were a principal inſtrument in putting an end to a war, uncommonly wide and extenſive; and of reſtoring peace to an exhauſted and depopulated world.</q>

condition</hi> annexed to every mortal bleſſing. Hence ſprung all the miſtakes, and all the miſeries of the young, the lovely MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELLA; and all the piercing pangs, which tore her wretched parents' hearts.</p>
               <p>MISELLA was bleſt, by the great giver of all good gifts, with a frame peculiarly elegant and pleaſing. Softneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwelt in her countenance; the down of the ſwan was rivalled by her ſkin; her ſhape was faultleſs, her limbs were finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt beautiful ſymmetry, and her voice was muſical as the harmony of the lute. She was taught from the cradle to value this fine perſon; and her fond and overweening parents fed the ſoothing vanity with every food which their dotage could ſupply.<note n="*" place="bottom">The very means and the beſt method they could have taken, or the devil himſelf could have deviſed, to make their child a <hi>curſe</hi> to them, and bring down their grey hairs with ſorrow to the grave.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Her education was perfectly polite, adapted to ſet off the graces of her frame, little calculated to expand or improve the more valuable beauties of her mind. Her taſte for dreſs was remarkably elegant, her

manner of dancing particularly genteel: ſhe excelled much at cards, and few were happier in deviſing ſchemes, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging parties of pleaſure. As her voice was charming in itſelf, ſo was it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by art, and aided by the ſoft touches of the guittar, which ſhe handled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable grace; preferring it to all other inſtruments, as the attitude of playing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, is moſt advantageous for the diſplay of a fair lady's gentility.</p>
               <p>She very early gave her parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof of the miſtake they had made in her education, and of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs in neglecting to inculcate the principles of religious duty and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious virtue. For in her <hi>ſeventeeth</hi> year, ſhe married a young officer, of inferior rank, and no fortune, with the entire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of her parents; nay, and in direct contradiction to their commands. The gaiety of his dreſs, and the charms of his perſon, captivated her heart; and unaccuſtomed to reaſon and think, ſhe broke through every obligation to gratify her romantic paſſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Young women can never be too cautious reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the men they make choice of, as partners for life, for their future happineſs depends on it.

               <p>My reader will not be amazed if a life of this kind produced no ſmall difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their circumſtances.

               <p>The contraſt, perhaps, may ſtrike us; let us view it in BUBULA; whoſe funeral obſequies I ſaw lately performed, with all the pomp and vain parade of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious pride; yet though carried to the ſilent tomb, with all this farce of ſhew,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030356_0108_0FE5CF782AD0D0C0"/>
no eye dropt a tear, and no heart heaved a ſigh when BUBULO ceaſed to breathe.</p>
               <p>Full threeſcore years and ten had BU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BULO encumbered with his heavy load, this ſublunary world; and it would be difficult to point out any works of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or religion, any works of real worth or humanity, which diſtinguiſhed theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years. Fond of vile pelf, the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm continually toiled to add to his heap; and though rich, and daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in wealth, could never prevail upon himſelf to communicate of his riches to others, or to ſerve his neareſt relations. Yet ſmooth were his words, and fair were his promiſes; and who that knew him not, would have thought him any other than an univerſal friend to mankind?</p>
               <p>The hours which were not devoted to gain, were conſecrated to the ſervice of his nice and enormous appetite, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of fleſh, and drinking of wine. He was, in this reſpect, a perfect animal: and who that ſaw him at a city feaſt ever thought him of a ſuperior order? His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties were almoſt entirely abſorbed by this life of indulgence and gluttony: yet ſtupid as he appeared to be, he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſcoff at Religion, to deny even
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030356_0109_0FE5CF1FDB84CCC0"/>
the being, and to deſpiſe the revelation of God.—What a dreadful character! from ſuch ſlaves of the devil and heirs of hell good Lord deliver us.</p>
               <p>He found a <hi>female</hi> willing to ſubmit to the ſlavery of his dominion: ſhe brought him three children, and happily was ſoon freed from her captivity. The eldeſt ſon continued a kind of ſuperior ſervant to him, till his death, which he had long impatiently wiſhed for, and at length heard of with joy. The younger, of a more ſprightly diſpoſition, unbiaſſed by princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ruſhed headlong into the practice of all faſhionable vices, and being unaſſiſted by his father, committed ſome actions which obliged him to ſecure himſelf, by a voluntary baniſhment to the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> His daughter, though frequently aſked in marriage, could never prevail upon him to forward her happy ſettlement in life:— he could not ſpare a fortune for her; ſhe continued with him, therefore, in a ſtate of diſcontent, and added but little to his felicity by her filial duty, as he was ſo averſe to make any addition to her's by his parental regard. He ſaw his widowed <hi>ſiſter,</hi> with many little orphans, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a variety of difficulties; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded at length to undertake her affairs,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030356_0110_0FE5CED4030BF010"/>
embroiled them more and more; and in concluſion gave them up, becauſe his <hi>own</hi> buſineſs and concerns would not allow him ſufficient time to attend to them.</p>
               <p>A long and waſting illneſs warned him of eternity:—he would not receive the warning. He dreaded death, yet would not prepare to die. The jovial aſſociates at the tavern and the club, forſook and forgot him:—his ſervants attended on, but curſed him:—his children thought every day of his exiſtence too long:—the few dependants, which his money occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ceaſed to regard him, and paid their reſpects chiefly to his ſon. BUBULO obſerved it, and it grieved him to his very ſoul. He ſent for more and more phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; they wrote, ſhook their heads, and took their fees: all hope was gone. The miniſter of the pariſh was ſent for.—He found the almoſt lifeleſs wretch weeping, and lying along the ground; for he would be removed from his bed; but not having ſtrength to ſupport himſelf, he fell down, and in a few moments died.—Nobody wept, for nobody had cauſe to weep: the pride of the family gave him a pompous funeral,—and now he is forgotten!</p>
               <p>Think not, oh reader, the character of
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030356_0111_0FE5CF8CB30B4A90"/>
BUBULO exaggerated. He lived!—and alas, too much it is to be feared, there are many ſuch BUBULO'S living, whoſe example ſhould inſpire us with deteſtation of a <hi>life,</hi> which muſt certainly end in a <hi>death</hi> not leſs dreadful.</p>

AGRICOLA had ſagacity enough to diſcern this impropriety in the conduct of the <hi>man of God.</hi> His <hi>Rector's</hi> rare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in this village, and ready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of his tythes, gave him alſo no very favourable idea of religion.<note n="*" place="bottom">From ſuch worldly minded rectors and curates, Good Lord deliver us.</note> He
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030356_0119_0FE5CF2E79EDBA28"/>
He judged theſe men <hi>ſervants</hi> of the Lord for the wages of the world; and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all religion to be merely <hi>lucrative</hi> and <hi>earthly.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Alas! how many endeavour only to make a gain of godlineſs, and follow Jeſus, merely for the loaves and fiſhes.</note> He was deſirous to believe it ſuch; hence in the ale-houſe, at the markets, and in the little club of his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage-neighbours, he frequently delivered his ſentiments with freedom, when God and his <hi>prieſts</hi> were ſure to be treated with little or no reſpect.</p>
               <p>AGRICOLA continued his courſe of life for ſome years; only as his money encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo encreaſed his heart's attachment to it;<note n="†" place="bottom">It is frequently obſerved, and too often verefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more we have, the more we want.</note> and (as the world was fond to ſay) his regard to probity diminiſhed as his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions were multiplied. The widows and the poor complained of his rapacity and extortion; the fields ſpoke his covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for he encroached upon his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours' lands, and the ancient boundaries were rendered diſputable. The markets were ſaid to be foreſtalled, and his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance became the ſource of oppreſſion to
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030356_0120_0FE5CEAEAF5A3CF8"/>
the poorer farmer: he wiſhed to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and beheld with a malevolent eye, the flocks, the herds, and the crops of others —He grew ſurly, proud, and inſolent: vainly imagining that his wealth gave him an importance, and a right to tyrannize over his inferior neighbours.<note n="*" place="bottom">Wealth may naturally claim ſome degree of homage and reſpect from the ſons and daughters of poverty and indigence, but never ſhould (though it too often does) create in the poſſeſſors of it, pride, or ſelf-importance.</note> My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with him afforded me an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity often to remonſtrate: he ſometimes heard and promiſed fair, but he heard more frequently with impatience, and would have ſpoken his diſlike, if worldly motives had not compelled him to ſilence.</p>
               <p>Happy had it been for him if he had heard, regarded, and been wiſe. Happy for him if he had truſted leſs to that <hi>"hereafter,"</hi> which never came! For as laſt ſummer he attended his reapers in the field, ſuddenly the heavens grew black with clouds; the ſun withdrew his light; the air ſeemed to ſtagnate with intolerable fervor; the lightning flaſhed with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fury; vaſt peals of thunder burſt

                     <p>THIS comes from your ſincere friend, and one that has your beſt intereſt deeply

at heart. It comes on a deſign altogether important, and of no leſs conſequence than your everlaſting happineſs: ſo that it may juſtly challenge your careful regard. It is not to upbraid or reproach, much leſs to triumph and inſult over your miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct:—no, 'tis pure benevolence, 'tis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted good-will prompts me to write; ſo that I hope I ſhall not raiſe your reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. However, be the iſſue what it will, I cannot bear to ſee you walk in the paths which lead to death, without warning you of your danger, without ſounding in your ears the awful admonition, "Return and live:—For why will you die?" I beg of you to conſider whether you do or not, in ſome meaſure, reſemble thoſe unhappy children of ELI, whom, though they were famous in their generation, and men of renown, yet vengeance ſuffered not to live. For my part, I may ſafely uſe the expoſtulation of the old prieſt:—"Why do you ſuch things?" for I hear of your evil doings by all this people. Nay, my brother, for it is no good report I hear; you make the Lord's people to tranſgreſs." I have long obſerved and pitied you; and a moſt melancholy ſpectacle I lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, made me reſolve to caution you, leſt you alſo come into the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                        <pb n="119" facs="unknown:030356_0124_0FE5CEC1DB490028"/>I was not long ſince called to viſit a poor gentleman, ere while of the moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt body, and of the gayeſt temper I ever knew. But when I viſited him, oh how was the glory departed from him! I found him no more that ſprightly, and vivacious ſon of joy, which he uſed to be; but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, pining away, and withering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the chaſtiſing hand of God. His limbs feeble and trembling; his countenance forlorn and ghaſtly;<note n="*" place="bottom">PSALMS, cxxvii. 2.</note> and the little breath he had left, ſobbed out in ſorrowful ſighs! His body haſtening apace to the duſt, to lodge in the ſilent grave,—the land of darkneſs and deſolation. His ſoul juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God who gave it;<note n="†" place="bottom">ECCLESIASTES, xii. 7.</note> to enter upon an unchangeable and eternal ſtate.</p>
                     <p>When I was come into his chamber, and had ſeated himſelf on his bed, he firſt caſt a moſt wiſhful look upon me, and then began as well as he was able to ſpeak —"Oh that I had been wiſe, that I had known this, that I had conſidered my lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end! Ah! Mr. —, Death is knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my door: in a few hours more I

                     <p>When I mentioned, among many other things, that holy Religion which he had formerly ſo ſlightly eſteemed, he replied (with a haſty eagerneſs) "Oh that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the only thing I now long for.<note n="†" place="bottom">

Now my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted eyes are enlightened, I. clearly diſcern the things that are excellent.</p>
                     <p>What is there in the place whither I am going, but God? or what is there to be deſired on earth, but Religion?—But if this God ſhould reſtore you to health, ſaid I, think you that you ſhould alter your

                     <p>"Oh if the righteous judge would try me once more; if he would but reprieve and ſpare me a little longer—in what a ſpirit would I ſpend the remainder of my days? I would know no other buſineſs, aim at no other end, than perfecting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in holineſs. Whatever contributed to that, every means of grace; every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſpiritual improvement, ſhould be dearer to me than thouſands of gold and ſilver—But alas, why do I amuſe myſelf with fond imaginations? The beſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are now inſignificant, becauſe they are too late. The day in which I ſhould have worked is over and gone, and I ſee a ſad, horrible night approaching, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever. Heretofore, (woe is me!) when God called, I refuſed; when he invited, I was one of them that made excuſe.—Now, therefore, I receive the reward of my deeds; fearfulneſs and trembling are come

upon me: I ſmart, I am in ſore anguiſh already; and yet this is but the beginning of ſorrows!—It doth not yet appear what I ſhall be—but ſure I ſhall be ruined, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and deſtroyed with an everlaſting deſtruction!"</p>
                     <p>This ſad ſcene I ſaw with my eyes; theſe words, and many more equally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, I heard with my ears; and ſoon after attended the unhappy gentleman to his tomb. The almoſt breathleſs ſkeleton ſpoke in ſuch an accent, and with ſo much earneſtneſs, that I could not eaſily forget him or his words. And as I was muſing upon this ſorrowful ſubject, I remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. N—SH; I remembered, you, Sir— For I diſcerned too near an agreement and correſpondence between yourſelf and the deceaſed. "They are alike, ſaid I, in their ways, and what ſhall hinder them from being alike in their end? The courſe of their actions was equally full of ſin and folly, and why ſhould not the period of them be equally full of horror and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs? I am grievouſly afraid for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor, leſt as he lives the life, ſo he ſhould die the death of this wretched man, and his latter end ſhould be like his.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe, therefore, I take my

pen to adviſe—to admoniſh—nay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of you to repent while you have an opportunity, if haply you may find grace and forgiveneſs.

                     <p>But I muſt tell you, Sir, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt freedom, that your preſent behaviour is not the way to reconcile yourſelf to God. You are ſo far from making atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to offended juſtice, that you are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the future account, and heaping up an increaſe of wrath againſt the day of wrath. For what ſay the ſcriptures? thoſe books, which at the conſummation of all things, the ancient of days ſhall open, and by which you ſhall be judged—What ſay thoſe ſacred volumes? They teſtify and declare to every ſoul of man,—"That whoſo liveth in pleaſure, is dead while he liveth."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 TIMOTHY, v. 6.</note> So that while you roll on in a continued circle of ſenſual delights and vain entertainments, you are dead to all the purpoſes of piety and virtue.</p>

Would you be reſcued from the juſt vengeance of Almighty God? Would you be delivered from weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth? Sure you would! But you may be certain that will never be done by amuſements, which, at the beſt, are trifling and impertinent; and therefore if for no other reaſon, fooliſh and ſinful. 'Tis by ſeriouſneſs; 'tis by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement and ſelf-examination, you muſt accompliſh this great and deſirable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis good for every rational creature upon earth, frequently and ſeriouſly to aſk himſelf, what am I? what was I created for? and whither am I going?</note> You muſt not appear at the head of every ſilly diverſion, but enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your cloſet, and ſhut the door: and commune with your own heart, and ſearch out your own ſpirit. The pride of life, and all ſuperfluity of naughtineſs muſt be put away. You muſt make haſte, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay not the time to keep (and with all your might too) all God's holy commandments.

                     <p>If you do not by this method remedy in ſome degree the evils which you have ſent abroad, and prevent the miſchievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which may enſue,—wretched will you be, yea wretched to all eternity.

                              <p>The writer of theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to retain this letter, (which, however, he has taken the liberty to correct in a few places) not only out of reſpect to the <hi>Lady</hi> who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it, but becauſe it was publiſhed in the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Magazine,</hi> in the regular courſe of the <hi>Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> He finds it too in a life of Mr. NASH, lately publiſhed, and was therefore the rather inclined to retain it, as that biographer ſeems to think it too ſevere, and is inclined to palliate a life of utter diſſipation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which certainly merited the ſevereſt ſtrictures.</p>
                              <p>No man living can have a higher regard for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and humanity than the writer of theſe lines: but he thinks benevolence to the <hi>ſoul</hi> of a much higher nature than that of the body; and would be far from leading thoſe who are treading the inſidious paths of pleaſure with too eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, into deluſive and dangerous opinions, as if tenderneſs of heart, and acts of charity, could atone for every other deficiency. Diſſipated and fond of pleaſure as we are, little need is there to encourage men in ſo falſe a purſuit. It is hoped, therefore, that the writer of NASH'S life, (who he is, I know not,) in a future edition, would ſtrike out that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and hurtful paſſage, which every ſincere Chriſtian muſt diſapprove, wherein he aſſerts,— "That there was nothing criminal in his (NASH'S) conduct:—that he was a <hi>harmleſs</hi> creature, whoſe greateſt vice was <hi>vanity,</hi>—and that ſcarce a <hi>ſingle action</hi> of his life, except one, deſerves the <hi>aſperity</hi> of <hi>reproach.</hi>" And this is ſaid of a man, who, with a heart of exquiſite humanity, and which might have been moulded into the nobleſt form,—was yet, through life, a gameſter profeſt, and an encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of illegal gambling!—a follower of pleaſure all his days, and a perpetual diſſipater!—and whoſe converſation was made up of trifling, of falſhood, and of immorality!</p>
                              <p>In matters which concern the ſouls of men, let us be eſpecially careful; for fatal, indeed, may it be to betray them into wrong opinions. In other reſpects we will unite to applaud Mr. NASH, and will readily join his Panegyriſts;—we will be thankful to him for the improvements he has made at <hi>Bath,</hi> by his means the moſt elegant and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all public places; and we will be thankful to the editor of his life, for the amuſement and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction we have received from ſo well-wrote and entertaining a performance.</p>

               <p>Old age is honourable, and hath its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.—But might I preſume, Oh! thou Almighty and All-wiſe! ſhort-ſighted as I am, and incapable at the beſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh my real good from evil, might I preſume to judge, or to aſk any thing of thee reſpecting my future ſtate in this poor and periſhing world, I would humbly ſay, "Suffer me not to bear the load of life when every faculty is benumb'd, when every power of enjoyment is paſt; when oblivion darkens the memory, and all the ſenſes ſeem wearied and ſealed up; when the power of being uſeful to mankind is totally removed; nay, when the power of pleaſing is no more, and we become a burden even to our neareſt friends."</p>

Yet though thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, deſpiſed, forſaken, and forgotten; HASSAN loves the world; clings faſter to it, the more it ſhrinks from his embraces; deteſts the thoughts of death; and thinks and talks of nothing with ſatisfaction, but the deluſive mammon of unrighteouſneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">LUKE, xvi. 9.11.</note> Oh, what an old age is this!

The old man, looking boldly into the face of the villain, replied with an undaunted courage; "Nay, if I were killed by thee, I have lived long enough; but I tell thee, ſon, unleſs thou mend thy manners, thou wilt never live to ſee half my days."</note> and reſolution, the old man becomes a bleſſing to ſociety; we riſe up to him with reverence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice to do him honour.</p>

               <p>Uncertain as is the tenure of human life, this rule, one would conceive, ſhould be univerſally regarded. For how few, how very few of the myriads of mortals, who tread this earth, arrive at old age, or ſee the preſent boundary of human life, the "ſeventieth year!"<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalms, xc.10.</note> What numbers before that, are conſigned to a ſtate eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unalterable! alarming thought!— And canſt thou, oh reader, promiſe thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this length of days!

for it, ſince the call may come inſtantly? and then how terrible will be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences?</p>
               <p>But AGRICOLA'S fate was peculiar.— So thought his neighbour HAUSTULUS. He ſaw the ſinged corpſe of AGRICOLA borne from the field; ſhook his head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſtroke a judgment from heaven, and enlarged greatly on the demerits of the deceaſed:<note n="*" place="bottom">De mortuis nil niſi bonum, is the language of humanity and benevolence, founded on that well known proverb, humanum eſt errare.</note>—yet he forgot himſelf. HAUSTULUS was the pride of the village where he lived: young, healthful, robuſt: the maidens beheld him with pleaſure; the young men heard of his perfections with envy. A lively good-nature recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him univerſally; and relying on the ſtrength of his conſtitution, he was the firſt and laſt at every merriment, at every wake, at every ſcene of rural pleaſantry and joy.</p>

               <p>"Pray you that can; I never prayed, I cannot pray.—Nor need I. Is not Heaven on my ſide already? It cloſes with my conſcience. Its ſevereſt ſtrokes but ſecond my own."</p>
               <p>His friend being much touched, even to tears, at this (who could forbear? I could not) with a moſt affectionate look, he ſaid:</p>
               <p>"Keep thoſe tears for thyſelf. I have undone thee—Doſt weep for me? That's cruel. What can pain me more?—</p>
               <p>Here his friend, too much affected, would have left him.</p>
               <p>"No, ſtay, Thou ſtill mayeſt <hi>hope;</hi> therefore hear me: how madly have I talked? how madly haſt thou liſtened and believed? But look on my preſent ſtate,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030356_0148_0FE5CECD9A3D8F50"/>
as a full anſwer to thee, and to myſelf. This body is all weakneſs and pain; but my ſoul, as if ſtrung up by torment to greater ſtrength and ſpirit, is full powerful to reaſon; full mighty to ſuffer. And that, which thus triumphs within the jaws of mortality, is doubtleſs <hi>immortal.</hi>

               <p>I was about to congratulate this paſſive, involuntary confeſſor, on his aſſerting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature; when he thus very paſſionately exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"No, no! let me ſpeak on. I have not long to ſpeak—My much-injured friend! my ſoul as my body lies in ruins; in ſcattered fragments of broken thought. Remorſe for the paſt throws my thoughts on the future. Worſe dread of the future ſtrikes it back on the paſt; I turn and turn, and find no ray. Didſt thou feel half the mountain that is upon me, thou wouldſt ſtruggle with the martyr for his ſtake, and bleſs heaven for the flame; this is not an

everlaſting flame, nor that an unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire."</p>
               <p>How were we ſtruck?—yet ſoon after, ſtill more. With what an eye of diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with what a face of deſpair, he cried out—</p>
               <p>"My principles have poiſoned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy; my unkindneſs has murdered my wife! And is there another hell?— Oh! thou blaſphemed, yet moſt indulgent Lord God! Hell itſelf is a refuge, if it hides me from thy frown."</p>
               <p>Soon after, his underſtanding failed. His terrified imagination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or even forgot. And ere the ſun (which I hope has ſeen few like him) aroſe, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, accompliſhed and moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ALTAMONT expired.<note n="*" place="bottom">Let the young, wealthy, gay, and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate votaries of pleaſure and diſſipation, learn from the latter moments of the wretched Altamont, (who is ſuppoſed by ſome to intend the late Lord Bolingbroke) the folly of living unmindful of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death, and be convince of the truth of that common proverb, <hi>they who ſwim in ſin, ſhall ſink in ſorrow.</hi>

               <p>If we look to <hi>this</hi> world only, how ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior are the advantages which the great and wealthy enjoy, how infinitely ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to thoſe which the poor and mean poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs?

Poverty denies to men the enjoyment of almoſt every thing which the wealthy call convenient and comfortable; much more of what they call elegant and pleaſurable.

                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:030356_0190_0FE5CECEF712A9D0"/>But a funeral, at which I was called lately to officiate, leads me to poſtpone theſe reflections to a following chapter; that I may pay ſome tribute to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of an humble man, whoſe virtues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be had in honour, though his low ſtation denies him the loud applauſe of public celebrity. But why ſhould fame be the prerogative of greatneſs; of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greatneſs and external ſplendor?—To do well, and to deſerve in every ſtation, is to be great, and ought to obtain praiſe —and will obtain praiſe!—Yes, ye ſons of obſcurity, whom no titles dignify,— whom no pedigrees ennoble,—but whoſe virtuous actions are more illuſtrious than either—yes, ye ſhall inherit praiſe, as much ſuperior to that which men, the world, and time can give,—as God, as heaven, and eternity are ſuperior to all theſe.</p>
               <p>This bright and bleſſed honour is not conferred according to rank, birth, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030356_0191_0FE5CEDCEDEFEB10"/>
but to high and low, rich and poor, the glorious price is held forth alike, and to him who doeth beſt, ſhall the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence be given.<note n="*" place="bottom">GENESIS iv. 7. ROMANS, ii. 6, 7.</note>—Yet one ſure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to obtain this bleſſing in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where all diſtinctions eternally ceaſe, is to act and live agreeably to thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions and ſubordinations, which God hath wiſely appointed upon earth: I mean the ſure method to obtain God's favour, is to acquieſce thankfully in that ſtation of life, wherein he hath placed us; and with entire ſubmiſſion, to diſcharge faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and uniformly all the duties of it.<note n="†" place="bottom">REVELALIONS, ii. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So thought the worthy man, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent funeral was lately ſolemnized. He had been ſervant in a neighbouring family above twenty years; and during that time had abundantly approved himſelf by the ſtricteſt fidelity. A rare example, when the depravity of this order amongſt us, is the ſubject of univerſal complaint, and the ſevereſt tax upon the domeſtic felicity of numbers! Though perhaps the cauſe and the remedy of the evil are both to be drawn
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030356_0192_0FE5CEB6567F2BA8"/>

               <p>PETRUCIO, (ſo call we the ſubject of our preſent chapter) was happy in this reſpect; happy in a maſter, whoſe own life was regular, and whoſe great care was to diſcharge every duty, which he owed, particularly to his ſervants. He was well recompenſed by the love and fidelity of his ſervants in general, but of PETRUCIO in particular. This faithful domeſtic had right notions of God, himſelf, and his duty. He murmured not at the inferiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſervility of his own condition: he knew it was the will of God; as ſuch he received it with thankfulneſs, and lived in it with chearful content: conſidering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the ſervant of Chriſt, he acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly,

                     <bibl>GENESIS, xvi. 13.</bibl>
                  </note> and thought it a poor excuſe for himſelf, if he could eſcape the notice of an earthly obſerver, while all his actions were minutely ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, who ſearches the inmoſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the heart. Hence he ſerved not "as a man-pleaſer, but as the ſervant of God, in ſingleneſs of heart as unto Chriſt; not with eye-ſervice, but as the ſervant of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart;" all his ſervice was done with a good will, not with a moroſe reſtraint or ſourneſs,—<hi>as to the Lord and not to man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>—for he knew, and ever bore in mind that comfortable truth, "That whatſoever good thing any man doeth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."<note n="§" place="bottom">EPHES. vi. 5, &amp;c.</note>

                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:030356_0194_0FE5CEA459BC45A8"/>In conſequence of theſe right principles, PETRUCIO ever eſteemed his maſter's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as eſſentially connected with his own: and would as ſoon have ſuffered the extremeſt puniſhment, as to have joined in any colluſion to defraud, much more to have himſelf defrauded his maſter. It was his conſtant endeavour to preſerve the ſtricteſt oeconomy in every part of his truſt, and he would expreſs the higheſt wonder and deepeſt abhorrence at many of thoſe infamous arts, which modern po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite ſervants would frequently adviſe him to practiſe, and to which tradeſmen, for the baſeſt ends, would often attempt to allure him.</p>
               <p>"Though I am in a ſtate of ſervitude upon earth, he would often ſay, I hope to be in a ſtate of freedom with God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: but how can I hope for this, if I am deficient in thoſe eaſy duties, which are required in my preſent ſtation? For ſurely, when all the neceſſaries of life are found me, it is eaſy to be juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, honeſt and induſtrious—nay, gratitude itſelf alone ſhould lead to this, for his ſake, who provides ſo well for me; and who requires certainly that I ſhould repay all his expence, with every worthy and

               </p>
               <p>We may well believe that a ſervant with ſuch notions, muſt be uniform and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in his whole conduct. And ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was PETRUCIO. He received every order with ſilence and humility: he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted every order with diligence and punctuality. He pretended not to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than his directors; and he was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the odious malapertneſs, which is one of the diſtinguiſhing qualifications of contemptible modern <hi>valets.</hi> His long continuance in the family, had wrought in his breaſt a tender affection, not only for his maſter and miſtreſs, but alſo for their children and relations: and at length their intereſt was become ſo peculiarly his own, that he ſhared in all their joys, and partook of all their ſorrows.</p>
               <p>The fruits of his fidelity were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and eſteem of his maſter and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; the affection of the family; the reverence of his fellow-ſervants; and a comfortable ſaving, on which he propoſed
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030356_0196_0FE5CED5ECF66810"/>
to live, if ever he ſhould have cauſe to quit the ſervice; and which, dying in it, he had the pleaſure to bequeath to a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-ſiſter and, her children, whom it reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from many difficulties, and placed in a happy ſituation, above dependence and neceſſity.</p>
               <p>During the time of his laſt ſickneſs, he frequently declared that the tenderneſs and regard of his maſter and miſtreſs to him, more than overbalanced the merit of all his former ſervices, and were an abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant recompence to him. For PETRUCIO had a generous mind, and was ſenſible of affectionate treatment.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gratitude is commendable and praiſe-worthy in all; from the poor and needy to the wealthy and benevolent, as well as from every rational creature under heaven, to their great Creator, Benefactor, and Preſerver, who giveth to all liberally and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not.</note> His maſter every day viſited his ſick room, and read and prayed by his bed-ſide: his miſtreſs with her own hands adminiſtered his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and took care to ſupply him with the moſt proper nouriſhment. His humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity alone could equal his gratitude and thankfulneſs on ſuch occaſions; and when upon his expreſſing his great obligations

his miſtreſs once ſaid, that "this, and much more than this, was due for his faithful ſervices." "And that word, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid the honeſt fellow, with tears in his eyes, that word is a reward ſufficient for more than twenty times ſuch ſervices as mine."</p>
               <p>Thus died this uſeful worthy man: and to do all honour to him, his maſter buried him at his own expence, with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and propriety conceivable:—ſix neighbouring farmers, tenants to his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bore his pall; his maſter and miſtreſs walked as chief mourners; the reſt of the family attended in proceſſion, and had mourning given them on the occaſion; and ſo great was the eſteem in which this faithful ſervant was held, (who I ſhould have obſerved was the willing and joyful hand by which his maſter and miſtreſs diſtributed their liberal charities)—that ſcarce a dry eye was ſeen at his funeral: and his death and funeral, I perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, have done more to reform the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in that part of the world, than twenty lectures to them could have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved. "See how PETRUCHIO, though a ſervant, is honoured and reſpected!"— was the general cry: and the general rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given on all hands was, "Becauſe he was faithful, honeſt, and induſtrious."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:030356_0198_0FE5CEE29CAB2838"/>And let ſervants, in concluſion, be told, that if they would obtain ſuch favour here, and ſuch recompence as PETRUCIO doubtleſs hath obtained, their only method is to go and do likewiſe; is to imitate his example; is to make their maſter's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt their own. The beſt motive upon which they can do this, is to conſider, that in ſo doing they ſerve the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and may be aſſured, that, according to their fidelity, ſo ſhall they reap hereafter. For God is no reſpecter of perſons.<note n="*" place="bottom">ACTS, x. 34.</note>

               <p>⁂ I ſubjoin to this chapter the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excellent <hi>rules,</hi> which were ſent by an unknown hand, entirely agreeing with the gentleman who ſent them,—"That if they were hung up in all kitchens and ſervant's halls, (printed on a large ſheet) they would be extremely uſeful."</p>
