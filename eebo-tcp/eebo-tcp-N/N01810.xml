            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN Mens <hi>Defaming</hi> their Neighbours (Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as have deſerved better uſage,) there is no Little Evil. Not only does our Saviour CHRIST inſtruct us <hi>to do as we would be done by,</hi> but the moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher among the Gentiles, by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Says, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceris.</hi> Nevertheleſs, as Great an Evil as it is, many are guilty of it: And many of the Best and moſt Serviceable Men in the World, have been Expoſed unto it. The Holy Prophets <hi>heard the Defaming of many.</hi> The Apoſtles of our Lord <hi>JESUS CHRIST, being Defamed,</hi> yet Bleſſed thoſe that were moſt Abuſive to them. Nor was there ever any Man in the World mere <hi>Defamed,</hi> than He that has been
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002143_0004_0FBC22BAF930EE20"/>the <hi>SAVIOUR</hi> of it; who has taught His Diſciples to <hi>Forgive their Enemies,</hi> to <hi>Bleſs thoſe that Curſe them,</hi> and to <hi>Do Good unto thoſe that Hate them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ESSAY</hi> now to be offered unto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was Printed at <hi>London</hi> Nine Years ago. But I never ſaw it until within theſe few Days; nor liſt I to Enquire after the Author. I find in it not only <hi>Erudition</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> but that which is a thouſand times better, a Goſpel Spirit of Real Piety: And that the Author (whoever he be) is a Perſon of Great Reading and Acquaintance with Learned Writers; and has made his Knowledge ſubſervient unto his Religion. I have therefore adviſed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing of it in <hi>Boſton;</hi> Hoping that GOD will bleſs it, both for the <hi>Conviction</hi> of them who are concerned as <hi>Tranſgreſſors,</hi> and for the <hi>Confolation</hi> of them who may be concerned as <hi>Sufferers,</hi> by <hi>Defamations.</hi>

I would ye ſhould underſtand, Brethren, that the Things which happen'd to me, have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Goſpel. <hi>But then, if we are at any time Exerciſed with Injurious</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations, <hi>why ſhould not this</hi> Temptation <hi>and</hi> Affliction <hi>be improved as well as the Reſt, and the</hi> Church <hi>of Chriſt, wherein the CASE occurs to</hi> all that will live Godlily, <hi>be Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>It is a Pleaſant Criticiſm of</hi> Cocceius, <hi>that the Church is Compared unto a</hi> Garden of Nutts; <hi>partly becauſe Good Men muſt, like</hi> Nutts, <hi>be well</hi> knock'd <hi>and</hi> broken, <hi>before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can get that</hi> Good <hi>which is to be gotten out of them. If the Reader get any</hi> Good, <hi>by an</hi> ESSAY <hi>now put into his Hands, let him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Faithfulneſs of the Glorious LORD, who Order'd a Servant of his, to be</hi> knock'd <hi>with ſome Calumnies and Reproaches; which awakened him, (inſtead of</hi> Anſwering <hi>and</hi> Confuting <hi>them, as 'tis Eaſy for him to do.) to ſet himſelf upon</hi> Strengthening his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <hi>with a Diſcourſe on a CASE, wherein very many are concerned. It muſt be confeſs'd that he had alſo in this</hi> ESSAY, <hi>a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eye to</hi> Another <hi>Servant of God, whoſe</hi> Watchfulneſs <hi>and</hi> Faithfulneſs <hi>and</hi> Induſtry, <hi>had not Excuſed him from</hi> unkind uſage <hi>(which every wiſe Man looks for) in an</hi> Evil World. Plutarch <hi>wrote a Treatiſe,</hi> De Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pienda ab hoſtibus utilitate; <hi>how</hi> to Profit by ones Enemies. <hi>But</hi> Plutarch <hi>was a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſuch Maxims as this</hi> ESSAY <hi>is Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of.

Make your <hi>Defamations</hi> a provocation unto you, to humble your ſelf deeply before God for the <hi>ſecret Sin,</hi> which by leaving you to be <hi>defamed,</hi> you may ſee, <hi>he ſets in the light of his Face.</hi> Under the Law of Ceremonies, if he that had an <hi>Iſſue</hi> did <hi>ſpit</hi> upon another, the Perſon <hi>ſpat</hi> upon was thereby <hi>defiled:</hi> Sir, if an <hi>unclean Wretch</hi> have <hi>ſpit</hi> upon you, it becomes you to enquire, Whether you have not upon you ſome <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement</hi> that is to be waſhed off, and make a new flight to that which will <hi>cleanſe from all Sin.</hi> Perhaps you are at a loſs, <hi>What may be your more ſpecial Sins which are ſcourged by God, in the Reproaches which are caſt upon you.</hi> My Friend, It were a very proper thing for you, upon the firſt blowing up of any <hi>Storm</hi> of Obloquies, preſently to fall down before the Lord with this Petition; <hi>Lord, Shew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me.</hi> And then go on with an impartial <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> a Self-judging, a Self-loathing <hi>inquiry. Niſi eſſent peecata, non eſſent flagella.</hi> I am ſure there will need no long Divination, to bring you unto this one ſenſible ſtroke of Repentance; <hi>Lord, I have not Honour'd thy Name as I ought to have done, and therefore
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002143_0022_0FBC22DA60A237B0"/>thou art Righteous in all the diſhonour that my Name labours under.</hi> Had we been more concerned for the <hi>Name</hi> of God, who can tell, but He would have been more concerned for <hi>ours?</hi> When you go on, it may be you will find, that you have not always been ſo tender of your Neighbours <hi>good Name,</hi> as you ſhould have been, or ſo <hi>cautious</hi> of making right, fair, <hi>exact Repreſentations,</hi> when he has been ſpoken of. At leaſt, when you have heard a Neighbour with too much <hi>Truth,</hi> ill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, there has not been that <hi>grief</hi> in you, and that <hi>Leve which rejoyces not in Iniquity,</hi> as there ſhould have been. The Injuries done to your <hi>Name,</hi> are it may be to <hi>Chaſten</hi> you, for this too common miſcarriage. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold therefore the Goodneſs &amp; Severity of God! Severity,</hi> in his not leaving ſuch a moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fault without <hi>Chaſtening.</hi> But <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>you are Chaſtened of the Lord, that you ſhould not be condemned with the World,</hi> and in another World. Or, 'tis poſſible you may have treated ſome very impious and vicious Perſons with too much of <hi>Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance</hi> and <hi>Complement;</hi> tho' your deſign might be nothing under Heaven, but only to win upon them, that you might do them <hi>Good,</hi> and make them <hi>Good,</hi> and bring them to do <hi>Good;</hi> yet you may have indiſcreetly ſorgotten the <hi>laſt</hi> of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> God may therefore correct this indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002143_0023_0FBC22DB626EA2E0"/>of yours, by making <hi>ſuch Perſons</hi> to be the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of bringing very great <hi>Reproaches</hi> upon you. Briefly, Carry on the Scrutiny with all the accuracy imaginable, to diſcover the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God in your moſt <hi>unrighteous Deſamations.</hi> Upon the diſcovery, <hi>Repent</hi> of what has been amiſs; abhor it; bewail it; weep to the Lord, that for the ſake of that <hi>Blood,</hi> which <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from all Sin,</hi> you may have the Pardon of it. Oh! happy <hi>Reproaches</hi> which quicken us in the great work of <hi>Repentance!</hi> Be <hi>as meek as a Lamb,</hi> under the Injuries that are done you; let the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God, ſhining therein, make you ſo. But fly to the <hi>Lamb of God:</hi> And verily when you have converſed with the <hi>Bleed of the Lamb,</hi> you will have <hi>white Robes</hi> upon you: <hi>White Robes,</hi> I ſay; You may deſy <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter them.</p>
            <p>That which makes me the more to urge a great regard unto the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God in your <hi>Defamations,</hi> is this; Even <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that come upon us for the <hi>Cauſe of</hi> GOD, yet oftentimes carry <hi>Caſtigations</hi> in them. Rarely do there come any violent <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions</hi> on the Churches of the Lord, until they have by their <hi>Formality,</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> and <hi>abounding Iniquity,</hi> ripened themſelves for ſuch Calamities. Old <hi>Cyprian</hi> will tell you ſo. The <hi>French Reſugees</hi> at this day,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002143_0024_0FBC22DCDD87B910"/>may tell you ſo. And yet <hi>Perſecutions</hi> do at laſt prove <hi>Priviledges</hi> to the People of God. Thus particular Servants of the Lord may be <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> becauſe Heaven has a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for them; they may be the <hi>Favourites</hi> of Heaven. Yet, Oh the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of our God! The <hi>ſorrows</hi> brought on them in their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions,</hi> may be alſo to bring them unto <hi>Repentance</hi> for ſome <hi>Errors</hi> which they have been guilty of. The moſt excellent, but <hi>Reproached</hi> Confeſſors of Chriſt, bearing the <hi>Reproach of Chriſt,</hi> may yet alſo bear, at the very ſame time, a <hi>Rebuke for Sin.</hi> When the admirable <hi>Paul</hi> underwent <hi>ſtoning,</hi> he was honoured in it; adorned by it; vaſtly enriched; every <hi>Stone</hi> thrown at him was, to him as good as a <hi>Pearl.</hi> Some think, that while he lay in a <hi>Swoon</hi> under thoſe Outrages of his Enemies; <hi>Now</hi> was the time that he was <hi>caught up,</hi> and had one of his Raptures, either that into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> or that into the <hi>Third Heaven.</hi> Yet, no doubt, this Martyr of the Lord, when he came to himſelf, ſoon made this reflection; <hi>Lord, When the Blood of thy Martyr</hi> Stephen <hi>was ſhed, I was alſo ſtanding by.</hi> The ſhare he had in <hi>ſtoning</hi> the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> was now to be again <hi>repented</hi> of. And ſo was the <hi>Burning</hi> of the Martyr <hi>Lambart,</hi> when that good Man the Martyr <hi>Cranmer</hi> was going into the Fire. <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002143_0025_0FBC22DE5F8E00C0"/>Lord give you Underſtanding.</hi> For I may now put you in mind, that by being brought thus to ſee the <hi>Divine Righteouſneſs,</hi> you will come to a moſt Experimental ſight of the <hi>Divine Faithfulneſs</hi> in what has befallen you. One that had been very much <hi>Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> could ſay, Gen. 50.20. <hi>God meant it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good.</hi> If you get ſo much good by your <hi>Deſamations,</hi> as to diſcern the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God in them, and obtain, what is <hi>Ill</hi> in you, to be <hi>forgiven</hi> and <hi>amended,</hi> it is plain, <hi>God has meant it unto good.</hi> You may go on with Praiſes, with Wonders, and ſay, <hi>Lord, In Faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted me!</hi> It will moſt certainly be ſo, if you now ſet your ſelves to improve in <hi>Piety,</hi> by means of the <hi>Defamations,</hi> which are by the Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hurled at you. O Man of God, You may be awakened unto the <hi>doing</hi> of much <hi>good,</hi> by being <hi>evil ſpoken of.</hi> We ſay very truly, <hi>Malice is a good Inſormer, tho' it be a had Judge.</hi> You may by <hi>malicious Deſama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> be <hi>Informed</hi> of thoſe Points in your Conduct, which may need a better guard upon them. You may be being <hi>Reproached,</hi> be adviſed of thoſe things, which ought to be <hi>Reformed.</hi> It contributed mightily to the advancement of <hi>Temperance</hi> in the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Monica,</hi> that one reproachfully called her a <hi>Wine Bibber.</hi> It would be wiſely done of you, under <hi>Defamations,</hi> to <hi>ſearch and try
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002143_0026_0FBC22E0DBCDA148"/>your ways.</hi> Particularly whether, tho' what your <hi>Enemies</hi> have ſaid of you, be <hi>falſe,</hi> yet the holy Eyes of God have not ſeen in you ſome <hi>Fault akin</hi> to that which has been charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you. If you find it ſo, Oh! <hi>mourn</hi> for it, and <hi>turn</hi> to God. This is the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> of Heaven, in the <hi>bad Language</hi> of the <hi>evil Tongue,</hi> in the <hi>Fire</hi> ſpit at you by a <hi>Tongue ſet on Fire by Hell.</hi> At leaſt, you may find this, that you ſhould grow more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in thoſe <hi>Graces,</hi> and in thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> which are moſt contrary to the <hi>Charges</hi> of your Enemies upon you. They, 'tis true, <hi>abuſe</hi> you, and yet at the ſame time they <hi>exhort</hi> you, they <hi>excite</hi> you. God by them calls upon you; <hi>My Child, You are not yet come to a due Eminency in thoſe good things, which are juſt contrary, moſt contrary to the ill things, that are ſpoken of you. Oh! be quickened unto an eminency in all goodneſs, by the Evil ſpoken of you.</hi> A Great Man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf much obliged unto the Chief Men of <hi>Athens,</hi> That by their <hi>Abuſes</hi> they taught him how to Speak and how to Live, better than he ſhould have done without ſuch Monitors. Perhaps you may have <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> who being ſenſible that you have ſome <hi>Friends</hi> who think well of you, are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy at it, and ſo reſolved upon rendering you unſerviceable, that they will make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous <hi>Inſinuations</hi> of your being an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,:</hi>

            <p>Let me beſeech you, after this, to maintain
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002143_0032_0FBC22ED5C44C930"/>moſt exact <hi>watch,</hi> a moſt ſevere <hi>guard,</hi> upon your ſelf, leaſt while the <hi>Waters of ſtrife</hi> are broaching, your <hi>provoked Spirit</hi> may at any time <hi>ſpeak unadviſedly with your Lips.</hi> The <hi>meekeſt</hi> Man in the World, you know did ſo; and you know <hi>it went ill</hi> with that Good Man for doing ſo. My Friend, Your Calumnious Adverſaries furniſh you with valuable Opportunities, to <hi>adorn the Doctrine of God your Saviour,</hi> and to do ſuch things as are done by none but thoſe that may <hi>lay hold</hi> on the Comforts of <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> The Bleſſed <hi>Eliot</hi>'s Three Words, <hi>Bear, Forbear, Forgive:</hi> Now, now is the time for them to come into exerciſe. All tendencies to <hi>Revenge</hi> upon your <hi>Enemies,</hi> the <hi>Wrongs</hi> which they have done you, muſt now be abhor'd, be ſuppreſs'd; muſt be look'd upon as <hi>worſe things</hi> than the worſt of your <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> 'Tis probable, they may be ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as may deſerve to have <hi>much Evil</hi> ſpoken of them. However, 'tis now decent for <hi>you</hi> to be more <hi>ſparing</hi> in ſpeaking of it, than you would have been, if you had ſuffered nothing from them. Leave that <hi>juſt Work</hi> to others; there is hazard leaſt you <hi>over-do,</hi> or leaſt ſome <hi>revengeful glance</hi> of your own do work in it, if you go to meddle with it.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, If you know any <hi>Good</hi> of thoſe that have <hi>ſpoke ill</hi> of you, be you not averſe to <hi>ſpeak</hi> that Good, and not ill
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002143_0033_0FBC22EE28C9F888"/>pleaſed if you hear it <hi>ſpoken</hi> by others. How famous, how precious is the Name of <hi>Calvin,</hi> for the Anſwer which he gave, when he was told, that the angry <hi>Luther</hi> put ſome hard Names upon him! An anſwer ſo recited, ſo eſteemed, by all the World, that there is no need now of my telling any of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours what it was. But be ſure that your Heart ſtand always in awe of that Word; Prov. 20.22. <hi>Say not thou, I will recompence Evil:</hi> And, Rom. 12.17. <hi>Recompence to no Man Evil for Evil. Athenagoras,</hi> I remember gives this deſcription of the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: <hi>'Tis counted an indefferent thing, for a Man to revile another, by whom he has been firſt reviled. But we Chriſtians, do ſpeak as well as ever we can of them that ſpeak nothing but Evil of us.</hi> And <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> bears this <hi>juſt Witneſs</hi> for them; <hi>We don't ask, that they who have most accuſed us, and abuſed us, and falſely ſpoken all Evil of us, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for it; no, 'tis puniſhment enough to be left unto ſuch Folly &amp; Raſhneſs.</hi> Oh! Do not look upon this <hi>generous Patience,</hi> as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, or a leſſon only for the <hi>Elohim, whoſe Dwelling is not with Fleſh!</hi> Rather look upon it as an <hi>Unmanly weakneſs,</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear the <hi>ill Words</hi> of other Men. It is a pretty Remark; when <hi>Abiſhai</hi> could not bear the railing Tongue of <hi>Shimei;</hi> ſays <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> unto him, <hi>What have I to do with you, ye
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002143_0034_0FBC22EF9E89CB78"/>Sons of Zeruiah?</hi> Now <hi>Zeruiah</hi> was their Mother. Why, <hi>the Sons of Zeruiah?</hi> He ſeems to intimate, You have more of your <hi>Mother</hi> than of your <hi>Father</hi> in you; you talk as if you were of the <hi>weaker Sex;</hi> if you had the Souls of <hi>Men</hi> in you, a few <hi>ill Words</hi> would not be ſuch an intolerable grievance with you.</p>
            <p>If you will hearken to me, you ſhall take <hi>little notice</hi> of the <hi>Affronts</hi> that are offered you: For the moſt part they are not worth your <hi>Notice.</hi> When the famous Doctor <hi>Sands</hi> was ignominiouſly carried on a lame Jade through the City of <hi>London,</hi> a baſe Woman in ſcorn threw a Stone at him, and hit him full on the Breaſt; he took no other <hi>notice</hi> of it, but only made this mild Anſwer, <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I pray God forgive thee!</hi> This was <hi>notice</hi> enough. Commend me to the ſweet ſpirited <hi>Melancthon. Oſiander,</hi> an hot Man, had preached againſt <hi>Vitus Theodorus.

I muſt ſet before you the Heavenly Counſel &amp; Command of our Saviour, Math. 5.44. <hi>Pray for them which uſe you deſpitefully.</hi> You muſt give me leave to preſs this with a very great importunity upon you; that whenever you underſtand that any Perſon has <hi>injuriouſly defamed</hi> you,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002143_0040_0FBC22FAE5F72590"/>and <hi>abuſed</hi> you, you make this very thing an <hi>occaſion</hi> for you, to <hi>pray</hi> for that Perſon; <hi>Pray</hi> for him now by <hi>Name,</hi> if you never did ſo before; before you go to reſt that Night, mention the very <hi>Name</hi> of that Perſon before the Lord, and <hi>let this Prayer be made without Lips of Deceit: Lord! Pardon that Perſon, and Bleſs him, and make him wiſe and good, and do him good!</hi> Be not able to reſt until you have done ſo. When you have done <hi>this,</hi> Oh! the Peace, Oh! the Joy, which may now fill your Mind, in the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of your own <hi>Pardon</hi> from the Lord! The <hi>comforting Spirit</hi> of God, in the <hi>Grace</hi> now exerciſed by you, <hi>ſeals</hi> your <hi>Pardon.</hi> Receive his <hi>Teſtimony, Child be of good cheer, Thy Sins are forgiven thee!</hi> A bleſſing worth a Thouſand Worlds: I am importunate with you to <hi>aſſure</hi> it in this <hi>excellent way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon ſuch a Text as that; Pſal. 92.11. <hi>Mine Eye ſhall ſee my Deſire on my Enemies; mine Ears ſhall hear my Deſire of the Wicked that riſe up againſt me:</hi> I have heard one ſay, It gave ſome ſhock to his Thoughts; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd him to behold none but the great <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> ſpeaking: When it came to be ſung in the Aſſemblies of <hi>Zion,</hi> the Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly awakened in him were, <hi>Lord, My Deſire is, that my Enemies may be pardoned, and come to have a ſhare with me in the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Goodneſs.</hi> This truly were to <hi>ſing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002143_0041_0FBC22FC5EC67AA0"/>with melody in the Heart unto the Lord.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I conſulred the Original: I found, that this Word, <hi>my Deſire,</hi> is not in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: I wiſhed that ſome other <hi>Word of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> might be brought into the Tranſlation, inſtead of <hi>my Deſire:</hi> Why may we not Read, <hi>What God ſhall do,</hi> or, <hi>what ſhall be done?</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>Darby,</hi> in his verſion of Pſalms, when that Clauſe comes, Pſal. 54.7. <hi>Mine Eye hath ſeen its Deſire on my Enemies;</hi> turns it ſo, <hi>Thou mak'st my Focs to fall before mine Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One ſays very truly, <hi>'Tis an eaſy thing to forgive Injuries, when God has changed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of them, and turn'd them into Bleſſings.</hi> I hope, you have got ſo much good by your <hi>Defamations,</hi> that you can <hi>bleſs God</hi> for them; then it will be no hard thing for you to wiſh a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> on the Author of them.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall your <hi>Generoſity</hi> ſtop here. It is a part of the <hi>gracious Yoke</hi> which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has laid upon us; Math. 5.44. <hi>Do good unto them that hate you.</hi> I think you ſhould <hi>watch</hi> the next opportunity after an Injury, and particularly after an injurious <hi>Defamation,</hi> to do ſome kindneſs unto the Perſon that has Injured you; <hi>Do ſomething wherein he may be the better for you.</hi> It was an ancient Maxim <hi>Diſce diligere Inimicum, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis cavere Inimicum.</hi> Sir, <hi>Love</hi> your <hi>Enemies,</hi> and you will bravely <hi>arm</hi> your ſelf againſt

Your <hi>Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may ſo manage the Circumſtances of your Action, that the Man ſhall not be <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Sin</hi> by what you do. It may be ſo managed, that you may find the ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that Word, Rom. 12.20. <hi>If thine Enemy hunger, feed him; if be thirſt give him Drink: For in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap Coals of Fire on his head.</hi> That is to ſay; thou ſhall <hi>melt</hi> him; effectually and throughly <hi>melt</hi> him. The Expreſſion may ſeem to carry ſome <hi>Damage</hi> in it, but the <hi>Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> has not been commonly underſtood; it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes unto them who are concerned with the <hi>melting</hi> of <hi>Metals;</hi> the <hi>Metals</hi> which will not be <hi>melted</hi> by <hi>Fire</hi> put under them, are <hi>melted</hi> when <hi>Coals of Fire</hi> are <hi>beaped</hi> upon them; are laid over the <hi>Crucible.</hi> It may be by ſuch a <hi>good Conduct</hi> of yours, you may <hi>overcome Evil with Good.</hi> You may bring your Adverſaries to ſuch a <hi>Renorſe,</hi> that they ſhall bear this glorious Teſtimony for you; <hi>He is a good Man.</hi> Whether this be done or no, it is moſt certain you will, by ſuch a <hi>Conduct</hi> exceedingly <hi>gloriſy God:</hi> Your
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002143_0043_0FBC22FF5E23E1A0"/>concern for ſuch a <hi>Conduct,</hi> will exceedingly diſcover the <hi>Love of God</hi> flaming in your Soul: The Conſolations of that <hi>Love</hi> will be wonderful! be wonderful!</p>
            <p>I will now obſerve to you this one thing more. There are none that have ſo much occaſion to endeavour a <hi>good carriage</hi> under <hi>Deſamations,</hi> as a faithful MINISTER of the Goſpel. Upon that Clauſe in the Fifth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the <hi>Lord's Prayer, Forgive us, as we Forgive;</hi> ſays <hi>Luther, Mirabilis eſthaec additio!</hi> The like Appendix might have been added unto the other Petitions; as before this, <hi>Give us this Day our daily Bread, as we diſpenſe daily Bread unto thoſe who are about us;</hi> and after this, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation, as we are loth to lead others into Temptation.</hi> Indeed we ſhould look upon our ſelves as being ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged. But then our Saviour intimates unto us; that on our <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbour, will depend all the other good Operations which are thus to be purſued. It is a World full of ſuch Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that except we can <hi>forgive,</hi> we ſhall do very little <hi>good</hi> unto our Neighbours. But it is a Remark, as I remember, of a <hi>French</hi> Writer, that in this <hi>Platform of Prayer,</hi> the condition of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> is peculiarly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated. I will not go thro' all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; 'tis enough to Note, The ungodly part of Mankind will multiply <hi>Injuries</hi> upon
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002143_0044_0FBC230373B6A9A8"/>every <hi>Faithful Miniſter.</hi> His fulfilment of his Miniſtry, will expoſe him to the Envy and Malice of many People, and a Thouſand Injuries. For ſuch in a peculiar manner, is this Petition calculated; <hi>Forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the happy <hi>Rule</hi> of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> which I have ſomewhere found recited in theſe Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is a <hi>Rule</hi> with me, rather to ſuffer and bury in ſilence, any manner of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Abuſes from <hi>abſurd People</hi> in the Flock, than to manage any <hi>Contention</hi> with them, on any <hi>Occaſion.</hi> Let the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Iſſue</hi> be what it will, I ſhall generally gain more in regard of the Great Intereſt, by Remitting of my Right, than by <hi>purſuing</hi> of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Miniſter,</hi> above all other Men, ſhould ſoar to <hi>Heaven,</hi> live in <hi>Heaven,</hi> keep near <hi>Heaven;</hi> and if he will do ſo, I tell you, what will be his Experience.</p>
            <p>The Incomparable <hi>Newton</hi> has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, That the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> or the force of their <hi>deſcent</hi> towards the <hi>Center,</hi> decreaſes, as their <hi>diſtance</hi> from the <hi>Center</hi> increaſes. A <hi>Ton</hi> weight on the ſurface of the Earth raiſed Heaven-wards unto the heighth of one ſemi-diameter of the Earth, from hence, would weigh but one Quarter of a <hi>Ton.</hi> At three ſemi-diameters from the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002143_0045_0FBC23049C8963B0"/>ſurface of the Earth, it would be as eaſy for a Man to carry a <hi>Ton,</hi> as here to carry little more than an Hundred Pounds. I know, the further you fly towards <hi>Heaven,</hi> the more (if I may uſe the <hi>Faulconers</hi> Word) you muſt <hi>Leſſon.</hi> There is great Reaſon why it ſhould be ſo! <hi>Deſamations</hi> will be ſome of the things by which you muſt be <hi>leſſen'd.</hi> It's true, <hi>Defamations</hi> are <hi>heavy</hi> Things, they are hard to carry; it is hard to carry well under them; ſome of them are a <hi>Ton</hi> weight. But my Friend, If you were as near <hi>Heaven</hi> as you ought to be, you would make <hi>light</hi> of them; you would bear them wonderfully.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It may be ſome relief of your <hi>Diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> under your <hi>Defamations,</hi> to conſider what <hi>Company</hi> you have in your Affliction; to conſider, how <hi>defamed</hi> and <hi>ill ſpoken of,</hi> the <hi>beſt of Men</hi> in the World have been before you. What you undergo has much <hi>Temptation</hi> in it; But Sir, no <hi>Temptation except what is common</hi> to the beſt of Men. <hi>This comfort for the miſerable,</hi> ſeems to be recommended as no <hi>miſerable comfort</hi> by our Saviour; Math. 5.11, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are you when Men ſhall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you, and Perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of Evil againſt you falſely for my ſake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> Well known is the Story of that <hi>Knight,</hi> who going to his Martyrdom, and ſeeing

There never was an uſeful Servant of God in the World without ſo many <hi>Defamations;</hi> that if you ſhould be wholly without them, and <hi>all Men ſhould ſpeak well of you,</hi> you might well queſtion, <hi>whether you are a Saint of their Order or no.</hi> The <hi>Enmity</hi> fixed at the beginning between the <hi>two Seeds,</hi> has ever ſince been operating in Defamations: The <hi>Third Chapter of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> has predicted them; for all that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and oppoſe the Kingdom of <hi>Satan</hi> in the World; and ſuch is the Influence of <hi>Satan,</hi> on the <hi>Tongues</hi> of his Children, that he continually procures the Prediction to be accompliſhed. <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Writer of this, was a famous Inſtance of it; <hi>Moſes,</hi> the greateſt Man, [Let the Inſolent <hi>Critick</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſay what he will!] that ever ſhone in the World for four Thouſand Years together; An <hi>Angel in Fleſh.</hi> How often did his own People <hi>Defame</hi> him in their <hi>Murmurings:</hi> The People that were under more Obligations unto <hi>Him,</hi> than unto any Man under Heaven!

               <hi>The Time would fail me, to mention</hi> all the <hi>holy Prophets,</hi> who have joined in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made by one of them; Jer. 20.10. <hi>I heard the Deſaming of many.</hi> They have been <hi>Defamed</hi> as the <hi>Troublers of Iſrael,</hi> when they were the <hi>Chariots of Iſrael.</hi> They were <hi>Deſerted</hi> and <hi>Defamed,</hi> until they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired unto the <hi>funiper-Tree.</hi>

            <p>Under the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> the matter has not been mended; the <hi>old Enmity</hi> has been carried on in the <hi>old way, which wicked Men have Trodden.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, could appeal to all that knew them; <hi>Ye are Witneſſes, how Holily, how Righteouſly, how Unblameably we have behaved our ſelves.</hi> But then, thoſe Men of God were called unto this <hi>marvellous Proof</hi> of their being ſo. 2 Cor. 5.4, 8. <hi>Approving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much Patience, by Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour — by Evil Report.</hi> Above all, thou
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002143_0048_0FBC23099A32C598"/>muſt not be forgotten, O <hi>Paul,</hi> who didſt <hi>labour,</hi> (and in this way, <hi>ſuffer) more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly then they all.</hi> Nor thy <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> — the ſtrange Averſion which the <hi>Chriſtianized Jews</hi> had unto him, on the ſcore of his labour among the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> A Reproachful Averſion which could not be removed. The Gracious God, tho' <hi>beſought thrice</hi> by his Prayerful and Faithful Servant, yet would not remove this <hi>Buffeting</hi> Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but have him content with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> which he had in other things beſtow'd upon him. In the early Times, the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Chriſtians, how <hi>defamed</hi> were they? Such vile <hi>Accuſations</hi> were brought unto the <hi>Imperial Throne</hi> againſt them, that ſome of the beſt Emperors look'd on them as the worſt of People; a <hi>Trajan</hi> himſelf became their Perſecutor. The Church was long <hi>with Child,</hi> and in <hi>Travel,</hi> (full Two Hundred and Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Eight prophetical Days;) before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, when the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> could be no more heard againſt her; yea, and after that <hi>Conſtantinian Revolution,</hi> it was aſtoniſhing to ſee, how profeſſed <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> but ſhamefully <hi>divided</hi> ones, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one another with <hi>Defamations:</hi> Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Arians</hi> againſt the <hi>Orthodox.</hi> The one Example of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> may be enough; you may <hi>learn all</hi> from what was done to that <hi>one. Church Hiſtory</hi> reports, that <hi>Caedes,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002143_0049_0FBC230A9B45F2E8"/>Adulteria, Furta, quicquid atrox confingi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat, ſancto viro objiciebantur.</hi> They accuſed him for <hi>Beating</hi> ſome other Miniſters, and offering them horrid Outrages; and for <hi>Spoiling</hi> and <hi>Robbing</hi> of Churches. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> Compelled him to do ſome neceſſary Things for his own Defence, and then thoſe <hi>unreaſonable Men,</hi> complained of him for doing thoſe Things. They accuſed him for <hi>Murdering</hi> a Man, and cutting off one of his Hands to ſerve certain magical Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: tho' the Man anon appear'd alive, ſafe and ſound, unto the confuſion of the Accuſers. They accuſed him of a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Converſation with Women;</hi> tho' the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers were anon confounded by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions which the Wretches made, that they never ſaw any thing amiſs by him, Sometimes their Accuſations prevailed ſo far as to compel his retirement out of the Town. The <hi>chief Rulers</hi> were violently ſet againſt him. The corrupt <hi>Clergy</hi> hated him, and would have had him utterly Depoſed. The Glorious CHRIST, whoſe Cauſe he Eſpouſed, ſtrangely Supported him, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him; Once by ſinging of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> he ſo charmed the Soldiers who came to ſieze him, they could not meddle with him. He had many <hi>Triumphs</hi> over his Adverſaries: He often ſaw them reduced unto ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that they were afraid, they were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002143_0050_0FBC230DF1B12930"/>of owning themſelves to be <hi>his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</hi> At laſt, he dyed peaceably and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably in his own City, after he had been a Biſhop for ſix and Forty Years. I will trouble Antiquity to ſpare us one Example more, from the many which it might afford unto us. <hi>Narciſſus</hi> the ſerviceable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Miniſter of <hi>Jeſuſalem;</hi> a Man of ſuch a ſhining ſanctity, the <hi>ſore Eyes</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Men were offended at the brightneſs of it. Three of them accuſed him of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity,</hi> and ſwore to it with dreadful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations; one wiſhed that he might be <hi>burnt</hi> if he had not ſpoke the Truth; the ſecond wiſhed, that he might <hi>Rot</hi> alive; the third wiſhed, that he might loſe his <hi>Eye ſight.</hi> Very few believed the Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet this humble and modeſt Servant of God withdrew upon it. But the Vengeance of God ſoon followed the <hi>Accuſers;</hi> the Houſe of the firſt unaccountably took <hi>Fire,</hi> and he with all his Family were <hi>burnt</hi> to Aſhes; the ſecond fell into a diſeaſe, in which he did <hi>Rot</hi> and <hi>Die;</hi> the third ſaw this and was terrified, and owned the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Combinations, and with the very <hi>Tears</hi> of his Repentance he <hi>wept his Eyes out. Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> then returned and became a brighter Saint then ever he had been in his Life before. I mention this, becauſe the Authors of <hi>Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> ought to be afraid of the <hi>Judgments</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:002143_0051_0FBC230F1B91F3F0"/>wherewith God may vindicate his <hi>wronged Children,</hi> who bear patiently all the Wrongs that are done unto them, and <hi>commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him that Judges Righteouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, thoſe great Men, who illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Primitive Churches,</hi> met with ſtrange <hi>Abſurdities</hi> in the dealings of their <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> with them. Their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> let them ſee, how ready they were to catch at any thing that might look <hi>defamatory</hi> upon them. <hi>Jerom</hi> for Inſtance, had written ſome very <hi>applauding</hi> things concerning <hi>Origen;</hi> yet afterwards he wrote other things great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>condemning</hi> of him. <hi>Ruffin</hi> for this, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an horrid Clamour againſt <hi>Jerem,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man of <hi>no Truth</hi> in him; yea, <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf cenſured <hi>Jerom</hi> for Levity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy. It was a miſtake in <hi>them; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> defended himſelf with this fair Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy: <hi>I commend the Man for his Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; But I always diſliked his Principles. I highly valued his Abilities; but I did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tye my ſelf up from diſliking what is to be found amiſs in him.</hi> A Man may be Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Inconſtant</hi> when he obſerves the Rule of the trueſt <hi>Conſtancy.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>object,</hi> and not <hi>he</hi> that <hi>Changes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us come down to the Time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> we ſhall not find this <hi>way of wickedneſs</hi> then <hi>reformed.</hi> Good Men were ſtill defamed wonderfully. What hideous
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002143_0052_0FBC2310D2E05620"/>
               <hi>Defamations</hi> of the moſt excellent Men in the World, are the Writings of ſuch Men as <hi>Tympius,</hi> and <hi>Cochleus,</hi> and <hi>Genebrard</hi> ſtuff'd withal? To ſuch a degree of <hi>Defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> did the ſottiſh Malice and Madneſs of their Adverſaries carry them, that they printed Stories about the <hi>tragical Deaths</hi> of theſe Excellent Men, while the Men were yet living: But forced, it ſeems, by <hi>writing and printing</hi> of Anſwers, to prove that they were indeed <hi>Alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None ſuffer'd more this way then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Luther,</hi> whereupon our <hi>Whitaker</hi> made that Remark; <hi>Pelix ille, quem Dominus eo honore dignatus eſt, ut Homines nequiſſimos ſuos haberet Inimicos.</hi> There is a ſort of <hi>wicked Men</hi> whom it will be your <hi>happineſs</hi> to have your <hi>Enemies;</hi> you are <hi>honour'd</hi> if you may enjoy their <hi>Enmity.</hi> What <hi>ſmutty Stories</hi> did they invent and foment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the admirable <hi>Beza?</hi> I will not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reſt of the <hi>notoriouſly defamed Hero's;</hi> but only the Great, the Sweet, the dear <hi>Calvin</hi> muſt not be left unmentioned. <hi>France</hi> never ſaw a better Man; and yet how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the Name of <hi>Calvin?</hi> The Witlings of the time (a knot of them at <hi>Bruxells</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly) laid their Wits together to write Atheſtical <hi>Pamphlets</hi> of <hi>Modeſt Inquiries</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. The Title was, <hi>Calvino-maſtix.</hi> They made their <hi>Satyrs</hi> as pugnent as they
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002143_0053_0FBC23122123CB90"/>could; they indroduced the inraged <hi>Prince</hi> of the Bottomleſs Pit, as threatning to Plague the World with the moſt peſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Monſter</hi> he could procure for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mankind. This <hi>curſed Monſter</hi> muſt be <hi>Calvin!</hi> They charged him as being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Villanies</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (as they ſaid) his being <hi>burnt on the Shoulder</hi> for a Rogue. They <hi>Stigmatized</hi> him for one that in treating certain <hi>poſſeſſed People,</hi> had ſcandalouſly misbehav'd himſelf. When he was dead, what a hideous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter did <hi>Bolſecus</hi> publiſh of him, which paſſes among the Adverſaries of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, for <hi>a true Hiſtory of the Life and Death</hi> of <hi>Mr. Calvin?</hi> It accuſes him, as being a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> an <hi>Epicure,</hi> a <hi>Whore-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the worſt of Men; That he pretended unto certain <hi>Supernatural Powers</hi> of Heaven; but was detected in his deceit: That he dyed eaten up with Lice (the Word <hi>Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> they extended into <hi>Phthiriaſis</hi>) blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, invoking of Devils, deteſting his Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and curſing the Day that ever he put Pen to Paper. Yea, and in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation it ſelf, how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the Name of <hi>Calvin?</hi> Tho' the true Friends of the <hi>Reformation</hi> have generally concur'd with Dr. <hi>Hoyl,</hi> when he ſaid:
<q>That great Inſtrument of Gods Glory, <hi>John Calvin,</hi> was a Man of whom I had
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002143_0054_0FBC23139EE5FD08"/>almoſt ſaid, as once it was of <hi>Moſes, That there aroſe not a Prophet ſince like him</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor ſince the Apoſtles Days <hi>was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> His Works the World may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire how they could be ſo <hi>many,</hi> being ſo <hi>good,</hi> and ſo <hi>good</hi> being ſo <hi>many;</hi>
               </q> Yet you will find a venemous Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> (a Son of the Church, who uſually diſcover'd a <hi>Soul</hi> as <hi>Black</hi> as the Ink he wrote withal;) dreſs him up in <hi>Sambenito's;</hi> and at the beſt make but a <hi>Reverend Scribler</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>I am very much miſtaken, if the moſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Country in the World have no Sons of <hi>Bolſeus</hi> in it. I will no longer believe ſome <hi>Defamations</hi> which I ſee publiſhed in ſome of the moſt received <hi>Engliſh Hiſtories.</hi> No, nor ſome that have been raſhly taken up from Tory Reporters, and Publiſh'd in the life of our <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Perſons as our <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and our <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen;</hi> Servants of God, as unworthy to be expoſed for taking <hi>wrong Steps</hi> as the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi> And that holy Man, the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> whom I now mention, might remember that he was himſelf accuſed of a criminal Familiary with a lew'd Woman, yea, and with killing a Man in cold Blood; tho' he was really a Man of as much <hi>Grace &amp; Worth</hi> as moſt that ever the Nation had. I will tell you why I will not readily believe ſuch Stories. I have known ill Men to ſpread
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002143_0055_0FBC23151B583E80"/>Stories (like themſelves) of certain <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Frauds</hi> as uſed by ſome Servants of God in <hi>Religious</hi> Matters; when I have certainly known that the Stories have been Lies, and vile Fictions of ill-minded Men: And, I can chearfully ſay, <hi>The Great God knows the Truth of this Declaration;</hi> Yea, I have ſeen the Remarkable Judgments of God on the Authors of them. But ſuch Men as <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win &amp; Owen</hi> had done ſo much to pull down the Kingdom of the <hi>Devil</hi> in the World, that the <hi>Devil</hi> muſt, by <hi>Defamations,</hi> take an <hi>exemplary revenge</hi> upon them. And ſome <hi>Good Men</hi> were ſo <hi>ill affected</hi> unto their moſt valuable <hi>Brethren,</hi> as to let themſelves be therewith impoſed on. And I will take leave to tranſcribe a Paſſage from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Owen</hi> on this occaſion. <hi>A Man may have the Bleſſing of God and the Curſe of a profeſſing People at the ſame time. Man's Condemnation, and God's Abſolution do not ſeldom meet upon the ſame Perſons, for the ſame things. If you do the Will of the Lord, pray think it not ſtrange, if among Men, Curſes be your Reward, and Deteſtation your Wages.</hi> I mention this Obſervation by the by, becauſe you may live to have occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>The Glorious God has in this way, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his moſt faithful Servants. It has been <hi>to humble them, and prove them, and do them good in the latter end:</hi> Of ſuch <hi>Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:002143_0056_0FBC2318B6801A48"/>I may ſay as <hi>Jerom</hi> concerning other Calamities:
<q>They are <hi>Monitors</hi> put upon us, to <hi>Humble</hi> us, <hi>in ſimilituainem Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantium,</hi> as when the Conquerors of old rode in <hi>Triumph,</hi> there was a Perſon placed behind them in the <hi>Triumphal Chariot,</hi> who as often as the Citizens made their <hi>Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> whiſpered them in the Ear with an, <hi>Hominem te eſſe memento;</hi> Remember, Sir, you are but a Man.</q> When the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have <hi>Triumphed</hi> with continual <hi>ſerviceableneſs,</hi> the Way of Heaven has been to clap <hi>Detracters</hi> upon them, from whom in the midſt of the Acclamations which the obliged Churches of God have beſtowed upon them, they have had the moſt wholeſom <hi>Admonitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Conformity</hi> to the ever bleſſed JESUS, whereto His <hi>Defamed</hi> Servants, <hi>do</hi> and <hi>may</hi> arrive, ſhould be much in their Eye, under their <hi>Defamations.</hi> Looking after an Adequate notion of <hi>Honour,</hi> I finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon this; All true <hi>Honour</hi> lies in a <hi>Conformity</hi> to the admirable JESUS. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Man is <hi>Conformable</hi> to the admirable Saviour of the World, ſo far, and no farther he is an <hi>Honourable</hi> Man. Thence I infer, to be <hi>Defamed,</hi> may be to be <hi>Honoured:</hi> For I am ſure the Saviour of Men was extremely <hi>Defamed</hi> among Men; <hi>Deſpiſed &amp; rejected of Men.</hi> It was foretold of him that he
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002143_0057_0FBC231A0342F218"/>ſhould be <hi>ſpoken againſt:</hi> And it was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto extremity; there was not a Perſon in all the Land ſo <hi>ſpoken againſt.</hi> Indeed he had <hi>ſome</hi> that ſtood by him, yet they were but <hi>ſome;</hi> We read, Joh. 7.12. <hi>Some ſaid, He is a Good Man: Others ſaid, no, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the People.</hi> In the Viſions which the beloved <hi>John</hi> had of our Saviour, we ſee, Rev. 1.15. <hi>His feet like unto fine Braſs, as if they burned in a Furnace.</hi> The Learned <hi>Grellot</hi> has a curious Thought upon it. Our Saviour paſſed through a <hi>burning Furnace</hi> of Afflictions, that ſo he might come to His <hi>Glory.</hi> Grievous <hi>Defamations</hi> were ſome of the <hi>ſcorches,</hi> that afflicted Him in that <hi>Fiery Furnace,</hi> and compelled him to cry out, Pſal. 69.19, 20. <hi>Thou haſt known my Reproach, and my Shame &amp; my Diſhonour: Mine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are all before thee; Reproach hath broken my Heart.</hi> He took a <hi>Friendly notice</hi> of ſome that had not the beſt of Reputation; but with no other intention than the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one of a <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> intending to recover his <hi>Patients.</hi> For this he was <hi>Defamed,</hi> as a <hi>Familiar Friend of Wicked People.</hi> He Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately provided a large quantity of <hi>Wine</hi> for the Neighbours at a Wedding-Feaſt: For this he was <hi>Defamed,</hi> as a <hi>Wine-Bibber.</hi> He did wonderful things to deliver poor People from the Hands and Hurts of <hi>Evil Spirits:</hi> He was requited with being <hi>Defamed</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:002143_0058_0FBC231B29DEEAF8"/>as one that carried on an unlawful Converſe with <hi>Evil Spirits. No man heard his voice in the Streets:</hi> He fled from all the very Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of a <hi>Temporal Kingdom;</hi> yet he was <hi>Defamed</hi> as one that <hi>moved Sedition.</hi> A <hi>Thief</hi> was prefer'd before him. His own <hi>Kindred</hi> had thoſe among them, who maltreated Him; and call'd Him all that was bad. I find by Travellers, the Jews to this Day make this their great offence againſt Him. <hi>He went about doing of Good;</hi> yet a great part of Mankind conſpired for to treat him as an <hi>Evil Doer.</hi> Tho' He could challenge all Men living to tax him with the leaſt <hi>Ill thing,</hi> yet He was <hi>Numbred with Tranſgreſſors;</hi> He was Crucified between <hi>Two Robbers:</hi> From whence <hi>Hierocles,</hi> almoſt Three Hundred Years after, publiſhed and fomented a Tradition, that he was a <hi>Highway-Man,</hi> the Head of a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Crew of <hi>Banditti.</hi> Thus a <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> the moſt remarkable Set of the <hi>Seed of the Serpent</hi> that had been in any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſtung the <hi>Holy, Harmleſs, Undefiled</hi> JESUS! O Diſciple; How, how canſt thou propoſe any other ſort of treatment, than what thy Glorious Lord met withal?</p>
            <p>There never can be better Advice given to a <hi>Defamed</hi> Chriſtian than that, Heb. 12.2, 3. <hi>Look unto JESUS, who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right Hand of the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002143_0059_0FBC231CA7738C60"/>Throne of God; conſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf, leaſt ye be wearied and faint in your Minds.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in the <hi>Defamations</hi> that you ſuffer, you may very allowably examine, <hi>What conformity to the Sufferings of the Lord JESUS CHRIST may be diſcovered.</hi> Indeed we muſt with all the Contrition &amp; Confuſion imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, make the Acknowledgment of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner, who was <hi>Crucified</hi> with our Saviour; <hi>We ſuffer juſtly: We receive the due Reward of our Deeds. Our Lord never did any thing amiſs.</hi> But this does not forbid us poor Sinners, to conſider what there was in the Sorrows of our Saviour, to which any thing in our <hi>Sorrows</hi> may be <hi>conformable.</hi> It is an obſervable Paſſage, in Col. 1.24. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in my ſufferings, and fill up the ſignatures of the Afflictions of Chriſt.</hi> The Greek word uſed there properly ſignifies the hollow Marks and Strokes of the <hi>Seal,</hi> which are filled up with <hi>Wax.</hi> In your <hi>Defamations</hi> you may without <hi>Immodeſty,</hi> (but Oh! do it with a very <hi>trembling Modeſty!</hi>) obſerve perhaps, the <hi>Signatures</hi> which may as the <hi>Wax</hi> under the <hi>Seal,</hi> anſwer ſomething that befell CHRIST in his <hi>Afflictions.</hi> A brave Man once undergoing very batharous Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as well as the loſs or his Life on the Scaffold, chearfully ſaid upon it; <hi>What a deal of do here is, to make a poor Sinner like
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002143_0060_0FBC231E53354068"/>his Bleſſed Saviour?</hi> I make the more bold with this Matter, becauſe Antiquity has told me, <hi>Contumelia ſunt Chriſti inſignia.</hi> This may be the glory of <hi>Defamations</hi> and <hi>Indignities.</hi> If you find yours to have any of this <hi>glory</hi> in them, Oh! count it a <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in it, with <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great thing that remains, is your <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation</hi> of a Glorious CHRIST under all the provoking <hi>Defamations</hi> that are heap'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Of him you read, 1 Pet. 2.21, 23. <hi>He has left us an Example that ye ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps; who when he was reviled, revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not again; when be ſuffer'd, he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him-that judges righteouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you in the Hands of the <hi>Shearers?</hi> Oh! that you could imitate that <hi>Lamb of God!</hi> His incomparable <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>Silence!</hi> His readineſs to <hi>Forgive</hi> his moſt unreaſonable Adverſaries! When all manner of Evil was not only <hi>ſpoke</hi> of him, but alſo <hi>done</hi> to him, he expreſſed no undue Reſentments; he did not let fall one outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious or intemperate <hi>Word;</hi> he ſilently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted the <hi>Wrongs</hi> that were done unto him; he left to his Eternal Father, the <hi>Way</hi> and the <hi>Time</hi> of his juſt Vindication; He <hi>pray'd</hi> for his Perſecutors; His obliging Prayer for them was, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>

If you <hi>follow the ſteps</hi> of your ſuffering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, I will ſet before you the <hi>Conſolations of God,</hi> which Oh! how can they be <hi>ſmall</hi> unto you?

            <p>'Tis a Bleſſed thing to ſuffer <hi>like</hi> your Glorious LORD; but then if you ſuffer <hi>for</hi> him, or if the Cauſe of the malignity, which diſpoſes ill Men readily to utter or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Defamations</hi> againſt you, be your known <hi>ſerviceableneſs</hi> to his Intereſts, and Churches, this is a vaſt addition to your Bleſſedneſs.

            </p>
            <p>Here, Sir, is the <hi>conſummating Point</hi> of your <hi>Conformity</hi> to your Saviour. <hi>Firſt,</hi> You muſt be full of CHRIST: always <hi>thinking</hi> of him, acting for him; watching all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002143_0062_0FBC232310CDBA30"/>decently to make <hi>mention</hi> of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; daily pleading of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> flying to his <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> reſigning to the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his holy <hi>Spirit;</hi> admiring, ſtudying, following, of his holy <hi>Pattern;</hi> perpetually rendring ſome <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> to him by your ſelf, and beſpeaking <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of him from others; this muſt be the very buſineſs of Your Life! <hi>Then,</hi> you muſt be as CHRIST was, full of <hi>Benevolence</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence</hi> to Mankind; ever filled with <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions</hi> towards the Miſerable; ever doing to them all the <hi>Kindneſſes</hi> imaginable: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly contributing to the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of ſuch as are at <hi>Variance;</hi> and ſeeking out <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> People, and with delight ſtooping to any kind Offices for them; and all this upon <hi>his account;</hi> continually <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving,</hi> how to be <hi>ſerviceable</hi> unto all that are about you; reliſhing of no Pleaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that of doing any <hi>Service</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you may be capable; thankful to any one that will but ſhow you an Opportunity how to <hi>do Good,</hi> and not needing any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Perſwaſives to lay hold upon it: Having imprinted on your Mind a deep apprehenſion of your being but a <hi>Steward</hi> of all your Poſſeſſions in this World; and in a diſcreet and faithful <hi>Stewardſhip,</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all to juſt ſuch uſes as your Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer has preſcribed for all.</p>

When you have gained theſe two Points, you may be Tempted now to think, <hi>'Tis well; 'tis all!</hi> No, my Friend; it is not <hi>well,</hi> it is <hi>all</hi> ſpoilt, if there be not a <hi>Third</hi> ſuper-added. It is this; If you thus glorify CHRIST, you muſt be greatly expoſed unto the Envy and Hatred of a Malignant <hi>World;</hi> you muſt look to be as he was <hi>Deſpiſed and Rejected of Men. Satan</hi> Operating on the Minds of Men, will procure you a vaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance of <hi>Prejudice</hi> from the World. Men will have a ſtrange Averſion for you: Yea, many that paſs for <hi>Good Men</hi> will have ſo; and yet not be able to give any good Reaſon for their Averſion. Well, you muſt chearfully undergo all the <hi>Neglect,</hi> all the <hi>Contempt,</hi> all the <hi>Obloquies</hi> that ſhall be caſt upon you. Your <hi>Love</hi> to a Glorious CHRIST, and your <hi>Hope</hi> of being <hi>lov'd</hi> by Him, and <hi>like</hi> to him, is to carry you chearfully through it all; yea, tho' you ſhould be hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the <hi>Off-ſcouring of all things.</hi> You muſt be willing that the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, and the <hi>Diſeſteem</hi> of Man, ſhould make a very <hi>Nothing</hi> of you; and this not only from a Mind really, convinced that you are <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> but alſo from the marvellous <hi>Exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> of your glorious Chriſt, when he came into the World. Now, <hi>it is Finiſhed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Point of <hi>Conformity</hi> to your Bleſſed Saviour which I mightily preſs upon
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002143_0064_0FBC23259F07A250"/>you; <hi>a Spirit Reconciled unto Humiliations;</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi> that will not only <hi>ſubmit</hi> to, but even <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>Humiliations;</hi> a Spirit not averſe to <hi>Diminutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And among the precious Diſcoveries of ſuch a <hi>Spirit</hi> there is eſpecially one, which you ſhall allow me to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>You know, that the beloved Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Pride</hi> as the laſt part of the <hi>Old Man</hi> which dies within us. It's the <hi>Pride of Life;</hi> it Lives to the end of our <hi>Life;</hi> till we our ſelves do <hi>die.</hi> I have been inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>What is the last Eſſay of Pride?</hi> It is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for an <hi>humble</hi> Man to be willing to be <hi>thought humble;</hi> or, to be impatient, when <hi>Pride</hi> is charged upon him. This then is the Thing which I demand of you. Be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways really, heartily, inwardly <hi>loathing your ſelf;</hi> really eſteem others <hi>Wiſer</hi> and <hi>Better</hi> than your ſelf; really ſhun <hi>Honours,</hi> be averſe to them, afraid of them; never be uneaſy at being <hi>over-looked</hi> by other Men; or if there be Three Hundred in <hi>Sparta</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before you. The very firſt <hi>Motions</hi> of a Deſign to make your ſelf a <hi>Name,</hi> ſuppreſs them immediately. After all this, be not angry if you are ſtill call'd a <hi>proud Man.</hi> It is the eaſieſt thing imaginable for diſaffected People to find ſomething or other by which they will imagine to juſtify their paſſing ſuch a <hi>Cenſure</hi> upon you. But
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002143_0065_0FBC2327228A7FB0"/>now let not ſuch a Cenſure produce the leaſt <hi>impatience</hi> in you. I was not well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a very Good and Great Man, the Martyr <hi>Cyprian,</hi> for this thing; he had his Adverſaries, whoſe principal Clamour againſt him was, that he was a <hi>Proud Man;</hi> he wanted <hi>Humility:</hi> Now the only Symptom of it that I know of was, that he took the pains to write a <hi>Letter,</hi> in his <hi>own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> againſt that fooliſh Calumny. His beſt Vindication, and the beſt Confutation of the Calumny, in my poor Opinion, would have been to have born it patiently, and have ſaid <hi>nothing at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will mention to you one Circumſtance of <hi>Conformity</hi> to your Bleſſed Saviour, which if it ſhould occur in your Experience, I would not have you wonder at it. Our Saviour having had <hi>Heaven</hi> opened, with aſtoniſhing Teſtimonies of the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Him, at his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> in the Mount, he preſently met with what was grievous to him; an <hi>horrid Spectacle</hi> of one poſſeſſed with a <hi>Devil,</hi> and ſomething in the carriage of his own Diſciples, which admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred Grief unto him. In Conformity to this, it has been the Obſervation made by ſome Servants of God, That juſt after they have been admitted unto a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Familiarity</hi> with Heaven, the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> preſently entertains them with ſome
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002143_0066_0FBC2328EFD8B7E0"/>
               <hi>vexatious Object;</hi> ſomething that proves very <hi>Troubleſome</hi> and <hi>Abaſing</hi> unto them; and moſt probably ſome <hi>Obloquy</hi> raiſed by the <hi>Devil</hi> againſt them! It may be, you have (eſpecially on the whole <hi>Days</hi> which you have ſet apart for the <hi>Religion of the Cloſet</hi>) had an admiſſion into <hi>Heaven,</hi> yea, into the <hi>moſt Holy Place</hi> of Heaven, by a lively Faith beholding JESUS in the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> concerned for you; you have been ſwallowed up with Raptures of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> of what the Glorious One has done and will do for you. It has been with you a time of aſtoniſhing <hi>Irradiations</hi> from the Heavenly World! Now let it not ſurprize you, if you immediately have to do with People that have the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> in them. Oh! 'Tis an un-known Power that the <hi>Devil</hi> has over the Minds and the Tongues of <hi>Defamatory People!</hi> Nor let it be a ſurprize to you, if ſome from whom you might expect better things, be now left unto ſomething that may grieve you wonderfully. <hi>Rejoyce, again I ſay, rejoyce,</hi> in this <hi>Conformity</hi> to your Saviour. <hi>Paul;</hi> If thou haſt been in Heaven, expect a <hi>Meſſenger of Satan,</hi> (ſome <hi>Zedekiah</hi>) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to <hi>Buffet</hi> thee.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Let not your <hi>Defamations</hi> be the <hi>Diſcouragements</hi> of your <hi>Uſefulneſs;</hi> by no means be diſcouraged from <hi>well-doing</hi> by being <hi>ill ſpoken</hi> of.</p>

Doubtleſs, one Deſign of Satan (the <hi>Prince of Defamers</hi>) in raiſing a ſtorm of <hi>Defamations</hi> on you, is to overſet your Diſpoſition for the Service of God. But, Oh do not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him! So, when the Prophet <hi>heard the defaming of many,</hi> he fell into that unhappy Pang, Jer. 20.9. <hi>Then I ſaid, I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his Name.</hi> I hope, Sir, you'l be better adviſed. If you had not been a <hi>Fruitful Tree,</hi> it may be, there had not been ſo many <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Sticks</hi> thrown at you. Now, my Friend, Bear not the fewer <hi>Good Fruits,</hi> becauſe of what you have thus met withal. What a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was that? Rom. 8.37, 39. <hi>We are more than Conquerors,—DEPTH—ſhall not be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God.</hi> Tho' you are brought into a <hi>Depth</hi> of Diſgrace, and laid <hi>low</hi> by <hi>Defamation,</hi> yet, Oh! <hi>Love God,</hi> as much as ever, and <hi>Love</hi> the Service of God with a Flame that ſhall never be Extinguiſhed. Let no <hi>Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> retund or flatten your brave <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to do all the good that ever you can. <hi>Ignatius</hi> of old, ſaid unto <hi>Polycary;</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002143_0068_0FBC232DD7544E28"/>Yea, <hi>Be</hi> much <hi>better</hi> than you were before; let nothing iſſue from you but bright <hi>Strictures</hi> of Piety and Patience, and <hi>ſparkling</hi> Devotion and Uſefulneſs.

            </p>
            <p>I will mention to you, Two very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Experiments; things which I have often obſerved in the Courſe of my Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a Paſſage which the Famous <hi>Baxter</hi> has in his <hi>Chriſtian Directory: If you be famous for any Grace or Good Works, expect to be Defamed for the quite contrary; I have known ſome that have given away almoſt all they had to the Poor, and hardly kept Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for themſelves; yet theſe Perſons have been accuſed of Covetouſneſs, Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Hard Dealing.</hi> 'Tis moſt certainly ſo.
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002143_0069_0FBC232EA0A481A0"/>
               <hi>Inſani ſapiens Nomen feret, AEquus Iniqui.</hi> If you decline a Thouſand Opportunities to make your ſelf a <hi>Name,</hi> and very patiently <hi>bear,</hi> and almoſt <hi>ſeek</hi> to be <hi>over-look'd,</hi> yet you ſhall be called, <hi>The proudeſt of Men.</hi> I you are always <hi>deviſing Liberal Things,</hi> and ever ſcorn <hi>little Things,</hi> yet you ſhall be Reproached as, <hi>a Man looking always for Gain</hi> If you contrive all the Methods imaginable not only to be Good, Loving, Tender in your ſeveral <hi>Relations,</hi> yet you ſhall be treated as a very <hi>unkind</hi> Perſon, and perhaps moſt <hi>unkindly</hi> by them that have the leaſt Reaſon for it. Methought, I have often ſeen ſome reſemblance of this Matter in a thing which I have ſeen befalling a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> when in the way of his Paſtoral Duty, he viſited Perſons <hi>poſſeſſed with Evil Spirits;</hi> the Perſons, tho' they knew every one elſe in the Room, yet thro' the unaccountable Operation of the <hi>Evil-Spirits</hi> on their Eyes, the Miniſter who was moſt likely to do them Good, ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo dirty, ſo ugly, ſo <hi>diſguis'd</hi> unto them, they could have no knowledge of him. So <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> ſhall Good Men often be to the Minds of People, when <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> are <hi>working on the unperſwadable Children.</hi> Sir, If ever you find it ſo, remember that God is now <hi>Trying</hi> of you, whether you will grow in that <hi>Grace;</hi> hold on in that <hi>Good Work;</hi> for which you have hitherto

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis a Paſſage which I have ſomewhere elſe met withal, <hi>Tho' I have done good Offices for all Men whatſoever, as they have come in my way, yet a great part of them, whom I have diſtinguiſhed by doing of ſomething peculiar for them, have afterwards treated me moſt ungratefully, and abominably; have proved Prodigies of Ingratitude.</hi> Indeed, it is no rare thing, for <hi>Great Services,</hi> to be worſe rewarded than <hi>Great Injuries;</hi> They that were lately your <hi>Dependents,</hi> will be ſhortly your <hi>Defamers.</hi> It is a Maxim of <hi>Seneca</hi> unmasked; <hi>Men bear a ſecret Hatred unto thoſe who have moſt obliged them.</hi> Make your ſelf a <hi>Scaffold</hi> for another to riſe by; when he is up, he will kick you down if he can.

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002143_0075_0FBC2339317145B8"/>of God can proceed little further in <hi>doing of Good</hi> in the World. At the ſame time, you don't know what God may do for <hi>you. Moſes</hi> had not been ſo magnified by God, if <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> had not abuſed him, and abaſed him. Something may fall out that ſhall more Signalize you, and magnify you among the People of God, than any thing that has ever yet befallen you.</p>
            <p>GOD is to be adored in ſuch things; but tho' I make the <hi>briefest Mention</hi> of them that is poſſible, I would not have mentioned them at all, if the things had not been of ſo <hi>frequent occurrence,</hi> as to be worth your Obſervation; and at the ſame time, I know you will deſire concerning moſt of them, that they may not Occur in your own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. You had rather ſee God <hi>Saving</hi> of your <hi>Perſonal Enemies,</hi> then for your ſake <hi>ſmiting</hi> of them; and, If you ſaw the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted Hand of God ready to diſcharge Thunder-bolts upon them, you would beg for them, <hi>Lord, ſpare them, ſpare them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will rather Conclude with this Advice.</p>
            <p>PRAYER, PRAYER, which has here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore doubtleſs been the <hi>Breath of your Life,</hi> ought now more than ever to be ſo. The beſt Reſolution that you can take up, is that of the Pſalmiſt; <hi>The Mouth of the Wicked, and the Mouth of the Deceitful are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened againſt me; they have Spoken againſt
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002143_0076_0FBC233AAA53EC18"/>me with a Lying Tongue; but I give my ſelf unto Prayer.</hi> If the <hi>Storm of Obloquy</hi> upon you be more than ordinary, it looks as if the Lord called you unto ſomething more of <hi>Retirement; Sitting alone</hi> for a while, and <hi>keeping Silence,</hi> and putting your <hi>Mouth in the Duſt;</hi> while you give your <hi>Cheek</hi> to him that <hi>Smites</hi> you, and you are <hi>filled full of Reproach.</hi> How many <hi>Pſalms</hi> will you in this <hi>Retirement,</hi> and <hi>Religion of the Cloſet,</hi> find prepared for you, to Direct you, to Support you, to Supply your Supplications? eſpecially, the <hi>Third,</hi> the <hi>Thirteenth,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth,</hi> the <hi>Twenty-Seventh,</hi> the <hi>Thirty-Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Thirty-Eighth,</hi> the <hi>Forty-Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Fifty Fourth,</hi> the <hi>Fifty-Sixth,</hi> the <hi>Eighty-Sixth,</hi> the <hi>Ninety-First,</hi> the <hi>Hundred and Ninth,</hi> the <hi>Hundred and Thirty Eighth,</hi> the <hi>Hundred and Forty Second,</hi> the <hi>Hundred and Forty Third.</hi> The worſt of <hi>Dragons</hi> have been Charmed by ſuch <hi>Pſalms</hi> as theſe. My Friend, The <hi>Foot-steps</hi> of God, even when he is <hi>treading</hi> on you, will <hi>drop Fatneſs</hi> into your Soul; if you are brought unto ſuch Employments, and being made thus Fruitful (tho' in a Low <hi>Valley</hi>) you may <hi>ſhout &amp; alſo ſing for Joy.</hi> Even when thrown into a <hi>Dung-Cart,</hi> you may be (as the Martyr in that caſe Expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it,) as <hi>a ſweet Odour unto God;</hi> yea, and unto his faithful People too. Be concerned thus to Glorify the Name of your Holy
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002143_0077_0FBC233C4C3C4F18"/>LORD; and fear not; HE will take a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Care of <hi>your Name.</hi> And at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time when your <hi>Name</hi> is trod in the <hi>Dirt,</hi> among <hi>Men</hi> on Earth, it will, being <hi>written in Heaven,</hi> be precious among the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven, to whom you and your <hi>bringing Forth fruit with Patience,</hi> are made a <hi>Spectacle,</hi> and where a <hi>Crown</hi> of Glory is ready wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you. Having brought you <hi>thither,</hi> I cannot break off any where more agreeably but <hi>there,</hi> (whither, My Friend, all you preſent Sufferings are carrying of you!) <hi>There,</hi> I leave you.</p>
