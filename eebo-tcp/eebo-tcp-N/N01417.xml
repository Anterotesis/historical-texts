            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>MR. Attorney General, by his Letter of the Twenty Second of <hi>October</hi> laſt paſt to your Self, as Speaker to the Houſe of Repreſentatives for this Province, having moſt unaccountably, with an uncommon Freedom, taken upon him to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and Arraign a Conſiderable Company of Gentlemen Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as he is pleaſed to ſtile them) Projectors of the Bank of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and call them to the Bar of that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe, Charging them with the many <hi>High Crimes and Miſdemeanours</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That they are openly carrying on their Bank with utmoſt Vigour and Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Contempt of an Order of Council; and indeed affirming, that the Government
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001685_0003_0FB4D9492049EE20"/>
have nothing to do with them in that Affair: And that they look upon themſelves very Well and ſufficient to carry it on without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Application to the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. <hi>Vide</hi> Page 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That their Bank is <hi>Pandora's Box,</hi> Page 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That their Projection is juſt Ripe for Execution, which will more or leſs affect, invalidate and break in upon the Prerogative of the Crown, ſeveral Acts of Parliament, the Conſtitution and Laws of this Province, the Eſtates and Liberties of the People; and that not only for the preſent, but ſucceeding Generations. <hi>Page</hi> 4, 7, 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That their Projection is a thing <hi>Intolerable, Unreaſonable and Unjust,</hi> not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Commutative Justice,</hi> and <hi>Common Honeſty</hi>; and muſt unavoidably prove a great Snare and Miſchief to People that want Money to pay their Debts, or otherwiſe for whoſe eaſe and advantage the Bank is Projected. <hi>Page</hi> 16, 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the Buſineſs of the Projectors is in one day to be Maſters of <hi>One Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> without any Riſque, or any other Charge o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001685_0004_0FB4D9750339AB18"/>
finally the Eſtates themſelves, without a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſideration. <hi>Page</hi> 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That their Projection will be in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſetting up an <hi>Abſolute, Independent Government,</hi> which like a Fire in the Bowels, will Burn up and Conſume the whole Body. <hi>Page</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Articles being Intermixed and Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo many Invective Sarcaſms, Oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Language and Undue Reflections, the Gentlemen Concerned hold themſelves Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Juſtice to themſelves, and the Truth, and in Honour to your ſelf; that you and every one elſe may be Undeceived, and that the whole Matter may be ſet in its true light, do Affirm and Declare,</p>
                  <p>That two or three Gentlemen in the Town of <hi>Boston,</hi> diſcourſing of the Difficulties that Trade laboured under, for want of a Medium of Exchange, the Silver being ſent Home for <hi>England,</hi> and the Bills of Credit on the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces daily Called in by the Funds on which they were Emitted; thought it proper to conſult ſome other Friends, and to Meet together, and Conſider of a ſuitable Remedy for the preſent and growing Inconveniencies and Difficulties. At which time ſome were deſired to Commit their thoughts to Writing, in order to be conſidered of at a Second Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was accordingly done; And after ſeveral Meetings, agreed on a Land Security,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001685_0005_0FB4D98463B547F8"/>
as a Fund for Bills and Notes to be Circulated; and Minutes then drawn up, for the Regulating and Carrying on that Affair, but all with an intire dependance upon on the Government for their Favour and Countenance in promoting it, and furniſhing them with all ſuch neceſſary Powers as might enable them to carry it on with ſafety to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Poſſeſſors of their Bills or Notes. And therefore immediately they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſome of the Gentlemen to wait upon His Excellency the Governour for his Advice, Favour, Countenance and Direction in their Projection; who accordingly the very next Morning before they had taken a fair Copy of their Minutes, waited on His Excellency; ſo careful were they of paying all due Reſpects to Government, who were well Received by him, and Encouraged to proceed. And at the ſame time their Scheme being firſt laid before his Excellency; his thoughts were deſired, whether it was practicable for the Publick to come into a Fund themſelves, to which he was pleaſed to Anſwer, No, by no means; The Country is greatly Indebted already, and if ſuch a thing were propoſed, any Landed Man might come into the General Court, and enter his Proteſt againſt it; Neither would it be ſafe for that a Governours Fingers could not be kept out of it. And there then being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe about the power of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001685_0006_0FB4D989B61615A8"/>
to Lend at Intereſt on the Publick Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; He Replied, That what the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not do wiſely, equitably and ſafely they could not do; and that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that they had Projected for Relief in that Affair, he well approved of; withal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he would be the firſt Perſon that would take out <hi>Three Hundred Pounds</hi> of their Bills to promote their Credit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to proceed to take Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in order to lay it before the General Aſſembly for their Allowance; and that he would do all that lay in his power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it; aſſuring them that he would Write Home in their favour, by ſetting forth the Neceſſity of ſuch a Projection: And direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to wait upon Mr. Secretary <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> for his Advice, which they did, who was of Opinion that the Government would not Raiſe Money or Bills to Let out upon Loan. They then, and at ſundry other times conſulted him about their Scheme, committed it to him to peruſe, correct, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, amend and frame as he ſhould think fit, which he accordingly did. Whereas if the Projectors had been diſcouraged in their ſo early Attempts, it might have prevented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further proceedings: And the ſaid Scheme was laid before the General Court at their Seſſions in <hi>February</hi> laſt paſt, together with a Petition, Subſcribed by moſt of the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001685_0007_0FB4D98E30A94E50"/>
of that Affair, for the granting them ſuch neceſſary Powers, as they ſhould think meet to carry on the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The foregoing being Matter of Fact, and the exact ſteps taken by the Gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Projection of the Bank. It cannot be ſo much as imagined, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Letter, his Poſt and near Relation to the Governour Conſidered, ſhould be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof. However it fully proves that part of his Letter reſpecting their <hi>Slight, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Contempt of the Authority and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be a deſigned Miſrepreſentation, and therefore Abuſive of the Gentlemen concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſome of whom on ſeveral accounts are Superiour to him.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, If you will pleaſe to Conſider his Argument, whereby he would ſeem and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove his Charge of <hi>Contempt,</hi> &amp;c. you will find it as Unfair and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Notwithſtanding
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001685_0008_0FB4D996561580E0"/>
all which, I am loth to ſay, in Contempt of it, the perſons concerned are openly carrying on their Bank with utmoſt Vigour and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and ſuppoſing, and indeed affirming that the Government have nothing to do with them in that Affair.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this a bold and wilful Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Matter? Whenas the Order of Council, which the Government Ordered to be Printed in the Weekly News-Letter, is in the Words following.</p>
                  <p>At a Council Held at the Council-Chamber in <hi>Boſton,</hi> upon Fryday the Twentieth of <hi>August,</hi> 1714.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon Reading a Memorial, Preſented by the Queens Attorney General, ſetting forth that upon good Information, a certain Number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Merchants are Projecting a Bank of Credit as they call it, deſigning ſpeedily to Make and Emit a quantity of Bills to a great Value; which is a Matter of Importance, and will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be of General Influence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ordered, <hi>That the Projectors or Undertakers of any ſuch Bank do not proceed to Print the ſaid Scheme, or put the ſame on Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Make or Emit any of their Notes or Bills, until they have laid their Propoſals before the General Aſſembly of this Her Majesties Province; who are always ready to Countenance
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001685_0009_0FB4D99B457B9C38"/>
and Encourage any Propoſals that may be of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage for the Publick; or for the promoting and encouraging of Trade amongst Her Majesties Good Subjects of this Province; And that this Order be Printed in the Weekly News-Letter.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now by what Words in this Order can Mr. Attorney ſupport his Argument, to prove the Projectors <hi>Contempt and Inſinuated Diſobedience,</hi> which as it did not forbid their proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further in that Affair, but rather encourage and direct them to compleat their Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perfect their Scheme, ſo as it might be fit to lay before the General Aſſembly; ſo was it punctually complied with, in that the Projectors neither Printed their Scheme, or put the ſame upon Publick Record, Made, or Emitted any of their Notes or Bills; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſidered and New-Modelled their Scheme, and took many more Subſcriptions, and ſo far perfected it, as to lay it before the General Aſſembly, which they did at their laſt <hi>October</hi> Seſſions; hoping for their Countenance and Authority, for that becauſe a certain number of the Gentlemen concerned were appointed to attend his Excellency with the preſent Scheme, which they carried to him on the Morning of the Day they preſented another of the ſame to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, who then freely declared, that he would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

the Deſign, if the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Council would come into it, and that the Publicks Raiſing of Bills to Let out, to him had its dark ſides; for that if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould borrow of the Publick Bills, and Mortgage his Eſtate for payment, and fail of making payment, whereby the Eſtate ſo Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged ſhould become forfeit, the Eſtate ſo forfeited would belong to the Crown; and if he were their Governour, he ſhould think himſelf obliged to lay his Hands upon it, till the Kings Pleaſure could be had, who would have the intire diſpoſition thereof.</p>
                  <p>And now after ſo fair a Gloſs and falſe Comment upon the Order of the Governour and Council, and the Actions of the Project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in Conformity thereto in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Letter; what can be expected but the like Arguments throughout. And indeed here you may ſee <hi>Ex Ungue Leonem.</hi> Is not this too much like prevaricating talk in a bad Cauſe. Wherefore it is now to be Noted, that notwithſtanding the Gentlemen concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had made ſeveral Alterations in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obliging every one that Subſcribed thereto, to give good real Security, to the full value of their ſeveral Subſcriptions, to Lie as a Fund or Security, to anſwer all the Notes or Bills Iſſued from the Bank; and to make good all Deficiencies, whereby the Poſſeſſors or Borrowers of the Bills or Notes were in no
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001685_0011_0FB4D9A1296E7DB8"/>
danger of being wronged, with ſome other Amendments: The want of which Security in the firſt Projection, is one of the moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Arguments Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> hath made uſe of to cry down the ſame. Now he being well Informed of theſe Alterations before he Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; Nay, before he delivered and ſent his Letter to you, whereby he certainly knew his ſhort Abſtract of the Projection, and his Form of the Bills, with his Addition of an Eſchutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eon, and conſequently all the fine Structure he builds thereon, to be but upon a ſandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; tho' he would have the Honourable Houſe of Repreſentatives believe it.</p>
                  <p>And then he does in effect tell you, that the Projectors of the Bank have of their own heads formed themſelves into a Company, by a <hi>Constitution</hi> of their own making, and Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves into a <hi>Body Politick and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate to all Intents and Purpoſes in the Law</hi>; and then calls in the Prerogative and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Government to his Aid and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. It's true, they have by a Conſtitution of their own making, formed themſelves into a Company and Co-partnerſhip, and that they take for granted they well might do without the leaſt affront to the Crown, or this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe had never attempted it; for what's more common and uſual then for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others to enter into Partnerſhip, make their Rules, and oblige themſelves to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001685_0012_0FB4D9A6603FEF88"/>
the due obſervation of them. And does this make them a Body Politick, and Corporate to all intents and purpoſes in the Law, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the Prerogative, or diſhonour this Government? What is it then the Projectors have done, that makes them ſuch a Body Politick as Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> pretends they are. Certainly no man but one in <hi>Eutopia</hi> could make ſuch an Interpretation of their Articles as he has done. The Projectors, as he right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, do not pretend to Incorporate, or make themſelves a Body Politick; neither does his partial deſcription of a Corporation, which he ſays is my Lord <hi>Cooks,</hi> with all the <hi>&amp;crs.</hi> he has put into it prove they have.</p>
                  <p>We agree with him, that all Bodies Politick are derived from the King as their Original Fountain; but it does not thence follow, that all Banks of Credit and Companies are, for that there have been ſuch as never were Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And does not the Sword Blade Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>London,</hi> continue even unto this day, to Emit their Notes to a very great Value by Truſtees, and not Incorporated as a Bank of Credit; ſo that their Emitting Notes or Bills is not in <hi>England</hi> accounted a <hi>thing intolerable, Unreaſonable and Unjust,</hi> and abſolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Honour, the Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of that Government, nor to ſuffer a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their own People to ſet up an <hi>Abſolute Independent Government,</hi> which like a Fire in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001685_0013_0FB4D9ADE6206FE0"/>
their Bowels, would burn up &amp; conſume their whole Body. But Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> it ſeems is wiſer, &amp; ſees further into the Matter, than the Government of <hi>England</hi> doth. And then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to prove the Erecting this Bank a Breach of Law, he brings in an Act of Parliament, made in the Sixth Year of the Reign of Queen <hi>ANNE,</hi> to wit, <hi>that during the Continuance of the Bank of</hi> England, <hi>it ſhall not be lawful for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Body Politick or Corporate, other than the ſaid Company of the Bank, or for other Partners exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix in</hi> England <hi>to Borrow or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note, payable on demand, or at any time leſs than ſix Months from the Borrowing thereof.</hi> Now it is to be obſerved, that this Law does not make any Number of Partners to be a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick or Corporate, for their being in Partnerſhip; Neither doth it forbid any ſix, or any other Number of Partners to Borrow or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note, payable at any time longer than ſix Months from the Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Moſt certainly that Law was made in favour of the Bank of <hi>England</hi>; So that even in <hi>England</hi> it ſelf before that Act had its force, it was lawful there for any Body Politick or Corporate, or Partners to Borrow or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore will be Lawful again at the determination of that Bank. Then why may it not lawfully be done here, ſince that Act no ways affects this Province; For can Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001685_0014_0FB4D9BE03E8DAC0"/>
that ſetting up a Bank of Credit in <hi>New-England,</hi> would in the leaſt meaſure, prejudice the Bank of <hi>England</hi>: However, tho' he ſays he will not trouble himſelf to Argue how far this Projection would be a Breach upon the Bank of <hi>England</hi>; yet tells you, <hi>page</hi> 12. <hi>That certainly if the ſame Fact committed in</hi> England, <hi>by a Number exceeding ſix would be a Breach of Law; much more may we ſuppoſe it forbidden and made Unlawful for an hundred to do it here.</hi> Certainly, this is a fine and accurate Mode of Reaſoning and Pungent Argument.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe our Law forbids us Building of Wooden Houſes in <hi>Boston,</hi> therefore we muſt not Erect one in <hi>Lynn,</hi> or the Province of <hi>Main.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what he ſays of the Projection not being founded in <hi>Commutative Justice</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honesty,</hi> and that he can't ſee the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs and Juſtice of it, betwixt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers and Borrowers; and therefore muſt unavoidably prove a <hi>great Snare and Miſchief</hi> to thoſe that want Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To make a ſhew of the Proof thereof, he Argues from his own falſe Abſtract of the Projection, ſo that he diſputing <hi>Ex non Conceſſis</hi>; all he draws from thence, together with his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> grounded thereon, muſt needs fall of it ſelf, &amp; come to nothing. And it is plain, his deſign was only to amuſe the People, but more particularly the Houſe of Repreſentatives: Now ſince the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001685_0015_0FB4D9CF05C54798"/>
Projection obliges every Subſcriber to Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a Real Eſtate, of the full value of what he Subſcribes for, to make a ſufficient Fund for the Credit of their Notes and Bills; as likewiſe to Anſwer all Deficiencies ariſing by any defect or default of the Projectors in the aforeſaid Scheme; Whereby the Borrowers or Poſſeſſors of the Notes or Bills are ſure to have Juſtice done them; and all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, in caſe the Bank ſhould come to an end, even then will the laſt Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of their Bills or Notes have good Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depend on: Notwithſtanding all the Objector hath ſaid, or poſſibly can ſay: They ſtill having their Credit and Value from the Intrinſick Value of the Bank, and not from what his Bubbled Borrowers give them, as he groundleſly aſſerts. He muſt needs ſuppoſe the Houſe to be aſleep, and ſo to need awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, as <hi>page</hi> 5. when he aſſerts, <hi>page</hi> 19. that by the Tenour of the Bills you ſee, they are only obliged to Accept of them for the Redemption of <hi>Pawns</hi> and <hi>Mortgages</hi>: When in his Reciting the Tenour of the Bill, <hi>page</hi> 7. He owns that we oblige our ſelves to Accept the ſame in ALL PAYMENTS according to Covenant made by us on Publick Record, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which how directly he Contradicts himſelf, &amp; endeavours to Miſlead the Houſe, we leave you and the World to judge: Nor would the Projectors have the Profits of other Mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001685_0016_0FB4D9D7E2AF8FF8"/>
much leſs the Eſtates themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a valuable Conſideration, nor make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of any Eſtates but their own, which they willingly Depoſit and Mortgage for a General Benefit for the Loan and Credit whereof it's as lawful for them to take Intereſt, as it is for Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> for his Bills of Credit on the Province. The Bank Bills having a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more certain Security than the Publick Loan Bills, and more eaſily obtained, in Caſe that late Act ſhould be Repealed: And for that Reaſon his Argument againſt the Private Bank is of far greater ſtrength and force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Publick Bank.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Attorney <hi>is pleaſed often to put you in mind, that this Prejection breaks in upon, and Invalidates the Conſtitution of this Province, page</hi> 4. 15. <hi>The Act of Parliament of late made Referring to Money in the Plantations, deſigning thereby to awaken the Government upon this great occaſion, to Exert their proper Power, and not ſuffer the Projection to proceed, but by ſome proper Act, and Publick Order, to declare againſt, and forbid it, lest thereby the Constitution of the Government of the Province be broke in upon, and endangered: Becauſe we are a Dependent Government, and muſt in all things Conform our ſelves to the Laws of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>and Inſtructions of the Crown, and therefore muſt expect to give an Account of all our Matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the ſuffering of this Private Bank to be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001685_0017_0FB4D9DCD9E1CB20"/>
Erected, is ſuch an Encroachment upon the Prerogative, and a breach of the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as to endanger the loſs of our Charter, &amp; the Liberties and Eſtates of the People, which to prevent, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> tells you, was the very Conſideration that principally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him at that time ſo freely to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Thoughts to your ſelf in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; with the ſeveral other fine flouriſhes and plauſible Inſinuations, whereby he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to believe that in all this Affair that he hath ſincerely aimed at the Publick Good, and effectually to prevent any Attempts that might be made againſt our Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which no doubt he is intirely fond of, &amp; always was vigilant &amp; induſtrious to maintain and defend. If he has ſincerely given you his Opinion reſpecting the Private Bank, and the direful effects of it, with what ſort of ſincerity did he when he ſays he had the Honour to be of an Extraordinary Committee Raiſed for that purpoſe, give it as his Opinion, that conſidering the demand as to the Taxes, &amp; the great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the People, as to their Trade, it might be convenient to Make and Iſſue out a further quantity of the Publick Bills of Credit: And now in his Letter ſpend ſo much time, and take ſuch pains, and argue to perſuade the General Court to ſet up a Bank of Credit themſelves, Emit their Bills, and take Intereſt for the ſame. Is it not as poſſible for the Government to Erect,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001685_0018_0FB4D9DEB330DBC0"/>
Set up and Eſtabliſh things contrary to the Law, as for a Number of Private Perſons; and does not the Law of <hi>England</hi> which he ſaith would be broke in upon, by Erecting a Private Bank, much more reſpect a Corporation than Private Perſons; and which he himſelf readily grants it doth. Is not this then one effectual way to endanger the Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the utter Ruin &amp; Loſs of the Charter, &amp; the many Liberties we hold &amp; enjoy thereby. For if a Number of private Perſons break in upon the Law of <hi>England,</hi> they may be ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed therefor; But if a Corporation or Government like Ours, Set up and Enact things contrary to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the way to puniſh them would be by Loſs of their Charter and Priviledges granted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. So that upon the whole Matter, whether his Letter was not rather to Lull you aſleep if poſſibly he could, that then he might bring you into the Practice of ſuch things, which hereafter you, and all of us might have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſon to lament and be grieved for, but when too late; than in the leaſt meaſure to awaken the Government that they might be upon their Guard againſt any Attempts to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine them.
