            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMONG the various ſelections of Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Reading and Speaking, which have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Compiler of the following ſheets, ſhe does not recollect any one adapted to the uſe of ſchools for Young Ladies. Feeling too ſenſibly the many inconveniencies reſulting from the partial atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has heretofore been paid to their education, warmly intereſted in the happineſs of the female part of the riſing generation, and wiſhing for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in virtuous principles and habits, no leſs than in thoſe perſonal accompliſhments, that are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their ſex, ſhe has been induced to contribute ſomething towards the promotion of ſo deſireable an end, by making the ſelection, for which ſhe now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licits the patronage of their Inſtructors and of the public in general. Though it is principally deſigned for the uſe of ſchools, ſhe flatters herſelf that it will be found not unworthy the peruſal of ſuch as have already finiſhed their education. To render the book more deſerving of their attention, ſhe has generally preferred whole pieces to extracts; and has taken much pains to collect a pleaſing variety of matter. As it is the opinion of the moſt judicious of both ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that public exhibitions, in ſpeaking, are not only unneceſſary but highly improper for Miſſes, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Dialogues inſerted is ſmall, and theſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to aſſiſt them in learning to read this kind of compoſitions with propriety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035911_0003_1007BED9F3785888"/>The Compiler having been careful, in every part of the work, to reject whatever is too common; and, finding that the faireſt flowers in the field of poetry have been culled out by thoſe who have preceded her in ſuch collections, is apprehenſive that this depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will appear rather barren: ſhe hopes, however, that the pieces ſhe has ſelected will not be thought deſtitute of merit, or ill-adapted to her general deſign.</p>
            <p>Her aim throughout, has been to blend inſtruction with rational amuſement. Convinced that books, which convey only the latter, are already too much multiplied, ſhe has admitted but few pieces, which do not tend either to inform the mind, to improve the heart, to correct the manners, or to regulate the conduct.</p>
            <p>If the work, in addition to the entertainment it may afford the younger part of her ſex, ſhall be found to produce any of theſe valuable effects, the Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler will reflect on the hours, which ſhe has ſpent in collecting and arranging the materials that compoſe it, with great ſatisfaction; and
<q>"Glory in the work ſhe did not write."</q>

                  <head>READING.</head>
                  <p>TO be able to read with propriety, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a genteel accompliſhment, and not ſo eaſy to be acquired as moſt people imagine; and perhaps you will not find one woman in five hundred, that is poſſeſſed of it. There are ſo many faulty ways of reading, which young people are apt to run into, that it is difficult to avoid them all; and when once a bad habit is contracted, it is almoſt impoſſible to correct it.</p>
                  <p>There is your aunt Filmer, who reads with ſuch a canting tone as grates the ears of the whole company. She has frequently almoſt ſung me to ſleep, though read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the moſt diverting books in the world. Your couſin Pultency, you know, reads with ſuch hurry and rapidity, and ſuch neglect of the proper ſtops and pauſes, that the moſt attentive hearer cannot underſtand one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035911_0006_1007BEDF981150E0"/>
ſhe pronounces; whilſt Mrs. Daſhwood reads in ſuch a ſlow and ſlovenly manner, and draws out the words to ſuch an immoderate length, that nobody has patience to follow her. Mrs. Nugent reads with ſuch a loud and ſhrill voice as ſtuns the ears of the whole audience. It might do very well in a public aſſembly, but is altogether unfit for a tea-table: whereas Miſs Littleton's accent is ſo faint and feeble, that you muſt apply your ear almoſt to her mouth, before you can underſtand the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I would therefore have you form yourſelf upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of your governeſs, who, indeed, is one of the beſt readers I ever heard. She reads with the ſame eaſy nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural voice as ſhe uſes in converſation. She obſerves the ſtops and pauſes with great exactneſs. She reads ſo ſlow as to be eaſily underſtood by any perſon, who will give a proper attention, and is not abſolutely dull; and yet ſo faſt, as not to diſguſt thoſe of the quickeſt apprehenſion. Her voice ſhe carefully adapts to the number and extent of her audience. When ſhe reads to a large company, her voice is high without being ſhrill; when to a ſmall one, it is low, but withal diſtinct. In a word, ſhe is a complete miſtreſs of the art of reading; and you cannot fail to become ſo too, if you imitate her manner, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her directions.</p>

                  <head>WRITING AND SPELLING.</head>
                  <p>WRITING, my dear, is one of the moſt uſeful arts that ever was invented. Were it not for this art, the knowledge of every perſon would be contracted within the narrow circle of his own experience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but by means of this, we can enjoy the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge and diſcoveries of all thoſe, who have lived before us; and, in ſome meaſure make them our own. By means of this art, you may converſe with your friend, though removed to the moſt diſtant corner of the world, almoſt as well as if perſonally preſent. By means of this art, you can preſerve on paper whatever you read, hear,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035911_0006_1007BEDF981150E0"/>
or ſee, that is worth remembering; and which it would otherwiſe be impoſſible to treaſure up in your memory.</p>
                  <p>But it is not only an uſeful, it is likewiſe a polite qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; nor ſhould any one pretend to the character of an accompliſhed woman, who cannot write a diſtinct and legible hand. Let me therefore adviſe you to be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably careful and diligent in learning the art of writing. Follow the directions of your maſter, who, I preſume, will lay before you the moſt perfect copies and examples. Of all the various hands, a round hand is, in my opinion, the moſt proper; for when you are a miſtreſs of that, you may, with great eaſe, learn either a neat running or Italian hand; but if you begin with the latter, you never can arrive at any degree of perfection in the former. When you write, never be in a hurry, but proceed with the greateſt care and deliberation: always write as well as you can, and then your hand will be ſtill improving; for if you do not, inſtead of improving, it will, every day, become worſe. But before you put pen to paper, you muſt reſolve not to indulge yourſelf in the wrong ſpelling of a ſingle word; and if you faithfully obſerve this rule for a ſhort time, you will ſoon be able to ſpell any word without the help of a dictionary. Nothing, indeed, is more unworthy the character of a gentlewoman, than falſe ſpelling: and yet, in this reſpect, I am ſorry to ſay it, moſt of our ſex are ſhamefully deficient; and ſome of them too, whom I know to be perſons of excellent good ſenſe and diſtinguiſhed abilities: but this muſt have been owing to bad habits contracted in their youth, of which they were never afterwards able to get the better. It is therefore your part to prevent, what it is ſo extremely difficult to correct.</p>

                  <head>CYPHERING.</head>
                  <p>OF all the various qualifications of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed woman, there is not any one more uſeful and neceſſary than cyphering. Without this, you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035911_0007_1007BEE18DAB4480"/>
upon your memory for every farthing of money that paſſes through your hands. Without this, you can neither keep an account of the money you receive, nor of what you expend. Without this, you will be in danger of being cheated by every perſon you deal with. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, you will not be able to aſſiſt me in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of our family, which, however, I expect you ſhould be in a few years; and ſtill leſs will you be able to ſuperintend the economy of your own, when, in the courſe of providence, you come to be miſtreſs of one. In a word, without this, you will be altogether unqualified for ſeveral of the moſt important duties in life.</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore perſuade you, my dear, to give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention to your cyphering, and to acquire ſuch a competent knowledge in this uſeful art, as is proper for a woman. I ſay, a woman; for it is not neceſſary that ſhe ſhould underſtand it ſo perfectly as a man: as her ſphere of action is more confined, ſo her knowledge, in this reſpect, ſhould be more confined likewiſe. You ought, however, I think, to be a complete miſtreſs of the four ſimple rules of arithmetic, the rule of proportion, and a plain method of book-keeping. And I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to begin to keep a diſtinct account of all the money you receive or lay out, and, indeed, of every thing belonging to you, that can be numbered; as ſoon, I mean, as you have acquired a knowledge of cyphering ſufficient for that purpoſe. By this means, you will, at once, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the rules of arithmetic more deeply in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, and inſenſibly acquire ſuch a habit of accuracy and regularity, as will be of great ſervice to you in your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct.</p>

                  <p>I AM glad to hear that you have, at length, entered on the ſtudy of grammar. I hope you will go on, with ſpirit and perſeverance, and not be diſcouraged by its apparent difficulty; for, however great this may

                  <p>I HAD lately the pleaſure of hearing, from your governeſs, that you are daily improving in all the different branches of your education, and particularly in geography, which, ſhe ſays, you have been learning for ſome months paſt. This is an accompliſhment equally uſeful and genteel; but in which, I am ſorry to ſay it, moſt of our ſex are ſhamefully deficient; as I could prove by a variety of examples.

Miſs Fenton, whoſe wit is greater than her knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, and her vanity greater than both, is perpetually committing blunders of this kind. Mr. Grenville hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the other day, to be reading the news papers to a large company, and, among other articles, one from Warſaw, giving an account of a certain nobleman, who, for ſome ſlight cauſe, had divorced his lady. He had no ſooner finiſhed, than Miſs, with her uſual forwardneſs, obſerved that theſe Spaniards were the worſt huſbands in the world. Some of the company bluſhed, others ſmiled, and the reſt remained demurely grave. Miſs, perceiving her error, was confounded and abaſhed: but the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, out of his great humanity, endeavoured to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for her, as well as he could, by adding, that the young lady's remark was very juſt; that, though the place mentioned in the news-paper was the chief city in Poland, he believed there was a town ſomewhere in Spain of the ſame name, and it was a very eaſy matter to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the one for the other. Into ſuch ſhameful blunders do young ladies frequently fall, from their ignorance of geography; and to ſuch pitiful ſhifts muſt their friends have recourſe, to ſave them the bluſh of confeſſing their ignorance. But the knowledge of geography will effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prevent your committing any blunders of this kind, as it will teach you the names of all the principal towns in the world. Nor is this all; it will further acquaint you with the climate, the ſoil and produce of all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the earth; and with the cuſtoms, manners, government and religion of the ſeveral inhabitants: by which means you will be able to talk pertinently on moſt ſubjects that occur in converſation.</p>

                  <p>YOUR governeſs writes me, that you are become a great proficient both in vocal and inſtrumental muſic. This, though not the moſt uſeful, is certainly one of the moſt genteel qualifications which a young

lady can poſſeſs. It is, of all others, the moſt agreeable amuſement, the moſt pleaſant recreation; and ſhe that underſtands muſic, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed never complain that her time lies heavy on her hand. It is at once the beſt preventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the moſt effectual cure for melancholy and low ſpirits, as it can baniſh every gloomy and deſponding thought, and inſpire us with cheerfulneſs and good humour.</p>
                  <p>The power of muſic over the human mind is very ſurpriſing, and almoſt irreſiſtible. When we are depreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſorrow and grief, it can cheer and enliven our drooping ſpirits. When we are elated with exceſſive and immoderate joy, (for joy may be immoderate and even dangerous) it can allay the violence of the paſſion, bring us down from the giddy height, and reduce us to a ſtate of pleaſing tranquillity. If inflamed with anger, or boiling with rage, it can ſoften and melt us into pity and compaſſion. In a word, hatred, malice, envy, and every other vicious paſſion, may, by the power of muſic, be preſently baniſhed, or at leaſt charmed and allayed for a while, and if the charm be frequently repeated, they may at laſt be overcome.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are a few of the many advantages which may be derived from muſic. But all this is only meant with regard to thoſe who have a taſte for muſic, or, as it is commonly called, a good ear; for there are ſome people ſo utterly devoid of this taſte, that they can make no other diſtinction of ſounds, than that of more or leſs loud. To them, the noiſe of a blackſmith's hammer, and the fineſt airs of a violin, are the ſame; whilſt a perſon of a good ear, improved by practice, receives from ſuch an entertainment the moſt exquiſite and refined pleaſure; perhaps the moſt refined that can be enjoyed in this world, except that of doing a good action.</p>

                  <head>DRAWING.</head>
                  <p>WERE drawing only to be conſidered as an innocent amuſement, even in this light would it merit your attention; for innocent amuſements are of more
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035911_0009_1007BEE829E8B2E0"/>
importance to our happineſs, and perhaps to our virtue too, than many people imagine. The moſt active and buſy ſtations of life have ſtill ſome intervals of reſt, ſome hours of leiſure. The body, as well as the mind, requires it. And, if theſe are not employed in innocent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they will either lie heavy on our hands, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of raiſing, depreſs our ſpirits; or, what is worſe, tempt us to kill the time, as it is called, by ſuch amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are far from being innocent.</p>
                  <p>But drawing is not only an innocent amuſement: it is more; it is an uſeful qualification. It will exerciſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and improve your imagination, by filling it with the images of every thing that is beautiful or curious in the works of nature or art. It will ſtrengthen and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your judgment, by obliging you to examine the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects you copy with greater care and accuracy than you would otherwiſe have done; and it may ſometimes be an aſſiſtance to your memory, as it will enable you to take down on paper a greater variety of objects, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſame object, than it would be eaſy, or perhaps poſſible, to remember. It will likewiſe be of great uſe in furniſhing you with beautiful patterns and deſigns for ſewing, which thoſe who are ignorant of this art muſt borrow from others, without being able to judge whether they are good or bad.</p>
                  <p>But I have neither time nor inclination to enumerate all the advantages which a young lady may derive from the art of drawing. What I have ſaid, however, will, I hope, be ſufficient to kindle in you a deſire of acquiring an accompliſhment, at once ſo uſeful and genteel. Allow me to give you one general advice, which is this; let the objects from which you copy, be chiefly the works of nature; and carefully avoid every thing that is unnatural, whimſical, or romantic, as moſt Chineſe drawings are. To imitate the former, has a natural tendency to improve the taſte; to copy the latter, has a natural tendency to corrupt and pervert it.</p>

What an infinite number of the female ſex, and, perhaps, the moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of it too, live by the needle?

                  <p>After all, I do not deſire you to apply to your needle ſo as to hurt your eyes, or weaken your conſtitution: far from it. On the contrary, I would have this, and all your other ſtudies, carried on in a perfect conſiſtency with your health, which is never to be ſacrificed to any conſideration whatever.

                  <p>CLEANLINESS is a habit, I had almoſt ſaid a virtue, which you cannot learn too ſoon, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too long, both from a regard to yourſelf, and the world around you. It will, at once, contribute to the eaſe and health of your body, and be the means of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035911_0010_1007BEE9C45E02F0"/>
you into polite and genteel company; at leaſt the oppoſite extreme of dirtineſs will certainly deprive you of that advantage; it will either make your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be ſhunned; or, if that cannot be done, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways render your preſence diſagreeable.</p>
                  <p>But beware that you do not confound cleanlineſs with finery; nor miſtake the one for the other. They are as diſtinct in their nature as any two things can well be; and, though not inconſiſtent, are frequently found to be ſeparated. A woman may be very neat and clean in a plain and ſimple dreſs; and ſhe may be very dirty and tawdry in a fine and coſtly one. There is Miſs Moleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, ſhe never wears any thing above a plain ſilk gown; but that, and all the other parts of her dreſs, which are equally ſimple, ſhe puts on and adjuſts with ſuch elegance and propriety, as pleaſes the eye of every one that beholds her: whilſt Lady Dormer, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though dreſt in the richeſt ſattin brocade, and loaded with a profuſion of jewels and pearls, is, after all, ſo ſlovenly and tawdry, that ſhe may be ſaid rather to carry her clothes like a porter, than to wear them like a well dreſt lady.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, it conſumes a great deal of time: I am perſuaded you always find as much as you ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, in order to be neat, between the time that is uſual for leaving off ſchool, and that of going to dinner. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it will every day require leſs, for the more you practiſe it, the eaſier it will become; and a twelvemonth hence, I dare ſay, you will be able to dreſs yourſelf as well in half an hour, as you can do at preſent in a whole one.</p>

                  <head>CONVERSATION.</head>
                  <p>FIRST of all, take care never to interrupt any perſon when ſhe is ſpeaking. This is the height of ill manners. If ſhe talks longer than ſhe ought, and even deſerves to be interrupted, yet be not you the firſt to do it. That will come with a better grace from one
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035911_0010_1007BEE9C45E02F0"/>
of greater age and experience. If ſhe be guilty of one fault, that is no reaſon why you ſhould be guilty of another. If you have a reflection to make upon any thing ſhe has ſaid, you muſt reſerve it till the end of the ſtory; though perhaps you may imagine it would have come in with greater propriety in the middle of it. If the remark would have been very pertinent then, it will not be impertinent now; but if it appears to be trifling here, you may be aſſured it would not have been very ſenſible even there. By this means you will at once diſcover your prudence and diſcretion, and inſenſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a habit of retaining and examining your thoughts before you throw them out in converſation.</p>
                  <p>I am the more anxious to caution you againſt this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of interrupting people in the middle of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, becauſe it is an error which young perſons, from the natural heat of their temper, and the vivacity of their ſpirits, are moſt apt to commit. Your friend is telling a ſtory: in conſequence of ſomething ſhe ſays, a good thought ſtrikes your fancy; out it comes; for you can contain yourſelf no longer: your friend is ſtopt: the reſt of the company ſmile; and yet perhaps your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark was very ſmart and witty. But was it really, do you think, or could it poſſibly be, ſo very ſmart and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to apologize for your ill manners in interrupting your friend? Every ſenſible perſon will tell you that it could not.</p>
                  <p>Another rule which you ought carefully to obſerve, is, never to take up too much of the converſation your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and far leſs to engroſs the whole of it. This, even in perſons of the greateſt age, knowledge, and experience, muſt appear ridiculous; but, in one ſo young, ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and ſo inexperienced as you are, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as the height of arrogance and preſumption. Indeed, every one ſeems to be entitled to a greater or leſs ſhare of the converſation, in proportion to her years and knowledge: but no perſon, let her years and knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge be what they will, has a right to the whole of it; nor ſhould any one, however young and ignorant, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely excluded. This would deſtroy the very end of converſation, which is mutually to impart and receive
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035911_0011_1007BEEB617AADC0"/>
knowledge, pleaſure, and improvement. For, what knowledge or improvement can ſhe poſſibly receive, who is always talking herſelf, and never allows the reſt of the company to open their mouths? Or, what pleaſure can they enjoy, who are condemned to profound ſilence, and have their ears perpetually ſtunned with the noiſe of the ſame tongue? If, indeed, they could enjoy any pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in ſuch circumſtances, they muſt be endued with great patience and humility; greater, I am afraid, than fall to the ſhare of any individual of the human kind.</p>
                  <p>In company, never ſpeak ill of any abſent perſon, whether friend, ſtranger, or enemy. The firſt would be baſe, the ſecond unjuſt, and the laſt low and mean-ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By ſpeaking ill of your abſent friends, you deſerve to loſe, and certainly would loſe, both them and thoſe who are preſent; for who, in their ſenſes, would culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a friendſhip with one guilty of ſo much perfidy and baſeneſs? By ſpeaking ill of ſtrangers, you would make all the world your foes; for ſhe, who, without the leaſt provocation, can aſperſe the character of thoſe with whom ſhe has little acquaintance and no connexion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be the object of univerſal deteſtation. By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt your abſent enemies, you would diſcover the moſt contemptible meanneſs of ſpirit and littleneſs of mind; and if it ſhould come to their ears, might flatter their pride and vanity too much, by making them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that they had ruffled your temper more perhaps than they had really done, or, at leaſt, than you ſhould give them an opportunity of knowing.</p>
                  <p>Another rule which you ought to obſerve in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, never to ſay any thing that may give pain or uneaſineſs to any one of the company. By this I do not mean any of the errors which I have deſcribed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned above. All theſe, to be ſure, give pain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs to the perſons that ſuffer by them; but then they do ſo in plain and open terms, and, of conſequence, may be the more eaſily corrected or refuted. What I mean at preſent is, that you ought never to ſay any thing that ſeems to reflect, even in the moſt diſtant manner, upon the faults or foibles of any of the company, or of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent friends. If this proceed from malice, it betrays a bad
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035911_0011_1007BEEB617AADC0"/>
heart; if from want of thought, it diſcovers a weak head: and the ill-natured and fooliſh are equally unqualified for the delicate intercourſe of polite converſation.</p>

                  <head>DIVERSIONS.</head>
                  <p>WITH regard to diverſions in general, I would have you to remember, that they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered merely as diverſions, and not as ſerious buſineſs. They are intended not to diſſipate and unſettle the mind, but only to relax and unbend it; that it may return to the performance of the important duties of life with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alacrity and vigour; and therefore you ought never to allow them to take up too much of your time, and far leſs to engroſs the whole of it, as is the practice, I am afraid, of too many young ladies. What with ſhopping in the forenoon, viſiting in the afternoon, and plays, balls and concerts in the evening, I doubt they find but little time for more uſeful employments. This might do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well, had we been ſent into the world only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ourſelves for a while with baubles and gew-gaws, like children; but that would be a ſuppoſition equally unworthy our great Creator, and the dignity of our own nature: on the contrary, we were placed here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the happineſs and welfare of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to improve our minds in knowledge, virtue and piety, in order to qualify us for a better and happier ſtate hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore adviſe you, never to have recourſe to diverſions, till once you are fatigued and wearied with buſineſs. By this means you will enjoy them with double pleaſure; whereas, ſhould you make them your employment, inſtead of your amuſement, they will loſe all their reliſh. For it is with diverſions as it is with all other ſenſual pleaſures; the more frequently they are enjoyed, the leſs agreeable do they become; they pall upon the ſenſe, grow taſteleſs and inſipid, and at laſt perfectly nauſeous and irkſome: ſo that, as well from a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035911_0012_1007BEEE84D5E270"/>
regard to your own happineſs, as from a ſenſe of duty, you ſhould take care never to throw away too much of your time upon them. And that you may not be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo, learn to employ yourſelf in ſome more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uſeful buſineſs: for I believe in my conſcience, that it is not ſo much from an immoderate love of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, as for want of ſomething elſe to do, that ſo many young ladies ſquander away the whole of their time in a perpetual round of diverſions.</p>

                  <head>EMPLOYMENT.</head>
                  <p>I AM glad to ſee by your laſt, that you are fully convinced of the truth of what I ſaid concerning dreſs and diverſions, and are ſo ſenſible of the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worth and value of your time, which indeed is the moſt precious treaſure you can poſſeſs, as it is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ground-work of every other bleſſing you enjoy.</p>
                  <p>But precious as our time is, yet there is not any one thing of which we are ſo careleſs, or rather prodigal and profuſe. We either ſquander it away upon mere trifles, or allow it to paſs in a ſtate of liſtleſs indolence, or lazy inactivity. The preſent moment we ſeldom enjoy, or improve to any good purpoſe. We are perpetually bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in forming ſchemes for ſome future and diſtant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; but when that period is come, we neglect it, as we have done thoſe that are already paſt; and then lay new ſchemes for ſome other period more diſtant ſtill: and ſo on without end; till, at laſt arrived on the verge of old age, we begin to take a review of our paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and find that we have conſumed the greateſt part of our time in forming ſchemes and reſolutions; but have hardly ever had the wiſdom and courage to put ſo much as one of them in execution.</p>
                  <p>Such is the picture of a lazy, indolent, and idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for, I believe, even the lazieſt of that lazy tribe have ſtill ſome thoughts of doing better to-morrow; but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035911_0012_1007BEEE84D5E270"/>
to-morrow comes and paſſes like to-day, and another morrow after that; and thus they doze away their whole lives in a kind of waking dream or reverie. Such a conduct us this would be extremely fooliſh and abſurd, even upon the ſuppoſition that they were certain of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at old age, though indeed it were to be wiſhed, for the honour of their character, that they never reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that period, ſince the longer they live, they only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more ridiculous: but when it is conſidered that no one can promiſe herſelf another year, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even another day or hour, then folly is too gentle a name for ſuch a behaviour; it is madneſs, it is phrenzy in the higheſt degree: and yet with this phrenzy and madneſs every perſon may be ſaid to be ſeized, who conſumes her whole life in idleneſs and indolence.</p>
                  <p>But do not miſtake me. I do not mean to inſinuate, by any thing I have now ſaid, that the mind ſhould always be kept on the ſtretch; but this, I think, I may ſafely affirm, that it ought always to be engaged one way or other, either in ſome uſeful and profitable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or in ſome innocent and cheerful diverſion, that it may return to the duties of life with greater vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and alacrity; but never ſhould, by any means, be ſuffered to ruſt in ſloth and inactivity.</p>
                  <p>Idleneſs is a moſt pernicious and fatal vice, whether we conſider its influence on the mind or body. It weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the ſtrength and impairs the beauty of the latter; for an indolent perſon will hardly be at the pains to take ſo much exerciſe as is neceſſary to keep the body in health and vigour. It ſtupifies and benumbs the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for ſhe will not take the trouble to improve it either by reading or converſation. Nay, it will even corrupt and debaſe the heart; for it is inconſiſtent with a ſtate of eaſe and indolence to have the ſtrong but fine affections of love, pity, compaſſion, ſorrow, ſympathy, and the like, frequently awakened and excited in the breaſt: and yet if theſe tender paſſions are not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited either by real or imaginary objects, the heart will gradually become hard and unfeeling, and at laſt perfectly callous and inſenſible.</p>

What makes Miſs Temple trifle away her whole life in an inſipid round of public and private diverſions? Becauſe ſhe has got nothing elſe to do; it is idleneſs working upon the natural levity and giddineſs of her mind. In a word, idleneſs is the parent, or at leaſt the nurſe, of moſt of the follies and vices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to human nature, and from which we might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be preſerved, would we only take care to keep our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves always engaged either in ſome uſeful employment, or innocent amuſement.</p>

                  <head>THE BEAUTY OF VIRTUE.</head>
                  <p>A BEAUTIFUL perſon, with a vicious mind, is no better than a painted ſepulchre, fair and comely without, but ugly and deformed within. A wit, without humanity and good-nature, is a peſt and a nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance; like a venomous waſp, or poiſonous ſerpent, ſhe ſtings and bites every one ſhe meets, without diſtinction of friend or foe. And a perſon of knowledge and learning, without humility and modeſty, is generally a vain, conceited, and prattling pedant.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, a beautiful young lady, if ſhe is virtuous at the ſame time, becomes by that means, at once more virtuous and beautiful: more virtuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her temptations to vice are more frequent and ſtrong; and every time ſhe reſiſts theſe temptations, ſhe gives the moſt convincing proof of her untainted chaſtity and unſpotted honour: more beautiful; for what is beauty? it is not a ſet of features formed with the niceſt ſymmetry and proportion; it is not a complexion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the pureſt white and red; no: but it is both theſe informed, inſpired, lighted up, and animated by the ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of a virtuous mind: it is chaſtity, modeſty,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035911_0013_1007BEF0EF8EC630"/>
good-nature, compaſſion, benevolence, and all the other virtuous diſpoſitions and tender affections ſtreaming forth from the eyes, thoſe windows of the ſoul, and playing in every lineament of the face. Unleſs theſe virtues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the ſoul, and are ſtrongly marked and expreſſed in the countenance, the fineſt features and complexion are little better than the face of a painted baby, or life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtatue: all is dull, dead, and inanimated; or, what is ſtill worſe, groomy, four and ſullen.</p>
                  <p>Hence the graceful bluſh of modeſty, and the pleaſing ſmile of good-nature, ſo frequently and ſo awkwardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by thoſe who are poſſeſſed of neither of theſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but perhaps are remarkable for their oppoſite vices: no matter; they are paying a compliment to virtue; they confeſs, by their hypocriſy and diſſimulation, that the appearance of it is amiable and lovely; and if the appearance of it be lovely, how much more ſo muſt the reality be? The truth is, virtue is the only thing that is good and amiable: ſenſe, wit, knowledge, and learning, are, in their own nature, indifferent; they are either good or bad, juſt as they are well or ill employed. In the hands of a virtuous perſon they may be the means of much good; in the hands of a vicious perſon, they may be the means of much ill: but virtue, in its own nature and conſequences, is certainly and infallibly productive of happineſs, as well to the perſon poſſeſſed of it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as to the world in general.</p>

                  <head>MODESTY.</head>
                  <p>MODESTY is the outward expreſſion of a pure and chaſte mind; and, therefore, every word you ſpeak, every action you perform, every geſture of your body, every look of your eyes; in fine, every thing, by which the inward diſpoſitions of the mind can be expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcovered, comes under the regulation of this virtue.</p>
                  <p>Modeſty, as it relates to dreſs, has already been conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered under that article: as it relates to converſation, it
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035911_0014_1007BEF484016018"/>
has been, in ſome meaſure, explained. After the advice I then gave you to ſhun the lewd and immodeſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of others, it would certainly be unneceſſary to uſe any other arguments to diſſuade you from running into the ſame error yourſelf. There is ſomething in this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſo baſe and vulgar, that I will not even ſuppoſe you capable of a thing at once ſo unpolite and immoral.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more inconſiſtent with modeſty, than to talk with a loud, ſhrill and harſh tone of voice. This is very unbecoming, even in a man, but much more in a woman, and moſt of all in a young woman, whoſe accent ſhould be low, ſmooth and gentle, an emblem of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſoftneſs and delicacy of her mind. It is no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the rules of modeſty, to talk in a poſitive and peremptory ſtrain. This is ſcarce tolerable, even when you are talking of things that cannot be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted; but it is abſolutely intolerable, when you are ſpeaking of matters that are of a doubtful nature, as, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, moſt ſubjects of converſation are. It is the duty of a young lady to talk with an air of diffidence, as if ſhe propoſed what ſhe ſaid, rather with a view to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation herſelf, than to inform and inſtruct the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>Modeſty, as it regards the countenance, and eſpecially the expreſſion of the eyes, is no leſs worthy of your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe, perhaps, it appears more in this than in any one thing whatever. Young as you are, you cannot be ignorant, that all the different paſſions of the mind may be painted and expreſſed in the countenance. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and meekneſs, joy and ſorrow, love and hatred, pride and humility, impudence and modeſty, have each a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular air of the face, naturally adapted to expreſs them; and whatever paſſion happens to be uppermoſt in the mind, the countenance will take its tincture and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thence. Though I know the face is ſometimes a falſe glaſs, ſtill I am perſuaded it is often a true one; and that the countenance is often a faithful picture of the mind.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the only way to have a modeſt look, a modeſt gait, or a modeſt behaviour, in general, is to have a modeſt mind. Without this, all the formality, gravity,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035911_0014_1007BEF484016018"/>
and grimace, in the world, will ſignify nothing; for, though by this means, you may be able to impoſe upon the thoughtleſs and ignorant, yet the ſenſible and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious obſerver will always ſee through the maſk, and perhaps but deſpiſe you the more for your hypocritical ſolemnity. But do not miſtake me; while I adviſe you to be modeſt, I do not adviſe you to be ſheepiſh and baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; far from it. Modeſty and ſheepiſhneſs, however alike they may be in appearance, are as different in their nature as any two things can well be. A modeſt perſon will not talk too much or two high in company, becauſe ſhe knows it is improper: a ſheepiſh perſon will hardly talk at all, or at leaſt not ſo as to be underſtood, becauſe ſhe is afraid. A modeſt perſon looks with a decent aſſurance; a ſheepiſh one is abaſhed, and bluſhes at ſhe don't know what. A modeſt perſon will never contradict the general taſte of the company, unleſs it be inconſiſtent with decency and good manners; a ſhepiſh perſon will hardly contradict it, even when it is. The one acts from principle, the other from mere inſtinct; the one is guided by the rules of right reaſon, and therefore is conſiſtent in her conduct; the other is guided by no rules at all, and conſequently has no uniformity of character.</p>
                  <p>Let me adviſe you carefully to guard againſt falſe modeſty, which is one of the greateſt enemies of virtue, and perhaps has betrayed young people into as many vices as the moſt abandoned impudence. Never be ſo extremely modeſt as to comply with any thing that is bad, how much ſoever it may be in vogue; nor ever be aſhamed to follow what is good, however ſingular or uncommon.</p>
                  <p>True modeſty is meant to be the preſerver, not the betrayer of your virtue; it will be a kind of guard and protection to your chaſtity; it will ſecure you from the rudeneſs and impertinence of the impudent and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned part of the other ſex. There is ſuch a dignity and majeſty in a modeſt behaviour, as never fails to command reſpect: it confounds and abaſhes even the moſt prodigate, and makes them either aſhamed or
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035911_0015_1007BEF60FB9B608"/>
afraid of giving vent to their low and obſcene ribaldry, when they are ſure it will be received with a bluſh or frown, with contempt or averſion.</p>

                  <head>GOOD-NATURE.</head>
                  <p>THE virtue directly oppoſed to anger and peeviſhneſs, and which I would recommend to your ſtudy and practice, is humanity and good-nature; a certain meekneſs of temper and gentleneſs of diſpoſition, that makes us happy in ourſelves, and prompts us to communicate happineſs to all around us. This temper of mind, it muſt be confeſſed, is rather the gift of nature than the attainment of art. Some people are born with ſuch a happy conſtitution, that hardly any thing can diſturb or diſcompoſe them. The former may be ſaid to be more happy than the latter, but not more virtuous, for nothing deſerves the name of virtue that is not of our own acquiſition: and, however difficult the taſk may appear, yet this virtue of good-nature, may, in ſome meaſure be acquired by every one who will apply herſelf to the ſtudy of it with care and diligence.</p>
                  <p>In order to excite you to the ſtudy and practice of good-nature, let me entreat you to conſider the many happy effects that flow from it. It is an inexhauſtible fund of inward peace and tranquillity. What the wiſe man ſays of a good conſcience (without which, perhaps, good-nature cannot exiſt, at leaſt not in its higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) may properly enough be applied to this virtue, to wit, that it is "a continual feaſt." A perſon bleſſed with this happy temper of mind, poſſeſſes within herſelf a never-failing ſource of joy and pleaſure: ſhe derives happineſs from almoſt every incident and occurrence of life, even from thoſe, which to the peeviſh and ill-natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the cauſe of pain and uneaſineſs.

                  <p>TO take a ſincere pleaſure in the bleſſings and excellencies of others, is a much ſurer mark of benevolence than to pity their calamities; and you muſt always acknowledge yourſelf ungenerous and ſelfiſh, whenever you are leſs ready to "rejoice with them that do rejoice," than to "weep with them that weep."</p>
                  <p>If ever your commendations of others are forced from you by the fear of betraying your envy, or if ever you feel a ſecret deſire to mention ſomething that may abate the admiration given them, do not try to conceal the baſe diſpoſition from yourſelf, ſince that is not the way to cure it.</p>
                  <p>Human nature is ever liable to corruption, and has in it the ſeeds of every vice, as well as of every virtue; and the firſt will be continually ſhooting forth and growing up, if not carefully watched and rooted out as faſt as they appear. It is the buſineſs of religion to purify and exalt us from a ſtate of imperfection and infirmity, to that which is neceſſary and eſſential to happineſs. Envy would make us miſerable in heaven itſelf, could it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there; for we muſt there ſee beings far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and conſequently more happy than ourſelves; and, till we can rejoice in ſeeing virtue rewarded in proportion to its degree, we can never hope to be among the number of the bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Watch, then, my dear child, and obſerve every evil propenſity of your heart, that you may in time correct it, with the aſſiſtance of that grace which alone can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the evils of our nature, and which you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and earneſtly implore.</p>

                  <p>FRIENDSHIP, in the higheſt ſenſe of the word, can only ſubſiſt between perſons of ſtrict integrity, and true generoſity. Before you fancy yourſelf poſſeſſed

of ſuch a treaſure, you ſhould examine the value of your own heart, and ſee how well it is qualified for ſo ſacred a connexion: and then a harder taſk remains, to find out whether the object of your affection is alſo endued with the ſame virtuous diſpoſition. Youth and inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience are ill able to penetrate into characters; the leaſt appearance of good attracts their admiration, and they immediately ſuppoſe they have found the object they purſued.</p>
                  <p>It is a melancholy conſideration, that the judgment can only be formed by experience, which generally comes too late for one's own uſe, and is ſeldom accepted for that of others. I fear it is in vain for me to tell you what dangerous miſtakes I made in the early choice of friends; how incapable I then was of finding out ſuch as were fit for me, and how little I was acquainted with the true nature of friendſhip, when I thought myſelf moſt fervently engaged in it! I am ſenſible all this will hardly perſuade you to chooſe by the eyes of others, or even to ſuſpect that your own may be deceived.</p>
                  <p>A due regard to reputation is an indiſpenſable qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the choice of a friend. "Have regard to thy name," ſaith the wiſe ſon of Sirach, "for tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The young perſon who is careleſs of blame, and indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the eſteem of the wiſe and prudent part of the world, is not only a moſt dangerous companion, but gives a certain proof of the want of rectitude in her own mind. Diſcretion is the guardian of all virtues, and when ſhe forſakes them, they cannot long reſiſt the attacks of an enemy. There is a profligacy of ſpirit in defying the rules of decorum, and deſpiſing cenſure, which ſeldom ends otherwiſe than in extreme corruption, and utter ruin. Modeſty and prudence are qualities that early diſplay themſelves, and are eaſily diſcerned; where theſe do not appear, you ſhould avoid, not only friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but every ſtep towards intimacy, leſt your own character ſhould ſuffer along with that of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; but where they ſhine forth in any eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, you may ſafely cultivate an acquaintance, in the reaſonable hope of finding the ſolid fruits of virtue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath

ſuch ſweet and promiſing bloſſoms; ſhould you be diſappointed, you will at leaſt have run no riſk in the ſearch after them, and may cheriſh as a creditable acquaintance the perſon ſo adorned, though ſhe may not deſerve a place in your inmoſt heart.</p>
                  <p>Fancy, I know, will have her ſhare in friendſhip, as well as in love. You muſt pleaſe, as well as ſerve me, before I can love you as a friend of my heart. But the talents that pleaſe for an evening, may not pleaſe for life. The humorous man ſoon runs through his ſtock of odd ſtories, mimicry, and jeſts; and the wit, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repeated flaſhes, confounds and tires one's intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, inſtead of enlivening it with agreeable ſurprize; but good ſenſe can neither tire nor wear out; it improves by exerciſe, and increaſes in value the more it is known: the pleaſure it gives in converſation is laſting and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, becauſe it is accompanied with improvement: Its worth is proportioned to the occaſion that calls for it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But family friendſhips are friendſhips made for us, if I may ſo ſpeak, by God himſelf! With kindeſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he has knit the bands of family love, by indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable duties; and wretched are they, who have burſt them aſunder by violence and ill-will, or worn them out by conſtant little diſobligations, and by the want of that attention to pleaſe, which the preſence of a ſtranger always inſpires, but which is often moſt ſhamefully neglected towards thoſe whom it is moſt our duty and intereſt to pleaſe. May you, my dear, be wiſe enough to ſee that every faculty of entertainment, every engaging qualification which you poſſeſs, is excited to the beſt advantage for thoſe, whoſe love is of the moſt importance to you—for thoſe who live under the ſame roof, and with whom you are connected in life, either by the ties of blood, or by the ſtill more ſacred ties of a voluntary engagement.</p>
                  <p>Converſation, which is ſo apt to grow dull and inſipid in families, nay, in ſome to be almoſt wholly laid aſide,

muſt be cultivated with frankneſs and openneſs of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and by the mutual communication of whatever may conduce to the improvement or innocent entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each other.</p>
                  <p>Reading, whether apart, or in common, will furniſh uſeful and pleaſing ſubjects, and the ſprightlineſs of youth will naturally inſpire harmleſs mirth and native humour, if encouraged by a mutual deſire of diverting each other, and making the hours paſs agreeably in your own houſe: every amuſement that offers, will be heightened by the participation of theſe dear companions, and by talking over every incident together, and every object of pleaſure. If you have any acquired talent for entertainment, ſuch as muſic, painting, or the like, your own family are thoſe before whom you ſhould moſt wiſh to excel, and for whom you ſhould always be ready to exert yourſelf, not ſuffering the talents you have gained, perhaps by their means, and at their expenſe, to lie dormant, till the arrival of a ſtranger gives you ſpirit in the performance. Where this laſt is the caſe, you may be ſure vanity is the only motive of the exertion: but how little ſenſibility has that heart, which is not more gratified by the ſilent pleaſure painted on the countenance of a partial parent, or of an affectionate brother, than by the empty compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a viſitor, who is, perhaps, inwardly, more diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ridicule and criticiſe, than to admire you.</p>

                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:035911_0017_1007BEFA150F72F0"/>The firſt and greateſt point is to lay out our general plan of living in a juſt proportion to our fortune and rank: if theſe two will not coincide, the laſt muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly give way; for, if you have right principles, you cannot fail of being wretched under the ſenſe of the injuſtice as well as danger of ſpending beyond your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and your diſtreſs will be continually increaſing. No mortifications, which you can ſuffer in retrenching in your appearance, can be comparable to this unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If you would enjoy the real comforts of affluence, you ſhould lay your plan conſiderably within your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not for the pleaſure of amaſſing wealth; though, where there is a growing family, it is an abſolute duty to lay by ſomething every year: but to provide for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, and to have the power of indulging your choice in the diſpoſal of the overplus, either in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pleaſures, or to increaſe your funds for charity and generoſity, which are in fact the true funds of pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>In your table, as in your dreſs, and in all other things, I wiſh you to aim at propriety and neatneſs; or, if your eſtate demands it, elegancy, rather than ſuperfluous figure: to go beyond your ſphere, either in dreſs, or in the appearance of your table, indicates a greater fault in your character than to be too much within it. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to enter into the minutiae of the table: good ſenſe and obſervation on the beſt models, muſt form your taſte, and a due regard to what you can afford, muſt reſtrain it.</p>
                  <p>Ladies, who are fond of needle-work, generally chooſe to conſider that as a principal part of good houſewifery: and, though I cannot look upon it as of equal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the due regulation of a family, yet, in a middling rank, and with a moderate fortune, it is a neceſſary part of a woman's duty, and a conſiderable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in expenſe is ſaved by it. Many young ladies make almoſt every thing they wear; by which means they can make a genteel figure at a ſmall expenſe. This, in your ſtation, is the moſt profitable and deſirable kind of work: and, as much of it as you can do, conſiſtently with a due attention to your health, to the improvement of your mind, and to the diſcharge of other duties, I
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035911_0018_1007BEFCA8A62890"/>
ſhould think highly commendable. Abſolute idleneſs is inexcuſable in a woman, becauſe the needle is always at hand for thoſe intervals, in which ſhe cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employed. If you are induſtrious, and if you keep good hours, you will find time for all your employments. Early riſing, and a good diſpoſition of time, is eſſential to economy.</p>
                  <p>The neatneſs and order of your houſe and furniture, is a part of economy, which will greatly affect your appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and character, and to which you muſt yourſelf give attention; ſince it is not poſſible even for the rich and great to rely wholly on the care of ſervants, in ſuch points, without their being often neglected. The more magnificently a houſe is furniſhed, the more one is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with that air of confuſion, which often prevails where attention is wanting in the owner. But, on the other hand, there is a kind of neatneſs, which gives a lady the air of a houſe-maid, and makes her exceſſively troubleſome to every body, and particularly to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: in this, as in all branches of economy, I wiſh you to avoid all parade and buſtle. Thoſe ladies, who pique themſelves on the particular excellence of neatneſs, are very apt to forget that the decent order of a houſe ſhould be deſigned to promote the convenience and pleaſure of thoſe who are to be in it; and that, if it is converted into a cauſe of trouble and conſtraint, their huſbands and gueſts would be happier without it. The love of fame, that univerſal paſſion, will ſometimes ſhew itſelf on ſtrangely inſignificant ſubjects; and a perſon, who acts for praiſe only, will always go beyond the mark in every thing. The beſt ſign of a houſe being well governed is that nobody's attention is called to any of the little affairs of it, but all goes on ſo well of courſe that one is not led to make remarks upon any thing, nor to obſerve any extraordinary effort that produces the general reſult of eaſe and elegance, which prevails without.</p>

                  <p>THE utmoſt happineſs we can hope for in this world is contentment; and, if we aim at any thing higher, we ſhall meet with nothing but grief and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.</p>
                  <p>A ſure method to ſecure content, will be to obſerve the following rules; firſt, never to ſee ſuperiors with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; ſecondly, to reflect on the various calamities and misfortunes that human nature is ſubject to; and, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to form a regular impartial compariſon, between ourſelves and thoſe who are placed below us in the enjoyments of life. Thoſe conſiderations will fortify and ſtrengthen the mind againſt the impreſſions of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; will reconcile it to the natural diſtreſſes that befal it, and will prepare it for the enjoyment of peace and tranquillity. Great inconveniences attend running into any extreme. Much of our happineſs depends upon an evenneſs of temper; in not ſuffering the ſcale of our reaſon to mount us too high, in the ſeaſon of proſperity, nor to ſink us too low with the weight of adverſe fortune. Wherefore, my advice is, that you never may exult im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately, upon a new acceſſion of good, nor be abject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt down, at the ſudden approach of evil. The true regard of your own private ſatisfaction, ſhould incline you to ſtability and reſignation, upon any change, and to keep your ſpirits always calm and even; becauſe your life would be a labyrinth of perplexities without it. Had you all the deſirable properties in the world, you could be no more than pleaſed and contented with them; and, if by a right way of thinking, you can reconcile yourſelf to your own condition, you will fall very little ſhort of the moſt complete happineſs that mortals can enjoy.</p>

                  <p>CHASTITY is the next virtue that is to fall under your conſideration: no charm can ſupply its place: without it, beauty is unlovely; wit is mean and wanton; quality contemptible, and good breeding worthleſs. Chaſtity is ſo eſſential and natural to your ſex, that every declination from it is a proportionable receding from womanhood. An immodeſt woman is a kind of monſter, diſtorted from its proper form. She who forfeits her chaſtity, withers by degrees into ſcorn and contrition; but ſhe who lives up to its rules, ever flouriſhes, like a roſe in June, with all her virgin graces about her—ſweet to the ſenſe, and lovely to the eye. Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity heightens all the virtues, which it accompanies; and ſets off every great talent that human nature can be poſſeſſed of. It is not only an ornament, but alſo a guard to virtue. This is the great point of female hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and the leaſt ſlip in a woman's honour is never to be recovered.</p>
                  <p>This, more than any other virtue, places your ſex in the eſteem of ours; and invites even thoſe to admire it, who have the baſeneſs to profane it. I therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to your approbation, in the minuteſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Chaſtity is a kind of quick and delicate feeling in the ſoul, which makes her ſhrink, and withdraw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035911_0019_1007BF0075546F70"/>
from every thing that is wanton, or has danger in it. This makes it ſo great a check to looſe thoughts, that I preſcribe to you the practice of it in your greateſt ſolitudes, as if the beſt judges were to ſee and cenſure all you do.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of one Lucretia, a Roman lady, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been raviſhed by Sextus, eldeſt ſon to Tarquin, the king of the country, ſhe took a dagger in her hand; and, after having publickly exhorted her relations to revenge her injury on the barbarous raviſher, ſhe plunged it in her boſom, at once putting an end to her life and her diſgrace. And ſuch was the opinion which the Romans entertained of this crime, as well as of the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which followed the commiſſion of it, that the whole nation roſe in arms, and not only dethroned the king, and baniſhed the royal family, but even, if I may ſo ſpeak, baniſhed kings, in general, making a decree, that, for the future, no king ſhould ever ſway the ſceptre over the Roman people, but that their government, inſtead of a monarchy, ſhould thenceforth become a republic.</p>

Let no pretence of your being in the right, ever provoke you to anſwer her with indifference or contempt. You muſt love her, and be grieved at every thing that diſquiets her. You are to pleaſe her in all circumſtances; to comfort her on all occaſions; to obey her commands with pleaſure; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult her in all affairs, and to reverence all her precepts.

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035911_0020_1007BF03124BCAC8"/>
as the human ſoul is, can naturally have no internal principle of corruption, or be ſubject to annihilation; and hence ariſes a certainty of its being a particle of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and eternal eſſence. Again, its love of exiſtence; its hopes of undying happineſs; its ſatisfaction in the practice of virtue; its remorſe on the commiſſion of vice; and the delight it takes, in the contemplation of its divine original, are irreſiſtible proofs of its immortal nature. He muſt be loſt in ſtupidity, who can either imagine, or believe, that a thinking being, which is in a perpetual progreſs of improvement, that is always capable of new accompliſhments and further enlargements, and is ſtill travelling on, from perfection to perfection, ſhould, in the beginning of her inquiries, and after a few diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of her own excellencies and acquirements, fall away into nothing, and periſh with corruption. Beſides, the juſtice, wiſdom, goodneſs and veracity of God, are all concerned in the proof of her eternity. In this world, man, let his talents be ever ſo great, and his labour ever ſo conſtant, can never take in his full meaſure of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge; can never eſtabliſh his ſoul in virtue, or come up to the perfection of his nature. Would it then agree with the infinite juſtice and wiſdom of God, to create ſuch noble beings, for ſo mean a purpoſe, as to periſh with the beaſts of the field? That would be, to give us reaſon to be abortive, talents not to be exerted, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities not to be gratified; which would deſtroy that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and goodneſs of the Deity, that ſhines through all his works.</p>
                  <p>We are to look upon this world as a nurſery for the next, and are only to receive our firſt rudiments of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here, and afterwards to be tranſplanted into eternal dominions; where our immortal ſouls will ſtill be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge to knowledge, and virtue to virtue; and will ſhine forever with new acceſſions of glory to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This is the triumphant pleaſure of our ſouls: this is the higheſt perfection of our nature; and it muſt be a proſpect pleaſing even to God himſelf, to ſee his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drawing nearer to him by greater degrees of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>

                  <head>RELIGION.</head>
                  <p>HITHERTO you have "thought as a child, and underſtood as a child; but it is time to put away childiſh things."—If you deſire to live in peace and honour, in favour with God and man, and to die in the glorious hope of riſing from the grave to a life of endleſs happineſs; if theſe things appear worthy your ambition, you muſt ſet out in earneſt in the purſuit of them. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and happineſs are not attained by chance, nor by a cold and languid approbation; they muſt be ſought with ardour, attended to with diligence, and every aſſiſtance muſt be eagerly embraced, that may enable you to obtain them. Conſider that good and evil are now before you; that, if you do not heartily chooſe and love the one, you muſt undoubtedly be the wretched victim of the other.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſtep muſt be to awaken your mind to a ſenſe of the importance of the taſk before you; which is no leſs than to bring your frail nature to that degree of Chriſtian perfection, which is to qualify it for immortality, and, without which it is neceſſarily incapable of happineſs; for, it is a truth never to be forgotten, that God has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed happineſs to virtue, and miſery to vice, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature of things; and that a wicked being (while he continues ſuch) is in a natural incapacity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying happineſs, even with the concurrence of all thoſe outward circumſtances, which in a virtuous mind would produce it.</p>
                  <p>As there are degrees of virtue and vice, ſo there are of reward and puniſhment, both here and hereafter: but do not aim only at eſcaping the dreadful doom of the wicked; let your deſires take a nobler flight, and aſpire after thoſe tranſcendant honours, and that brighter crown of glory, which await thoſe who have excelled in virtue; and let the animating thought, that every ſecret effort to gain his favour is noted by your all-ſeeing Judge, and that he will, with infinite mercy, proportion his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your labour, excite every faculty of your ſoul to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035911_0021_1007BF05425A7E48"/>
pleaſe and ſerve him. To this end, you muſt inform your underſtanding what you ought to believe and to do. You muſt correct and purify your heart; cheriſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all its good affections; and continually mortify thoſe that are evil. You muſt form and govern your temper and manners, according to the laws of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and juſtice, and qualify yourſelf, by all means in your power, for an uſeful and agreeable member of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. All this, you ſee, is no light buſineſs, nor can it be performed without a ſincere and earneſt application of the mind, as to its great and conſtant object.</p>
                  <p>True devotion is not a melancholy ſentiment that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the ſpirits, and excludes the ideas of pleaſure which youth is ſo fond of: on the contrary, there is nothing ſo friendly to enjoyment, ſo productive of true pleaſure, ſo peculiarly ſuited to the warmth and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of a youthful heart. Do not therefore think it too ſoon to turn your mind to God; but offer him the firſt fruits of your underſtanding and affections: and be aſſured, that the more you increaſe in love to him, and delight in his laws, the more you will increaſe in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in excellence and honour;—that, in proportion as you improve in true piety, you will become dear and amiable to your fellow creatures, contented and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in yourſelf, and qualified to enjoy the beſt bleſſings of this life, as well as to inherit the glorious promiſe of immortality.</p>
                  <p>What an example is ſet before us in our bleſſed Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! How is his whole life, from his earlieſt youth, ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated to the purſuit of true wiſdom, and to the practice of the moſt exalted virtue! When you ſee him, at twelve years of age, in the temple, amongſt the doctors, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and aſking them queſtions, on the ſubject of religion, and aſtoniſhing them with his underſtanding and anſwers,—you will ſay perhaps, "Well might the Son of God, even at thoſe years, be far wiſer than the aged; but can a mortal child emulate ſuch heavenly wiſdom? Can ſuch a pattern be propoſed to my imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?" Yes, my dear, remember that he hath bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you his heavenly wiſdom, as far as concerns your good. He has left you ſuch declarations of his will,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035911_0022_1007BF06E4A04050"/>
and of the conſequences of your actions, as you are, even now, fully able to underſtand, if you will but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them. If then you will imitate his zeal for knowledge, if you will delight in gaining information and improvement, you may even now become "wiſe unto ſalvation." Unmoved by the praiſe he acquired amongſt theſe learned men, you ſee him meekly return to the ſubjection of a child under thoſe who appeared to be his parents, though he was in reality their Lord: you ſee him return to live with them, to work for them, and to be the joy and ſolace of their lives; till the time came, when he was to enter on that ſcene of public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which his heavenly Father had ſent him, from his own right hand, to take upon him the form of a poor carpenter's ſon. What a leſſon of humility is this, and of obedience to parents! When having received the glorious teſtimony from heaven, of his being the beloved Son of the Moſt High, he enters on his public miniſtry, —what an example does he give us, of the moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and conſtant benevolence! How are all his hours ſpent in doing good to the ſouls and bodies of men! Not the meaneſt ſinner is below his notice: to reclaim and ſave them, he condeſcends to converſe familiarly with the moſt corrupt, as well as the moſt abject. All his miracles are wrought to benefit mankind; not one to puniſh and afflict them. Inſtead of uſing the almighty power, which accompanied him, to the purpoſe of exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, and treading down his enemies, he makes no other uſe of it, than to heal and to ſave.</p>

                  <head>A MODEL OF CONDUCT FOR ONE DAY.</head>
                  <p>THE ſureſt way you can take, to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſuch miſtaken, periſhing enjoyments, as this world can boaſt, is to put yourſelf under the neceſſity of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how one day goes through your hands, and let vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſincerity, and religion be the rules of actions for that day. Oblige yourſelf to a certain order of time, in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035911_0022_1007BF06E4A04050"/>
your devotions, in your buſineſs, in your retirements, amuſements, recreations, and pleaſures. Let your firſt care be to pleaſe the Deity, who preſides over all your cheerful hours, and innocent converſations; the next to avoid the reproaches of your own heart; and the next, to eſcape the cenſures of the world. A lady is never ſo ſure of her conduct; as when the verdict ſhe paſſes upon her own behaviour is confirmed by the opinion of all that know her. By an obſervation of theſe rules, you will come to a diſcovery of all the foibles that lurk in the ſecret corners of your ſoul; and will ſoon arrive at a true and impartial knowledge of yourſelf. You are likewiſe carefully to conſider, how far you deſerve the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, with which the world favours you: whether your actions proceed from worthy motives, and how far you are really poſſeſt of thoſe virtues, that they imagine you are. Friends may not ſee our faults; they may be partial and conceal them from us; or elſe they may ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, ſo as to reconcile us to them, and make them appear too trivial to be taken notice of. I therefore, cannot think it improper, to conſult, what character we bear among our enemies, whoſe malice (though it may inflame our imperfections, and expoſe them in too ſtrong a light) has frequently ſome ground for what it advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. By the reproaches which an enemy caſts upon us, our eyes are opened to ſeveral blemiſhes and defects in our conduct, which otherwiſe would eſcape our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The exerciſe of ſome ſocial virtue or other will fall in your way almoſt every day in your life. To relieve the needy, and comfort the diſtreſſed; to make allowance for the ſtips and defects of others; to adviſe the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and ſoften the envious; to rectify the prejudiced, and quiet the angry; to ſilence detraction, and juſtify the deſerving; to overlook hatred, and forgive an injury; to mitigate the fierceneſs of others, and to ſubdue our own paſſions; are virtues that may give daily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the moſt induſtrious tempers, and in the moſt active ſtation of life. Thoſe are exerciſes ſuited to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, and always bring delight to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet manager.</p>

                  <head>POLITENESS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</head>
                  <p>WHILST you labour to enrich your mind with the eſſential virtues of chriſtianity—with piety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, meekneſs, humility, integrity, and purity, and to make yourſelf uſeful in domeſtic management, I would not have you neglect to purſue thoſe graces and acquirements, which may ſet your virtue in the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous light, adorn your manners, and enlarge your underſtanding; and this not in the ſpirit of vanity, but in the innocent and laudable view of rendering your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more uſeful and pleaſing to your fellow creatures, and conſequently more acceptable to God. Politeneſs of behaviour, and the attaining ſuch branches of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, and ſuch arts and accompliſhments as are proper to your ſex, capacity, and ſtation, will prove ſo valuable to yourſelf through life, and will make you ſo deſirable a companion, that the neglect of them may reaſonably be deemed a neglect of duty, ſince it is undoubtedly our duty to cultivate the powers entruſted to us, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves as perfect as we can.</p>
                  <p>You muſt have often obſerved that nothing is ſo ſtrong a recommendation on a ſlight acquaintance as polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor does it loſe its value by time or intimacy, when preſerved, as it ought to be, in the neareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, and ſtricteſt friendſhips. This delightful qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification, ſo univerſally admired and reſpected, but ſo rarely poſſeſſed in any eminent degree, cannot but be a conſiderable object of my wiſhes for you; nor ſhould either of us be diſcouraged by the apprehenſion that neither I am capable of teaching, nor you of learning it, in perfection; ſince whatever degree you attain will am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply reward our pains.</p>
                  <p>Whatever tends to embelliſh your fancy, to enlighten your underſtanding, and furniſh you with ideas to reflect upon when alone, or to converſe upon in company, is certainly well worth your acquiſition. The wretched expedient, to which ignorance ſo often drives our ſex,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035911_0023_1007BF0ADC3A9BB8"/>
of calling in ſlander to enliven the tedious inſipidity of converſation, would alone be a ſufficient reaſon for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching your mind with innocent ſubjects of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may render you a fit companion for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſenſe and knowledge, from whom you may reap the moſt deſirable improvements; for, though I think reading indiſpenſably neceſſary to the due cultivation of your mind, I prefer the converſation of ſuch perſons to every other method of inſtruction: but this you cannot hope to enjoy, unleſs you qualify yourſelf to bear a part in ſuch ſociety, by at leaſt a moderate ſhare of reading.</p>
                  <p>Natural philoſophy, in the largeſt ſenſe of expreſſion, is too wide a field for you to undertake; but the ſtudy of nature, as far as may ſuit your powers and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, you will find a moſt ſublime entertainment: the objects of this ſtudy are all the ſtupendous works of the Almighty hand that lie within the reach of our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the works of man, perfection is aimed at, but it can only be found in thoſe of the Creator. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of perfection muſt produce delight; and every natural object around you will offer this delight, if it could attract your attention:—if you ſurvey the earth, every leaf that trembles in the breeze, every blade of graſs beneath your feet is a wonder as abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of human art to imitate as the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the univerſe. Endleſs pleaſures, to thoſe who have a taſte for them, might be derived from the endleſs variety to be ſound in the compoſition of this globe and its inhabitants. The foſſil, the vegetable, and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal world, gradually riſing in the ſcale of excellence; the innumerable ſpecies of each which preſerve their ſpecific difference from age to age, yet of which no two individuals are ever perfectly alike—afford ſuch a range of obſervation and inquiry as might engroſs the whole term of our ſhort life, if followed minutely. Beſides all the animal creation, obvious to our unaſſiſted ſenſes, the eye, aided by philoſophical inventions, ſees myriads of creatures, which by the ignorant are not known to have exiſtence; it ſees all nature teem with life; every fluid, each part of every vegetable and animal ſwarm with its peculiar inhabitants, inviſible to the naked eye,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035911_0024_1007BF0E9A848748"/>
but as perfect in all their parts, and enjoying life as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably as the elephant or the whale.</p>
                  <p>But, if from the earth, and from theſe minute won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the philoſophic eye is raiſed towards the heavens, what a ſtupendous ſcene, there, opens to its view! Thoſe brilliant lights, that ſparkle to the eye of ignorance as gems adorning the ſky, or as lamps to guide the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, aſſume an importance that amazes the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! They appear to be worlds, formed like ours for a variety of inhabitants; or ſuns, enlightening numberleſs other worlds too diſtant for diſcovery! I ſhall ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the aſtoniſhment and rapture with which my mind received this idea, when I was about your age: it was then perfectly new to me, and it was impoſſible to deſcribe the ſenſations which I felt from the glorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> boundleſs proſpect of infinite beneficence burſting at once upon my imagination! Who can contemplate ſuch a ſcene unmoved? if your curioſity is excited to enter upon this noble inquiry, a few boooks on the ſubject, and thoſe of the eaſieſt ſort, with ſome of the common experiments, may be ſufficient for your purpoſe; which is, to enlarge your mind, and to excite in it the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gratitude and profound adoration towards that great and good Being, who exerts his boundleſs power in communicating various portions of happineſs through all the immenſe regions of creation.</p>

I had theſe paſte book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les lately ſent home; they were bought of the Prince of Wales' jeweller: what pedlar ſet yours? I never ſaw any thing ſo vulgar. I put mine on for the firſt time when I ſung at a private concert before the Prince. For you muſt know, that I am allowed to ſing charmingly; Lord Smoothtongue, who dined at our houſe the other day, ſaid that I had a fine angelic Italian voice. He ſpoke in French to me too for half an hour, and declared, that I prattled like a native of France. I ſhall ſoon begin to learn Italian; it is not very difficult; but nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is difficult to me; I ſhall be able to ſpeak it in ſix months.</p>
                  <p>Thus did ſhe run on, till poor Mary was quite weary of her fooliſh pride and chat, and longed to leave her, to enjoy her vain thoughts alone.

She walked up and down the path with a grave ſtep, looking at them as if ſhe expected to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by ſome one, to play with them; but no one took notice of her. She paſſed by with a pretty pocket-book in her hand, hoping that they would aſk to ſee it, and admire its ſilver claſp and enamelled figures.

                  <p>Leonora perceiving that they were laughing at her, turned away bluſhing with anger, and at laſt began to weep, becauſe ſhe could not vent her paſſion on them.</p>
                  <p>Then ſhe happened to meet her father, who was a ſenſible man, and ſaw with pain that his wife ſpoiled her daughter. What is the matter with you? Why do you weep? Has any accident befallen you? How ſhould I laugh, anſwered ſhe; thoſe children have no manners. They ſit there together, and laugh and play without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting me. They appear what they are, poor vulgar creatures; I ought not to have expected better from them. Would you believe it, when I paſſed by, they laughed me out of countenance.

                  <p>I, anſwered ſhe; I have done nothing to them; I would not demean myſelf to quarrel with ſuch—. She ſtopped ſhort, becauſe ſhe ſaw a frown on her father's brow. She then related to him, that ſhe had only informed them how her ſinging was admired, and that ſhe ſpoke French remarkably well. I told them indeed, added ſhe, that I was ſoon to learn Italian, and kept them at a diſtance, that they might not tear my lace, they were ſo rude. Leonora! Leonora! ſaid he, you have acted very ſimply. If you wiſh to be reſpected and loved, and that people ſhould like to be in your company, you muſt not always ſpeak of yourſelf and your talents, for you will then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly diſguſt them.

I am not ſurpriſed that they laughed at you. If a man were to be in my company, who only talked of himſelf, and took care to let me ſee that he thought me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, becauſe he had a larger fortune than myſelf, I ſhould laugh in his face.

She had been brought up by a relation; and, in her childhood, been with thoughtleſs, idle people; and had learned from them the dreadful cuſtom of ſlandering, or ſpeaking ill of every body. Mrs. Jones did not yet know her evil propenſity: ſhe took her arm in a friendly manner, and ſaid, your ſiſter's marriage with ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man gave me great pleaſure. I congratulate you, and ſincerely wiſh that they may all their lives enjoy the happineſs they merit. Hannah (for that was the name of this malicious girl) thanked her coldly for the part ſhe took in the happineſs of her family. But, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, with a ſneering laugh, I know not whether the doctor's happineſs, or, if you pleaſe, the profeſſor's, will be ſo very great. Now it is only the honey-moon. But when he has his wife at home a month or two, he will ſoon ſee what a fine choice he has made. I really do not know what he will do with her. She knows nothing of the management of a family; and ſhe has ſuch a bad temper, God help thoſe who are to live always with her! for my part, I am very glad that ſhe is now out of our houſe. The worthy profeſſor will have trouble enough with her; but then, (ſhe laughed again)
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035911_0026_1007BF1275FA09F8"/>
the worthy profeſſor has no right to find fault with her. I know him, and know all his tricks. I muſt not mention them: but, Mrs. Jones, if you knew what I know, you would form quite a different opinion of him.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones now teſtified her ſurpriſe, and aſſured her that ſhe never had heard any thing but good of him and her ſiſter. Beſides, Mr. Goodman had praiſed them, and he was certainly a worthy, ſenſible man.</p>
                  <p>He may be a learned man, anſwered Hannah, but he is nothing more. He leaves all things at ſixes and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens; and if any one will give him a glaſs of wine, he will ſay all that is kind and good of them for it. I do not love to ſpeak ill of others; but I know very well what they ſay of his wife; ha! ha! ha! ſhe can ſkin a flint in the management of her houſe; you will ſee more ſunſhine than bread there, I fear.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones earneſtly endeavoured to defend her friends; for ſhe knew them, and would not ſuffer ſuch artful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umny to ſhake her good opinion. But the more ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their characters, the more ill this malicious girl ſaid of them. She then turned the converſation to other perſons; and ſhe had ſomething bad to tell of every one. Mrs. Jones liſtened above half an hour to theſe malicious ſlanders, for ſhe could not ſtop her: unable to bear it any longer with patience, ſhe looked at her with contempt, and abruptly interrupted her. Madam, ſaid ſhe to her, you have recollected ſomething ill of every perſon you have mentioned; I ſhould be glad to hear you, juſt to turn the torrent, ſay ſomething good of them.</p>
                  <p>How can I help it, ſaid ſhe, if people are not better? How can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t I ſpeak well of them, when they have nothing good in them?</p>
                  <p>What, continued Mrs. Jones, are you not aſhamed of yourſelf? Have you heard nothing good of any of thoſe perſons you have been calumniating? I love and eſteem them all, becauſe I know them to be good; but if I only believed half what you have ſaid of them, they would ſink ſo low in my opinion, that they would forfeit the place they have in my eſteem: I ſhould be forced to deſpiſe them, as being deſtitute of virtue and honour.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035911_0027_1007BF1606D96330"/>
Is not this deteſtable? Hannah! Hannah! if you robbed me of my watch or purſe, it would be very wrong; but it would not be ſo blameable an action as ſlandering, if you deprived me of my reputation, and thus robbed me of my honour! However precious my watch may be, I can purchaſe another if it be ſtolen; but gold cannot rub out the ſtains you might fix on my good name. But only think how much you have injured yourſelf. How can I reſpect a perſon who has ſpoken in ſuch a ſtyle of her own ſiſter and brother! If I were to repeat to them, to Mr. Goodman, or any of the other perſons you have mentioned, only half what you have ſaid of them, what do you ſuppoſe would be the conſequence?</p>
                  <p>What do you ſay, dear Madam? (interrupted the frightened Hannah) ſurely you will not repeat what I have ſpoken to you, becauſe I conſidered you as my friend. I did not mean any harm.</p>
                  <p>If I (anſwered Mrs. Jones) ſpare you, you will ſoon betray yourſelf: you will ſoon loſe every friend you have. All your acquaintance will fly from you; they will deſpiſe and loathe you. We loathe a ſlanderer as we do a viper. I, at leaſt, ſhall take care in future not to come near you, leſt you ſhould again faſten on my ear, as you have done to-day, to inſtil poiſon into my heart; for whoever ſpeaks ill to me of all the world, will certainly not ſpeak well of me when my back is turned.</p>
                  <p>So ſaying, ſhe haſtily left the malicious girl ſtanding alone, not knowing what to do with herſelf, ſhe was ſo vexed. She walked angrily up and down the garden; and, meeting her ſiſter, would have begun to ſpeak ill of Mrs. Jones; but ſhe would not hear her, and turned from her, ſaying, I know you ſiſter, and I know Mrs. Jones. I have not time to liſten to you.</p>
                  <p>This made her very angry. When the whole company were cheerful, and walked about chatting and laughing, Hannah flew to a dark corner, and ſeated herſelf there, the prey of her own malice.</p>

                  <head>CHILDREN TAUGHT THE USEFULNESS OF SERVANTS.</head>
                  <p>THE frequent amuſements in which Mr. Jones's family had been engaged for ſome time paſt, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted too much their regular employments. Charles had not done what his maſter every day required; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's work was left unfiniſhed; Mrs. Jones had ſeveral things to do in the family, and Mr Jones many accounts to ſettle, which made him ſay to his wife and children, we have lately enjoyed much pleaſure, perhaps more than we ought, becauſe we have neglected our neceſſary employments. But now it is proper for us to return to our reſpective occupations with freſh vigour; elſe we ſhall loſe by degrees all deſire for employment, and our whole family would then fall into ſuch diſorder, that we ſhould no longer find any comfort in it.</p>
                  <p>He deſired Charles, after he had given this caution, to prepare his exerciſe, and went himſelf to his compting-houſe.</p>
                  <p>At firſt the children did not much reliſh work, and even Mr. Jones himſelf found it more troubleſome than uſual; but imperceptibly every thing returned into its former order. Every one fulfilled his appointed taſk; and finding themſelves very well, they were happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that regular employment affords more real ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than continual amuſements and feaſts.</p>
                  <p>This order was not interrupted till the middle of October, when the two maids begged Mrs. Jones to let them go to a fair in a neighbouring village. Scarcely were they gone out of the houſe, when the man ſervant entered, and, burſting into a violent fit of crying, he could only bring out—What ſhall I do? what ſhall I do? Mrs. Jones was alarmed, and aſked him what ailed him; but he could only anſwer—They ſay my father is dying. Mr. Jones pitied the poor man, and aſked if he wiſhed to go and nurſe him during his illneſs? O yes! O yes! ſaid the man; let me but ſee him before he dies, or I
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035911_0028_1007BF18DC1C03B0"/>
ſhall never know a happy day again! Mr. Jones then inſtantly gave him leave to go, ſaying, I would rather do all your work myſelf, than keep you from your ſick father. Go, and attend him; and aſk my wife for ſomething to take with you, to revive his ſpirits. Then Harry ſoon haſtened away, with his pockets full of nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing things for the poor ſick man.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones determined to avail herſelf of this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to impreſs a uſeful leſſon on the minds of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and would not ſend for any aſſiſtance, though all the ſervants were abſent.</p>
                  <p>They having left every thing in order, much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience was not felt during the remainder of the day; but the next morning, Mary, going to waſh herſelf, found no water, and was obliged to go to the pump for it her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, trembling from head to foot. The children now felt the abſence of the ſervants, and how much they went indebted to them for waiting on them. When breakfaſt time came, the milk was brought; but there were no clean baſons to put it in, and the children muſt drink out of thoſe in which ſome milk remained ſince the day before, or waſh them themſelves. When they entered the parlour, every thing was in diſorder and out of its place; all ſtood as they had left them the night before; the floor was covered with crumbs, bits of paper, and duſt; in ſhort, it looked like a dwelling in which idle people lived.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones ſaid, that to-day ſhe muſt duſt and ſweep the room herſelf, ſince no one thought of doing it for her.</p>
                  <p>The children, who dearly loved their mother, would not ſuffer her to do it, but began to work themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Mary took the broom and ſwept it clean, with ſome labour; and Charles put the things in order.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the wind roſe, and made the panes rattle; and the pattering of the rain and hail rendered it ſtill more dreary. The poor children's teeth chattered, their fingers were ſtiff with cold, and they aſked their mother if they were not to have a fire to-day?</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be very glad of a fire, ſhe replied, but I have nobody to light it. If then you do not chooſe to ſtand trembling, you muſt contrive to make a fire yourſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:035911_0028_1007BF18DC1C03B0"/>Charles lighted ſome matches, and put them into the grate, but they went out: he tried again, and ſometimes the wood caught fire; but they had not placed the cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders properly to admit air to draw up the blaze, ſo it went out again; the wood did not burn. Mary aſſiſted as well as ſhe could; but as ſhe had never lighted a fire before, ſhe did not know how to make it, ſo her help was of no avail. They ſtood trembling and crying till Charles's maſter luckily came in, and told them how they ought to place the wood, and pile the cinders light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over it, ſo as to admit the air; and not heave a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of freſh coals on, which were damp, and would not readily burn, till the flame had ſome ſtrength to curl around them.</p>
                  <p>They were now comfortable and warm; the children rubbed their hands, rejoicing, and ſaying, now we have lighted it, we will not ſoon ſtir out of the warm room. But ſcarcely was Charles ſeated by the ſide of his maſter, when Mr. Jones entered with ſome letters in his hand, which muſt inſtantly be taken to the poſt.</p>
                  <p>Here, Charles, ſaid he, run immediately; theſe letters muſt be carried to the poſt-office. Oh, dear father, cried he, I would gladly go; but ſee what dreadful weather it is! it rains violently; and how it blows! may I wait till the ſhower is over? Fie, fie, the letters muſt go: the poſt never waits for good weather. Come, ſtart up quickly, leſt he ſhould be gone. Then Charles ran away, and came back quite wet: he would have changed his clothes, but had not time; for his father ſent him out again with ſome other meſſages.</p>
                  <p>Mary could not ſtay much longer by the fire, becauſe ſhe had ſeveral things to do in the kitchen. When it ſtruck one, they came again into the parlour, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their hands when they heard they were to have mutton-chops and apple-dumplings for dinner, of which they were very fond. But, when they were ready, the cloth was not laid, nor the ſalt-ſellars brought in, nor the glaſſes waſhed. Mrs. Jones had taken care to ſend her huſband his dinner warm into his little compting-houſe, where he had a great deal of buſineſs to do. But ſhe left the children to prepare the table for themſelves;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035911_0029_1007BF1A6E09A8E8"/>
and, before every thing was ready, full half an hour had ſlipped away. They now ſeated themſelves at table, but the mutton was cold, and the dumplings overdone, ſo that their dinner did not taſte half as good as they had expected.</p>
                  <p>After dinner they had ſtill many things to do, and were ſo dreadfully fatigued in the evening that they thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> themſelves on a ſofa, ſcarcely able to move a limb. I could not have believed, ſaid Mary to Charles, that the ſervants had ſo much to do: now I feel it; and I will never give them unneceſſary trouble again. Poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! they are obliged to wait on us the whole day. When we are ſleeping comfortably, in our warm beds, they are forced to get up to light our fires and ſweep our rooms, that we may find every thing in order when we riſe. When it rains and blows hard, we ſit in a warm comfortable room; but they muſt go out, and not wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t till the ſhower is over.</p>
                  <p>In the winter, when it freezes ſo hard that their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are quite benumbed with cold, they muſt go to the well for water. How often they are obliged to eat their dinners cold; and ſometimes through our fault, I fear. I have frequently been ill-natured to them; I am now very ſorry for it. I am, indeed, very ſorry!</p>
                  <p>And ſo am I, interrupted Charles, very ſorry; for I have often forgotten myſelf, and ſpoken very improperly to the ſervants. I muſt tell you what vexes me: I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Henry a blockhead, becauſe he forgot to clean my ſhoes, though the poor fellow had been running about the whole day for my father: but, believe me, I will never do it again; I will always be civil to Henry, Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Catharine, when I want them to do any thing for me. I will take care never to ſpeak haſtily to them; and, above all, not to call them names. Poor Henry, how he cried about his father! I wiſh I had not called him a blockhead! I ſhall not be eaſy till I aſk him to forgive me. Mary made the ſame reſolution; and they both longed for the return of the ſervants.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the two maids returned; but Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arine was ſent with ſome medicines to Henry's father; and, for three days, the children were obliged to aſſiſt
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035911_0029_1007BF1A6E09A8E8"/>
Jenny to do the work of the houſe; and at night they were ſo tired, that they did nothing but wiſh for the next day, hoping that Catharine, at leaſt, would come back. The fourth day, Mary was ſtanding at the window, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much work ſhe ſhould have to do the next day, and almoſt afraid to think of it, when ſhe heard ſome one ring the bell; ſhe threw up the window—it was Catharine; and at the ſame time Henry ran up the ſteps. What joy! She forgot to pull down the ſaſh. Charles! Charles! cried ſhe, Catharine is come! Henry is come! They both ran to the ſtreet door; and, eagerly opening it, caught hold of their hands, ſaying—Welcome, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, dear Henry! good Catharine! we often wiſhed for you. Their pleaſure was ſtill greater, when Henry informed them that his father would ſoon be well.</p>
                  <p>The next day every thing was again in order, and theſe children never afterwards behaved rudely to the ſervants; on the contrary, they were always civil and good-natured to them, and not only pitied them, when they had more work than uſual to do, but endeavoured to aſſiſt them; and reſolved never more to give unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary trouble to thoſe who had at all times ſo many hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to bear.</p>

                  <p>AS Mr. Jones and his family were, one day walking through a field juſt ſown with wheat, James, all at once, ſprang forward, bent down on the ground, then ſtarted up again, threw his hat before him, as if to catch ſomething, and then darted forward again. Mary, who was curious to know what he had in his eye, ran after him. At laſt he caught what he purſued, as Mary came up with him, and both rejoiced at having taken a little priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Jones were in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and did not obſerve them. However, they were ſoon obliged to ſtop, for they heard Mary ſcream out, in a terrified tone—Dear James, ah! do not do it; pray,

pray hold your hand! And theſe entreaties having no effect, ſhe called to her father and mother for help. Mr. Jones could not imagine what the children were diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, but waved his hand for them to come near him. Dear father, ſaid Mary, you do not know what a wicked boy James is! he has juſt caught a field-mouſe, and for all I can ſay, will cut its ears and tail off. The poor mouſe! it never did him any harm! he has already op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his knife! only look at him.

                     <p>Nevertheleſs, there appears in the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this little mouſe's body a thouſand times more contrivance than in your watch. Look at this little ear, through which it hears all that paſſes round it: through this organ it was warned when you purſued it; and theſe pretty eyes, in which the forms of all the objects before it are painted; and theſe ſharp teeth, with which it can gnaw the hardeſt grain; and theſe neatly turned paws; this ſkin as ſoft as velvet. But you would be ſtill more aſtoniſhed if you could ſee its inſide; if you could ſee how every thing paſſes there to preſerve life; how the little ſtomach diſſolves the food; how it ſeparates the beſt juices, and carries them by very fine channels ſtill further; how fleſh, blood, and bones are formed of them. Put your hand on its breaſt, and feel how its heart beats, to puſh the blood through its little veins. Your watch may

be very ingeniouſly made; but do you think it would ever produce any little watches? To this degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection they can never be carried. The moſt beautiful things made by man are dead, and without ſenſe: God alone can give life and reaſon.</p>

                     <p>The injury they do is very trifling. They commonly only gather up the grains which the farmer lets fall; and the moſt part of it would probably periſh, if thoſe little notable mice did not carry it to their neſts.

                     <speaker>Mr. Jones.</speaker>
                     <p>Then, indeed, it is time to deſtroy them; but without tormenting them; and they ſhould be put to death as quickly as poſſible. If the torments they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured would bring back the wheat, or teach them hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, there would be ſome excuſe for it; but this mouſe will not be leſs a thief after you have cut off its ears and tail.</p>

                  <p>Ah! my dear James! cried Mary, do not kill it; give me the little mouſe; I pray you give it me! Can you deny me?</p>
                  <p>He gave it her, and, as ſoon as ſhe got it, ſhe let it run away, calling after it—Run, run, poor animal, till you find again your little children.</p>
                  <p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Jones were pleaſed with her. Mrs. Jones kiſſed Mary, and ſaid, good girl! you have perhaps ſaved the lives of four or five little mice, who muſt have periſhed with hunger if their mother had been killed.</p>

                  <head>OF FLOWERS.</head>
                  <p>FLOWERS are formed to pleaſe us, and it is for our ſakes that they have received their lovely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances: no eye but ours can enjoy their beauties: the animals never ſeem to be affected with pleaſure, when they behold them; nor do they ever ſtop to conſider them with attention: they confound them with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon herbage of the field; they trample on the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of the tribe, and are perfectly inſenſible of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the earth. Whereas, man, amidſt a crowd of objects and riches that ſurround him, diſtinguiſhes and purſues the flowers with a peculiar complaiſance.</p>
                  <p>They have likewiſe an agreeable correſpondence with our eyes, and a ſet of powerful attractions, that invite us to approach them. Whenever we gather them, they preſent us with new perfections in proportion to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding them with nearer attention. The greateſt part of them not only regale our view with the beauty and arrangement of their colours, but gently delight our ſmell with an excellent perfume; and, when they have gratified our ſenſes with an innocent ſatisfaction, the mind ſtill diſcloſes wonders in them, which raviſh its faculties.</p>
                  <p>When we have carefully ſurveyed the ſtructure of a flower, we always find one or more incloſures appointed for the reception of the ſeed: around that incloſure is a ſet of chives ſuſtaining ſeveral packets of powder, which they ſcatter on all parts. The whole is encompaſſed with an empalement, or ſoft robe, that unfolds and encloſes, with a kind of precaution, according to the diſpoſition of the air. All theſe things convince us, that theſe parts, which are diſpoſed with ſo much art and regularity, and wither round the encloſure, when the ſeed is formed, are inſtrumental in the generation of the ſeed. We are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe convinced of the original deſign of flowers: the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, by diſpenſing the verdure of the earth to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, has perpetuated his gifts through all ages, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035911_0031_1007BF1FCD69BB28"/>
of the commiſſion he has given to flowers to renew each plant from year to year, by infuſing fertility into the ſeed.</p>
                  <p>This important and firſt deſign to procure immortality to plants, is not inconſiſtent with a ſecond, which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the view of man. When God created the flower, he thought fit to blend utility with pleaſure. If he had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed them to furniſh each plant with a reproduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſeed, he would not have graced the generality of them with ſuch lovely forms and engaging colours; but they would have reſembled roots, which, being only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to impart nouriſhment to the plant in a ſituation of obſcurity, were not provided with any embelliſhment: whereas that great Being, who formed the flowers, ſeems to have taken pleaſure to ſhape and paint the greateſt part of them in ſuch a manner, as qualifies them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale the view of man, and adorn his habitation. It is difficult to conceive how far the deſign to delight man with the beauty and profuſion of flowers has been extended. They rear their heads on the lofty tops of trees, and are diffuſed through the herbage that creeps along the earth; they embelliſh the vallies and the mountains, and the meadows are enamelled with their colours; they are gathered from the ſkirts of woods, and make their appearance even in deſerts: the earth is a garden entirely covered with their bloom.</p>
                  <p>The beauty of flowers never fails to inſpire us with joy; ſculpture imitates them in its ſofteſt ornaments; architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beſtows the embelliſhment of leaves and feſtoons, on thoſe columns and fronts, which would otherwiſe be too naked. The richeſt embroideries are little more than foliage and flowers; the moſt magnificent ſilks are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt covered with theſe charming forms, and are thought beautiful, in proportion as they reſemble the lively tinge of natural flowers.</p>
                  <p>The feſtivals in the country are never celebrated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out garlands, and the entertainments of the polite are uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in with flowers: a young bride, in all the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of her nuptial array, would imagine ſhe wanted a neceſſary part of her ornaments, if ſhe did not improve them by a ſprig of flowers: a queen, amidſt the greateſt

                     </gap>rous of aſſuming an air of ſoftneſs and gaiety, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of flowers.</p>
                  <p>We may, indeed, in ſome meaſure, conſider it as a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that we ſhould ever be deprived of the view of beautiful flowers. But, alas! what more is the beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <l>Suſtain the ſhorteſt doom:</l>
                     <l>Beauty is like the morning roſe,</l>
                     <l>That withers in its bloom.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>If the Divine Wiſdom ſeems to have had complacency in the diſtribution of thoſe colours that array the flowers, what a new charm has it imparted to them in their partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular airs and forms!

What an aſpect of majeſty is viſible in the growth of tulips! how elegant is the ſymmetry of thoſe pyramids, in which the lilies appear!</p>
                  <p>Flowers are not only intended to beautify the earth with their brilliant colours; but the greateſt part of them, in order to render the entertainment more exquiſite, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a fragrance, that perfumes all the air around us; and it ſhould ſeem as if they were ſolicitous to reſerve their odours for the evening and morn, when walking is moſt agreeable; but their ſweets are very faint during the heat of the day, when we viſit them leaſt.</p>
                  <p>To conclude—even flowers furniſh us with inſtruction, and conduct us, by gentle ſteps, to the knowledge of the Firſt Being, who has thus condeſcended to ſhape and paint them with ſo much delicacy, and to grace them with ſuch a variety of beauties. How amiable muſt he then be, who is the ſource of ſo many charms in ſuch an infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of objects, to whom he conſtantly imparts the ſame luſtre they diſcloſed, when they firſt appeared on the earth! and, if he has been pleaſed to beſtow ſo magnificent an array on creatures of ſuch a tranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The frailty of human nature, and the infelicity of human life, require to be relieved and ſoothed. There are many occaſions, on which this is not to be done by ſage admonitions, or ſolemn reflections. Theſe, to well-diſpoſed minds, are often highly ſolacing; but to dwell on them always were to ſtrain the machine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its powers. Beſides, in fact, a ſeaſonable diverſion to anxiety, a temporary forgetfulneſs of grief, is frequently a far better method to remove it, than any direct applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or laboured remedy. To change the metaphor; when the road proves rugged, or is in danger of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tedious, one ſucceſsful method of beguiling it is, for travellers to cheer and amuſe one another by the play of fancy, and the facetiouſneſs of mirth. But then the end of the journey muſt not be forgotten. Becauſe we are weak, there is no reaſon why we ſhould be ſilly. The brow of care may ſurely be ſmoothed without convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into the laugh of folly. While we indulge the recreation neceſſary for mortal, let us maintain the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per requiſite for immortal beings. To reconcile theſe two things, and to blend them happily, ſeems the proper ſcience of creatures on their journey through time to eternity. From you, my gentle friends, we look for every thing that, next to the diviner influence of religion, can ſoften the inequality, and animate the dulneſs of the way.</p>

                  <head>THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.</head>
                  <p>A YOUNG girl, having fatigued herſelf one hot day, with running about the garden, ſat herſelf down in a pleaſant arbour, where ſhe preſently fell aſleep. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſlumber, two female figures preſented themſelves before her. One was looſely habited in a thin robe of pink, with light green trimmings. Her ſaſh of ſilver gauze flowed to the ground. Her fair hair fell in ringlets down her neck; and her head-dreſs conſiſted of artificial flowers interwoven with feathers. She held in one hand a ball-ticket, and in the other a fancy-dreſs all covered with ſpangles and knots of gay ribbon. She advanced ſmiling to the girl, and, with a familiar air, thus addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her:—</p>
                  <p>My deareſt Meliſſa, I am a kind genius, who have watched you from your birth, and have joyfully beheld all your beauties expand, till at length they have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you a companion worthy of me. See what I have brought you. This dreſs and this ticket will give you free acceſs to all the raviſhing delights of my palace. With me you will paſs your days in a perpetual round of ever varying amuſements. Like the gay butterfly, you will have no other buſineſs than to flutter from flower to flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſpread your charms before admiring ſpectators. No reſtraints, no toils, no dull taſks, are to be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my happy domains. All is pleaſure, life and good humour. Come then, my dear! Let me put on you this dreſs, which will make you quite enchanting; and away, away, with me!</p>
                  <p>Meliſſa felt a ſtrong inclination to comply with the call of this inviting nymph; but firſt ſhe thought it would be prudent at leaſt to aſk her name. My name, ſaid ſhe, is Diſſipation.</p>
                  <p>The other female then advanced. She was clothed in a cloſe habit of brown ſtuff, ſimply relieved with white. She wore her ſmooth hair under a plain cap. Her whole perſon was perfectly neat and clean. Her look was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but ſatisfied; and her air was ſtaid and compoſed.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035911_0033_1007BF25C6388F50"/>
She held in one hand a diſtaff; on the oppoſite arm hung a work-baſket; and the girdle round her waiſt was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſciſſars, knitting-needles, reels, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of female labour. A bunch of keys hung at her ſide. She thus accoſted the ſleeping girl:—</p>
                  <p>Meliſſa, I am the genius who have ever been the friend and companion of your mother; and I now offer my protection to you. I have no allurements to tempt you with like thoſe of my gay rival. Inſtead of ſpending all your time in amuſements, if you enter yourſelf of my train, you muſt riſe early, and paſs the long day in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of employments, ſome of them difficult, ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and all requiring ſome exertion of body or mind. You muſt dreſs plainly, live moſtly at home, and aim at being uſeful rather than ſhining. But, in return, I will inſure you content, even ſpirits, ſelf-approbation, and the eſteem of all who thoroughly know you. If theſe offers appear to your young mind leſs inviting than thoſe of my rival, be aſſured, however, that they are more real. She has promiſed much more than ſhe can ever make good. Perpetual pleaſures are no more in the power of Diſſipation, than of Vice or Folly, to beſtow. Her delights quickly pall, and are inevitably ſucceeded by languor and diſguſt. She appears to you under a diſguiſe, and what you ſee is not her real face. For myſelf, I ſhall never ſeem to you leſs amiable than I now do; but, on the contrary, you will like me better and better. If I look grave to you now, you will hear me ſing at my work; and when work is over, I can dance too. But I have ſaid enough: it is time for you to chooſe whom you will follow; and upon that choice all your happineſs depends. If you would know my name, it is Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery.</p>
                  <p>Meliſſa heard her with more attention than delight; and though overawed by her manner, ſhe could not help turning again to take another look at the firſt ſpeaker. She beheld her ſtill offering her preſents with ſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an air, that ſhe felt it ſcarcely poſſible to reſiſt; when, by a lucky accident, the maſk with which Diſſipation's face was ſo artfully covered, fell off. As ſoon as Meliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa beheld, inſtead of the ſmiling features of youth and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035911_0034_1007BF27AE0CA688"/>
cheerfulneſs, a countenance wan and ghaſtly with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſoured by fretfulneſs, ſhe turned away with horror, and gave her hand unreluctantly to her ſober and ſincere companion.</p>

                  <head>DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT; Or, SUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAY MORNING.</head>
                  <p>IT was Sunday morning. All the bells were ringing for church, and the ſtreets were filled with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moving in all directions.</p>
                  <p>Here, numbers of well-dreſſed perſons, and a long train of charity children, were thronging in at the wide doors of a large handſome church. There, a ſmaller number, almoſt equally gay in dreſs, were entering an elegant meeting-houſe. Up one alley, a Roman Catholic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was turning into their retired chapel, every one croſſing himſelf with a finger dipt in holy water as he went in. The oppoſite ſide of the ſtreet was covered with a train of Quakers, diſtinguiſhed by their plain and neat attire, and ſedate aſpect, who walked without cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony into a room as plain as themſelves, and took their ſeats, the men on one ſide, and the women on the other, in ſilence. A ſpacious building was filled with an over-flowing crowd of Methodiſts, moſt of them meanly hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited, but decent and ſerious in demeanour; while a ſmall ſociety of Baptiſts in the neighbourhood, quietly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied their humble place of aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>Preſently the different ſervices began. The churches reſounded with the ſolemn organ, and with the indiſtinct murmurs of a large body of people following the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in reſponſive prayers. From the meetings were heard the ſlow pſalm, and the ſingle voice of the leader of their devotions. The Roman Catholic chapel was enlivened by ſtrains of muſic, the tinkling of a ſmall bell, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual change of ſervice and ceremonial. A profound ſilence and unvarying look and poſture announced the ſelf-recollection and mental devotion of the Quakers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:035911_0034_1007BF27AE0CA688"/>Mr. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> led his ſon <hi>Edwin</hi> round all theſe different aſſemblies as a ſpectator. Edwin viewed every thing with great attention, and was often impatient to inquire of his father the meaning of what he ſaw: but Mr. Ambroſe would not ſuffer him to diſturb any of the congregations, even by a whiſper. When they had gone through the whole, Edwin found a great number of queſtions to put to his father, who explained every thing to him in the beſt manner he could. At length, ſays Edwin—But why cannot all theſe people agree to go to the ſame place, and worſhip God the ſame way?</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould they agree? (replied his father.) Do you not ſee that people differ in a hundred other things? Do they all dreſs alike, and eat and drink alike, and keep the ſame hours, and uſe the ſame diverſions?</p>
                  <p>Ay! but thoſe are things in which they have a right to do as they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>And they have a right, too, to worſhip God as they pleaſe. It is their own buſineſs, and concerns none but themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But has not God ordered particular ways of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him?</p>
                  <p>He has directed the mind and ſpirit with which he is to be worſhipped, but not the particular form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. That is left for every one to chooſe, according as ſuits his temper and opinions. All theſe people like their own way beſt, and why ſhould they leave it for the choice of another? Religion is one of the things in which <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were made to differ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeveral congregations now began to be diſmiſſed, and the ſtreet was again overſpread with perſons of all the different ſects, going promiſcuouſly to their reſpective homes. It chanced that a poor man fell down in the ſtreet in a fit of apoplexy, and lay for dead. His wife and children ſtood round him crying and lamenting in the bittereſt diſtreſs. The beholders immediately flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round, and, with looks and expreſſions of the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt compaſſion, gave their help. A Churchman raiſed the man from the ground, by lifting him under the arms, while a Diſſenter held his head, and wiped his face with his handkerchief. A Roman Catholic lady took out her

ſmelling-bottle, and aſſiduouſly applied it to his noſe. A Methodiſt ran for a doctor. A Quaker ſupported and comforted the woman; and a Baptiſt took care of the children.</p>
                  <p>Edwin and his father were among the ſpectators. Here, ſaid Mr. Ambroſe, is a thing in which <hi>mankind were made to agree.</hi>

                  <p>I AM one of four Siſters; and having ſome reaſon to think myſelf not well uſed either by them or by the world, I beg leave to lay before you a ſketch of our hiſtory and characters. You will not wonder there ſhould be frequent bickerings amongſt us, when I tell you that in our infancy we were continually fighting; and ſo great was the noiſe, and din, and confuſion, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> our continual ſtruggles to get uppermoſt, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any body to live amongſt us, in ſuch a ſcene of tumult and diſorder. Theſe brawls, however, by a powerful interpoſition, were put an end to; our proper place was aſſigned to each of us, and we had ſtrict orders not to encroach on the limits of each other's property, but to join our common offices for the good of the whole family.</p>
                  <p>My firſt ſiſter (I call her the firſt, becauſe we have generally allowed her the precedence in rank,) is, I muſt acknowledge, of a very active ſprightly diſpoſition; quick and lively, and has more brilliancy than any of us: but ſhe is hot: every thing ſerves for fuel to her fury, when it is once raiſed to a certain degree; and ſhe is ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous whenever ſhe gets the upper hand, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her aſpiring diſpoſition, if I may freely ſpeak my mind, ſhe is calculated to make a good ſervant, but a very bad miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>I am almoſt aſhamed to mention, that notwithſtanding her ſeeming delicacy, ſhe has a moſt voracious appetite, and devours every thing that comes in her way; though,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035911_0035_1007BF2A5C3B66D8"/>
like other eager thin people, ſhe does no credit to her keeping. Many a time has ſhe conſumed the product of my barns and ſtore-houſes, but it is all loſt upon her. She has even been known to get into an oil-ſhop or tallow-chandler's, when every body was aſleep, and lick up, with the utmoſt greedineſs, whatever ſhe found there. Indeed, all prudent people are aware of her tricks, and though ſhe is admitted into the beſt families, they take care to watch her very narrowly. I ſhould not forget to mention, that my ſiſter was once in a country where ſhe was treated with uncommon reſpect; ſhe was lodged in a ſumptuous building, and had a number of young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the beſt families to attend on her, and feed her, and watch over her health; in ſhort, ſhe was looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſomething more than a common mortal. But ſhe always behaved with great ſeverity to her maids, and if any of them were negligent of their duty, or made a ſlip in their own conduct, nothing would ſerve her but bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor girls alive. I have, myſelf, had ſome dark hin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The next ſiſter I ſhall mention to you, has ſo far the appearance of modeſty and humility, that ſhe generally ſeeks the loweſt place. She is indeed of a very yielding eaſy temper, generally cool, and often wears a ſweet placid ſmile upon her countenance; but ſhe is eaſily ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, and when worked up, as ſhe often is, ſhe becomes a perfect fury. Indeed ſhe is ſo apt to ſwell with ſudden guſts of paſſion, that ſhe is ſuſpected at times to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lunatic. Between her and my firſt mentioned ſiſter, there is a more ſettled antipathy than between the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; and they never meet without making efforts to deſtroy one another. With me ſhe is always ready to form the moſt intimate union, but it is not always to my advantage. There goes a ſtory in our family, that when we were all young, ſhe once attempted to drown me.

From that time ſhe has made no ſuch atrocious attempt, but ſhe is continually making encroachments upon my property; and even when ſhe appears moſt gentle, ſhe is very inſidious, and has ſuch an undermining way with her, that her inſinuating ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I have the ſatisfaction, however, of finding that people always incline towards me as they grow older; and that thoſe, who ſeemed proudly to diſdain any affin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with me, are content to ſink at laſt into my boſom. You will probably wiſh to have ſome account of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I am not a regular beauty; ſome of my features are rather harſh and prominent, when viewed ſeparately; but my countenance has ſo much variety of expreſſion, and ſo many different attitudes of elegance, that thoſe who ſtudy my face with attention, find out continually new charms; and it may be truly ſaid of me, what Titus ſays of his miſtreſs, and for a much longer ſpace:

Dr. Glack, miniſter of Marienburgh, ſeeing her there, inquired of the clerk who ſhe was; and being informed ſhe was a poor orphan, he had taken into his houſe out of charity, what from a wiſh to relieve the poor clerk from a burthen he was not well able to ſupport, and a

Here her company and opportunities for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement were better, and her deportment ſuch, that ſhe became equally eſteemed by the Doctor, his wife and children: her ſteady, diligent, and careful attention to all their domeſtic concerns ingratiated her ſo much with the Doctor and his wife, that they made no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and their own children. She ever after ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her acknowledgment with the utmoſt gratitude, in richly providing for all thoſe, who could lay claim to any alliance with the Doctor's family; nor did ſhe forget her firſt benefactor, the clerk of Runghen. In this happy ſituation ſhe grew up to woman, when a Livonian ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, in the Swediſh ſervice, fell paſſionately in love with her; ſhe likewiſe liking him, agreed to marry him, provided it could be done with the Doctor's conſent; who, upon inquiry into the man's character, finding it unexceptionable, readily gave it. The marriage day was appointed, and indeed, came; when a ſudden order came to the ſerjeant that very morning, to march direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a detachment for Riga. Soon after this, General Baur, at the head of an army, came before the town and took it, in the year 1742, when all the inhabitants were made priſoners, and amongſt the reſt this lovely bride. In the promiſcuous crowd, overwhelmed with grief, and bathed in tears at her unhappy fate, the General obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, ſaw a <hi>je ne ſçai quoi</hi> in her whole appearance, which attracted him ſo much, that he aſked her ſeveral queſtions about her ſituation; to which ſhe made anſwer with more ſenſe than is uſual with perſons of her rank. He deſired her not to be afraid, for he would take care of her, and gave immediate orders for her ſafety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception into his houſe, of which he gave her the whole charge, with authority over all his ſervants, by whom ſhe was very much beloved, from her manner of uſing them: the General afterwards often ſaid, his houſe was never ſo well managed as when ſhe was with him.</p>

                  <head>STORY OF A VIRTUOUS YOUNG LADY.</head>
                  <p>DURING my reſidence in Moſcow, I was told the following particulars of the Czar. He was born in the year 1672, and was married in 1690, at the age of eighteen, to Ottokeſſa Lupochin, a beggar's daughter, by whom he had Prince Alexis. Some time after, he turned her away, and ſhut her up in a monaſtery, on ſuſpicion of diſloyalty to his bed. After the divorce, one Miſs Mons, a very beautiful young lady, born at Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow of foreign parents, was much in favour with the Czar; but when he was abroad, Mr. Keyſerling, then reſident at. Moſcow, as Envoy from the King of Pruſſia, paid his addreſſes to, and married her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="unknown:035911_0038_1007BF32378F4FF8"/>The Czar was ſometime after ſmitten with the charms of another beautiful young lady, the daughter of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign merchant in this city: he firſt ſaw her at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, where he dined one day. He was ſo much taken with her appearance, that he offered her any terms ſhe pleaſed, if ſhe would live with him, which this virtuous young woman modeſtly refuſed; but, dreading the effects of his authority, ſhe put on a reſolution, and left Moſcow in the night, without communicating her deſign even to her parents. Having provided a little money for her ſupport, ſhe travelled on foot ſeveral miles into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, till ſhe arrived at a ſmall village, where her nurſe lived with her huſband and their daughter, the young lady's foſter ſiſter, to whom ſhe diſcovered her intention of concealing herſelf in a wood near that village: and to prevent any diſcovery, ſhe ſet out the ſame night, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the huſband and daughter. The huſband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a timber man by trade, and well acquainted with the wood, conducted her to a little dry ſpot in the middle of a moraſs, and there he built a hut for her habitation. She had depoſited her money with her nurſe to procure little neceſſaries for her ſupport, which were faithfully conveyed to her at night, by the nurſe or her daughter, by one of whom ſhe was conſtantly attended in the night time.</p>
                  <p>The next day after her flight, the Czar called at her father's to ſee her; and, finding the parents in anxious concern for their daughter, and himſelf diſappointed, fancied it a plan of their own concerting. He became angry, and began to threaten them with the effects of his diſpleaſure, if ſhe was not produced: nothing was left to the parents but the moſt ſolemn proteſtations, with tears of real ſorrow running down their cheeks, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of their innocence, and ignorance what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her; aſſuring him of their fears that ſome fatal diſaſter had befallen her, as nothing belonging to her was miſſing, except what ſhe had on at the time. The Czar, ſatisfied of their ſincerity, ordered great ſearch to be made for her, with the offer of a conſiderable reward to the perſon who ſhould diſcover what was become of her; but to no purpoſe. The parents and relations, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035911_0038_1007BF32378F4FF8"/>
ſhe was no more, went into mourning for her.</p>
                  <p>Above a year after this, ſhe was diſcovered by accident. A Colonel, who had come from the army to ſee his friends, going a hunting into that wood, and following his game, through the moraſs, he came to the hut, and looking into it, ſaw a pretty young woman in a mean dreſs. After inquiring of her who ſhe was, and how ſhe came to live in ſo ſolitary a place, he found out at laſt that ſhe was the lady whoſe diſappearance had made ſo great a noiſe. In the utmoſt confuſion, and with the moſt fervent entreaties, ſhe prayed him, on her knees, that he would not betray her. To which he replied, that he thought her danger was now paſt, as the Czar was then otherways engaged; and that ſhe might with ſafety diſcover herſelf, at leaſt to her parents, with whom he would conſuit how matters ſhould be managed. The lady agreed to his propoſal; and he ſat out immediately, and overjoyed her parents with the happy diſcovery. The iſſue of their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was to conſult Madam Catharine (as ſhe was then called) in what manner the affair ſhould be opened to the Czar. The Colonel went alſo upon this buſineſs, and was adviſed by Madam to come next morning, and ſhe would introduce him to his Majeſty, when he might make the diſcovery, and claim the promiſed reward. He went according to appointment; and, being introduced, told the accident by which he had diſcovered the lady, and repreſented the miſerable ſituation in which he found her, and what ſhe muſt have ſuffered by being ſo long ſhut up in ſuch a diſmal place, from the delicacy of her ſex. The Czar ſhewed a great deal of concern that he ſhould have been the cauſe of all her ſufferings, declaring that he would endeavour to make her amends. Here Madam Catharine ſuggeſted, that ſhe thought the beſt amends his Majeſty could make, was to give her a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fortune, and the Colonel for a huſband, who had the beſt right, having caught her in purſuit of his game. The Czar, agreeing perfectly with Madam Catharine's ſentiments, ordered one of his favourites to go with the Colonel, and bring the young lady home; where ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, to the inexpreſſible joy of her family and relations,

                     </gap>er of the town; who, after a ſhort introduction, took a book out of his pocket, which he preſented to Mr. Krahe, expreſſing a deſire that he would purchaſe it. The ſuperintendant found, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was a prayer-book, ornamented in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtyle of religious foppery, with a number of colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed figures and engravings. It was the one which the Elector Clement Auguſtus, of Cologne, had ordered to be publiſhed, and was become very ſcarce and valuable. The profeſſor inquired whence he had it? and the young man anſwered with a modeſt bluſh, that it was a copy from one he had borrowed. "By whom?" "By myſelf," rejoins the youth. Upon a cloſe examination, Mr. Krahe could ſcarcely diſtinguiſh the copy from the original. He could not conceal his ſurpriſe, and aſked why he did not practiſe engraving, rather than continue a baker? The youth anſwered, that it was the wiſh of his ſoul; but his father having a numerous family, could not afford the expenſe of ſuitable inſtructions. "I deſign to travel," adds he; "but as my father cannot furniſh the means, and as I knew that you was fond of drawings, I was emboldened to make this application to you, in hopes that you would purchaſe the copy, to furniſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035911_0039_1007BF35129C09C0"/>
help, and I muſt truſt to my induſtry and good fortune for future advancement."</p>
                  <p>"Call here to-morrow, without fail," ſays Mr. Krahe, with an emphaſis that manifeſted pleaſure and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Early the next morning, the profeſſor called upon an intimate friend at Keyſerſworth, a few miles from Duſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorff, of which place the young man was a native.</p>
                  <p>This friend, with the power, had the diſpoſition to do good. Krahe told him the ſtory, ſhewed him the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and begged him to lend the young artiſt two hundred crowns. "He will, doubtleſs," adds he, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, in a few years, a diſtinguiſhed engraver, and be able to reimburſe you. I will be ſecurity for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
                  <p>"I take no ſecurity," anſwered his friend; and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced three hundred crowns.</p>
                  <p>Krahe returned to the aſtoniſhed and tranſported ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with the money. He quitted the oven, learned ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry and perſpective, applied to drawing according to the rules of the art, and acquired a competent knowledge of hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>After aſſiduous application, for the ſpace of two years, the young man had made ſuch rapid progreſs, that Mr. Krahe adviſed him to quit Duſſeldorff, where no further improvement was to be expected, and viſit Paris, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a letter of introduction to Mr. Willes, a celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed engraver in that metropolis.</p>
                  <p>Smith (for this was the young man's name) put his advice into execution; and, in order to economize his little ſtore, he travelled on foot from Duſſeldorff to Paris. But unfortunately, he fell ill immediately upon his arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and, although he applied to a monaſtery, where he was hoſpitably received, and carefully attended, yet inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental expenſes, during an illneſs of ſome continuance, had entirely exhauſted his little ſtore. Upon his recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, that delicate kind of pride, which ſo frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies true genius, forbade his making application to Mr. Willes, while he muſt appear an indigent beggar.</p>
                  <p>One day, as he was walking, penſively in the ſtreets, his mind occupied with his unfortunate ſituation, he was
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035911_0040_1007BF378EFFD030"/>
met by two ſoldiers of the Swiſs guards; one of whom accoſted him with the inquiry, "Young man, are you not a German?"—"Yes."—"From whence?"—"From Keyſerſworth, near Duſſeldorff."—"You are my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—What do you do here?" Smith related to him the particulars of his hiſtory; adding, that a long illneſs had exhauſted a large portion of his time, and all his money; and that he could not ſupport the idea of being troubleſome to any one. The ſoldiers adviſed him to enliſt, aſſuring him that the ſervice was not ſevere, and that he would have leiſure to follow the bent of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Smith accepted the propoſition, was introduced to the captain of the regiment, was enliſted for four years, and ſhortly after was introduced to Mr. Willes, by the captain himſelf. As much time was indulged to him, as the nature of the ſervice could poſſibly admit, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his favourite object, under Mr. Willes. He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this ſituation the four years, when he received his diſmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Finding that he was in the line of improvement, he continued at Paris two years longer, applying himſelf, with the utmoſt diligence, to the art of engraving: at the expiration of which term, he returned home, with the beſt atteſtations concerning his talents, induſtry, and moral conduct.</p>
                  <p>Profeſſor Krahe received him with open arms, was charmed with the progreſs he had made, and engaged him to work in the cabinet. He continued to work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſpection of the profeſſor, about two years, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting himſelf in ſuch a manner, as to gain upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his patron.</p>
                  <p>It was about this period, that the profeſſor invited our artiſt to an entertainment, where ſeveral of his friends were to be preſent. He met his friends, and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the joys of convivial converſation, when he was informed that the entertainment was in honour of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But alas! this ſtranger was the deſtined huſband of the profeſſor's eldeſt daughter;—beautiful, in his eyes as an angel; and wiſe, in his judgment, as the goddeſs of wiſdom. He made as precipitate a retreat as decency
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035911_0040_1007BF378EFFD030"/>
would permit, and left the briſk glaſs and jovial ſong to circulate among the happy.</p>
                  <p>The next morning he returned to the cabinet with the utmoſt dejection of mind and countenance. This ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change was noticed by his benefactor, who inquired into the cauſe. Smith, in confuſed expreſſions, and with faultering voice, confeſſed that he had fallen deeply in love with that very daughter who was ſhortly to be in the poſſeſſion of another.</p>
                  <p>"Have you intimated to my daughter the ſtrength of your affections?"</p>
                  <p>"Never," anſwered the noble youth; "not in the moſt diſtant manner. Could I, without title, fortune, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of any kind, be ſo baſe as to ſpeak of love to the daughter of my friend, my patron, my benefactor? I was contented to ſee her, and was careful to conduct myſelf in ſuch a manner, that no ſuſpicions might ariſe, to debar me of that happineſs; and now I learn, that I am ſhortly to be deprived of the only ſatisfaction to which I dared to aſpire."</p>
                  <p>The benevolent profeſſor tried his utmoſt to ſoothe and comfort him; aſſured him of the ſtrength of his affection; that he loved him as his own child: but warned him to ſubdue his love for Henrietra; expatiating upon the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inality, circumſtanced as they were, of indulging the paſſion.</p>
                  <p>The poor young man admitted the force of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and promiſed to obey. But the ſtruggle was too much for his conſtitution. He fell ill, and continued in a dangerous ſtate upwards of four months. Mr. Krahe paid him every attention, and gave him every conſolation in his power. But, in all their interviews, the name of Henrietta was never mentioned. His lamentable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, could not be concealed from her.

                  <p>The intended huſband returned to his parents; and it was not difficult to perceive, from the tenor of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that certain objections were ſtarted by them to the union. Although he dared not to expreſs his own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                     </gap> eccleſiaſtics, ſhe perpetually experienced the miſeries of diſappointment, and the malignity of detraction. With great capacity for buſineſs, ſhe was unſucceſsful in affairs. Infinitely amiable in her private deportment, ſhe enjoyed not tranquillity and happineſs. She was candid and open, engaging and generous. Her manners were gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, her temper cheerful, her converſation eaſy and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035911_0042_1007BF3BC5A7FB98"/>
her wit polite, her information various, her taſte elegant. But her huſbands, like her courtiers, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to interrupt her proſperity and enjoyments; and while her adminiſtration was deformed with diſaſters and faction, her domeſtic life was embittered with diſquietudes and ſorrow. With every claim to felicity, ſhe was expoſed to all the croſſes of fortune; and her form, which gave a ſplendour to her rank, her abilities, her virtues, and her accompliſhments, ſerved to ennoble her afflictions. The incomparable beauty and expreſſion of her countenance, the exquiſite propriety of her ſtature, and the exact ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of her ſhape, attracted and fixed the admiration of every beholder. In her air, her walk; her geſture, ſhe mingled majeſty and grace. Her eyes, which were of a dark grey, ſpoke the ſituations and ſenſibility of her mind; the ſound of her voice was melodious and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and her hair, which was black, improved the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her complexion. To give the greateſt luſtre to her perſon, ſhe took a full advantage of the adventitious aids of dreſs. She diſcovered an inexhauſtible fancy in the richneſs and variety of her garments. She delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in jewels and precious ſtones; and ſhe was anxiouſly curious in the fineneſs and faſhion of her linen. But while her mind and her perſon were ſo perfect and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring, ſhe was not exempted from frailties. Though capable of diſſimulation, and acquainted with the arts of management and addreſs, ſhe did not ſufficiently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate herſelf to the manners of her people. Her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for her religion was too fond and doating, to conſiſt with the policy and the dignity of a great ſovereign. In her counſellors ſhe uniformly repoſed too unbounded a confidence; and from the ſoftneſs of her nature, ſhe could be ſeduced to give them her truſt even after their demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was equivocal and ſuſpicious. Her clemency was not guided by prudence, and was generally repaid with ingratitude and inſult. To the proteſtant clergy, whoſe inſolence was inordinate and ſeditious, ſhe conducted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſometimes with a paſſion that was unbecoming, and ſometimes with a remiſſneſs that detracted from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. A determined contempt or a vigorous ſeverity would have ſuited better with her royal condition. She
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035911_0043_1007BF3D52990450"/>
received her impreſſions with too much vivacity; and from the delicacy of her organization, ſhe was diſpoſed to that ſpirit of caprice which is in ſome meaſure character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of her ſex; but which, though often pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in the ſtill and endearing intercourſe of private life, betrays in public concerns the ſuſpicion of inconſtancy and indiſcretion. Her faults, however, were the reſult of amiable weakneſſes; and they excite regret rather than indignation. The moſt unpardonable error of her life, was the romantic imprudence with which ſhe ventured into England, and entruſted herſelf to the power of Elizabeth. By courage and perſeverance ſhe might have defeated the turbulence and ambition of her nobles; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and time would have opened to her all the arts of government. But by this fatal ſtep ſhe involved herſelf in difficulties which ſhe was never able to ſurmount. Eliz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth, to whom her abilities and beauty were a ſource of the moſt unrelenting jealouſy and anger, embraced with a ferocious ardour the opportunity of humbling her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely as a Queen and as a woman. She was expoſed to all the practices of a cunning and a wicked vengeance. The vileſt calumnies, the moſt inſulting mortifications, the moſt ſtudied barbarities, were practiſed againſt her. She was made to exchange a kingdom for a priſon! An inclement and ſuſpicious adverſary, who dreaded to encounter her when at liberty, tarniſhed the glory of an illuſtrious reign by trampling upon her ſceptre, while ſhe was a captive. The rivalſhip of beauty, ſtill more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than of talents, ſoftered the reſentments of Elizabeth; and while ſhe made Mary to ſuffer under her power, ſhe found the moſt exquiſite delight in overturning the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of her charms. It pleaſed her, to the greateſt degree, that the beauty of the Scottiſh Princeſs ſhould waſte itſelf in ſolitude; that ſhe ſhould be kept at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from admiration and homage; and that ſhe ſhould never experience, in any fortunate alliance, the melting tenderneſs, and the delicate ſenſibilities of connubial love. During the long period, which paſſed from the flight of Mary into England till her death, her miſeries were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, piercing and uninterrupted. The bitter cup of her fortune, which often overflowed, never ceaſed to be
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035911_0043_1007BF3D52990450"/>
full. But though agonizing with conſtant afflictions, and though crowned with thorns, ſhe ſtill remembered that ſhe was a Queen, and maintained the elevation and the dignity, which became her. To overwhelm her with diſtreſs and anguiſh, Elizabeth ſcrupled not to inſult and to violate the moſt eſtabliſhed principles of law and juſtice, the honour of hoſpitality, the reverence of her ſex, the holineſs of religion, the ſolemnity of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ties of relation, the feelings of humanity, the ſanctity of innocence, and the majeſty of Kings. But no inſolence of tyranny, no refinement of anger, and no pang of woe could conquer or deſtroy her greatneſs and her fortitude. Her mind, which grew in its powers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtruggles and calamity, ſeemed even to take a ſtrain of vigour from the atrocious paſſions of her rival; and during her lamentable captivity, and in her dying ſcene, ſhe diſplayed a magnanimity and a heroiſm, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may have been equalled, but which has never been ſurpaſſed in any age, or in any nation.</p>

                  <p>Accident threw within her reach a moſt tempting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for ſuch fiend-like diverſion, in the perſon of Amelia
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035911_0044_1007BF40DFA65B20"/>
Nevil, the daughter of a brave and accompliſhed officer, who, cloſing a laborious and painful life in very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent circumſtances, had left his unfortunate child to the care of his maiden ſiſter. The aunt of Amelia was ſuch an old maid as might alone ſuffice to reſcue the ſiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from ridicule and contempt. She had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, in her early days, to a gallant youth, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily loſt his own life in preſerving that of his dear friend, her brother: ſhe devoted herſelf to his memory with the moſt tender, unaffected, and invariable attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; refuſing ſeveral advantageous offers of marriage, though her income was ſo narrow, that neceſſity obliged her to convert her whole fortune into an annuity, juſt before the calamitous event happened, which made her the only guardian of the poor Amelia. This lovely but unfortunate girl was turned of fourteen on the death of her father. She found, in the houſe of his ſiſter, the moſt friendly aſylum, and a relation, whoſe heart and mind made her moſt able and willing to form the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of this engaging orphan, who appeared to be as highly favoured by nature as ſhe was perſecuted by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The beauty of Amelia was ſo ſtriking, and the charms of her lively underſtanding began to diſplay themſelves in ſo enchanting a manner, that her affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate aunt could not bear the idea of placing her in any lower order of life: ſhe gave her the education of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, in the flattering and generous hope that her various attractions muſt ſupply the abſolute want of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that ſhe ſhould enjoy the delight of ſeeing her dear Amelia ſettled happily in marriage, before her death expoſed her lovely ward to that poverty, which was her only inheritance. Heaven diſpoſed it otherwiſe. This amiable woman, after having acted the part of a moſt affectionate parent to her indigent niece, died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Amelia attained the age of twenty. The poor girl was now apparently deſtitute of every reſource, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to penury, with a heart bleeding for the loſs of a moſt indulgent protector. A widow lady of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance very kindly afforded her a refuge in the firſt moments of her diſtreſs, and propoſed to two of her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulent friends, that Amelia ſhould reſide with them by
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035911_0044_1007BF40DFA65B20"/>
turns, dividing her year between them, and paſſing four months with each. As ſoon as Mrs. Wormwood was informed of this event, as ſhe delighted in thoſe oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious acts of apparent beneficence, which are falſely call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charity, ſhe deſired to be admitted among the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary guardians of the poor Amelia. To this propoſal all the parties aſſented; and it was ſettled that Amelia ſhould paſs the laſt quarter of every year, as long as ſhe remained ſingle, under the roof of Mrs. Wormwood. This lovely orphan had a ſenſibility of heart, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her extremely grateful for the protection ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but which made her ſeverely feel all the miſeries of her dependence. Her beauty attracted a multitude of admirers, many of whom, preſuming on her poverty, treated her with a licentious levity, which always wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ingenuous pride. Her perſon, her mind, her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were univerſally commended by the men; but no one thought of making her his wife. "Amelia," they cried, "is an enchanting creature; but who in theſe times, can afford to marry a pretty, proud girl, ſupported by charity?" Though this prudential queſtion was never uttered in the preſence of Amelia, ſhe began to perceive its influence, and ſuffered the painful dread of proving a perpetual burden to thoſe friends, by whoſe generoſity ſhe ſubſiſted: ſhe wiſhed a thouſand times that her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate aunt, inſtead of cultivating her mind with ſuch dangerous refinement, had placed her in any ſtation of life, where ſhe might have maintained herſelf by her own manual labour: ſhe ſometimes entertained a project of making ſome attempt for this purpoſe; and ſhe once thought of changing her name, and of trying to ſupport herſelf as an actreſs on one of the public theatres; but this idea, which her honeſt pride had ſuggeſted, was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſuppreſſed by her modeſty; and ſhe continued to waſte the moſt precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetually wiſhing to change her mode of life, and of not knowing how to effect it. Almoſt two years had now elapſed ſince the death of her aunt; and, without any proſpect of marriage, ſhe was in her ſecond period of reſidence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's underſtanding was by no means inferior to her other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035911_0045_1007BF435766B900"/>
She began to penetrate all the artful diſguiſe, and to gain a perfect and very painful inſight into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al character of her preſent hoſteſs. This lady had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that when Miſs Nevil reſided with her, her houſe was much more frequented by gentlemen than at any other ſeaſon. This, indeed, was true; and it unluckily happened that theſe viſitors often forgot to applaud the ſmart ſayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in contemplating the ſweet countenance of Amelia; a circumſtance fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the moſt bitter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, hatred and malice. In truth, Mrs. Wormwood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted her lovely gueſt, with the moſt implacable viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but ſhe had the ſingular art of diſguiſing her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation in the language of flattery: ſhe underſtood the truth of Pope's maxim,
<q>"He hurts me moſt who laviſhly commends;"</q>
and ſhe therefore made uſe of laviſh commendation as an inſtrument of malevolence towards Amelia; ſhe inſulted the taſte, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared herſelf convinced, that he was a fool, becauſe he had not choſen that moſt lovely young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. To more than one gentleman ſhe ſaid, you muſt marry Amelia; and, as few men chooſe to be driven into wedlock, ſome offers were poſſibly prevented by the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous vehemence of her praiſe. Her malice, however, was not ſufficiently gratified by obſerving that Amelia had no proſpect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, ſhe reſolved to amuſe this unhappy girl with the hopes of ſuch an event, and then to turn, on a ſudden, all theſe ſplendid hopes into mockery and deluſion. Accident led her to pitch on Mr. Nelſon, as a perſon whoſe name ſhe might, with the greateſt ſafety, employ as the inſtrument of her inſidious deſign, and with the greater chance of ſucceſs, as ſhe obſerved that Amelia had conceived for him a particular regard.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Nelſon was a gentleman, who, having met with very ſingular events, had contracted a great but very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable ſingularity of character. He was placed, early in life, in a very lucrative commercial ſituation, and was on the point of ſettling happily in marriage with a very beautiful young lady, when the houſe in which ſhe reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035911_0045_1007BF435766B900"/>
was conſumed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the deſtined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nelſon, in loſing the object of his ardent affection, by ſo ſudden a calamity, loſt for ſome time the uſe of his reaſon; and when his health and ſenſes returned, he ſtill continued under the oppreſſion of the profoundeſt melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had loſt in ſo ſevere a manner, ſuggeſted to his fancy a ſingular plan of benevolence, in the proſecution of which he recovered a great portion of his former ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. This plan conſiſted in ſearching for female objects of charity, whoſe diſtreſſes had been occaſioned by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes very moderate, he was able to relieve many unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate perſons in this condition; and his affectionate imagination delighted itſelf with the idea, that in theſe uncommon acts of beneficence, he was guided by the influence of that lovely angel whoſe mortal beauty had periſhed in the flames!</p>
                  <p>Mr. Nelſon frequently viſited a married ſiſter who was ſettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood reſided. There was alſo, in the ſame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular eſteem. This lady, whoſe name was Melford, had been left in very ſcanty circumſtances on the death of her huſband, and, reſiding at that time in London, ſhe had been involved in additional diſtreſs by that calamity to which the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive charity of Mr. Nelſon was forever directed: he more than repaired the loſs which ſhe ſuſtained by fire, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſettling her in the neighbourhood of his ſiſter. Mrs. Melford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was ſtill the moſt valuable friend of that lovely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, who paid her frequent viſits, though ſhe never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided under her roof. Mr. Nelſon had often ſeen Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia at the houſe of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politeneſs, whenever he viſited Mrs. Wormwood; a circumſtance on which the latter founded her ungenerous project. She perfectly knew all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular private hiſtory of Mr. Nelſon, and firmly believed, like all the reſt of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but ſhe thought it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035911_0046_100792ED808F8630"/>
to make Amelia conceive the hope that her beauty had melted his reſolution; and nothing ſhe ſuppoſed, could more effectually mortify her gueſt, than to find herſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided for ſo vain an expectation.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to inſinuate, in the moſt artful manner, that Mr. Nelſon was very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his civilities to Amelia; magnified all his amiable qualities, and expreſſed the greateſt pleaſure in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſo delightful a match. Theſe petty artifices, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had no effect on the natural modeſty and diffidence of Amelia: ſhe ſaw nothing that authoriſed ſuch an idea in the uſual politeneſs of a well-bred man of thirty-ſeven; ſhe pitied the misfortune, ſhe admired the elegant and engaging, though ſerious manners, and ſhe revered the virtues of Mr. Nelſon; but, ſuppoſing his mind to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely engroſſed, as it really was, by his ſingular charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purſuits, ſhe entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite engine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired in her youth, the very dangerous talent of forging any hand that ſhe pleaſed; and her paſſion for miſchief had afforded her much practice in this treacherous art. Having previouſly and ſecretly engaged Mr. Nelſon to drink tea with her, ſhe wrote a billet to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the moſt perfect imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his hand. The billet ſaid, that he deſigned himſelf the pleaſure of paſſing that afternoon at the houſe of Mrs. Wormwood, and requeſted the favour of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference with Miſs Nevil, in the courſe of the ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening; intimating, in the moſt delicate and doubtful terms, an ardent deſire of becoming her huſband. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia ſhould not ſee the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let till juſt before dinner-time, that ſhe might not ſhew it to her friend and confidant, Mrs. Melford, and by her means detect its fallacy before the hour of humiliation arrived.</p>
                  <p>Amelia bluſhed in reading the note, and, in the firſt ſurpriſe of unſuſpecting innocence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Wormwood, who burſt into vehement expreſſions of delight, congratulated her bluſhing gueſt on the full ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of her charms, and triumphed in her own prophetic
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035911_0046_100792ED808F8630"/>
diſcernment. They ſat down to dinner, but poor Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia could hardly ſwallow a morſel; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of pleaſure and amazement. The malicious impoſtor, enjoying her confuſion, allowed her no time to compoſe her hurried ſpirits in the ſolitude of her chamber. Some female viſitors arrived to tea; and at length Mr. Nelſon entered the room. Amelia trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and bluſhed as he approached her: but ſhe was a little relieved from her embaraſſment by the buſineſs of the tea-table, over which ſhe preſided. Amelia was nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally graceful in every thing ſhe did; but the preſent agitation of her mind gave a temporary awkwardneſs to all her motions: ſhe committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politeneſs of Mr. Nelſon led him to ſay ſo many kind and graceful things to her on theſe petty incidents, that, inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing her diſtreſs, they produced an oppoſite effect, and the tumult of her boſom gradually ſubſided into a calm and compoſed delight. She ventured to meet the eyes of Mr. Nelſon, and thought them expreſſive of that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, which promiſed a happy end to all her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. At the idea of exchanging miſery and dependence for comfort and honour, as the wife of ſo amiable a man, her heart expanded with the moſt innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her countenance, and gave ſuch an exquiſite radiance to all her features, that ſhe looked a thouſand times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood ſaw this improvement of her charms, and, ſicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſight, determined to reduce the ſplendor of ſuch inſufferable beauty, and haſtily terminate the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of her deluded gueſt. She began with a few ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and ſarcaſtic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes which they frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of an imaginary lover; but, finding theſe remarks produced not the effect ſhe intended, ſhe took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of whiſpering in the ear of Amelia, and begged her not to harbour any vain expectations; for the billet ſhe had received was a counterfeit, and a mere piece of pleaſantry. Amelia ſhuddered and turned pale: ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, diſappointment, and indignation, conſpired to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035911_0047_1007BF47DC426000"/>
her. She exerted her utmoſt power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her boſom was too violent to be diſguiſed. The tears, which ſhe vainly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuppreſs, burſt forth, and ſhe was obliged to quit the room in very viſible diſorder. Mr. Nelſon expreſſed his concern; but he was checked in his benevolent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who ſaid, on the occaſion, that Miſs Nevil was a very amiable girl, but ſhe had ſome peculiarities of temper, and was apt to put a wrong conſtruction on the innocent pleaſantry of her friends. Mr. Nelſon obſerving that Amelia did not return, and hoping that his departure might reſtore the interrupted harmony of the houſe, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood, who immediately flew to the chamber of Amelia, to exult like a fiend over that lovely victim of her ſucceſsful malignity. She found not the perſon whom ſhe was ſo eager to inſult. Amelia had indeed retired to her chamber, and paſſed there a very miſerable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and ſtill more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which ſhe condemned with that exceſs of ſeverity ſo natural to a delicate mind in arraigning itſelf. She would have flown for immediate conſolation to her friend, Mrs. Melford; but ſhe had reaſon to believe that lady engaged on a viſit; and ſhe therefore reſolved to take a ſolitary walk for the purpoſe of compoſing her ſpirits: but neither ſolitude nor exerciſe could reſtore her tranquillity; and, as it grew towards evening, ſhe haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
                  <p>Her worthy old confidant was indeed in her little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately betrayed her diſtreſs; and the old lady with her uſual tenderneſs exclaimed, "Good Heaven! my dear child, for what have you been crying?" "Becauſe," replied Amelia in a broken voice, and burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a freſh ſhower of tears, "becauſe I am a fool." Mrs. Melford began to be moſt ſeriouſly alarmed; and, expreſſing her maternal ſolicitude in the kindeſt manner, Amelia produced the fatal paper. "There," ſays ſhe, "is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nelſon;
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035911_0047_1007BF47DC426000"/>
it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been ſuch an idiot as to believe it real." The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who, in her firſt alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was herſelf greatly comforted in diſcovering the truth, and ſaid many kind things to conſole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, "that I am fooliſhly in love with Mr. Nelſon, though I think him the moſt pleaſing as well as the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of men; and though I confeſs to you, that I ſhould certainly think it a bleſſed lot to find a refuge from the miſery of my preſent dependance, in the arms of ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and ſo benevolent a protector." "Thoſe arms are now open to receive you," ſaid a voice that was heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpeaker appeared. Amelia ſtarted at the ſound, and her ſurpriſe was not a little increaſed in ſeeing Mr. Nelſon himſelf, who, entering the room from an adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of tenderneſs and delight. Amelia, alive to all the feelings of genuine modeſty, was for ſome minutes more painfully diſtreſſed by this ſurpriſe, than ſhe had been by her paſt mortification: ſhe was ready to ſink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her ſecret to a man, from whom ſhe would have laboured moſt to conceal it. In the firſt tumult of this delicate confuſion, ſhe ſinks into a chair, hides her face in her hankerchief. Nelſon, with a mixture of reſpect and love, being afraid of increaſing her diſtreſs, ſeizes one of her hands, and continues to kiſs it without uttering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much aſtoniſhed, but leſs painfully confuſed than Amelia, beholds this unexpected ſcene, with that kind of joy, which is much more diſpoſed to weep than to ſpeak: and, while this little party is thus abſorbed in ſilence, let me haſten to relate the incidents which produced their ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Nelſon had obſerved the ſarcaſtic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Amelia; and, as ſoon as he had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his uncomfortable viſit, he haſtened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her ſome little account of what had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to concert with her ſome happier plan for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this amiable, inſulted orphan. "I am acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaid he, with ſome brave and wealthy officers, who
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035911_0048_1007BF4A59CD9740"/>
have ſerved with the father of Miſs Nevil, and often ſpeak of him with reſpect; I am ſure I can raiſe among them a ſubſcription for the maintenance of this tender, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that ſhall enable her to eſcape from ſuch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to ſupport a ſervant." Mrs. Melford was tranſported at this idea; and, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting all her own obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his generoſity; and, ſuddenly ſeeing Amelia at ſome diſtance, through a bow window, which commanded the ſtreet in which ſhe lived, "Thank Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſhe cried, here comes my poor child, to hear and bleſs you for the extent of your goodneſs." Nelſon, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted moſt in doing good by ſtealth, immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from the good old lady a promiſe of ſecreſy: it was the beſt part of his plan, that Amelia ſhould never know the perſons, to whom ſhe was to owe her independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. "I am ſtill afraid of you, my worthy old friend, ſaid Nelſon; your countenance or manner will, I know betray me, if Miſs Nevil ſees me here to-night."—"Well, ſaid the delighted old lady, I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will probably not ſtay with me ten minutes; you may amuſe yourſelf, for that time, in my ſpacious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: I will not ſay you are here; and, as ſoon as the good girl returns home, I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexation."—"Admirably ſettled," cried Nelſon; and he immediately retreated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little back room, which led through a glaſs door in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a long ſlip of ground, embelliſhed with the ſweeteſt and leaſt expenſive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amuſement to Mrs. Melford. Nelſon, after taken a few turns in this diminutive garden, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf rather chilled by the air of the evening, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated again into the little room he had paſſed, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wait there till Amelia departed; but the partition between the parlours being extremely ſlight, he overheard the tender confeſſion of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an irreſiſtible impulſe, in the manner already deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Melford was the firſt who recovered from the kind of trance into which our little party had been thrown by
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035911_0048_1007BF4A59CD9740"/>
their general ſurpriſe; and ſhe enabled the tender pair, in the proſpect of whoſe union her warm heart exulted, to regain that eaſy and joyous poſſeſſion of their faculties, which they loſt for ſome little time in their mutual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment. The applauſe of her friend, and the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her lover, ſoon taught the diffident Amelia to think leſs ſeverely of herſelf. The warm-hearted Mrs. Melford declared that theſe occurrences were the work of Heaven. "That (replied the affectionate Nelſon) I am moſt willing to allow; but you muſt grant that Heaven has produced our preſent happineſs, by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a ſpirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil converted into the torment of its poſſeſſor, I muſt beg that ſhe may not return, even for a ſingle night, to the houſe of Mrs. Wormwood." Amelia pleaded her ſenſe of paſt obligations, and wiſhed to take a peaceful leave of her patroneſs; but ſhe ſubmitted to the ardent entreaties of Nelſon, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when ſhe was united at the altar to the man of her heart. Nelſon had the double delight of rewarding the affection of an angel, and of puniſhing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in perſon to Mrs. Wormwood his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when that treacherous old maid had amuſed herſelf with the hope of deriding her gueſt; whoſe return ſhe was eagerly expecting, in the moment Nelſon arrived to ſay, that Amelia would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more.</p>
                  <p>The ſurpriſe and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aroſe almoſt to frenzy: ſhe racked her malicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive brain for expedients to defeat the match, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated a report for that purpoſe, which decency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and deſpiſed. Amelia was not only married, but the moſt admired, the moſt beloved, and the happieſt of human beings; an event which preyed ſo inceſſantly on the ſpirit of Mrs. Wormwood, that ſhe fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her miſchievous and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life; a memorable example, that the moſt artful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity may ſometimes procure for the object of its envy, that very happineſs which it labours to prevent!</p>

                  <head>HISTORY OF MELETINA.</head>
                  <p>MELETINA is the accompliſhed daughter of opulent parents. Her mother died when ſhe was very young. Her father, a man of feeling and liberal mind, devoted himſelf entirely to the education of his two love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, Meletina and her brother, who, being nearly of an age, and equal in all the beſt gifts of nature, grew up together in the tendereſt affection. It happened that Meletina, now turned of twenty, was on a diſtant viſit, at the houſe of a female relation, when ſhe heard that her father, whom ſhe loved moſt tenderly, was attacked by a very dangerous diſorder. The poor girl haſtened home in the moſt painful anxiety, which was converted into the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt diſtreſs, by her finding, on her return, that her father was dead, and her brother confined by the malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, which he had caught in his inceſſant attendance on the parent they had loſt. The utmoſt efforts were uſed to keep Meletina from the chamber of her brother; but no entreaties could prevail on her to deſert the only ſurviving object of her ardent affection; and, deſpiſing the idea of her own danger, ſhe attended the unhappy youth, who was now delirious, with ſuch tender aſſiduity, that ſhe would not permit him to receive either nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or medicine from any hand but her own. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her conſtitution, or the immediate care of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, preſerved the generous Meletina from infection, and Heaven granted to her earneſt prayers the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life of her brother; but his recovery ſeemed rather deſigned as a trial of her fortitude than as a reward of her tenderneſs: his bodily health was reſtored to him, but his mental faculties were deſtroyed. The unhappy Meletina, in the place of a lively young friend and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous protector, found only a poor babbling idiot, whoſe ſituation appeared to her the more deplorable, becauſe, though he had utterly loſt a ſolid and a brilliant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he ſeemed to retain all his benevolent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. By one peculiarity which attended him, ſhe was
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035911_0049_1007BF4C46CB0F38"/>
ſingularly affected; and perhaps it made her reſolve on the extraordinary ſacrifice which ſhe has offered to his calamity. The peculiarity I ſpeak of was this; he not only diſcovered grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſatisfaction in the ſight of his ſiſter, though utterly unable to maintain a rational converſation with her, but if ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eft him for any conſiderable time, he began to expreſs, by many wild geſtures, extreme agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and anxiety, and could never be prevailed on to touch any food, except in the preſence of Meletina. Many experiments were tried to quiet his apprehenſions on this point, and to relieve his ſiſter from ſo inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and ſo painful an attendance. Theſe experiments did not ſucceed; but two medical friends of Meletina, who took a generous intereſt in her health and happineſs, engaged to correct this peculiarity in her poor ſenſeleſs brother, and convinced her that for his ſake, as well as for her own, ſhe ought to acquieſce in ſome painful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients for this purpoſe. Her underſtanding was indeed convinced by their humane and judicious arguments, but her heart ſoon revolted againſt them; and, after two or three ſevere but unſucceſsful attempts to correct the obſtinate habit of the affectionate idiot, ſhe determined to irritate him no further, but to make an entire ſacrifice of her own convenience and pleaſure to the tranquillity of this unfortunate being. She felt a tender and melancholy delight in promoting his peace and comfort; but the time now arrived in which the force and purity of her ſiſterly attachment was expoſed to a trial perhaps as ſevere as ever woman ſuſtained. A year and ſome months had now elapſed ſince the deceaſe of her father, when a young ſoldier, of family and fortune, who had made a deep impreſſion on her youthful heart, returned to England from a diſtant campaign. He was juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from a wound, which had detained him abroad, and returned home in the ardent hope of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely rewarded for all his toils and ſufferings, by the poſſeſſion of his lovely Meletina. She received him with all the frankneſs and warmth of a ſincere and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous affection: but, after they had given to each other a long and circumſtantial account of their paſt diſtreſſes, ſhe anſwered his eager propoſal of immediate marriage
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035911_0050_1007BF502F517AC8"/>
by declaring, that ſhe thought it her duty to renou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> her fair proſpect of connubial happineſs, and to devote herſelf entirely to that unfortunate brother, who exiſted only by her inceſſant attention: She enumerated the many reaſons that inclined her to ſuch a painful ſacrifice, with all the ſimple and pathetic eloquence of angelic vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Her lover, who poſſeſſed that melting tenderneſs of heart which often accompanies heroic courage, liſten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I muſt not be your wife. The peculiarity of my ſituation calls for ſo painful a ſacrifice; but great ſacrifices have great rewards. I feel that I ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the noble pride, not only of diſcharging my duty, but of preſerving your tender eſteem, which I ſhould certainly deſerve to forfeit, as well as my own, if I did not reſolutely decline your too generous propoſal." The affectionate young ſoldier endeavoured to ſhake her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by every argument that the truth and ardour of his paſſion could poſſibly ſuggeſt. Meletina was inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the utmoſt that her lover could obtain, was a promiſe, that if, by attention, and time, ſhe ſucceeded in her hope of reſtoring the intellects of her brother, ſhe would complete the ſcene of general happineſs, which that joyful event would occaſion, by the immediate acceptance of that hand which ſhe now rejected only from the juſt ſcruples of genuine affection. Having thus ſettled their
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035911_0050_1007BF502F517AC8"/>
very delicate conteſt, they parted. The ſoldier rejoined his regiment; but, in ſpite of military diſſipation, continued for a long time to write very tender letters to the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meletina. At laſt, however, whether his paſſion was diminiſhed by its deſpair of being gratified, or whether the purity of a chaſte attachment is incompatible with a martial life, while he was engaged in dangerous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervice, he was deeply involved in a very perplexing illicit intrigue, which would probably have given him many years of diſquietude, had not the chance of war put an early period to his life. A muſket-ball paſſed through his body; but he lived long enough to write an affectionate parting letter to Meletina, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his frailties, extolled her angelic purity of heart, and entreated her to do what he ſolemnly aſſured her he did himſelf—conſider both the time and the manner of his death, not as a misfortune, but a bleſſing. Meletina lamented him when dead, as ſhe had loved him living, with the moſt faithful tenderneſs: ſhe mourned for him as for a huſband; and though many years have elapſed ſince his deceaſe, a grey ſilk is to this day her conſtant apparel. Nor is there any oſtentation in this peculiarity of her dreſs; for her attendance on her brother is ſtill ſo uniform, that ſhe never appears in public, and indeed is never abſent from her own houſe more than two or three hours at a time. From habit, and the affectionate caſt of her temper, ſhe takes a pleaſure in the petty childiſh plays by which her hapleſs companion is amuſed; and ſo far from ſinking herſelf into a ſtate of indolence or apathy, ſhe poſſeſſes great delicacy of manners, and all the ſtrength and luſtre of a refined underſtanding. She is now turned of fifty; and though her countenance when ſhe is ſilent, has an air of mild and touching mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy, her converſation is animated and cheerful. As her brother pleaſes himſelf by the habit of riſing and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſt with the lark, ſhe has the long winter evenings entirely to herſelf; and at this ſeaſon ſhe has a great ſhare of ſocial enjoyment, by receiving the viſits of her ſelected friends. To theſe ſhe is remarkably open and unreſerved, and has a peculiar pleaſure in talking over the extraordinary occurrences of her early life. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

                  <p>CASOS is one of the cyclades. It received its name from Caſo, father of Cleomachus. This little iſland ſent a colony to Mount Caſius, dependent on Syri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is eighty ſtadia [three leagues] in circumference; on it is a town of the ſame name, and round it ſeveral ſmaller iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The iſle of Caſos has ſuffered the common fate of the Archipelago. It is now ſubject to the Turks, but they dare not inhabit it, becauſe it has no fort. They would be afraid of being made priſoners by the privateers of Malta, as has happened to them more than once at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiparos, and other places deſtitute of fortreſſes. This fear is a moſt fortunate circumſtance for the inhabitants, who owe to that alone, the tranquillity, happineſs, and liberty they enjoy.</p>
                  <p>The day after we caſt anchor, I was impatient to go on ſhore. The boat accordingly was launched, and we row<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> towards the rocks which ſurrounded the iſland, but were at a loſs where to land. Every part of the ſhore was defended by dangerous ſhoals, over which the foaming billows broke with great noiſe and violence. On whichever ſide we caſt our eyes, Caſos appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed inacceſſible. At length one of the inhabitants, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our embarraſſment, came down from the village, and pointed out to us, by waving his handkerchief, the place to which we ſhould direct our courſe. We reached the place, after coaſting about a league along the iſland. The ground here becomes lower, and forms a valley, at the extremity of which a ſmall baſon has been dug for the reception of boats. The entrance is only twelve
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035911_0051_1007BFBDCDDE9D08"/>
feet wide, and very difficult of acceſs, as it muſt be paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through exactly in the middle. If the boat ſhould touch the ſides, which are ſharp rocks, it would be in great danger of being daſhed to pieces. Add to this that, when we arrived before the entrance, a violent ſwell was ebbing out of it. The Caſiot called one of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and placing themſelves on each ſide, they made a ſign to us to pull ſtrong. As ſoon as our boat had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the dangerous paſs, they guided it with long poles, to prevent it from ſtriking againſt the rocks, and thus conducted it into port. Through this paſſage alone is it poſſible to get on ſhore in the iſland. The inhabitants might widen it if they choſe; but they prefer leaving it thus dangerous, ſince, while it remains ſo, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der little apprehenſion from their enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Caſiot who had ſhewn us the harbour politely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us to go up to the village, and we followed him with pleaſure. I was dreſſed in the French ſtyle, with a ſword, hat, and every other appurtenance of the dreſs of my nation. The news of the arrival of ſtrangers ſoon ſpread, and the women and children came out of their houſes, and waited for us at the top of the hill. They ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great deal of curioſity, and examined us attentively. When we paſſed them, they all modeſtly caſt down their eyes. Among the crowd there were ſome very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Several of them ſaluted us, wiſhing us a good day, ſaying, "You are welcome!" and we anſwered them with the uſual eaſtern expreſſion—"May the day be happy for you and for your gueſts!"</p>
                  <p>The guide who conducted us was one of the principal inhabitants of the iſland. He preſſed me to ſtep into his houſe, and introduced me into a hall, which, though not magnificently furniſhed, was ſufficiently provided with every thing conducive to cleanlineſs and convenience. Around it was a ſofa. He ſeated me on a raiſed bench, and placed himſelf below, while breakfaſt was preparing. Soon after, his wife and daughter appeared, with new-laid eggs, figs, and grapes. The girl bluſhed at ſight of a ſtranger, whoſe dreſs muſt, no doubt, appear to her very extraordinary. Whilſt we were breakfaſting with a good appetite, and my hoſt was pouring me out ſome

excellent wine in a large glaſs, moſt of the women of the village came to pay him a viſit. They ſaluted us, and ſeated themſelves without ceremony around the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They had been brought by curioſity, and ſoon began to whiſper one another, and make their remarks on the French dreſs.

My attention was eſpecially engaged by two young fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, who would have been acknowledged to be hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſome, even in Paris.</p>
                  <p>The leaſt of the two had eyes full of fire, and fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> black eyebrows, equally arched. Her complexion was rather brown, but her features extremely animated. Her cheeks, delicately rounded, were every inſtant adorned with freſh roſes. Her delicate little mouth ſeemed form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay charming things. When ſhe ſmiled, teeth white as ſnow agreeably contraſted the vermillion of her lips; and a moſt enchanting vivacity animated her whole countenance, which ſeemed to ſparkle with wit and rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artee. Her ebon locks, faſtened (according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the country) to the crown of her head, fell negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently on a neck which ſeemed of poliſhed ivory. A bodice without ſleeves, opening a little towards the top<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afforded a glimpſe of the exact proportion of her beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhape. A robe of the whiteſt and fineſt cotton, edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a purple border four fingers wide, and elegantly embroidered, deſcended to her feet, and her waiſt was looſely girded by a ſaſh which floated around her.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond diſputed with her the palm of beauty. Her ſhape was more elegant, and her carriage more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Her eyes ſhone with a ſoft languor, and ſeemed
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035911_0052_1007BF5505BC6A10"/>
formed to inſpire love and delight, while her long eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſhes modeſtly lowered, concealed their ſplendor, as if ſhe were afraid of betraying the ſecrets of her ſoul. Her complexion was fairer; and her cheeks, leſs coloured, diſplayed the lily ſlightly tinctured with the roſe. Her features, though ſcarcely ſo expreſſive as thoſe of her companion, had more regularity, and were models of ſymmetry and juſt proportion. At the firſt glance ſhe but juſt appeared what may be called handſome; but on more mature conſideration, the perfection of the whole of her beauties enforced the higheſt admiration. The charms of the former inſpired a ſudden joy, and it was impoſſible to look on her without pleaſure: thoſe of the latter made leſs impreſſion at the firſt view; but, on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, an irreſiſtible attraction forced every heart of ſenſibility to pay her the ſincereſt homage.</p>
                  <p>All the women, who honoured us with their preſence, were dreſſed in the ſame manner. They all wore the jacket, the ſaſh, and the long robe of cotton. The only difference conſiſted in the embroidery, which varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different taſtes, and in the manner of wearing their hair, which ſome of them ſuffered to flow upon their ſhoulders in one or more treſſes, while others faſtened it to the crown of the head, letting it fall down again upon the neck. The two I have juſt mentioned, were not the only ones who were handſome, but their beauty appeared to me the moſt attractive.</p>
                  <p>You may poſſibly imagine, madam, that, after the ſad ſcenes to which I had been for ſome time accuſtomed, my imagination was inflamed at the ſight of theſe lovely fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and that I have taken a pleaſure in embelliſhing them. That may indeed be the caſe; but if it be, the illuſion was of ſome duration. I paſſed eight days in the iſland, and would not wiſh to alter a ſingle feature in the portraits I have drawn. I have deſcribed what I ſaw, and what I felt. I own to you, however, that my ſurpriſe was equal to my pleaſure. I expected to find, on this rock, only miſerable ſlaves, groaning under the oppreſſions of the Turks; inſtead of which, I met with a cheerful and happy people, who were fortunate enough to be able to preſerve their liberty amid the deſpotiſm and tyranny with which they are ſurrounded.</p>

They bgan to range themſelves in a ring, and invited me to dance. I did not wait for many entreaties. The circle we formed is ſingular, from the manner in which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven: the dancer does not give his hand to the two perſons next him, but to thoſe next them, ſo that you have your hands croſſed before your neighbours, who are thus locked, as it were, in the links of a double chain. This interweaving is not without pleaſure. In the middle of the circle ſtood the muſician, who played and ſang at the ſame time, while all the dancers kept exact time in advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, retreating or turning round him.

                  <p>IT was quite duſk when I got aſhore, and the evening being delightfully ſerene, I was glad, after ſo long a confinement, to ſtretch my legs, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to walk home to my lodgings, at the weſt end of the town.</p>
                  <p>Having occaſion to recur to my ſnuff-box, I found that its contents were exhauſted, by being liberally offered to ſome of my companions in the hoy; ſo it occurred to me to call at my old ſnuff ſhop in Covent Garden, and get it repleniſhed; conceiving I might at the ſame time pick up a little intelligence of what was ſtirring in town.</p>

In the life of Moſes, the philoſopher will meet with many curious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſpeculation, the ſtateſman with many intereſting particulars relative to policy and government, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine with many important incidents reſpecting the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of religion, which the moraliſt, who conſiders characters ſolely with the view of deducing from them uſeful leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the conduct of life, will be obliged to paſs by without notice.

                  <p>The extraordinary circumſtances, which attended the birth and early education of Moſes, are too intereſting and inſtructive to be overlooked.</p>
                  <p>At that time, the Iſraelites were groaning under the yoke of Egyptian bondage. The preſent king, who knew not Joſeph, jealous of their increaſing numbers and ſtrength, and fearful leſt they ſhould, in ſome future time, enter into an alliance with the enemies of Egypt, determined to haraſs and afflict, and as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to cruſh them. "He made their lives bitter with hard bondage in all manner of ſervice, and ſet over them taſt-maſters to afflict them with their burdens." This rigorous treatment, however, did not produce the effect which the king deſigned. Inſtead of being weakened and diminiſhed by the hardſhips which they ſuffered, "the more he afflicted them the more they multiplied." Obſerving this, he now reſolved to add cruelty to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and, effectually to remove every ground of fear

                  <p>The mother of Moſes, chooſing to obey nature and God rather than man, hid her ſon three months. And when ſhe found it impoſſible to conceal him longer, as the laſt expedient for his ſafety, ſhe put him into an art of bullruſhes properly ſecured againſt the water, and laid him among the ruſhes by the river ſide, near the place where the king's daughter and her attendants uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally came to bathe. Then leaving the child, doubtleſs with diſtreſſing anxiety, but not without hope that ſome fortunate incident might occur, ſhe ſtationed her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not far from the place to obſerve the iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, the young princeſs, Pharaoh's daughter, came with her attendants to the river ſide. She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately caſt her eye upon the ark lying among the ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and, curious to know the contents, ſent one of her maidens to fetch it. The mother, to preſerve the child as long as ſhe could, had covered it up with care in its ruſhy cradle, which, without ſome friendly hand to ſave it, muſt ſhortly have been in its grave. The princeſs removed the covering and found—a child. "And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the babe wept." The cries of infants find eaſy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

to the female heart. Though the helpleſs innocent knew not its danger, nor was able to beg for protection; its piteous tears ſpoke to the feelings of the young prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with an eloquence, which no prejudice of education, no pride of rank, no motives of intereſt or prudence, could withſtand.</p>
                  <p>She ſoon diſcovered that it belonged to one of the Hebrews. It was a child of ſuch mean and ignoble birth, as might ſeem beneath the notice of a royal princeſs, it ſprung from a race of ſtrangers, who had no natural claim to protection and favour in Egypt. It came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſentence of her father's edict againſt the male children of the Iſraelites. To attempt its reſcue might therefore be conſtrued into an act of diſobedience to him, and rebellion againſt the government, and might expoſe her to private reſentment and public cenſure. Any of theſe circumſtances may be ſuppoſed to have ariſen in her mind, upon the diſcovery of the child; and to a prejudiced and bigotted underſtanding, a cowardly and timorous ſpirit, or a ſelfiſh and unfeeling heart, might have furniſhed an apology for leaving the helpleſs infant to periſh. But, either ſhe was ſo wholly loſt in the emotions of pity, which the incident excited as to be inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to every other conſideration, or (which is more probable) the principles of generoſity and compaſſion had ſuch a commanding power within her, as to overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance every inferior motive. "She had compaſſion on the child."</p>
                  <p>His ſiſter, who ſtood near, obſerving the favourable notice which the princeſs took of her infant brother, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to ſpeak a word in his behalf, and offered to go and call one of the Hebrew women to nurſe the child for her. The princeſs liſtened to the propoſal, which accorded with her benevolent intentions, and ſent her to ſeek a nurſe. The meſſenger, who was at no loſs to whom to apply, ran and called the child's mother. With what pleaſure the mother received and obeyed the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which baniſhed all her fears and placed herſelf and her ſon under the protection of the king's daughter, may be better conceived than expreſſed.

                  <p>Unfortunately for George, before he had attained his twenty-third year, he became attached to a young lady, who had every requiſite to render the married ſtate hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,

but money; and money being the old gentleman's darling idol, he conſequently thought ſhe poſſeſſed no requiſite worthy the wife of his ſon: but George was too far engaged to retreat with honour; he therefore told his father, he was reſolved upon the union, and in a few days preſented his beloved Louiſa to entreat his bleſſing,</p>
                  <p>When Sir James found they were really married, he thought it was in vain to fly in a paſſion; he received them cordially, and gave them an univerſal invitation to his houſe, but in his heart he never forgave them. The livings were diſpoſed of to other people, and at his death he left the whole of his eſtate to his eldeſt ſon.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about eighty pounds a year, and as regular as the year came round, his wife preſented him with a child. Poverty took up her habitation among them, and he bitterly regretted having, by an act of diſobedience, not only brought on himſelf his father's diſpleaſure, but involved an amiable woman, whom he loved, in a ſcene of penury and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Theſe reflections ſoured his diſpoſition; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came peeviſh and moroſe; nay ſometimes went ſo far, as to reproach his wife as the cauſe of his abject ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Campbell took great care to inſtil into the minds of her children, the reſpect and affection due from them to their father. "My dear children," ſhe would often ſay, "be aſſured a breach of filial duty is ever attended with regret, and in general with misfortune."</p>
                  <p>Louiſa was the eldeſt of five children; ſhe was mild, meek, and affectionate. She attentively liſtened to the precepts of her mother, and laid them up in her heart, as an ineſtimable treaſure. Mr. Campbell's temper grew ſo extremely bad, that not only his wife, but his children came in for a ſhare of his ill humour. Louiſa, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, was ſure to be wrong, in whatever ſhe ſaid or did, and it was ſeldom ſhe was favoured with a kind or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate word; yet her manners were ſo amiable and her form ſo lovely, that though ſhe laboured under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages of a narrow education and extreme poverty, her company was courted by ſome of the genteeleſt fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies in the village; but in compliance with her father's ill humour, ſhe was ſeldom allowed to ſtir from home.</p>

                  <p>No ſooner was he out of her ſight, than he began to expoſtulate with himſelf upon his indiſcretion. In the ecſtacy of one unguarded moment he had blaſted all his ſchemes; and, by expoſing his weakneſs, armed her with freſh engines to torment him. In theſe reflections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Adeliſa was alone, and Leander immediately began by ſaying to her, "I am now come to receive at your hands the puniſhment, which the man who cannot keep his own ſecret richly deſerves. I ſurrender myſelf to you, and I expect you will exert your utmoſt ingenuity in tormenting me; only remember that you cannot give a ſtab to my heart without wounding your own image, which envelopes every part, and is too deeply impre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

At the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this ſpeech, Adeliſa's countenance became ſerious; ſhe fixt her eyes upon the floor, and after a pauſe, without taking any notice of Leander, and as if ſhe had been talking to herſelf in ſoliloquy, repeated in a murmuring tone, "Well, well, 'tis all over; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

"All that is moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to women," ſhe replied; "all the luxury, which the vanity of my ſex enjoys in tormenting your's: O Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! what charming projects of revenge had I contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to puniſh your pretended indifference; and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it I would have executed them to the utmoſt rigour of the law of retaliation, had you not in one moment diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed me of my malice by a fair confeſſion of your love. Believe me, Leander, I never was a coquette but in ſelf-defence; ſincerity is my natural character; but how ſhould a woman of any attractions be ſafe in ſuch a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, when the whole circle of faſhion abounds with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial coxcombs, pretenders to ſentiment, and profeſſors of ſeduction? Between you and me, Leander, this has been more a conteſt of cunning than an affair of honour, and if you will call your own conduct into fair review, truſt me, you will find little reaſon to complain of mine. Naturally diſpoſed to favour your attentions more than any other man's, it particularly behoved me to guard myſelf againſt propenſities at once ſo pleaſing and ſo ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious. Let this ſuffice in juſtification of what is paſt; it now remains that I ſhould explain to you the ſyſtem I have laid down for the time to come: if ever I aſſume the character of a wife, I devote myſelf to all its duties; I bid farewel at once to all the vanities, the petulancies, the coquetries of what is falſely called a life of pleaſure; the whole ſyſtem muſt undergo a revolution, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered upon other principles and to other purpoſes: I know the world too well to commit myſelf to it, when I have more than my own conſcience to account to, when I have not only truths to ſtudy; ſuſpicions, jealouſies, appearances to provide againſt; when I am no longer ſingly reſponſible on the ſcore of error, but of example alſo: it is not therefore in the public diſplay of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent fortune, in dreſs, equipage, entertainments, nor even in the fame of ſplendid charities my pleaſures will be found; they will centre in domeſtic occupations; in cultivating nature and the ſons of nature, in benefiting the tenants and labourers of the ſoil that ſupplies us with the means of being uſeful; in living happily with my neighbours, in availing myſelf of thoſe numberleſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, which a reſidence in the country affords of relieving the untold diſtreſſes of thoſe, who ſuffer in ſecret, and are too humble, or perhaps too proud to aſk."—</p>

                  <p>CHARLOTTE and Maria were educated together at an eminent boarding-ſchool near London; there was little difference in their age, and their perſonal accompliſhments were equal: but though their families were of the ſame rank, yet, as Charlotte was an only child, ſhe was conſiderably ſuperior in fortune.</p>
                  <p>Soon after they were taken home, Charlotte was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by Captain Freeman, who, beſides his commiſſion in the guards, had a ſmall paternal eſtate: but as her friends hoped for a more advantageous match, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was deſired to forbear his viſits, and the lady to think of him no more. After ſome fruitleſs ſtruggles, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced; but the diſcontent of both was ſo apparent, that it was thought expedient to remove Miſs into the country. She was ſent to her aunt, the Lady Meadows, who, with her daughter, lived retired at the family ſeat, more than one hundred miles diſtant from the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. After ſhe had repined in this dreary ſolitude from April to Auguſt, ſhe was ſurpriſed with a viſit from her father, who brought with him Sir James Forreſt, a young gentleman who had juſt ſucceeded to a baronet's title, and a very large eſtate in the ſame county. Sir James had good nature and good ſenſe, an agreeable perſon and an eaſy addreſs. Miſs was inſenſibly pleaſed with his company; her vanity, if not her love, had a new object; a deſire to be delivered from a ſtate of dependence and obſcurity, had almoſt abſorbed all the reſt; and it is no wonder that this deſire was gratified, when ſcarce any other was felt; or that in compliance with the united ſolicitations of her friends, and her lover, ſhe ſuffered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035911_0067_1007BF787675ECD0"/>
within a few weeks to become a lady and a wife. They continued in the country till the beginning of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, and then came up to London, having prevailed upon her aunt to accompany them, that Miſs Meadows, with whom the bride had contracted an intimate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, might be gratified with the diverſions of the town during the winter.</p>
                  <p>Captain Freeman, when he heard that Miſs Charlotte was married, immediately made propoſals of marriage to Maria, with whom he became acquainted during his viſits to her friend, and ſoon after married her.</p>
                  <p>The friendſhip of the two young ladies ſeemed to be rather increaſed than diminiſhed by their marriage; they were always of the ſame party, both in the private and public diverſions of the ſeaſon, and viſited each other without the formalities of meſſages and dreſs.</p>
                  <p>But neither Sir James nor Mrs. Freeman could reflect without uneaſineſs upon the frequent interviews which this familiarity and confidence produced between a lover and his miſtreſs, whom force only had divided; and though of theſe interviews they were themſelves witneſſes, yet Sir James inſenſibly became jealous of his lady, and Mrs. Freeman of her huſband.</p>
                  <p>It happened, in the May following, that Sir James went about ten miles out of town, to be preſent at the election of a member of parliament for the county, and was not expected to return till the next day. In the evening, his lady took a chair and viſited Mrs. Freeman: the reſt of the company went away early; the Captain was upon guard; Sir James was out of town, and the two la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies after ſupper ſat down to piquet, and continued the game without once reflecting upon the hour till three in the morning. Lady Forreſt would then have gone home; but Mrs. Freeman, perhaps chiefly to conceal a contrary deſire, importuned her to ſtay till the Captain came in, and at length with ſome reluctance ſhe conſented.</p>
                  <p>About five, the Captain came home, and Lady Forreſt immediately ſent out for a chair: a chair, as it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not be procured; but a hackney-coach being brought in its ſtead, the Captain inſiſted upon waiting on her ladyſhip home. This ſhe refuſed with ſome emotion;
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035911_0068_1007BF7A52BCEFA0"/>
it is probable that ſhe ſtill regarded the Captain with leſs indifference than ſhe wiſhed, and was therefore more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the impropriety of his offer: but her reaſons for rejecting it, however forcible, being ſuch as ſhe could not allege, he perſiſted, and her reſolution was overborne. By this importunate complaiſance he had not only thrown Lady Forreſt into confuſion, but diſpleaſed his wife: ſhe could not, however, without unpoliteneſs, oppoſe it; and, leſt her uneaſineſs ſhould be diſcovered, ſhe affected a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence which in ſome degree revenged it: ſhe deſired that when he came back he would not diſturb her, for that ſhe ſhould go directly to bed; and added, with a kind of drowſy inſenſibility, "I am more than half aſleep already."</p>
                  <p>Lady Forreſt and the Captain were to go from the Haymarket to Groſvenor Square. It was about half an hour after five when they got into the coach; the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was remarkably fine, the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Captain zealouſly expreſſed the ſame ſentiment, and propoſed that the coach ſhould ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t them down at St. James's Gate. The lady, however, had nearly the ſame objections againſt being ſeen in the Mall without any other company than the Captain, that ſhe had againſt its being known that they were alone togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a hackney-coach: ſhe, therefore, to extricate her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from this ſecond difficulty, propoſed that they ſhould call at her father's in Bondſtreet, and take her couſin Meadows, whom ſhe knew to be an early rifer, with them. This project was immediately put in execution; but La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Forreſt found her couſin indiſpoſed with a cold. When ſhe had communicated the deſign of this early viſit, Miſs Meadows entreated her to give up her walk in the Park, to ſtay till the family roſe, and go home after breakfaſt. "No," replied Lady Forreſt, "I am determined upon a walk; but as I muſt firſt get rid of Captain Freeman, I will ſend down word that I will take your advice." A ſervant was accordingly diſpatched to acquaint the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who was waiting below, that Miſs Meadows was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, and had engaged Lady Forreſt to breakfaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="unknown:035911_0068_1007BF7A52BCEFA0"/>The Captain diſcharged the coach; but being piqued a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Lady Forreſt, not doubting but that the Captain would immediately return home, congratulated herſelf upon her deliverance; but, at the ſame time, to indulge her deſire of a walk, followed him into the Park.</p>
                  <p>The Captain had reached the top of the Mall, and turning back met her, before ſhe had advanced two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces beyond the Palace. The moment ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, the remembrance of her meſſage, the motives that produced it, the detection of its falſehood, and diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of its deſign, her diſappointment and conſciouſneſs of that very ſituation which ſhe had ſo much reaſon to avoid, all concurred to cover her with confuſion, which it was impoſſible to hide: pride and good-breeding were, however, ſtill predominant over truth and prudence; ſhe was ſtill zealous to remove from the Captain's mind any ſuſpicion of a deſign to ſhun him, and therefore with an effort perhaps equal to that of a hero, who ſmiles upon the rack, ſhe affected an air of gaiety, ſaid ſhe was glad to ſee him, and as an excuſe for her meſſage and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, prattled ſomething about the ſickleneſs of woman's mind, and concluded with obſerving, that ſhe changed her's too often ever to be mad. By this conduct a retreat was rendered impoſſible, and they walked together till between eight and nine: but the clouds having inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gathered, and a ſudden ſhower falling juſt as they had reached Spring-Gardens, they went out inſtead of going back; and the Captain having put the lady into a chair, took his leave.</p>
                  <p>It happened that Sir James, contrary to his firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, had returned from his journey at night. He learnt from the ſervants, that his lady was gone to Captain Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, and was ſecretly diſpleaſed that ſhe had made this viſit when he was abſent; an incident, which, however trifling in itſelf, was, by the magic of jealouſy, ſwelled into importance: yet, upon recollection he reproved

himſelf for this diſpleaſure, ſince the preſence of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's lady would ſufficiently ſecure the honour of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e own. While he was ſtruggling with theſe ſuſpicions, they increaſed both in number and ſtrength in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the night wore away. At one, he went to bed; but he paſſed the night in agonies of terror and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doubting whether the abſence of his lady was the effect of accident or deſign, liſtening to every noiſe, and bewildering himſelf in a multitude of extravagant ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. He roſe again at break of day; and after ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hours of ſuſpenſe and irreſolution, whether to wait the iſſue, or go out for intelligence, the reſtleſſneſs of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prevailed, and about eight he ſet out for Captain Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's; but left word with his ſervants, that he was gone to a neighbouring coffee-houſe.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Freeman, whoſe affected indifference and diſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation of a deſign to go immediately to bed, contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prevent the Captain's return, had during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſuffered inexpreſſible diſquiet: ſhe had, indeed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intention to go to bed, nor inclination to ſleep; ſhe walked backward and forward in her chamber, diſtracted with jealouſy and ſuſpenſe, till ſhe was informed that Sir James was below, and deſired to ſee her. When ſhe came down, he diſcovered that ſhe had been in tears: his fear was now more alarmed than his jealouſy, and he concluded that ſome fatal accident had befallen his wife; but he ſoon learnt that ſhe and the Captain had gone from thence at five in the morning, and that he was not yet returned, Mrs. Freeman, by Sir James's inquiry, knew that his lady had not been at home: her ſuſpicions were, therefore, confirmed; and in her jealouſy, which to prevent a duel ſhe laboured to conceal, Sir James found new cauſe for his own. He determined, however, to wait with as much decency as poſſible, till the Captain came in; and perhaps two perſons were never more embarraſſed by the preſence of each other. While break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt was getting ready, Dr. Tattle came to pay Mrs. Freeman a morning viſit; and, to the unſpeakable grief both of the lady and her gueſt, was immediately admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Dr. Tattle is one of thoſe male goſſips who, in the common opinion, are the moſt diverting company in the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035911_0069_1007BF7CD25FB088"/>
world. The Doctor ſaw that Mrs. Freeman was low ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited, and made ſeveral efforts to divert her, but without ſucceſs: at length he declared, with an air of ironical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that he could tell her ſuch news as would make her look grave for ſomething: "The Captain," ſays he, "has juſt huddled a lady into a chair, at the door of a bagnio, near Spring-Gardens." He ſoon perceived that this ſpeech was received with emotions very different from thoſe he intended to produce; and therefore added, "that ſhe need not however be jealous; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the manner in which he had related the incident, the lady was certainly a woman of character, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſcovered by her mein and appearance." This particular confirmed the ſuſpicion it was intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; and the Doctor, finding that he was not as good company as uſual, took his leave, but was met at the door by the Captain, who brought him back. His preſence, however inſignificant, impoſed ſome reſtraint upon the reſt of the company; and Sir James, with as good an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of jocularity as he could aſſume, aſked the Captain "What he had done with his wife." The Captain, with ſome irreſolution, replied, that "he had left her early in the morning at her father's; and that having made a point of waiting on her home, ſhe ſent down word that her couſin Meadows was indiſpoſed, and had engaged her to breakfaſt." The Captain who knew nothing of the anecdote, that had been communicated by the Doctor, judged by appearances that it was prudent thus indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lie, by concealing the truth both from Sir James and his wife: he ſuppoſed, indeed, that Sir James would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inquire after his wife at her father's, and learn that ſhe did not ſtay there to breakfaſt; but as it would not follow that they had been together, he left her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for her abſence as ſhe thought fit, taking for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that what he had concealed ſhe would alſo conceal, for the ſame reaſons; or, if ſhe did not, as he had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing contrary to truth, he might pretend to have concealed it in jeſt. Sir James, as ſoon as he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this intelligence, took his leave with ſome appearance of ſatisfaction, and was followed by the Doctor.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. Freeman was convinced of the Captain's ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only by the advice he urged her to give Lady Forreſt, but by the conſiſtency of the ſtory and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he was affected. Her jealouſy was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into pity for her friend, and apprehenſion for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. She haſted to Miſs Meadows, and learnt that Sir James had inquired of the ſervant for his lady, and was told that ſhe had been there early with Captain Freeman, but went away ſoon after him: ſhe related to Miſs Mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows all that had happened, and thinking it at leaſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Sir James might not go directly home, ſhe wrote the following letter to his lady.</p>

                  <p>This letter was given to a chairman, and he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſay he brought it from the milliner's; becauſe, if it ſhould he known to come from Mrs. Freeman, and ſhould fall by accident into Sir James's hands, his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity might prompt him to read it, and his jealouſy to queſtion the lady, without communicating the contents.</p>
                  <p>Sir James being convinced that his lady and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had paſſed the morning at a bagnio, by the anſwer which he received at her father's, went directly home. His lady was juſt arrived before him, and had not recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from the confuſion and dread, which ſeized her, when ſhe heard that Sir James came to town the night before, and at the ſame inſtant anticipated the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her own indiſcretion.</p>
                  <p>She was told he was then at the coffee-houſe, and in a few minutes was thrown into an univerſal tremor, upon hearing him knock at the door. He perceived her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, not with compaſſion but rage, becauſe he believed it to proceed from the conſciouſneſs of guilt. He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pale, and his lips quivered; but he ſo far reſtrained his paſſion, as to aſk her, without invective, "Where and how ſhe had paſſed the night." She replied, "at Captain Freeman's; that the Captain was upon guard; that ſhe ſat up with his lady till he came in, and that he then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to ſee her home, ſhe would ſuffer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She had not fortitude to relate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, but ſtopped with ſome appearance of irreſolution and terror. Sir James then aſked, "If ſhe came directly from her father's home?" This queſtion, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it was aſked, increaſed her confuſion. To
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035911_0071_1007BF821CCC9EA0"/>
appear to have ſtopped ſhort in her narrative, ſhe thought would be an implication of guilt, as it would betray a deſire of concealment: but the paſt could not be recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe was impelled by equivocation to falſehood, from which, however, ſhe would have been kept back by fear, if Sir James had not deceived her into a belief that he had been no further than the neighbourhood. After theſe tumultuous reflections, which paſſed in a moment, ſhe ventured to affirm, that "ſhe ſtaid with Miſs Mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows till eight, and then came home:" but ſhe uttered this falſehood with ſuch marks of guilt and ſhame, which ſhe had, indeed, no otherwiſe than by this falſehood incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or deſerved, that Sir James no more doubted her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity than her exiſtence. As her ſtory was the ſame with that of the Captain's, and as one had concealed the truth and the other denied it, he concluded that there was a confederacy between them; and, determining firſt to bring the Captain to account, he turned from her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, and immediately left the houſe.</p>
                  <p>At the door he met the chairman, who had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by Mrs. Freeman to his lady; and fiercely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogating him what was his buſineſs, the man produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the letter, and ſaying, as he had been ordered, that he brought it from Mrs. Faſhion. Sir James ſnatched it from him, and, muttering ſome expreſſions of contempt and reſentment, thruſt it into his pocket.</p>
                  <p>It happened that Sir James did not find the Captain at home; he therefore left a billet, in which he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee him at a neighbouring tavern, and added, that he had put on his ſword.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, his lady, dreading a diſcovery of the falſehood which ſhe had aſſerted, diſpatched a billet to Captain Freeman; in which ſhe conjured him as a man of honour, for particular reaſons not to own to Sir James, or any other perſon, that he had ſeen her after he had left her at her father's: ſhe alſo wrote to her couſin Meadows, entreating, that if ſhe was queſtioned by Sir James, he might be told that ſhe ſtaid with her till eight o'clock, an hour at which only herſelf and the ſervants were up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="unknown:035911_0071_1007BF821CCC9EA0"/>The billet to Miſs Meadows came ſoon after the chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had returned with an account of what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the letter; and Mrs. Freeman was juſt gone in great haſte to relate the accident to the Captain, as it was of importance that he ſhould know it before his next interview with Sir James: but the Captain had been at home before her, and received both Sir James's billet and that of his lady. He went immediately to the tav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, and inquiring for Sir James Forreſt, was ſhewn into a back room, one pair of ſtairs. Sir James received his ſalutation without reply, and inſtantly bolted the door. His jealouſy was complicated with that indignation and contempt, which a ſenſe of injury from a perſon of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior rank never fails to produce: he, therefore, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Captain, in a haughty tone, "whether he had not that morning been in company with his wife, after he had left her at her father's?" The Captain, who was incenſed at Sir James's manner, and deemed himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in honour to keep the lady's ſecret, anſwered, that "after what he had ſaid in the morning, no man had a right to ſuppoſe he had ſeen the lady afterwards; that to inſinuate the contrary was obliquely to charge him with a falſehood; that he was bound to anſwer no ſuch queſtions, till they were properly explained; and that as a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was prepared to vindicate his honour." Sir James juſtly deemed this reply an equivocation and an inſult; and being no longer able to reſtrain his rage, he curſed the Captain as a liar and a ſcoundrel, and at the ſame time ſtriking him a violent blow with his fiſt, drew his ſword and put himſelf in a poſture of defence. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſign the Captain might have had to bring his friend to temper, and reconcile him to his wife, when he firſt entered the room, he was now equally enraged, and, indeed, had ſuffered equal indignity; he, therefore, drew at the ſame inſtant, and, after a few deſperate paſſes on both ſides, he received a wound in his breaſt, and, reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward a few paces, fell down.</p>
                  <p>The noiſe had brought many people to the door of the room, and it was forced open juſt as the Captain had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his wound: Sir James was ſecured, and a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was diſpatched for a ſurgeon. In the mean time, the

Truſting in the ſucceſs of diſſimulation, you was tempted to venture into the Park, where you met him whom you wiſhed to ſhun. By detecting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation in the Captain, my ſuſpicions were increaſed; and by diſſimulation and falſehood you confirmed them. But your diſſimulation and falſehood were the effects of mine; your's were ineffectual, mine ſucceeded: for I left word that I was gone no further than the coffee-houſe, that you might not ſuſpect I had learned too much to be deceived. By the ſucceſs of a lie put into the mouth of a chairman, I was prevented from reading
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:035911_0072_1007BF840D1672D8"/>
a letter, which at laſt would have undeceived me; and by perſiſting in diſſimulation, the Captain has made his friend a fugitive and his wife a widow. Thus does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity terminate in miſery and confuſion, whether, in its immediate purpoſe, it ſucceeds or is diſappointed. O my dear Charlotte! if ever we meet again,—to meet again in peace is impoſſible—but if ever we meet again, let us reſolve to be ſincere: to be ſincere is to be wiſe, innocent, and ſafe. We venture to commit faults, which ſhame or fear would prevent, if we did not hope to conceal them by a lie. But in the labyrinth of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, men meet thoſe evils, which they ſeek to avoid; and as in the ſtraight path of truth alone they can ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, in the ſtraight path of truth alone they can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue felicity with ſucceſs. Adieu! I am—dreadful!— I can ſubſcribe nothing, that does not reproach and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me!—Adieu!"</p>

                  <p>IN one of the moſt beautiful vallies that lie upon the borders of the Eaſt, lived Zegdad, an inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſhepherd. He had but one child, and having been early deprived of his wife, he laviſhed his whole ſtock of tenderneſs on Fatima.</p>
                  <p>Though fortune had not been laviſh of her gifts to the father of Fatima, yet he wanted not the neceſſaries or the comforts of life; his cottage was clean, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every thing uſeful; his fields ſupplied him with food, his flock with raiment.</p>
                  <p>Fatima was coarſe in her perſon, but ſhe was cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and good-natured; ſhe roſe each morn with the feathered ſongſters, and cheerfully performed the duties of her ſtation; her whole ſtudy was to pleaſe her father,

                  <p>One day her father ſent her to the Grand Vizier's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with fruit for his favourite; ſhe was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Semira was repoſing on a bed of roſes, clad in all the pomp of eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern magnificence, while two ſlaves were fanning her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> reſt.</p>
                  <p>Fatima had never before ſeen aught but ſimplicity: ſhe was filled with wonder and aſtoniſhment at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing beauty and grandeur of Semira; and as ſhe ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, envy and diſcontent crept into her hitherto guileleſs heart.</p>
                  <p>She returned home with a mind totally altered from what it was. Her rural paſtimes no more delighted her; labour was now a trouble; ſhe had been a witneſs to the eaſe and indolence of Semira. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> at any time ſhe caught a glimpſe of her perſon in the ſtream, ſhe turned from it with diſguſt. Her days were joyleſs, and her nights ſpent in bewailing her unhappy lot.</p>
                  <p>One evening, deaf to the ſolicitations of her young companions, ſhe retired to a thick grove, and inattentive to the ſound of the flagelet, thus gave vent to her ſorrow:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, wretched Fatima! unhappy maid! Why was I born to ſo hard a fate? to eat the bread of labour, to ſleep upon a ruſhy couch, while Semira is ſurrounded with ſplendor, is ſerved by kneeling ſlaves, and ſleep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> on a bed of down! Why has nature denied me thoſe raviſhing beauties, it has ſo bountifully laviſhed on her? her eyes are bright as the ſtars, her lips like half-blown roſes, her hand and arm like poliſhed ivory. Oh! why was not I lovely as Semira, and favourite to the Grand Vizier? In this low abject ſtate my being is intolerable; I will no longer endure it, but in yon limpid ſtream loſe the remembrance of myſelf and Semira."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="unknown:035911_0073_1007BF877B500948"/>At this moment the Fairy Urganda ſtood before her.</p>
                  <p>"Thy complaints are juſt, oh, Fatima! (ſaid ſhe) and if thou wilt relinquiſh thy home, and forſake thy father, thou ſhalt enjoy the utmoſt extent of thy wiſhes."</p>
                  <p>Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms, and the Fairy immediately ſprinkled her with water, at the ſame time pronouncing ſome myſtic words, when ſhe was transformed into a virgin of tranſcendant beauty, and found herſelf in the garden of a palace belonging to the Grand Vizier.</p>
                  <p>The lovely Semira had the day before offended her lord, and was no longer a favourite. Fatima attracted the notice of the Vizier; he ordered her to be led into ſplendid apartments, clothed with coſtly robes, adorned with jewels, and appointed ſlaves to wait on her and comply with all her wiſhes; and Fatima ſupplied the place of the degraded Semira.</p>
                  <p>She now thought herſelf the happieſt among the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but the Vizier was paſſionate, capricious, jealous, and extremely cruel; and it was not long before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed Fatima diſcovered that to be favourite to the Grand Vizier was to live only in ſplendid ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>"But (ſaid ſhe often to herſelf) though the Grand Vizier's favourite is miſerable, how ſuperlatively happy muſt be the favourite Sultana of my lord the Emperor! Oh! could I but attain that envied ſtation, how ſoon ſhould the imperious Vizier ſuffer for his barbarity to me."</p>
                  <p>Again did the boſom of Fatima ſuffer all the miſeries of diſcontent; the vaulted roofs, ſpacious gardens, and rich preſents of the Vizier, no longer charmed her; ſhe ſighed for the enſigns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears.</p>
                  <p>One evening ſhe retired to an arbour, at the extremity of the garden, and throwing herſelf on the banks where ſhe had firſt ſeen Semira, thus poured forth her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints:</p>
                  <p>"How wretched is the fate of Fatima! condemned to drag a hated being with a man, who ſtudies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the ſlave of his caprice and paſſion. Oh! could I but get from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035911_0074_1007BF89068EFC50"/>
place, I would fly to my lord the Emperor, and bow myſelf low in the duſt before him. My charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might reign Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of the Eaſt."</p>
                  <p>As ſhe ſpoke theſe words, a ſudden light entered the arbour, and the Fairy Urganda again ſtood before her.</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful Fatima, (ſaid ſhe) forbear your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, the prophet permits you to enjoy your wiſh; then riſe and follow me."</p>
                  <p>The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her among a number of beautiful ſlaves, from among which the Emperor was next morning to chooſe a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. In the morning the Emperor paſſed through the apartment, and his choice fell on Fatima. She was clothed in the enſigns of royalty, led in ſtate to the moſque, and in a few hours heard herſelf proclaimed Empreſs of the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>But Fatima had to the idea of royalty annexed the ideas of youth and beauty; how ſurpriſed was ſhe then to find the Emperor old, ugly, and deformed in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, moroſe in his diſpoſition, and jealous in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. She ſhrunk from his embraces with horror, and contracted ſo ſettled an averſion to him, that not all the ſplendor which awaited her could in the ſmalleſt degree compenſate for the many tedious hours ſhe was obliged to devote to him.</p>
                  <p>Among the ſlaves that attended on Fatima, was the artful Zynina, who had long, with envious eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor beſtowed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingratiate herſelf in his favour, by rendering him ſome piece of ſervice. To this end ſhe cultivated the friendſhip of the new Queen, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees drew from her the reaſon of her tears and dejection.</p>
                  <p>This intelligence was inſtantly conveyed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, with the addition of Fatima's heart being dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to another. Oſmin, willing to be convinced of the truth of Zynina's declaration, deſired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining the Queen's, where he might eaſily overhear any thing that paſſed between her and the deceitful ſlave, who immediately returned to her miſtreſs, and artfully renewed the converſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="unknown:035911_0074_1007BF89068EFC50"/>Fatima, glad to unburthen her almoſt burſting heart, confeſſed her ſettled averſion to her lord, and that death itſelf would be preferable to her preſent ſituation. "Then death be thy portion!" cried the enraged Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, furiouſly ruſhing into the apartment, and lifting his glittering ſcimetar.</p>
                  <p>Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony of terror exclaimed, "Oh that I was an humble cottager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatneſs."</p>
                  <p>At that moment ſhe found herſelf clad in her former homely apparel, ſtanding at the door of her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared and thus addreſſed her:</p>
                  <p>"Fatima, I have ſhewn you the vanity of human wiſhes; learn from hence to be content with the allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Providence. Whatever be your ſituation in life, ſubmit to it without repining; and know that our holy prophet, who ordereth all things in this terreſtrial world, knoweth what is beſt for mortals. Fulfil, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the reſpective duties of thy ſtation, to the utmoſt of thy power: envy not the ſuperior lot of another, but humbly take the bleſſings within thy reach, enjoy them, and be happy."</p>

                  <p>MR. Hargrave is one of my earlieſt friends. Being many years younger than he, I have ever been accuſtomed to regard him both as my guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and my friend: and the reverence, with which I looked on him in one character, never took from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and affectionate warmth I felt for him in the other. After having been, for ſome time, a good deal in the world, he retired to the country, where he lived with elegance and eaſe. His wife, a very amiable woman, died ſoon after her marriage, leaving one only child, a girl, to the care of whoſe education Mr. Hargrave, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her mother's death, devoted his whole attention. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had done much for her; and the inſtruction ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from an accompliſhed father, gave her every grace, which can adorn the female character.</p>
                  <p>Emily Hargrave was now in her twentieth year. Her father was advanced in life, and he began to feel the weakneſſes of age coming faſt upon him. Independent of the gratification which he uſed to receive from the obſervation of his daughter's virtues and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he had come to feel a pleaſure ſomewhat more ſelfiſh from the advantage, which thoſe virtues were of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035911_0075_1007BF8BCA75BC00"/>
to himſelf. Her care and dutiful attention were become almoſt neceſſary to him; and the principal pleaſure he received was from her company and converſation. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily was ſenſible of this; and, though ſhe was at pains to conceal her ſolicitude, it was plain that her whole care centered in him.</p>
                  <p>It was impoſſible that a girl ſo amiable as Emily Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave could fail to attract attention. Several young men of character and fortune became her profeſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers. But, though ſhe had a ſweetneſs, which gave her a benevolent affability to all, ſhe was of a mind too delicate to be eaſily ſatisfied in the choice of a huſband. In her preſent circumſtances, ſhe had another objection to every change of ſituation. She felt too much anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about her father, to think of any thing which could call off her attention from him, and make it proper to place any of it elſewhere. With the greateſt delicacy, therefore, and with that propriety with which her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was always attended, ſhe checked every advance that was made her; while, at the ſame time, ſhe was at the utmoſt pains to conceal from her father the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſacrifice, which ſhe was reſolved to make on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>About a month ago, I paid a viſit to Mr. Hargrave's family. The imbecilities of age, which were beginning to approach the laſt time I had ſeen him, had now made great advances. Formerly Mr. Hargrave uſed to be the delight of every company, and he never ſpoke without being inſtructing or entertaining. Now he ſpoke little; when he did, it was with feebleneſs both of voice and manner. Feeling his memory declining, ſenſible that he was not ſo acute as he once was, and unable to keep up his attention to a continued diſcourſe, though his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was ſtill perfectly good, he was afraid to venture his opinion, or to take any decided meaſure. He was too conſcious of his own infirmities; and that conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs led him to think that his failure was greater than it really was. In this ſituation, his whole dependance was upon Emily, and ſhe was his only ſupport. Never, indeed, did I ſee any thing more lovely, more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="unknown:035911_0076_1007BF8D974B8428"/>To all her other charms, the anxious ſolicitude ſhe felt for her father had ſtamped upon her countenance
<q>
                        <l>"That expreſſion ſweet of melancholy</l>
                        <l>Which captivates the ſoul."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſomething in the female character, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſupport. That gentleneſs, that delicate ſoftneſs approaching to timidity, which forms its moſt amiable feature, makes it ſtand in need of aſſiſtance. That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and aſſiſtance Emily had received in the completeſt manner from her father. What an alteration now! Inſtead of receiving ſupport herſelf, ſhe was obliged to give it; ſhe was under the neceſſity of aſſiſting, of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling, and of ſtrengthening the timid reſolutions of him, who had been, in her earlier years, her inſtructor and her guide, and to whom, next to Heaven, ſhe had ever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. Emily felt all this; but feeling took not from her the power of acting.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hargrave is abundantly ſenſible of his daughter's goodneſs. Her conſciouſneſs of this, and of how much importance her attentions are to her father, gives her the beſt conſolation.</p>
                  <p>While I was at his houſe, he hardly ever ſpoke of himſelf. Once, indeed, I remember he ſaid to me, "I am become a ſtrange being; even the goodneſs of that girl diſtreſſes me; it is too much for me to bear: it is," added he, in a very faint and broken voice, "like to overwhelm me."</p>
                  <p>I have often obſerved, that there is a perſeverance in virtue, and a real magnanimity in the other ſex, which is ſcarcely to be equalled in our's. In the virtue of men, there are generally ſome conſiderations not altogether pure, attending it, which though they may not detract from, muſt certainly diminiſh our wonder at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The heroic actions of men are commonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the great theatre, and the performers have the applauſes of an attending and admiring world to animate and ſupport them. When Regulus ſuffered all the tortures which cruelty could invent, rather than give up his honour or his country, he was ſupported by the conſcious admiration of thoſe countrymen, whom he had
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035911_0076_1007BF8D974B8428"/>

                  <p>THE conſideration of death has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made uſe of, by the moraliſt and the divine, as a powerful incentive to virtue and to piety.

                  <p>But, though neither the ſituation of the world, nor the formation of our minds, allow the thoughts of futurity or death a conſtant or prevailing effect upon our lives, they may ſurely ſometimes, not unſeaſonably, preſs upon our imagination: even excluſive of their moral or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious uſe, there is a ſympathetic enjoyment, which often makes it not only better, but more delightful to go to the houſe of mourning, than to the houſe of feaſting.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps I felt it ſo, when, but a few days ſince, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the funeral of a young lady, who was torn, in the bloom of youth and beauty, from the arms of a fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who doated on her, of a family by whom ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored: I think I would not have exchanged my feelings, at that time, for all the mirth which gaiety could inſpire, or all the pleaſure which luxury could beſtow.</p>
                  <p>Maria was in her twentieth year. To the beauty of her form, and excellence of her natural diſpoſition, a

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt juſtice. To accompliſh her perſon, and to cultivate her mind, every endeavour had been uſed; and they had been attended with that ſucceſs, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly meet with, when not prevented by miſtaken fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or untimely vanity. Few young ladies have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted more admiration; none ever felt it leſs. With all the charms of beauty, and the poliſh of education, the plaineſt were not leſs affected, nor the moſt ignorant leſs aſſuming. She died when every tongue was eloquent of her virtues, and every hope was ripening to reward them.</p>
                  <p>It is by ſuch private domeſtic diſtreſſes, that the ſofter emotions of the heart are moſt ſtrongly excited. The fall of more important perſonages is commonly diſtant from our obſervation; but even where it happens under our immediate notice, there is a mixture of other feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by which our compaſſion is weakened. The emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently great, or extenſively uſeful, leave behind them a train of interrupted views, and diſappointed expectations, by which the diſtreſs is complicated, beyond the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of pity. But the death of one who, like Maria, was to ſhed the influence of her virtues over the age of her father and the childhood of her ſiſters, preſents to us a little view of family affliction, which every eye can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and every heart can feel. On ſcenes of public ſorrow and national regret, we gaze as upon thoſe galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pictures, which ſtrike us with wonder and admiration; domeſtic calamity is like the miniature of a friend, which we wear in our boſoms, and keep for ſecret looks and ſolitary enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>The laſt time I ſaw Maria was in the midſt of a crowded aſſembly of the faſhionable and the gay, where ſhe fixed all eyes by the gracefulneſs of her motions, and the native dignity of her mien; yet ſo tempered was that ſuperiority, which they conferred, with gentleneſs and modeſty, that not a murmur was heard, either from the rivalſhip of beauty, or the envy of homelineſs. From that ſcene the tranſition was ſo violent to the hearſe and the pall, the grave and the ſod, that once or twice my imagination turned rebel to my ſenſes: I beheld the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

                  <p>I was ſoon, however, recalled to the ſad reality. The figure of her father bending over the grave of his darling child; the ſilent ſuffering compoſure, in which his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was fixed; the tears of his attendants, whoſe grief was light and capable of tears; theſe gave me back the truth, and reminded me that I ſhould ſee her no more.

                  <p>It was but for a moment. He looked eagerly into the grave; made one involuntary motion to ſtop the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who were throwing the earth into it; then ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recollecting himſelf, claſped his hands together, threw up his eyes to Heaven; and then firſt I ſaw a few tears drop from them. I gave language to all this. It ſpoke a leſſon of faith, and piety, and reſignation. I went away ſorrowful, but my ſorrow was neither ungentle nor unmanly. I caſt on this world a glance rather of pity than of enmity; on the next, a look of humbleneſs and hope!</p>

                  <p>"Do you weep again?" ſaid ſhe; "I would not have you weep; you are like my Billy: you are, believe me; juſt ſo he looked when he gave me this ring; poor Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! it was the laſt time ever we met!—"</p>

Let me, I pray thee, fair damſel, refreſh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amidſt the fatigue of a long journey, by a cool draught of the water which thou haſt juſt drawn from the well.

Her anſwer to this does her freſh honour; for, perſiſting in her amiable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhe told him ſhe was the daughter of Bethuel, the ſon of Milcah, and that ſhe had both ſtraw and proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enough, and room to lodge in. And the damſel <hi>ran</hi> ſhow the ſpirit of the character is preſerved!) to tell thoſe of her mother's houſe the requeſt of the traveller, ſpeaking no doubt, as favourably of him as ſhe could. Her intelligence ſoon brought forth her brother, who had been informed by his ſiſter that he was the ſervant of the celebrated Abraham: and the brother, whoſe name was Laban, invited him in, with the moſt friendly cordiality; and preſſed him much to eat ſuch delicacies as were moſt ſpeedily provided. But the ſervant, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take advantage of ſo fair an opportunity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the moment of benevolence, declared his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to refuſe food till he had told his errand.

                     </gap> vanity, from which, with all her courteſy, one cannot ſuppoſe her to have been totally exempt: he brought forth jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. The man diſcovered no ſmall knowledge of human nature (ever operating, in many caſes alike) in this conduct; and ſtill more, when deſirous to get all the family on his ſide, he gave precious things to the brothers and mother. Surely an amour by proxy was never better or more ſkilfully carried on, from the beginning to the end.</p>
                  <p>When he had made the preſents, he did not improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſs for a direct reward, nor indeed ſo much as mention the matter farther at that time; but leaving the damſel to meditate upon her ornaments, he ate and drank and paſſed the night ſocially, and ſuſpended the delicate ſubject. Here was a ſagacity diſplayed, to the deſpair of our dealers in romance, who prepoſterouſly jumble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inconſiſtences, and deviate eternally from prudence and nature. In the morning, however, he deſired his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Whatever were the ſentiments of the fair virgin, the brother and mother relented; and, deſiring her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a few days longer, they promiſed ſhe ſhould go. In this requeſt there is a ſurpriſing ſweetneſs: how the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpeaks in it! At any rate, ſhe muſt abide with us a little while, at the leaſt ten days: we cannot part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome endearing preparations; it would break our hearts. I pray thee, therefore, allow thus much to our kindred feelings; and if thou findeſt the maid nothing reluctant, why, after that ſhe ſhall go back with thee, to thy maſter and his ſon. But, poſſibly, the ſervant did not wiſh to truſt the thing ſo many days undecided; and he might underſtand enough of human ſickleneſs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſtrange changes of mind in the courſe of that time. However this be, he ſtrongly urged an inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. The whole matter was drawing to a criſis. They called the damſel, and put to her the deciſive queſtion; and the reſult was, her conſent to the ſuit: in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, ſhe ſet off with the man, attended by a
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035911_0080_1007BF9843912D70"/>
favourite ſervant, (her nurſe) for the houſe of Abraham. In the mean time, Iſaac was not indifferent to the event of the tranſaction; for he went out in the field at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, to <hi>meditate,</hi> as we are told; but, more probably, to meet his deſtined bride; and when he ſaw the camels were coming, he was, no doubt, much affected with the approaching interview.</p>
                  <p>There is great delicacy preſerved in the character of Rebekah, in the deſcription of this interview. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw her future lord, ſhe lighted off her camel; and when the ſervant informed her it was Iſaac, with a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty truly feminine, and beyond the mere force of cuſtom, ſhe covered herſelf with a veil. When the ſervant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Iſaac the whole of the circumſtances, he was charmed with her conduct; and the laſt verſe of this intereſting hiſtory repreſents the lover tenderly leading her into the tent of his mother; ſoon after which, he courted her heart, and ſhe became his wife, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. What a noble poem, or rather, what a poetical fact, is here exhibited in a ſingle leaf! Tenderneſs, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the moſt delicate aſſemblage of images are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly blended, without the leaſt appearance of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the ſmalleſt want of advantageous language.</p>

                  <p>When the famine raged with much ſeverity in her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive land, Naomi and her huſband Elimelech, and their two ſons, went to ſojourn in the country of Moab; but Elimelech died, and Naomi, the widow, was left with her children. Soon after this, thoſe children "took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the other Ruth." It came to paſs that the young men, their huſbands, died alſo, both of them; and now the poor widow was bereaved of her ſons and her huſband. Unable, therefore, to bear any longer a place in which every ſcene preſented ſome image of loſt endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or revived ſome diſtracting idea of conjugal or maternal tenderneſs, ſhe reſolved to ſeek ſolace from her ſorrow, by change of reſidence. So ſhe aroſe with her daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth, that ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the country of Moab. It preſently occurred to the poor woman, as ſhe was journeying on her way, that if ſhe was unhappy, it was no teſtimony of her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to involve her ſons' wives in equal calamities; and judging the reception ſhe would be likely to meet in the land of Judah, entering it deſolate, unfriended, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, ſhe pauſed a moment, and thus pathetically ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the young widows: "Go, my children, each of you return to your mother's houſe; the Lord deal kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me. The Lord grant that ye may find reſt, each of you, in the houſe of your dear deceaſed huſband." Having uttered this ſhort prayer for their happineſs, ſhe kiſſed them, and prepared to depart alone.

"They lifted up their voice and wept."—A folio could not ſo well diſplay their condition. After ſome time paſſed in this ſignificant ſilence, they ſaid unto her, "Surely we will return with thee unto thy people." Here, again, genuine grief diſcovers itſelf: one tender ſentence, and one only, expreſſes their deſigns and wiſhes to attend her. In ſuch caſes, conciſeneſs is nature, and circumlocution mere art and affectation. Perceiving the deſign of the daughters, the widow-wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Naomi again began to diſſuade them, and to preſs their ſpeedy return. She painted the various diſaſters they would be liable to, in her company; told them ſhe had no more ſons to give them for huſbands; nor even a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now ſhe once more preſſed the women in a farewel embrace, whilſt ſhe cloſed her argument with another bleſſing, more melting even than the firſt.—"Nay, my daughters, weep not, I entreat you. It grieveth me more for your ſakes than my own, that the hand of the Lord hath gone out againſt me." This was the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: ſhe had now fairly diſcovered all the horrors of her ſituation, and ſhewed herſelf a woman without accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation; a traveller, without hope of reſt at the end of her journey; and a widow, without one to take her by the hand, and ſay unto her, Welcome unfortunate! wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come again to thine own country. The picture was too deeply ſhaded for Orpah. The dread of poverty, and all its ſable catalogue of terrors, ſtruck her at once: ſhe ſhed the tribute of a few more tears, ſacrificed a few more ſighs, and went her way. Not ſo the affectionate Ruth. How excellently marked, and that, by a ſingle word, is the conduct of each. "Orpah <hi>kiſſed</hi> her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-in-law; but Ruth <hi>clave</hi> unto her." The ſentence,

though thus compreſſed, is emphatically copious in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> of meaning: but, indeed, the <hi>multum in parvo,</hi> ſhould be one characteriſtic of the ſacred writings. "Orpah kiſſed her mother-in-law," i. e. ſhe gave her a farewel embrace, wept a woman's ſorrow, and left her mother <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

"But Ruth clave unto her." i. e. clung around her neck, kiſſed her with ardour, as if ſhe deſigned to leave the ſeal of her very ſoul impreſſed on her lips forever. In vain did the noble minded Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi exhibit to her the various miſeries which were at hand, and againſt which there was no comfortable proviſion. In vain did ſhe point to the example, the politic, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent example of Orpah, her ſiſter. In ſcorn of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and to cloſe at once all future diſſuaſions, ſhe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> amazing elegance in the gradations. The full ſenſe implied, ſeems to branch out in this manner. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with deſiring Naomi to urge the ſubject of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no longer, ſince ſhe has completely made up her mind upon it. This is the firſt and ſlighteſt part. In the next place, ſhe unfolds her firſt deſign to follow her fortunes in whatever part of the habitable globe ſhe thinks proper to purſue them: but not thinking this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expreſſive of her affection, ſhe reſolves to take up her abode in the ſame houſe with her; to lodge under the ſame roof, however poor, and to ſhare the ſame bed, however inelegant. After this, ſhe reſolves to know no other people, than ſuch as are equally the common friends of both; to enter into no attachments, but thoſe which are united by the ſame tender ties to her dear Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi; and to form no connexions whatever, that can, in the leaſt, derogate from the love ſhe bore her. But ſhe is not contented with having delivered theſe aſſurances, for ſhe goes on, that her very religion ſhall be the relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of her friend; that one faith and one hope ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate

their devotion, and the God of one ſhall be the God of the other. Even this does not ſatisfy her: for ſhe next determines not only to go with her the pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of life, but attend her beyond the gate of death; to die with her Naomi, ſhould it be Naomi's lot to fall firſt; and to be buried at laſt in the ſame grave: and this ſhe confirmed by an immediate oath of the utmoſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſanctity amongſt the daughters of Judah: "The Lord God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if aught but death part thee and me."</p>
                  <p>"When Naomi ſaw that ſhe was ſtedfaſtly minded to go, ſhe left off perſuading her; ſo they went until they came to Bethlehem; and when they arrived, it came to paſs, that all the city were moved about them, and they ſaid, Is this Naomi?" Here are freſh morals and freſh elegancies opened upon us: the diſconſolate Naomi had no ſooner ſet her foot upon her own land, than all thoſe little paſſions, which lie lurking in the boſoms of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal and the inhoſpitable, were inſtantly awakened. Curioſity ſurveyed the tatters which ſhe had not the ſoul to repair. Ill-nature was, we may be ſure, officious enough to throw in her bitter ſarcaſm. Pride was ready with her inſulting offer of pity. Avarice lamented his incapacity to anſwer the good wiſhes of his heart; and in ſhort, every arrogant, every paltry propenſity was in arms againſt our defenceleſs travellers. But as Naomi originally lived in ſome degree of comfort and credit in her own country, and was now reduced; <hi>ſhe,</hi> of courſe, more particularly was the mark of their obloquy and converſation.</p>
                  <p>She ſoon found, that to rely upon the kindneſs of old friends, was but a preca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The benevolence of diſtant relations, in whoſe memory ſhe might be able to revive the images of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, was likewiſe a fond idea, that was born and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried almoſt in the ſame inſtant. Nothing of comfort ſeemed to remain in reſerve, till the excellent Ruth, the faithful partner of her ſufferings, ſuggeſted an expedient.

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on a part of the field belonging to Boaz. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance occaſioned a turn of fortune perfectly dramatic. For, Boaz, coming to take a view of his reapers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſtranger, ſaid unto the ſervant, who was ſet over the reapers, "Whoſe damſel is this?" The ſervant's anſwer is penned with the moſt natural ſimplicity.—"It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> even from the morning till now, that ſhe tarried a little in the houſe." Something there was, either in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or in the appearance of the object, which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> much upon the favour of the landlord: for it is ſurely a ſofter voice even than the voice of hoſpitality, that ſpeaks in the ſequel. "Heareſt thou not my daughter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> go not I charge you to glean in any other field, neither go from hence, but abide here faſt by my maidens." I have given particular injunctions to "the young men, that they ſhall not touch thee. And when thou art athirſt, go to the veſſels and drink of that which the young men have drawn." Here began the firſt fruits of her fidelity; and the partiality of Boaz made a very rapid progreſs, for in his ſecond addreſs he was more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent than in the firſt; he invited her to conſider herſelf as one of his own people, to "eat of the bread, to dip her welcome morſel in the vinegar" at meal-times, and to ſit cheerfully beſide the reapers. Nay, more,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035911_0083_1007BF9E97D82810"/>
with his own hand—(ſurely the heart extended it)—"he reached her parched corn, and ſhe did eat, and was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and left." Now it was that Boaz began to diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more evidently, that the ſpring of this generous cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent lay very near the heart. When ſhe was riſen up to glean, after her repaſt, he commanded the young men to ſhew her all poſſible marks of courteſy and diſtinction. His ſtrict orders were, not to ſuffer her to gather the ſcanty pittance, ear by ear, after the cautious rake had gone over the ground, but to let her glean unqueſtioned, even amongſt the ſheaves. Nay, more, they were to let ſome handfulls fall on purpoſe for her, and leave them for her particular gleaning: and indeed, ſuch was the ſucceſsful conſequences of theſe indulgencies, that after ſhe had beat out what ſhe had been permitted to glean in one ſingle day, "it was about an ephah of barley." This the kind creature carried with all the expedition of affection to her friend: and when Naomi ſaw it—when the ſoul of the ſorrowful widow ſang for joy; then Ruth related to her the whole hiſtory of her good fortune, and concluding that the name of the hoſpitable owner of the had was Boaz. This intelligence revived her ſpirits like a cordial, and ſhe exclaims with the moſt animated tranſport—"The man is near a kin to us," my beloved Ruth—"one of our next kinſmen." Often, and with equal ſucceſs, ſhe went, after this, into the field, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there to earn a very comfortable living for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and her friend, even to the cloſe of the harveſt. In the mean time, the paſſion of Boaz had made a very great progreſs, and the reſult of it was, that he became the honourable lover of our fair gleaner, and renewed his acquaintance with his relation Naomi, to whom he made, we are told, various preſents. Boaz and Ruth were ſoon united; and, as a convincing inſtance of the harmony in which the family lived together, we find, highly to the gratification of every benevolent heart, that when Ruth preſented to Boaz a child—her firſt-born—Naomi, after all the peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By mention of the evening, it ſhould appear that ſhe was diſpatched in the morning, or at leaſt very early in the day. What a taſk of toil muſt it then have been! how many billowy leagues muſt ſhe have travelled, ere ſhe found that of which ſhe was in ſearch! Linger upon the land I can never believe ſhe did, however the verdure and vegetable novelty might charm her. No! it was not until the evening ſhe ſucceeded in her endeavours, and then, upon the wings of kindneſs, ſhe haſted to ſatisfy the impatience of her maſter.

She is equally celebrated in profane and ſacred hiſtory, and every epithet of endearment is allotted to her. She is conſidered as favourable to love, and propitious to every tender undertaking; nor can we, at any time, expreſs a courteous character, without giving to it, among other qualities, the gentleneſs and truth of a Dove.</p>

                  <p>THE Dean of the cathedral of Badajoz was more learned than all the Doctors of Salamanca, Coim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, and Aleala, united. He underſtood all languages, living and dead, and was perfect maſter of every ſcience, divine and human; except that, unfortunately, he had no knowledge of magic, and was inconſolable when he reflected on his ignorance in that divine art. He was told that a very able Magician reſided in the ſuburbs of Toledo, named Don Torribio. Immediately he ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled his mule, departed for Toledo, and alighted at the door of no very ſuperb dwelling, the habitation of that great man.</p>
                  <p>"Moſt reverend Magician," ſaid he, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſage, "I am the Dean of Badajoz. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of Spain all allow me their ſuperior; but I am come to requeſt from you a far greater honour, that of becoming your pupil. Deign to initiate me in the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of your art, and doubt not but you ſhall receive a grateful acknowledgment, ſuitable to the benefit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and your own extraordinary merit."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="unknown:035911_0085_1007BFA4F4242CD0"/>Don Torribio was not very polite, though he valued himſelf on being intimately acquainted with the beſt company in the infernal regions. He told the Dean he was welcome to ſeek elſewhere for a maſter in magic; for that, for his part, he was weary of an occupation, which produced nothing but compliments and promiſes; and that he would not diſhonour the occult ſciences, by proſtituting them to the ungrateful.</p>
                  <p>"To the ungrateful!" cried the Dean: "has then the great Don Torribio met with perſons who have proved ungrateful! and can he ſo far miſtake me as to rank me with ſuch monſters?" He then repeated all the maxims and apophthegms, which he had read, on the ſubject of gratitude, and every refined ſentiment his memory could furniſh.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, he talked ſo well that the Conjurer, after having conſidered a moment, confeſſed he could refuſe nothing to a man of ſuch abilities and ſo ready at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent quotations. "Jacintha," ſaid he, calling to his old woman, "lay down two partridges to the fire; I hope my friend the Dean will do me the honour to ſup with me to night." At the ſame time he takes him by the hand, and leads him into his cabinet; there he touches his forehead, muttering three myſterious words, which I muſt requeſt the reader not to forget, <hi>Ortobolan, Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafrier, Onagriouſ;</hi> then, without further preparation, he began to explain, with all poſſible perſpicuity, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory elements of his profound ſcience.</p>
                  <p>His new diſciple liſtened with an attention, which ſcarcely permitted him to breathe; when, on a ſudden, Jacintha enters, followed by a little man, in monſtrous boots, and covered with mud up to the neck, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak with the Dean on very important buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>This was the poſtillion of his uncle, the biſhop of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dajoz, who had been ſent expreſs after him, and had galloped quite to Toledo, before he could overtake him; he came to bring him information that, ſome hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure, his Grace had been attacked by ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an apoplexy that the moſt terrible conſequences were to be apprehended. The Dean heartily curſed (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly that is, and ſo as to occaſion no ſcandal) at once

the diſorder, the patient, and the courier, who had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all three choſen the moſt impertinent time poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He diſmiſſed the poſtillion, telling him to make haſte back to Badajoz, whither he would preſently fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: after which he returned to his leſſon, as if there were no ſuch things as either uncles or apoplexies.</p>
                  <p>A few days after he again received news from Bada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joz, but ſuch as was well worth hearing. The principal Chanter and two old Canons came to inform the Dean that his uncle, the right reverend Biſhop, had been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to heaven to receive the reward of his piety; and, that the Chapter, canonically aſſembled, had choſen him to fill the vacant biſhopric; and humbly requeſted he would conſole, by his preſence, the afflicted church of Badajoz, now become his ſpiritual bride.</p>
                  <p>Don Torribio, who was preſent at this harangue of the deputies, endeavoured to derive advantage from what he had learned; and, taking aſide the new Biſhop, after having paid him a well turned compliment on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, proceeded to inform him that he had a ſon, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Benjamin, poſſeſſed of much ingenuity and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; but in whom he had never perceived either taſte or talents for the occult ſciences; he had therefore, he ſaid, adviſed him to turn his thoughts towards the church, and had now, he thanked Heaven, the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hear him commended as one of the moſt deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divines among all the clergy of Toledo: he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, took the liberty, to requeſt his Grace to beſtow on Don Benjamin the deanery of Badajoz, which he could not retain together with his biſhopric.</p>
                  <p>I am very unfortunate, replied the Prelate, apparently ſomewhat embarraſſed; you will, I hope, do me the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to believe that nothing could give me ſo great a pleaſure as to oblige you in every requeſt. But, the truth is, I have a couſin, to whom I am heir, an old ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic, who is good for nothing but to be a Dean; and if I do not beſtow on him this preferment, I muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil myſelf with my family, which would be far from agreeable. But, continued he, in an affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will you not accompany me to Badajoz? Can you be ſo cruel as to forſake me juſt at the moment when it
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035911_0086_1007BFA7119FCF70"/>
is in my power to be of ſervice to you? Be perſuaded, my honoured maſter: we will go together; think of nothing but the improvement of your pupil, and leave me to provide for Don Benjamin, nor doubt, but ſooner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ltry deanery, in the remoteſt part of Eſtramadura, is not a benefice ſuitable to the ſon of ſuch a man as yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>The canon law would, no doubt, have conſtrued this offer of the Prelate's into ſimony. The propoſal, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was accepted; nor was any ſcruple made by either of theſe two very intelligent perſons. Don Torribio fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his illuſtrious pupil to Badajoz, where he had an elegant apartment aſſigned him in the epiſcopal palace, and was treated with the utmoſt reſpect, by all the dioceſe, as the favourite of his Grace, and a kind of Grand Vicar.</p>
                  <p>Under the tuition of ſo able a maſter, the Biſhop of Badajoz made a rapid progreſs in the occult ſciences. At firſt he gave himſelf up to them, with an ardour which might appear exceſſive; but this intemperance: grew by degrees more moderate, and he purſued them with ſo much prudence that his magical ſtudies never interfered with the duties of his dioceſe. He was well convinced of the truth of a maxim, very important to be remembered by eccleſiaſtics, whether addicted to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, or only philoſophers, and admirers of literature, that it is not ſufficient to aſſiſt at learned nocturnal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or adorn the mind with the embelliſhments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſcience; but that it is alſo the duty of divines to point out to others the way to heaven, and plant, in the minds of their hearers, wholeſome doctrine and Chriſtian morality.</p>
                  <p>Regulating his conduct by theſe commendable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the learned Prelate was celebrated throughout Chriſtendom for his merit and piety, and promoted, when he leaſt expected ſuch an honour, to the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopric of Compoſtella.</p>
                  <p>The people and clergy of Badajoz lamented, as may be ſuppoſed, an event by which they were deprived of ſo worthy a Paſtor; and the Canons of the cathedral, to teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify

their reſpect, unanimouſly conferred on him the right of naming his ſucceſſor.</p>
                  <p>Don Torribio did not neglect ſo alluring an opport<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his old maſter, and was both ſorry and aſhamed it was not in his power to grant a thing, which appeared ſo very a trifle; but, in fact, Don Ferdinand de Lara, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of Caſtile, had aſked this ſame biſhopric for his natural ſon; and, though he had never ſeen that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he had, he ſaid, ſome ſecret, important, and what was more, very ancient obligations to him. It was, therefore, an indiſpenſable duty to prefer an old bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to a new one: but that he ought not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged at this proof of his juſtice, as he might learn, by that, what he had to expect when his turn arrived; which it certainly would the very firſt opportunity.</p>
                  <p>This anecdote, concerning the ancient obligations of the Archbiſhop, the Magician had the goodneſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and rejoiced, as much as he was able, that his intereſts were ſacrificed to thoſe of Don Ferdinand.</p>
                  <p>Nothing, therefore, was thought of but preparations for their departure to Compoſtella, where they were now to reſide. Though theſe were ſcarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly worth the troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, conſidering the ſhort time they were deſtined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there; for, at the end of a few months, one of the Pope's Chamberlains arrived, who brought the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop a Cardinal's cap, with an epiſtle, conceived in the moſt reſpectful terms, in which his Holineſs invited him to aſſiſt, by his counſel, in the government of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world; permitting him, at the ſame time, to diſpoſe of his mitre in favour of whom he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>Don Torribio was not at Compoſtella when the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier of the holy father arrived. He had been to ſee his ſon, who ſtill continued a Prieſt in a ſmall pariſh at Toledo; but he preſently returned, and was not put to the trouble of aſking for the vacant archhiſhopric. The Prelate ran to meet him with open arms.</p>
                  <p>My dear maſter, ſaid he, I have two pieces of good news to relate at once. Your diſciple is created a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,

                     </gap> dignity. I had intended, in the mean time, to have beſtowed on him the archbiſhopric of Compoſtella; but, unfortunately for him, or rather for me, my mother, whom we left at Badajoz, has, during your abſence, written to me a cruel letter, by which all my meaſures have been diſconcerted. She will not be pacified, unleſs I appoint for my ſucceſſor the Archdeacon of my former church, Don Pablos de Salazar, her intimate friend and Confeſſor; ſhe tells me it will occaſion her death, if ſhe ſhould not be able to obtain preferment for her dear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God; and I have no doubt but what ſhe ſays is true. Imagine yourſelf in my place, my dear maſter: ſhall I be the death of my mother?</p>
                  <p>Don Torribio was not a perſon who would incite or urge his friend to be guilty of parricide; nor did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf in the leaſt reſentment againſt the mother of the Prelate.</p>
                  <p>To ſay the truth, however, this mother he talked of was a good kind of woman, nearly ſuperannuated, who lived quietly with her cat and maid-ſervant, and ſcarcely knew the name of her Confeſſor. Was it likely, then, that ſhe had procured Don Pablos his archbiſhopric? Was it not far more probable that he was indebted for it to a Gallician lady, his couſin, a young widow, at once devout and handſome, in whoſe company his Grace the Archbiſhop had frequently been edified, during his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at Compoſtella? Be it as it may, Don Torribio followed his Eminence to Rome. Scarcely had he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in that city before the Pope died. It is eaſy to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine the conſequence of this event. The Conclave met. All the voices of the ſacred college were unanimous in favour of the Spaniſh Cardinal. Behold him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Pope!</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the ceremony of his exaltation, Don Torribio, admitted to a ſecret audience, wept with joy, while he kiſſed the feet of his dear pupil, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After weighing every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, his Holineſs concluded that Don Torribio was not only a uſeleſs but a troubleſome dependant; and, this point decided, he was no longer in doubt what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to return: accordingly he replied in the following words; "We have learned, with concern, that, under the pretext of cultivating the occult ſciences, you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a horrible intercourſe with the ſpirit of darkneſs and deceit; wherefore we exhort you, as a father, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate your crime by a repentance proportionable to its enormity.

                  <p>Don Torribio, without being diſconcerted, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately repeated aloud the three myſterious words which the reader was deſired to remember; and, going to the window, cried out, with all his force, "Jacintha, you need ſpit but one partridge; for my friend, the Dean, will not ſup here to-night."

                  <p>TO be affected in any way, is, at all times, in all places, and in all degrees to be diſagreeable. But affectation of learning and authorſhip, in a woman of very little merit, draws upon itſelf the contempt and hatred of both ſexes. They who excel moſt in either ſex, are found by experience to be moſt candid and modeſt, to aſſume leaſt, and to join in converſation with others without diſplaying the ſenſe of their ſuperiority. Indeed it often happens, that there is an amiable humility in true genius and learning, which compels the poſſeſſor of them to think diffidently of his own character, amid the united praiſes of all around. Let her, then, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the bright jewels of genius and learning, take care to ſet them in a plain manner, and their luſtre will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play additional brilliancy.</p>

The pleaſure reſulting from an act of kindneſs naturally excites a wiſh to repeat it; and indeed the general eſteem which the character of benevolence procures, is ſufficient to induce thoſe to wiſh for it, who act only from the mean motives of ſelf-intereſt.</p>

                     </gap>he want of it is often attended with great benefit to ſociety. Man is naturally deſirous of rendering himſelf, in ſome reſpect, valuable and amiable; and, if he has nothing external to recommend him, will endeavour to compenſate his defect by the acquiſition of internal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence. But that the virtues of the heart, and the abilities of the underſtanding, contribute much more to public benefit than any perſonal grace or accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a truth which needs no confirmation.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed a well known fact, that many of the beſt poets, philoſophers, writers, and artiſts, have been of the number of thoſe who were, in ſome meaſure, prevented in their youth from indulging idleneſs and profligacy, either by ſome conſtitutional infirmity, or by the want of thoſe perſonal graces, which are the greateſt allurements to a life of diſſipation. Among a thouſand inſtances, in confirmation of this truth, I will ſelect that of Pope; to the deformity and imbecility of whoſe body we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute his early and conſtant application to poetry.

While, however, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the advantages attending the want of perſonal charms, I muſt not be underſtood to undervalue beauty. If we admire the lifeleſs works of art, much more ſhould we be delighted with the aſſemblage of living features, in which are united ſymmetry and expreſſion.

It may appear paradoxical, but I will aſſert it to be true, that women who have no great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to beauty, are uſually found, as the companions of life, the moſt agreeable. They are, indeed, for the moſt part, I do not ſay always, the beſt daughters, the beſt wives, the beſt mothers; moſt important relations, and moſt honourable to thoſe who ſupport them with propriety. They who aim not at ſuch characters, but live only to diſplay a pretty face, can ſcarcely rank high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a painted doll, or a blockhead, placed with a cap on it, in a millener's window.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething of an irritability in the conſtitution of women, whoſe minds are uncultivated, which, when increaſed by oppoſition, and confirmed by habit, uſually produces a termagant, a ſhrew, or a virago; characters which, from the torment they occaſion, may be ſaid greatly to participate of an infernal nature.

                  <head>ON THE LITERARY EDUCATION OF WOMEN.</head>
                  <p>THERE are many prejudices entertained againſt the character of a learned lady; and, perhaps, if all ladies were profoundly learned, ſome inconveniences might ariſe from it: but, I muſt own, it does not appear to me, that a woman will be rendered leſs acceptable in the world, or worſe qualified to perform any part of her duty in it, by having employed the time, from ſix to ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, in the cultivation of her mind. Time enough will remain, after a few hours every day ſpent in reading, for the improvement of the perſon, and the acquiſition of the uſual accompliſhments. With reſpect to theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, I will not preſume to direct the method of purſuing them. I will not ſo far intrude on a province, which by no means belongs to me. The ladies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their inſtructors, want no directions in matters of external ornament, the end of which is to pleaſe on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition. However arrogant the men have been in their clai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of ſuperiority, they have uſually allowed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the poſſeſſion of a delicate taſte in the improvement and perception of all kinds of beauty.</p>
                  <p>The literary education of women ought indiſputably to be varied according to their fortunes and their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Much refinement, and a taſte for books, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure her, whoſe time, from prudential motives, muſt be entirely engroſſed by economy. Few women are, indeed, exempted from all attention to domeſtic care; but, yet, the unmarried, and thoſe who enjoy opulence, find many

                  <p>It is well known, that internal beauty contributes much to perfect external grace. I believe it will alſo be favourable to virtue, and will operate greatly in reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from any conduct groſsly indelicate, and obviouſly improper. Much of the profligacy of female manners has proceeded from a levity occaſioned by a want of a proper education.

Sometimes, however, ſhe will throw herſelf in our way, when we are not ſeeking for her, and be uncommonly liberal of her favours. In a word, ſhe is a moſt arrant coquette, and I long ago determined to have little to do with her. Her proffered civilities I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with becoming marks of gratitude; but take care never to put it in her power to give me any conſiderable mortification, by diſappointing my expectations.</p>

If before, I felt intereſted in their happineſs, and perceived a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection for them ariſing in my breaſt, I now loved them moſt cordially.

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>NEVER was any poor devil of a huſband plagued in the manner I am with the ſingularities of a wife. You muſt know, Sir, though her father was a carcaſs-butcher in White-Chapel, though ſhe was educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a boarding-ſchool in Thames-ſtreet, and never travelled farther than Bethnal-Green, or Hoxton, or Hackney, or Newington-Butts; yet ſhe affects ſuch a taſte and paſſion for the country, as would have ruined the patience of all the heathen philoſophers put together: every room in my houſe, from the cellar to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, bears teſtimony to her rural ideas in ſome way or other: the leads of my houſe, and the rails of my win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, are crowded with pots and pans, and vegetables and evergreens, like the ſhop of a botaniſt or ſeedſman. When I go into the kitchen, I find the light, which is none of the livelieſt at the beſt, totally ſhut out by a range of phyſic phials, huddled together as cloſe as they can ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ick, and filled with mint, to give the windows a rural appearance. Then, Sir, the dining-room windows, in ſummer time, are ſo croſſed and crowded with pack-threads, faſtened like bars from the top to the bottom of them, that if it were not for the French beans, which cluſter round the ſtrings, it would enliven my mind with the pleaſing imagination of being cooped up in a ſpung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe. Every chimney corner is then ſet out, as it is called, with bough-pots, and not a china jar in my houſe eſcapes an ornament from Covent-Garden market. I have been, you muſt know, ſeverely lectured for this week paſt, for ſpoiling a charming bed of parſley, as my wife calls it, upon the leads, while I was giving a brick-layer orders to make ſome repairs to the chimney; and what is ſtill more provoking, upon inquiring for my beſt wig-box, a few days ago, I was told, by the maid, that
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035911_0097_100792EFA661F168"/>
the box was put to a much better uſe; for that her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs had ſown a ſallad in it of muſtard and creſe, which would be fit to cut in a few days. Sir, this paſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, that not a broken pot, is free from ſome cultivation or other. As I hope to be ſaved, ſhe had ſome time ſince a geranium in full bloſſom, which, to ſave expenſe, was ſtuck faſt in a c—e f—l pan; a myrtle in a butter firkin; an orange-tree in a waſhing-tub; a tulip in a ſalt-box, and a young gooſeberry buſh in a punch-bowl. Nay, to ſuch a pitch of extravagance does this enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aſtic helpmate of mine carry this gardening taſte of her's, that the houſe was thrown into convulſions three days ago, upon a report that the cat had kittened upon the graſs-plot, which grew upon the top ſhelf of the pantry. Then, Sir, to add to my vexation, I have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be threatened with an indictment for being a nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to my neighbours and the public, as hardly a week paſſes without ſome pan or pot tumbling upon the heads of the paſſengers, and doing ſome miſchief or other. If I expoſtulate, I have no taſte; if I threaten, I have no humanity; if I coax her, I have no influence; and if I give way to her, I can expect no comfort. My very bed-room, in ſummer, Sir, is ſo filled with flowers, that I am in nightly dread of being perfumed to death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore morning. Then I never muſt ſtir out without a noſegay in my button-hole, becauſe it makes ſo rural and ſo countrified an appearance. In ſhort, what with rural ſights, and rural ſmells, and rural converſation, rural or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and rural nonſenſe, of one kind or another, my patience is quite exhauſted: therefore I take this public method of giving my wife warning, that unleſs there is a thorough reformation in her manners, I am determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſert ſome ſpirit, to turn the graſs-plot out of the houſe at a minute's notice ſend the parſley bed into the duſt tub, pack up her ſhrubbery in an hamper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore my wig-box to its proper uſe.</p>

                     <salute>MY DEAR EMILY,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>HAVE you then forgotten your promiſe to come down to the country, and ſpend a few days with me in the beginning of ſpring? Perhaps the fine folks in town do not ſuppoſe that the ſpring is come yet. I can account for their miſtake. Nothing but the ſun can convince them of its approach; and they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo mewed up in their apartments, that they think very little of conſulting him. As for us, we enjoy his kindly beams already. The country, which was ſo dull for ſome months, has re-aſſumed all its charms. The trees, have ſhaken off winter's ſqualid dreſs, to put on, once more, the livery of ſpring. The birds, returning in crowds, form the moſt agreeable concerts; while they hide their neſts under the thick foliage of the groves. What can you be doing in town? Were you to paſs the whole day at your window, breathing the freſh air, would you ſuppoſe that you enjoyed the ſpring? Caſt your eyes, round you, what do you ſee? A ſky clouded with ſmoke; dirty ſtreets; in ſhort, the ſame objects that you have ſeen all winter. The houſe-tops, it is true are no longer covered with ſnow and icicles, but your dun tiles, even with this advantage, afford no very brilliant proſpect. Do you ſee, as I do, the ſun's riſing beams deck the freſh leaf with purple and gold? do you ſee the dew-drops ſhine like pearls, before his warmth dries them up? do you ſee him, when he emerges from behind the hill, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undate the vaſt horizon with a torrent of light? I ſuppoſe your town idlers, who have ſtuck ſo long to their fire-ſides, begin to truſt themſelves at length to the park, though they ſtill ſhudder with the cold, that they have felt; but look at them attentively, you will find that one winter has made them old. Here, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, every thing ſeems to have grown young again.

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>SOME time ago I troubled you with a letter, giving an account of a particular ſort of grievance felt by the families of men of ſmall fortunes, from their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thoſe of great ones. I am emboldened, by the favourable reception of my firſt letter, to write you a ſecond upon the ſame ſubject.</p>
                  <p>You will remember, Sir, my account of a viſit my daughters paid to a great lady in our neighbourhood, and of the effects which that viſit had upon them. I was beginning to hope that time, and the ſobriety of manners, which home exhibited, would reſtore them to their former ſituation, when, unfortunately, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance happened, ſtill more fatal to me than their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to —. This, Sir, was the honour of a viſit from the great lady in return.</p>
                  <p>I was juſt returned from the ſuperintendance of my ploughs in a field I have lately incloſed, when I was met on the green, before my door, by a gentleman (for ſuch I took him to be) mounted upon a very handſome geld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who aſked me by the appellation of honeſt friend, if this was not Mr. Homeſpun's; and in the ſame breath, whether the ladies were at home? I told him, my name was Homeſpun, the houſe was mine, and my wife and daughters were, I believed, within. Upon this, the young man, pulling off his hat, and begging my pardon for calling me honeſt, ſaid he was diſpatched by Lady —, with her compliments to Mrs. and Miſſes Homeſpun, and that if convenient, ſhe intended herſelf the honour of dining with them, on her return from B— park (the ſeat of another great and rich lady in our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.)</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, Mr. Mirror, I was ſtruck ſomewhat of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eap with the meſſage; and it would not, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> overheard by my eldeſt daughter, who had come to the window on the appearance of a ſtranger. "Mr. Papillot," ſaid ſhe immediately, "I rejoice to ſee you; I hope your Lady and all the family are well." "Very much at your ſervice Ma'am," replied he, with a low bow; "my Lady ſent me before, with the offer of her beſt compliments, and that, if convenient,"—and ſo forth, repeating his words to me. "She does us infinite honour," ſaid my young madam; "let her Ladyſhip know how happy her viſit will make us; but in the mean time, Mr. Papillot, give your horſe to one of the ſervants, and come in and have a glaſs of ſomething after your ride." "I am afraid," anſwered he, (pulling out his right-hand watch) for, would you believe it, Sir? the fellow had one in each fob, "I ſhall hardly have time to meet my Lady at the place ſhe appointed me." On a ſecond invitation, however, he diſmounted, and went into the houſe, leaving his horſe to the care of the ſervants; but the ſervants, as my daughter very well knew, were all in the fields at work; ſo I, who have a liking for a good horſe, and cannot bear to ſee him neglected, had the honour of putting Mr. Papillot's in the ſtable myſelf.</p>
                  <p>After about an hour's ſtay, (for the gentleman ſeemed to forget his hurry within doors) Mr. Papillot departed. My daughters, I mean the two polite ones, obſerved how handſome he was; and added another obſervation, that it was only to particular friends my Lady ſent meſſages by him, who was her own body ſervant, and not accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſuch offices. My wife ſeemed highly pleaſed with this laſt remark: I was about to be angry, but on ſuch occaſions it is not my way to ſay much; I general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhrug up my ſhoulders in ſilence; yet, Mr. Mirror, I would not have you think me hen-peck'd.</p>
                  <p>By this time, every domeſtic about my houſe, male and female, were called from their ſeveral employments to aſſiſt in the preparation for her Ladyſhip's reception. It would tire you to enumerate the various ſhifts that were made, by purchaſing, borrowing, &amp;c. to furniſh out a dinner ſuitable to the occaſion.

                     </gap>, I obſerve, have a natural talent that way. My wife took upon herſelf the charge of apparelling me for the occaſion. A laced ſuit, which I had worn at my marriage, was got up for the purpoſe; but the breeches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t a ſeam at the very firſt attempt of putting them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the ſleeves of the coat were alſo impracticable; ſo ſhe was forced to content herſelf with cloathing me in my Sunday's coat and breeches, with the laced waiſt-coat of the abovementioned ſuit, ſlit in the back, to ſet them off a little. My gardener, who has been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, indeed, to ſerve in many capacities, had his head craped, curled, and powdered, for the part of butler; one of the beſt looking plough-boys had a yellow cape clapped to his Sunday's coat to make him paſs for a ſervant in livery; and we borrowed my ſon-in-law the parſon's man for a third hand.</p>
                  <p>All this was accompliſhed, though not without ſome tumult and diſorder, before the arrival of the great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. She gave us, indeed, more time for the purpoſe than we looked for, as it was near ſix o'clock before ſhe arrived. But this was productive of a misfortune on the other hand: the dinner my poor wife had buſtled, ſweated, and ſcolded for, was ſo over-boiled, over-ſtewed, and over-roaſted, that it needed the appetite of ſo late an hour to make it go well down, even with me, who am not very nice in theſe matters: luckily, her Ladyſhip, as I am told, never eats much, for fear of ſpoiling her ſhape, now that ſmall waiſts have come into faſhion again.</p>
                  <p>The dinner, however, though ſpoiled in the cooking, was not thrown away, as her Ladyſhip's train made ſhift to eat the greateſt part of it. When I ſay her train, I do not mean her ſervants only, of which there were half a dozen in livery, beſides the illuſtrious Mr. Papillot, and her Ladyſhip's maid, (gentlewoman, I ſhould ſay) who had a table to themſelves. Her parlour attendants were equally numerous, conſiſting of two

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of them before.</p>
                  <p>During the progreſs of this entertainment, there were ſeveral little embarraſſments, which might appear ridic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous in deſcription, but were matters of ſerious diſtreſs to us; ſoup was ſpilled, diſhes overturned, and glaſſes broken, by the awkwardneſs of our attendants; and things were not a bit mended by my wife's ſolicitude (who to do her juſtice had all her eyes about her) to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them.</p>
                  <p>From the time of her Ladyſhip's arrival, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that dinner could be over before it was dark; this, with the conſideration of the bad road ſhe had to paſs through in her way to the next houſe ſhe meant to viſit, produced an invitation, from my wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to paſs the night with us; which, after a few word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of apology for the trouble ſhe gave us, and a few m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the honour we received, was agreed to. This gave riſe to a new ſcene of preparation, rather more difficult than that before dinner. My wife and I were diſlodged from our own apartment, to make room for our noble gueſt. Our four daughters were crammed in by us, and ſlept on the floor, that their rooms might be left for the two ladies and four of the gentlemen, who were entitled to the degree of reſpect; for the remaining two, we found beds at my ſon-in-law's. My two eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had, indeed, little time to ſleep, being cloſetted the greateſt part of the night with their right honourable viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itor. My offices were turned topſy-turvey for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the ſervants of my gueſts, and my own horſes turned into the fields, that their's might occupy my ſtable.</p>
                  <p>All theſe are hardſhips in their kind, Mr. Mirror, which the honour that accompanies them ſeems to me not fully to compenſate; but theſe are ſlight grievances, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with what I have to complain of as the effects of this viſit. The malady of my two eldeſt daughters is not only returned, with increaſed violence, upon them,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:035911_0100_1007BFC70981B740"/>
but has now communicated itſelf to every other branch of my family. My wife, formerly a decent, diſcreet wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who liked her own way indeed, but was a notable manager, now talks of this and that piece of expenſe as neceſſary to the rank of a gentlewoman, and has lately dropped ſome broad hints, that a winter in town is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the accompliſhment of one. My two younger daughters have got the <hi>heads</hi> that formerly belonged to their elder ſiſters, to each of whom, unfortunately, the great Lady preſented a ſet of feathers, for which new <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ds</hi> were eſſentially requiſite.</p>
                  <p>The inſide of all of them has undergone a very ſtriking metamorphoſis, from this one night's inſtruction of their viſitor. There is, it ſeems, a faſhion in morality, as well as dreſs; and the preſent mode is not quite ſo ſtrait-lac'd as the ſtays are. My two fine ladies talked, a few morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ago, of ſuch a gentleman's <hi>connexion</hi> with Miſs C—, and ſuch another's <hi>arrangement</hi> with Lady G—, with all the eaſe in the world. I ſometimes remonſtrate warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſpecially when I have my ſon-in-law to bac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe new-fangled freedoms: but another doctrine they have learned, is, that a father and a parſon may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ch as they pleaſe, but are to be followed only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inclination of their audience.</p>
                  <p>This contempt of authority, and affectation of faſhion, has gone a ſtep lower in my houſehold. My gardener has tied his hair behind, and ſtolen my flour to powder it, ever ſince he ſaw Mr. Papillot; and yeſterday he gave me warning that he ſhould leave me next term, if I did not take him into the houſe, and provide another hand for the work in the garden. I found a great hoyden, who waſhes my daughters' linens, ſitting the other after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, dreſſed in one of their caſt fly-caps, entertaining this ſame oaf of a gardener, and the wives of two of my farm-ſervants, with tea, forſooth; and when I quarrelled with her for it, ſhe replied, that Mrs. Dimmity, my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's gentlewoman, told her all the maids at—had tea, and ſaw company of an afternoon.</p>
                  <p>But I am reſolved on a reformation, Mr. Mirror; and ſhall let my wife and daughters know, that I will be maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my own houſe and my own expenſes, and will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

be made a fool nor a beggar, though it were after the manner of the greateſt lord in chriſtendom. Yet I confeſs I am always for trying gentle methods firſt. I beg, therefore, that you will inſert this in your next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and add to it ſome exhortations of your own, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on them, if poſſible, to give over a behaviour, which I think, under favour, is rather improper even in great folks, but is certainly ruinous to little ones.</p>

                  <head>LETTER V.—TO THE AUTHOR OF THE MIRROR.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM one of the young women mentioned in a letter which you publiſhed in your 25th number, though I did not know, till very lately, that our family had been put into print in the Mirror. Since it is ſo, I think I too may venture to write you a letter, which, if it be not quite ſo well written as my father's, will at leaſt be as true.</p>
                  <p>Soon after my Lady —'s viſit at our houſe, of which my father's letter informed you, a ſiſter of his, who is married to a man of buſineſs here in Edinburgh, came with her huſband to ſee us in the country; and, though my ſiſter Mary and I ſoon diſcovered many vulgar things about them, yet, as they were both very good-humoured ſort of people, and took great pains to make themſelves agreeable, we could not help looking with regret to the time of their departure. When that drew near, they ſurpriſed us, by an invitation to me, to come and ſpend ſome months with my couſins in town, ſaying, that my mother could not miſs my company at home, while ſhe had ſo good a companion and aſſiſtant in the family as her daughter Mary.</p>
                  <p>To me there were not ſo many allurements in this journey as might have been imagined. I had lately
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035911_0101_1007C03C2A39B140"/>
been taught to look on London as the only capital worth viſiting; beſides that, I did not expect the higheſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the ſociety I ſhould meet with at my aunt's, which, I confeſs, I was apt to ſuppoſe none of the moſt genteel. I contrived to keep the matter in ſuſpenſe (for it was left entirely to my own determination) till I ſhould write for the opinion of my friend, Lady —, on the ſubject; for, ever ſince our firſt acquaintance, we had kept up a conſtant and regular correſpondence. In our letters, which were always written in a ſtyle of the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection, we were in the way of talking with the greateſt freedom of every body of our acquaintance. It was delightful, as her Ladyſhip expreſſed it, "to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold one's feelings in the boſom of friendſhip." To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent diſcovery, we correſponded under ſignatures of Hortenſia and Leonora; and ſome very particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence her Ladyſhip taught me not to commit to ink, but to ſet down in lemon juice. I wander from my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Mr. Mirror; "but I cannot help fondly recalling (as Emily in the novel ſays) thoſe halcyon days of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and felicity."</p>
                  <p>When her Ladyſhip's anſwer arrived, I found her clearly of opinion that I ought to accept of my aunt's invitation. She was very jocular on the manners which ſhe ſuppoſed I ſhould find in that Lady's family; but ſhe ſaid I might take the opportunity of making ſome acquirements, which, though London alone could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Edinburgh might, in ſome degree, communicate. She concluded her letter with requeſting the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my correſpondence, and a narrative of every thing that was paſſing in town, eſpecially with regard to ſome ladies and gentlemen of her acquaintance, whom ſhe pointed out to my particular obſervation.</p>
                  <p>To Edinburgh, therefore, I accompanied my aunt, and found a family very much diſpoſed to make me happy. In this they might, perhaps, have ſucceeded more completely, had I not acquired, from the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lady —, and the company I ſaw at her houſe, certain notions of polite life, with which I did not find any thing at Mr. —'s, correſpond. It was often, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, their good-humour which offended me as coarſe,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035911_0102_1007BFC8B463FCC0"/>
and their happineſs that ſtruck me as vulgar. There was not ſuch a thing as hip or low ſpirits among them, a ſort of finery which, at —, I found a perſon of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion could not poſſibly be without.</p>
                  <p>They were at great pains to ſhew me any ſights that were to be ſeen, with ſome of which I was really little pleaſed, and with others I thought it would look like ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to ſeem pleaſed. They took me to the play-houſe, where there there was little company, and very little attention. I was carried to the concert, where the caſe was exactly the ſame. I found great fault with both; for though I had not much ſkill, I had got words enough for finding fault from my friend Lady —: upon which they made an apology for our entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by telling me, that the play-houſe was, at that time, managed by a fiddler, and the concert was allowed to manage itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Our parties at home were agreeable enough. I found Mr. —'s and my aunts viſitors very different from what I had been made to expect, and not at all the cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies my Lady — and ſome of her humourous gueſts uſed to deſcribe. They were not, indeed, ſo polite as the faſhionable company I had met at her Ladyſhip's; but they were much more civil. Among the reſt was my uncle-in-law's partner, a good looking young man, who, from the firſt, was ſo particularly attentive to me that my couſins, jokingly, called him my lover; and even my aunt ſometimes told me ſhe believed he had a ſerious attachment to me; but I took care not to give him any encouragement, as I had always heard my Lady — talk of the wife of a burgeois as the moſt contemptible creature in the world.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſon at laſt arrived, in which, I was told, the town would appear in its gaiety, a great deal of good company being expected at the races. For the races I looked with anxiety, for another reaſon; my dear La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy — was to be here at that period. Of this I was informed by a letter from my ſiſter. From her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I had not heard for a conſiderable time, as ſhe had been engaged in a round of viſits to her acquaintance in the country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="unknown:035911_0102_1007BFC8B463FCC0"/>The very morning after her arrival (for I was on the watch to get intelligence of her) I called at her lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. When the ſervant appeared, he ſeemed doubtful about letting me in; at laſt he uſhered me into a little darkiſh parlour, where, after waiting about half an hour, he brought me word, that his Lady could not try on the gown I had brought then, but deſired me to fetch it next day at eleven. I now perceived there had been a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take as to my perſon; and telling the fellow, ſomewhat angrily, that I was no mantua-maker, deſired him to carry to his Lady a ſlip of paper, on which I wrote with a pencil the well known name of Leonora. On his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſtairs, I heard a loud peal of laughter above, and ſoon after he returned with a meſſage, that Lady — was ſorry ſhe was particularly engaged at preſent, and could not poſſibly ſee me. Think, Sir, with what aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment I heard this meſſage from Hortenſia. I left the houſe, I know not whether moſt aſhamed or angry; but afterwards I began to perſuade myſelf, that there might be ſome particular reaſons for Lady —'s not ſeeing me at that time, which ſhe might explain at meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I imputed the terms of the meſſage to the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſimplicity of the footman. All that day, and the next, I waited impatiently for the note of explanation or inquiry from her Ladyſhip, but was a good deal diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed when I found the ſecond evening arrive, without having received any ſuch token of her remembrance. I went, rather in low ſpirits, to the play. I had not been long in the houſe, when I ſaw Lady — enter the next box. My heart fluttered at the ſight; and I watched her eyes, that I might take the firſt opportunity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting myſelf to her notice. I ſaw them ſoon after turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards me, and immediately curtſied, with a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſmile, to my noble friend, who being ſhort-ſighted, it would ſeem, which, however, I had never remarked before, ſtared at me for ſome moments, without taking notice of my ſalute, and at laſt was juſt putting up a glaſs to her eye, to point it at me, when a lady pulled her by the ſleeve, and made her take notice of ſomebody on the oppoſite ſide of the houſe. She never afterwards happened to look to that quarter where I was ſeated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="unknown:035911_0103_1007BFCB49CCD1D0"/>Still, however, I was not quite diſcouraged; and, on an accidental change of places in our box, contrived to place myſelf at the end of the bench next her Ladyſhip's, ſo that there was only a piece of thin board between us. At the end of the act, I ventured to aſk her how ſhe did, and to expreſs my happineſs at ſeeing her in town, adding, that I had called the day before, but had found her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly engaged. "Why yes," ſaid ſhe, "Miſs Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun, I am always extremely hurried in town, and have time to receive only a few viſits; but I will be glad if you will come ſome morning and breakfaſt with me—but not to-morrow, for there is a morning concert; nor next day, for I have a muſical party at home. In ſhort, you may come ſome morning next week, when the hurry will be over, and, if I am not gone out of town, I will be happy to ſee you." I don't know what anſwer I ſhould have made; but ſhe did not give me an opportunity; for a gentleman in a green uniform coming into the box, ſhe immediately made room for him to ſit between us. He, after a broad ſtare full in my face, turned his back my way, and ſat in that poſture all the reſt of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>I am not ſo ſilly, Mr. Mirror, but I can underſtand the meaning of all this. My Lady, it ſeems, is contented to have ſome humble friends in the country, whom ſhe does not think worthy of her notice in town; but I am determined to ſhew her, that I have a prouder ſpirit than ſhe imagines, and ſhall not go near her, either in town or country. What is more, my father ſha'nt vote for her friend at next election, if I can help it.</p>
                  <p>What vexes me beyond every thing elſe, is, that I had often been telling my aunt and her daughters of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate footing. I was on with Lady —, and what a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent friendſhip we had for each other; and ſo, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, perhaps, they uſed to nick-name me the counteſs, and Lady Leonora. Now that they had got this ſtory of the mantua-maker and the play-houſe, (for I was ſo angry I could not conceal it) I am aſhamed to hear the name of a lady of quality mentioned, even if it be only in a book from the circulating library. Do write a paper,

                  <p>IT would be an inſult to your humanity (or perhaps look like it) to apologize for the liberty I am taking. I am one of thoſe people, whom the vulgar and illiberal call negroes. The firſt part of my life was rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unlucky, as I was placed in a family, who judged ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance the beſt and only ſecurity for obedience. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reading and writing I got by unwearied application. The latter part of my life has been, through God's bleſſing, truly fortunate, having ſpent it in the ſervice of one of the beſt and greateſt families in the kingdom. My chief pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure has been books—philanthropy I adore. How very much, good Sir, am I (amongſt millions) indebted to you for the character of your amiable uncle Toby! I declare I would walk ten miles in the dog-days, to ſhake hands even with the honeſt corporal, his ſervant. Your ſermons have touched me to the heart, and I hope have amended it; which brings me to the point. In your tenth diſcourſe is this very affecting paſſage—"Conſider how great a part of our ſpecies, in all ages, down to this, have been trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the feet of cruel and capricious tyrants, who would neither hear their cries, nor pity their diſtreſſes! Conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſlavery, what it is—how bitter a draught, and how many millions are made to drink of it!" Of all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite authors, not one has drawn a tear, in favour of my miſerable black brethren, except yourſelf and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane author of Sir George Elliſon. I think you will forgive me; I am ſure you will applaud me for beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to give one half-hour's attention to ſlavery, as it is

this day practiſed in our Weſt-Indies: that ſubject, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in your ſtriking manner, would eaſe the yoke, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of many; but, if only one—gracious God! what a feaſt to a benevolent heart! and ſure I am, you are an epicurian in acts of charity. You, who are univerſally read, and as univerſally admired, you could not fail. Dear Sir, think in me you behold the uplifted hands of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of my brother Moors. Grief, you pathetically ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is eloquent: figure to yourſelf their attitudes! hear their ſupplicating addreſſes!—Alas! you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; humanity muſt comply: in which hope, I beg per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſubſcribe myſelf, Reverend Sir, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>LETTER VII.—MR. STERNE TO IGNATIUS SANCHO.</head>
                  <p>THERE is a ſtrange coincidence, Sancho, in the little events, as well as in the great ones, of this world: for I had been writing a tender tale of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of a friendleſs poor negro girl, and my eyes had ſcarce done ſmarting with it, when your letter of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, in behalf of ſo many of her brethren and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, came to me. But why her brethren, or your's, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, any more than mine? It is by the fineſt tints, and moſt inſenſible gradations, that nature deſcends from the faireſt face about St. James's, to the ſootieſt complexion in Africa:—at which tint of theſe is it, that the ties of blood are to ceaſe? and how many ſhades muſt we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend lower ſtill in the ſcale, ere mercy is to vaniſh with them? But it is no uncommon thing, my good Sancho, for one half of the world to uſe the other half of it like brutes, and then endeavour to make them ſo. For my own part, I never look weſtward (when I am in a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive mood, at leaſt) but I think of the burthens which our brothers and ſiſters are there carrying; and could I eaſe their ſhoulders from one ounce of them, I declare I would ſet out this hour upon a pilgrimage to Mecca for their ſakes—which, by the bye, Sancho, exceeds your walk of

If I can weave the tale I have wrote, into the work I am about—it is at the ſervice of the afflicted—and a much greater matter; for, in ſerious truth, it caſts a ſad ſhade upon the world, that ſo great a part of it are, and have been, ſo long bound in chains of darkneſs, and in chains of miſery; and I cannot but both reſpect and felicitate you, that by ſo much laudable diligence you have broke the one—and that, by falling into the hands of ſo good and merciful a family, Providence has reſcued you from the other.</p>

                  <p>WHEN you favoured me with your letter, you ſeemed to be in want of materials to fill it, having met with no great adventures, either of peril or delight, nor done or ſuffered any thing out of the common courſe of life.</p>
                  <p>When you have lived longer, and conſidered more, you will find the common courſe of life very fertile of obſervation and reflection. Upon the common courſe of life muſt our thoughts and our converſation be gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally employed. Our general courſe of life muſt denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate us wiſe or fooliſh; happy or miſerable: if it is well regulated, we paſs on proſperouſly and ſmoothly; as if it is neglected, we live in embarraſſment, perplexity, and uneaſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Your time, my love, paſſes, I ſuppoſe, in devotion, reading, work, and company. Of your devotions, in which I earneſtly adviſe you to be very punctual, you may not perhaps think it proper to give me an account;

and of work, unleſs I underſtood it better, it will be of no great uſe to ſay much; but books and company will always ſupply you with materials for your letters to me, as I ſhall always be pleaſed to know what you are read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with what you are pleaſed; and ſhall take great delight in knowing what impreſſion new modes and new characters make upon you, and to obſerve with what at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention you diſtinguiſh the tempers, diſpoſitions, and abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of your companions.</p>

                  <p>YOU are heartily welcome, my dear little couſin, into this unquiet world; long may you continue in it, in all the happineſs it can give, and beſtow enough on all your friends to anſwer fully the impatience with which you have been expected. May you grow up to have every accompliſhment, that you good friend, the Biſhop of Derry, can already imagine in you; and, in the mean time, may you have a nurſe with a tuneable voice, that may not talk an immoderate deal of nonſenſe to you. You are, at preſent, my dear, in a very philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical diſpoſition; the gaieties and follies of life have no attraction for you; its ſorrows you kindly commiſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate! but, however, do not ſuffer them to diſturb your ſlumbers, and find charms in nothing but harmony and repoſe. You have as yet contracted no partialities, are entirely ignorant of party diſtinctions, and look with a perfect indifference on all human ſplendour. You have an abſolute diſlike to the vanities of dreſs; and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for many months to obſerve the Biſhop of Briſtol's firſt rule of converſation, ſilence; though tempted to tranſgreſs it by the novelty and ſtrangeneſs of all objects around.

temper will, by degrees, wear off: the firſt object of your admiration will probably be the candle; and thence (as we all of us do) you will contract a taſte for the gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the glaring, without making one moral reflection upon the danger of ſuch falſe admiration, as leads people many a time to burn their fingers. You will begin to ſhew great partiality for ſome very good aunts, who will contribute all they can towards ſpoiling you; but you will be equally fond of an excellent mamma, who will teach you, by her example, all ſorts of good qualities; only let me warn you of one thing, my dear, and that is, not to learn of her to have ſuch an immoderate love of home, as is quite contrary to all the privileges of this polite age, and to give up ſo entirely all thoſe pretty graces of whim, flutter, and affectation, which ſo many charitable poets have declared to be the prerogative of our ſex: oh! my poor couſin, to what purpoſe will you boaſt this prerogative, when your nurſe tells you with a pious care, (to ſow the ſeeds of jealouſy and emulation as early as poſſible) that you have a fine little brother come to put your noſe out of joint? There will be noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be done then but to be mighty good, and prove what, believe me, admits of very little diſpute, (though it has occaſioned abundance) that we girls, however people give themſelves airs of being diſappointed, are by no means to be deſpiſed. Let the men unenvied ſhine in public; it is we that muſt make their homes delightful to them; and if they provoke us, no leſs uncomfortable.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THAT diſtreſs finds ſome conſolation from revealing its misfortunes, is a trite obſervation, which perhaps is in no inſtance, more ſtrongly felt, than where we have ourſelves to blame for our calamities. There is ſomething in making a confeſſion, though but on paper, (even if it ſhould never be communicated to any one) which unloads the mind of a weight, that bears it down in ſecret; and though it cannot pluck the thorn from memory, has certainly the effect of blunting its poignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Suffer me then, Sir, to tell you, or to write as if I were telling you, how unhappy I am, and by what means I have become ſo.</p>
                  <p>I was left by my father at the age of thirteen, the eldeſt of two daughters, under the charge of one of the beſt and moſt indulgent of mothers. Our circumſtances were affluent; our ſociety reſpectable; and our education, from its very commencement, had been attended to with care, and provided for with the utmoſt liberality. No inſtruction was neglected, no accompliſhment unattended to. In attaining theſe, my ſiſter was not quite ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as I. Born, as I have been often told, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common quickneſs of parts, I found no difficulty in maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſtudies that were taught me, or of acquiring the embelliſhments it was wiſhed I ſhould acquire. My ſiſter was often deficient in the one and awkward at the other. She poſſeſſed, however, a ſound, plain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and an excellent temper. My ſuperiority nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er excited envy in her, and I think never vanity in me. We loved one another moſt ſincerely; and after ſome years had blunted the grief, which my mother felt for her huſband's death, there were, I believe, few happier families than our's.</p>
                  <p>Though our affections were cordial, however, our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were very different. My ſiſter was contented to
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:035911_0106_1007BFD3E4D411F0"/>
think as other people thought, and to feel as other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple felt; ſhe rarely ventured to ſpeculate in opinion, or to ſoar in fancy. I was often tempted to reject, if not to deſpiſe the common opinions of mankind, and to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to myſelf a warm, and, I am afraid, a viſionary pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of happineſs, ariſing from a highly refined ſenſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. My mother was at pains to diſcourage theſe enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic ideas, and to repreſent the danger of indulging in them. From a deſire, perhaps, of overcoming that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency towards them which ſhe perceived in me, her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when we were alone, almoſt conſtantly turned on this ſubject. As ſhe always allowed us the liberty of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with her, I ſtood up, in theſe converſations, the warm defender of my own maxims, in contradiction to thoſe prudent ones, which ſhe recommended. Her's, I am perſuaded, admitted of better reaſoning; but my cauſe gave greater room for eloquence. All my little talents were exerted in the conteſt; and I have often ſince thought that my mother had, from nature, a bent to my ſide of the queſtion, which all her wiſdom and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had not been able to overcome; that though ſhe conſtantly applauded the prudent ſyſtem of my ſiſter, ſhe was, in truth, rather partial to mine, and vain of that ability with which I defended it: however that might be, I myſelf always aroſe from the diſpute more and more convinced of the juſtneſs of my own opinions, and proud of that ſuperiority which I thought they conferred on me.</p>
                  <p>We had not long attained a marriageable age, when we found ourſelves ſurrounded with thoſe whom the world terms admirers. Our mother's benevolence and ſweetneſs of temper inclined her to ſociety, and we were too innocent for prudery; we had, therefore, a number of viſitors of the other ſex, many of whom were ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in their attentions, that women who wiſhed to boaſt of conqueſts, would have called them lovers. With us they did not always aſſume that title; my ſiſter was too prudent, and I was too nice, eaſily to believe a man a lover.</p>
                  <p>Among thoſe, however, were two gentlemen, whoſe attachment was declared to me in terms too ſtrong to be
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035911_0107_1007BFD732404DB8"/>
miſunderſtood. Florio's perſon was univerſally allowed to be handſome; many, of whom I was one, thought it elegant. With external accompliſhment his education had furniſhed him; his manner was eaſy and unembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed; ſome called it aſſuming, I thought it natural. His converſation was full of the language of ſenſibility; in my idea it ſpoke a mind replete with ſenſibility itſelf. Other people ſometimes ſuſpected him of ſhallowneſs and affectation; I praiſed him for avoiding the pedantry of knowledge, and the ruſticity of men proud of its acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Alcander was the only ſon of a particular friend of my mother, and therefore on a very intimate footing in our family. My mother, with whom he was a favourite, diſcovered in him a great fund of good ſenſe and uſeful knowledge. I was ſtruck with the inelegance of his appearance and addreſs, and the want of refinement in his ſentiments and converſation. His goodneſs and candour were often the topics of my mother's commendation; I remarked his want of diſcernment, and the coldneſs of his attachments and averſions. My mother often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her own eulogiums of Alcander, and the criticiſms of the world on Florio; I always heard her with a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined oppoſition of ſentiment, and therefore aroſe from the converſation more averſe to the firſt, and more attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the latter. Alcander, after perſiſting for ſome time under a very marked diſinclination to him, gave up the purſuit; but as he ſtill continued his viſits to the family, particularly during any occaſional abſence of mine, he transferred by degrees his affections to my ſiſter. When he had ceaſed to be my lover, I was very willing to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much his friend: my mother had always ſhewn her partiality in his favour; my ſiſter was won by his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and after ſome time became his wife.</p>
                  <p>Florio's ſuit to me was oppoſed by my mother, with rather more vehemence than was natural to her. She oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en inſiſted on the infatuation, as ſhe called it, of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which I was under, with regard to him; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which ſhe predicted I ſhould one day be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. Her oppoſition, however, though it over-ruled my conduct, never overcame my attachment: I would
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035911_0107_1007BFD732404DB8"/>
not be his without the conſent of my mother; but my affection it was not in her power to ſhake. Her love for me overcame her reſolution; and at laſt ſhe gave, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unwillingly, my hand to Florio.</p>
                  <p>I was now the happieſt of women. The ſcenes I had often pictured of conjugal tenderneſs and domeſtic hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, I thought now realized in the poſſeſſion of a man, who, I had taught myſelf to believe, was to love me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and was himſelf every thing I ought to love; and I often looked with a degree of pity on the ſituation of my ſiſter, whoſe happineſs (for ſhe called it happineſs) with Alcander was of a kind ſo inferior to mine.</p>
                  <p>How long this laſted I cannot exactly ſay. I fear I began to be unhappy long before I would allow myſelf to believe it. I have often wept alone at the coldneſs and neglect of Florio, when on meeting him, a few words of ſeeming tenderneſs and affection made me again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my doubts of his love, and think my own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the moſt enviable of any. Alas! he at length drove me from this laſt ſtrong hold, in which my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him had entrenched itſelf. It is now three years ſince he has treated me in ſuch a manner as to leave no apology for his treatment. During the laſt, my mother's death has deprived me of one of the few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts I had left. From my mother I carefully concealed my diſtreſs; but I believe in vain: ſhe lived to gueſs at my miſery; and I fear her ſenſe of it added to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that which brought her to the grave.</p>
                  <p>After the loſs of my huſband's love, it is little to talk of my diſappointment in his talents and accompliſhments. It was long, however, before I allowed myſelf to ſee defects, which leſs penetration than I have been flattered with poſſeſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d long before diſcovered. My mother had often, before our marriage, expreſſed her ſurpriſe that one of my abilities ſhould be ſo deceived, as not to ſee his inferiority. I believe it is by theſe abilities that the deception is aided: they are able to form a picture to which more ordinary minds are unequal; and in the weakneſs of their raſh attachment, they find the likeneſs where they wiſh to find it.</p>

I am too proud to allow a witneſs to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes; and from her, of all womankind, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them. This diſſimulation is due to my pride, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to my duty; yet if you knew, Sir, what it is to ſmile in public, to ſeem to be happy with ſuch feelings as mine; to act contentment all day long, and retire at night to my lonely pillow, with the anguiſh my heart has treaſured up all the while!—but the ſubject over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers me!—Farewel.</p>

                  <p>MY fair companion ſtill improves in my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem; the more I know her mind, her beauty becomes more poignant; ſhe appears charming even among the daughters of Circa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ia.</p>
                  <p>Yet were I to examine her beauty with the art of a ſtatuary, I ſhould find numbers here, that far ſurpaſs her; nature has not granted her all the boaſted Circaſſian reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularity of feature, and yet ſhe greatly exceeds the faireſt of the country, in the art of ſeizing the affections. Whence, I have often ſaid to myſelf, this reſiſtleſs magic, that attends even moderate charms? Though I regard the beauties of the country with admiration, every inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view weakens the impreſſion; but the form of Zelis grows upon my imagination: I never behold her without an increaſe of tenderneſs and reſpect. Whence this injuſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> of the mind in preferring imperfect beauty to that which nature ſeems to have finiſhed with care? Whence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation, that he, whom a comet could not amaze, ſhould be aſtoniſhed at a meteor? When reaſon was thus fatigued to find an anſwer, my imagination purſued the ſubject, and this was the reſult—I fancied myſelf placed between two landſcapes, this called the region of beauty, and that the valley of the graces; the one embelliſhed with all that
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:035911_0108_1007BFD8C4A6BC20"/>
luxuriant nature could beſtow; the fruits of various cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates adorned the trees; the grove reſounded with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>; the gale breathed perfume; every charm that could ariſe from ſymmetry and exact diſtribution were here conſpicuous; the whole offering a proſpect of pleaſure without end. The valley of the graces, on the other hand, ſeemed by no means ſo inviting; the ſtreams and the groves appeared juſt as they uſually do in frequented countries: no magnificent parterres; no concert in the grove: the rivulet was edged with weeds; and the rook joined its voice to that of the nightingale. All was ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and nature.</p>
                  <p>The moſt ſtriking objects ever firſt allure the traveller. I entered the region of beauty with increaſed curioſity, and promiſed myſelf endleſs ſatisfaction, in being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the preſiding goddeſs. I perceived ſeveral ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who entered with the ſame deſign; and what ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed me not a little, was to ſee ſeveral others haſtening to leave this abode of ſeeming felicity.</p>
                  <p>After ſome fatigue, I had at laſt the honour of being introduced to the goddeſs, who repreſented beauty in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. She was ſeated on a throne, at the foot of which ſtood ſeveral ſtrangers lately introduced like me, all gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her form with extaſy. "Ah what eyes! what lips! how clear her complexion! how perfect her ſhape!" At theſe exclamations, beauty with downcaſt eyes, would endeavour to counterfeit modeſty, but ſoon again looking round as if to confirm every ſpectator in his favourable ſentiments, ſometimes ſhe would attempt to allure us by ſmiles; and at intervals would bridle back, in order to inſpire us with reſpect as well as tenderneſs.</p>
                  <p>This ceremony laſted for ſome time, and had ſo much employed our eyes, that we forgot all this while that the goddeſs was ſilent. We ſoon, however, began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the defect: "What," ſaid we, among each other, "are we to have nothing but languiſhing airs, ſoft looks, and inclinations of the head? will the goddeſs only deign to ſatisfy our eyes?" Upon this, one of the company ſtepped up to preſent her with ſome fruits he had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the way. She received the preſent, moſt ſweetly ſmiling, and with one of the whiteſt hands in the world; but ſtill not a word eſcaped her lips.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="unknown:035911_0109_1007BFDAD0842E10"/>I now found that my companions grew weary of their homage; they went off one by one; and, reſolving not to be left behind, I offered to go in my turn; when juſt at the door of the temple, I was called back by a female, whoſe name was Pride, and who ſeemed diſpleaſed with the behaviour of the company. "Where are you haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening?" ſaid ſhe to me, with an angry air, "the goddeſs of beauty is here." I have been to viſit her, Madam, replied I, and I find her more beautiful even than report had made her. "And why then will you leave her?" added the female. I have ſeen her long enough, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I; I have got all her features by heart. Her eyes are ſtill the ſame. Her noſe is a very fine one, but it is ſtill juſt ſuch a noſe now as it was half an hour ago: could ſhe throw a little more mind into her face, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould be for wiſhing to have more of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. "What ſignifies," replied my female, "whether ſhe has a mind or not; has ſhe any occaſion for a mind, ſo formed as ſhe is by nature? If ſhe had a common face, indeed, there might be ſome reaſon for thinking to improve it; but when features are already perfect, every alteration would but impair them. A fine face is already at the point of perfection, and a fine lady ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep it ſo; the impreſſion it would receive from thought, would but diſturb its whole economy."</p>
                  <p>To this ſpeech I gave no reply, but made the beſt of my way to the valley of the graces. Here I found all thoſe, who before had been my companions in the region of beauty, now upon the ſame errand.</p>
                  <p>As we entered the valley, the proſpect inſenſibly ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to improve; we found every thing ſo natural, ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic and pleaſing, that our minds, which before were congealed in admiration, now relaxed into gaiety and good humour. We had deſigned to pay our reſpects to the preſiding goddeſs, but ſhe was no where to be found. One of our companions aſſerted, that her temple lay to the right; another to the left; a third inſiſted that it was ſtraight before us; and a fourth that we had left it behind. In ſhort, we found every thing familiar and charming, but could not determine where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſeek for the grace in perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="unknown:035911_0109_1007BFDAD0842E10"/>In this agreeable incertitude we paſſed ſeveral hours; and, though very deſirous of finding the goddeſs, by no means impatient of the delay. Every part of the valley preſented ſome minute beauty, which, without offering itſelf, at once ſtole upon the ſoul, and captivated us with the charms of our retreat. Still, however, we continued to ſearch, and might ſtill have continued, had we not been interrupted by a voice, which, though we could not ſee from whence it came, addreſſed us in this manner:</p>
                  <p>"If you would find the goddeſs of grace, ſeek her not under one form, for ſhe aſſumes a thouſand. Ever chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the eye of inſpection, her variety, rather than her figure, is pleaſing. In contemplating her beauty, the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight, and capable of fixing no where, is charmed with the whole. She is now contemplation with ſolemn look, again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion with humid eye; ſhe now ſparkles with joy, her countenance beaming with ſenſibility; ſoon every feature ſpeaks diſtreſs; her looks at times invite our approach, at others repreſs our preſumption; the goddeſs cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of theſe forms, but, by combining them all, ſhe becomes irreſiſtibly pleaſing." Adieu.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU have very lately obſerved that, in the numerous ſubdiviſions of the world, every claſs and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of mankind have joys and ſorrows of their own; we all feel hourly pain and pleaſure from events which paſs unheeded before other eyes, but can ſcarcely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our perceptions to minds pre-occupied by different objects, any more than the delight of well-diſpoſed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours or harmonious ſounds can be imparted to ſuch as want the ſenſes of hearing or of ſight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="unknown:035911_0110_1007BFDC9739C148"/>I am ſo ſtrongly convinced of the juſtneſs of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, and have on ſo many occaſions diſcovered with how little attention pride looks upon calamity of which ſhe thinks herſelf not in danger, and indolence liſtens to complaint when it is not echoed by her own remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that though I am about to lay the occurrences of my life before you, I queſtion whether you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to peruſe my narrative, or without the help of ſome female ſpeculatiſt, be able to underſtand it.</p>
                  <p>I was born a beauty. From the dawn of my reaſon I had my regard turned wholly upon myſelf; nor can I recollect any thing earlier than praiſe and admiration. My mother, whoſe face had luckily advanced her to a condition above her birth, thought no evil ſo great as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. She had not the power of imagining any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er defect than a cloudy complexion, or diſproportionate features; and therefore contemplated me as an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of all that could raiſe envy or deſire, and predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with triumphant fondneſs, the extent of my conqueſts, and the number of my ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>She never mentioned any of my young acquaintance before me, but to remark how much they fell below my perfection; how one would have had a fine face but that her eyes were without luſtre; how another ſtruck the ſight at a diſtance, but wanted my hair and teeth at a nearer view; another diſgraced an elegant ſhape with a a brown ſkin; ſome had ſhort fingers, and others dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in a wrong place.</p>
                  <p>As ſhe expected no happineſs nor advantage but from beauty, ſhe thought nothing but beauty worthy of her care; and her maternal kindneſs was chiefly exerciſed in contrivances to protect me from any accident, that might deface me with a ſcar, or ſtain me with a freckle: ſhe never thought me ſufficiently ſhaded from the ſun, or ſcreened from the fire. She was ſevere or indulgent with no other intention than the preſervation of my form: ſhe excuſed me from work, leſt I ſhould learn to hang down my head, or harden my finger with a needle: ſhe ſnatched away my book, becauſe a young lady in the neighbourhood had made her eyes red, with reading by a candle; but ſhe would ſcarce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y ſuffer me to eat, leſt I
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:035911_0110_1007BFDC9739C148"/>
ſhould ſpoil my ſhape; nor to walk, leſt I ſhould ſwell my ancle with a ſprain. At night I was accurately ſurveyed from head to foot, leſt I ſhould have ſuffered any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of my charms in the adventures of the day; and was never permitted to ſleep, till I had paſſed through the coſmetic diſcipline, part of which was a regular luſtration performed with bean-flower water and may-dews; my hair was perfumed with variety of unguents, by ſome of which it was to be thickened, and by others to be curled. The ſoftneſs of my hands was ſecured by medicated gloves, and my boſom rubbed with a pomade prepared by my mother, of virtue to diſcuſs pimples, and clear diſcolorations.</p>
                  <p>I was always called up early, becauſe the morning air gives a freſhneſs to the cheeks; but I was placed behind a curtain in my mother's chamber, becauſe the neck is eaſily tanned by the riſing ſun. I was then dreſſed with a thouſand precautions, and again heard my own praiſes, and triumphed in the compliments and prognoſtications of all that approached me.</p>
                  <p>My mother was not ſo much prepoſſeſſed with an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of my natural excellencies as not to think ſome cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary to their completion. She took care that I ſhould want none of the accompliſhments included in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male education, or conſidered as neceſſary in faſhionable life. I was looked upon in my ninth year as the chief ornament of the dancing-maſter's ball; and Mr. Ariet uſed to reproach his other ſcholars with my performances on the harpſichord. At twelve, I was remarkable for playing my cards with great elegance of manner, and accuracy of judgment.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the time arrived when my mother thought me perfect in my exerciſes, and qualified to diſplay, in the open world, thoſe accompliſhments which had yet been only diſcovered in ſelect parties, or domeſtic aſſemblies. Preparations were therefore made for my appearance on a public night, which ſhe conſidered as the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and critical moment of my life. She cannot be charged with neglecting any means of recommendation, or leaving any thing to chance, which prudence could aſcertain. Every ornament was tried in every poſition
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:035911_0111_1007BFE016E7E058"/>
every friend was conſulted about the colour of my dreſs; and the mantua-makers were haraſſed with directions and alterations.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the night arrived, from which my future life was to be reckoned. I was dreſſed and ſent out to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, with a heart beating like that of an old knight-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at his firſt ſally. Scholars have told me of a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan matron, who, when ſhe armed her ſon for battle, bade him bring back his ſhield or be brought upon it. My venerable parent diſmiſſed me to a field, in her opinion of equal glory, with a command to ſhew that I was her daughter, and not to return without a lover.</p>
                  <p>I went, and was received like other pleaſing novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with a tumult of applauſe. Every man, who val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelf upon the graces of his perſon, or the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his addreſs, crowded about me, and wit and ſplendour contended for my notice. I was delightfully fatigued with inceſſant civilities, which were made more pleaſing by the apparent envy of thoſe, whom my preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence expoſed to neglect, and returned with an attendant equal in rank and wealth to my utmoſt wiſhes, and from this time ſtood in the firſt rank of beauty, was followed by gazers in the Mall, celebrated in the papers of the day, imitated by all who endeavoured to riſe into faſhion, and cenſured by thoſe whom age or diſappointment forced to retire.</p>
                  <p>My mother, who pleaſed herſelf with the hopes of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my exaltation, dreſſed me with all the exuberance of finery; and when I repreſented to her that a fortune might be expected proportionate to my appearance, told me that ſhe ſhould ſcorn the reptile, who could inquire after the fortune of a girl like me. She adviſed me to proſecute my victories, and time would certainly bring me a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, who might deſerve the honour of being enchained forever.</p>
                  <p>My lovers were indeed ſo numerous, that I had no other care than that of determining to whom I ſhould ſeem to give the preference. But having been ſteadily and induſtriouſly inſtructed to preſerve my heart from any impreſſions which might hinder me from conſulting my intereſt, I acted with leſs embarraſſment, becauſe my
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:035911_0111_1007BFE016E7E058"/>
choice was regulated by principles more clear and certain than the caprice of approbation. When I had ſingled out one from the reſt as more worthy of encouragement, I proceeded in my meaſures by the rules of art; and yet, when the ardour of the firſt viſits was ſpent, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally found a ſudden declenſion of my influence: I felt in myſelf the want of ſome power to diverſify amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enliven converſation; and could not but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that my mind failed in performing the promiſes of my face. This opinion was ſoon confirmed by one of my lovers, who married Lavinia with leſs beauty and fortune than mine, becauſe he thought a wife ought to have qualities, which might make her amiable when her bloom was paſt.</p>
                  <p>I had now completed my nineteenth year: if my charms had loſt any of their ſoftneſs, it was more than compenſated by additional dignity; and if the attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of innocence were impaired, their place was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the arts of allurement. I was therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for a new attack, without any abatement of my confidence, when in the midſt of my hopes and ſchemes, I was ſeized with that dreadful malady, which has ſo oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en put a ſudden end to the tyranny of beauty. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my health after a long confinement; but when I looked again on that face, which had often been fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tranſport at its own reflection, and ſaw all that I had learned to value, all that I had endeavoured to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, all that had procured me honours or praiſes, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably deſtroyed, I ſunk at once into melancholy and deſpondence. My pain was not much conſoled or alleviated by my mother, who grieved that I had not loſt my life together with my beauty.</p>
                  <p>Having thus continued my relation to the period from which my life took a new courſe, I ſhall conclude it in another letter, if by publiſhing this you ſhow any regard to the correſpondence of,</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU have ſhewn, by the publication of my letter, that you think the life of Victoria not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the notice of a philoſopher: I ſhall therefore continue my narrative, without apology for unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which you have dignified, or for inaccuracies which you are to correct.</p>
                  <p>When my life appeared to be no longer in danger, and as much of my ſtrength was recovered as enabled me to bear the agitation of a coach, I was placed at a lodging in a neighbouring village, to which my mother diſmiſſed me with a faint embrace, having repeated her command not to expoſe my face too ſoon to the ſun or wind, and told me, that with care I might perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tolerable again. The proſpect of becoming tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable had very little power to elevate the imagination of one, who had ſo long been accuſtomed to praiſe and extaſy; but it was ſome ſatisfaction to be ſeparated from my mother, who was inceſſantly ringing the knell of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted beauty, and never entered my room without the whine of condolence, or the growl of anger. She often wandered over my face, as do travellers over the ruins of a celebrated city, to note every place which had once been remarkable for a happy feature. She condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to viſit my retirement, but always left me more mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy; for after a thouſand trifling inquiries about my diet, and a minute examination of my looks, ſhe gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concluded with a ſigh, that I ſhould never more be fit to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>At laſt I was permitted to return home, but found no great improvement of my condition; for I was impriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in my chamber as a criminal, whoſe appearance would diſgrace my friends, and condemned to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into new beauty. Every experiment which the officiouſneſs of folly could communicate, or the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ignorance admit, was tried upon me. Sometimes
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:035911_0112_1007BFE3EDE592A0"/>
I was covered with emollients, by which it was expected that all the ſcars would be filled, and my cheeks plump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to their former ſmoothneſs; and ſometimes I was puniſhed with artificial excoriations, in hopes of gaining new graces with a new ſkin. The coſmetic ſcience was, exhauſted upon me; but who can repair the ruins of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? My mother was forced to give me reſt at laſt, and abandon me to the fate of a fallen toaſt, whoſe fortune ſhe conſidered as a hopeleſs game, no longer worthy of ſolicitude or attention.</p>
                  <p>I was ſo little able to find entertainment for myſelf, that I was forced in a ſhort time to venture abroad, as the ſolitary ſavage is driven by hunger from his den. I entered with all the humility of diſgrace into aſſemblies, where I had lately ſparkled with gaiety, and towered with triumph. I was not wholly without hope, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection had miſrepreſented me to myſelf, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of my former face might yet have ſome attraction and influence: but the firſt circle of viſits convinced me, that my reign was at an end; that life and death were no longer in my hands; that I was no more to practiſe the glance of command, or the frown of prohibition, to receive the tribute of ſighs and praiſes, or to be ſoothed with the gentle murmurs of amorous timidity. My opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion was now unheard, and my propoſals were unregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the narrowneſs of my knowledge, and the meanneſs of my ſentiments, were eaſily diſcovered, when the eyes were no longer engaged againſt the judgment; and it was obſerved, by thoſe who had formerly been charmed with my vivacious loquacity, that my underſtanding was impaired as well as my face, and that I was no longer qualified to fill a place in any company but a party at cards.</p>
                  <p>Though the negligence of the men was not very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when compared with vows and adoration, yet it was far more ſupportable than the inſolence of my own ſex. For the firſt ten months after my return into the world, I never entered a ſingle houſe, in which the memory of my downfall was not revived. At one place I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated on my eſcape with life; at another I heard of the benefits of early inoculation; by ſome I have been
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:035911_0113_1007BFE587ECE670"/>
told in expreſs terms, that I am not yet without my charms; others have whiſpered, at my entrance—This is the celebrated beauty. One told me of a waſh that would ſmooth the ſkin; and another offered me her chair that I might not front the light. Some ſoothed me with the obſervation that none can tell how ſoon her caſe may be my own; and ſome thought it proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me with mournful tenderneſs, formal condolence, and conſolatory blandiſhments.</p>
                  <p>Thus was I every day haraſſed with all the ſtratagems of well-bred malignity; yet inſolence was more tolerable than ſolitude, and I therefore perſiſted to keep my time at the doors of my acquaintance, without gratifying them with any appearance of reſentment or depreſſion. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that their exultation would in time vapour away; that the joy of their ſuperiority would end with its novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that I ſhould be ſuffered to glide along in my preſent form among the nameleſs multitude whom nature never intended to excite envy or admiration, nor enable to delight the eye or inflame the heart.</p>
                  <p>This was naturally to be expected, and this I began to experience. But when I was no longer agitated by the perpetual ardour of reſiſtance and effort of perſeverance, I found more ſenſibly the want of thoſe entertainments, which had formerly delighted me: the day roſe upon me without an engagement; and the evening cloſed in its natural gloom, without ſummoning to a concert or a ball. None had any care to find amuſements for me, and I had no power of amuſing myſelf. Idleneſs expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to melancholy, and life began to languiſh in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs indifference.</p>
                  <p>Miſery and ſhame are nearly allied. It was not without many ſtruggles that I prevailed on myſelf to confeſs my uneaſineſs to Euphemia, the only friend who had never pained me with comfort or with pity. I at laſt laid my calamities before her, rather to eaſe my heart than to receive aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We muſt diſtinguiſh, (ſaid ſhe) my Victoria, thoſe evils which are impoſed by Providence, from thoſe to which we ourſelves give the power of hurting us. Of your calamity, a ſmall part is the infliction of Heaven,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:035911_0113_1007BFE587ECE670"/>
the reſt is little more than the corroſion of idle diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. You have loſt that which may indeed ſometimes contribute to happineſs, but to which happineſs is by no means inſeparably annexed. You have loſt what the greater part of the human race never have poſſeſſed; what thoſe on whom it is beſtowed for the moſt part poſſeſs in vain; and what you, while it was your's, knew not how to uſe: you have only loſt early what the laws of nature forbid you to keep long, and have loſt it while your mind is yet flexible, and while you have time to ſubſtitute more valuable and more durable excellencies. Conſider yourſelf, my Victoria, as a being born to know, to reaſon, and to act: riſe at once from your dream of melancholy to wiſdom and to piety; you will find that there are other charms than thoſe of beauty, and other joys than the praiſe of fools.</q>

                     <p>Becauſe we cannot afford it, my dear. Your papa is not ſo rich, by a great deal as Sir Thomas; and if we were to lay out our money upon ſuch things, we ſhould not be able to procure food and raiment and other neceſſaries for you all.</p>

                     <speaker>Sally.</speaker>

                     <p>Sir Thomas had a large eſtate left him by his father, but your papa has little but what he gains by his own induſtry.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sally.</speaker>

                     <p>Do you not think that there are a great many people poorer than he, that are alſo very deſerving?</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, to be ſure. Don't you know what a number of poor people there are all around us, who have very few of the comforts we enjoy? What do you think of Plowman the labourer? I believe you never ſaw him idle in your life.</p>

                     <p>O, no! they are ſo dirty and ragged.</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
                     <p>They are, indeed, poor creatures! but I am afraid they ſuffer worſe evils than that.</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
                     <p>Why I am afraid they often do not get as much victuals as they could eat. And then, in winter, they muſt be half ſtarved for want of fire and warm cloathing. How do you think you could bear all this?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sally.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed I don't know. But I have ſeen Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's wife carry great brown loaves into the houſe; and I remember once eating ſome brown bread and milk, and I thought it very good.</p>

                     <p>I believe you would not much like it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly: beſides, they can hardly get enough of that. But you ſeem to know almoſt as little of the poor as the young French Princeſs did.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
                     <p>Why there had been one year ſo bad a harveſt in France, that numbers of the poor were famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death. This calamity was ſo much talked of, that it reached the Court, and was mentioned before the young Princeſſes. Dear me! ſaid one of them, how ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that was! Why, rather than be famiſhed, I would eat bread and cheeſe. Her governeſs was then obliged to acquaint her, that the greateſt part of her father's ſubject's ſcarcely ever eat any thing better than black bread all their lives; and that vaſt numbers would now think themſelves very happy to get only their uſual pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that. Such wretchedneſs as this was what the Princeſs had not the leaſt idea of; and the account ſhocked her ſo much, that ſhe was glad to ſacrifice all her finery to afford ſome relief to the ſufferings of the poor.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sally.</speaker>
                     <p>But I hope there is nobody famiſhed in our country.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope not; for we have laws by which ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery perſon is entitled to relief from the pariſh, if he is unable to gain a ſubſiſtence; and were there no laws about it, I am ſure it would be our duty to part with every ſuperfluity rather than let a fellow-creature periſh for want of neceſſaries.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sally.</speaker>
                     <p>Then do you think it was wrong for Miſs Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton to have all thoſe fine things?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sally.</speaker>
                     <p>But why might ſhe not be contented with ſuch things as I have; and give the money that the reſt coſt to the poor?</p>

                     <speaker>Sally.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, I believe I am; for I remember Polly White was very glad of one of my old dolls; and Nancy Shape cried for ſuch a ſaſh as mine, but her mother would not let her have one.</p>

                     <p>Every thing ought to be ſuited to the ſtation in which we live, or are likely to live, and the wants and duties of it. Your papa and I do not grudge laying out part of our money to promote the innocent pleaſure of our children; but it would be very wrong in us to lay out ſo much on this account as would oblige us to ſpare in more neceſſary articles, as in their education, and the common houſehold expenſes required in our way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                     <p>It is the ſteady poſſeſſion of ourſelves in caſes of alarm, that prevents us from being flurried and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. You have heard the expreſſion of <hi>having all our wits about us.</hi> This is the effect of preſence of mind, and
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:035911_0117_1007BFEFF4CCFBA8"/>
a moſt ineſtimable quality it is; for without it, we are full as likely to run into danger as to avoid it. Do you not remember of hearing of your couſin Mary's cap taking fire in the candle?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>O yes, very well.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, the maid, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw it, ſet up a great ſcream, and ran out of the room; and Mary might have been burnt to death for any aſſiſtance ſhe could give her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>How fooliſh that was.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. The girl had not the leaſt preſence of mind, and the conſequence was, depriving her of all recollection, and making her entirely uſeleſs. But as ſoon as your aunt came up, ſhe took the right method for preventing the miſchief. The cap was too much on fire to be pulled off, ſo ſhe whipped a quilt from the bed, and flung it round Mary's head, and thus ſtifled the flame.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>Mary was a good deal ſcorched, though.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; but it was very well that it was no worſe. If the maid, however, had acted with any ſenſe at firſt, no harm at all would have been done, except burning the cap. I remember a much more fatal example of the want of preſence of mind. The miſtreſs of a family was awakened by flames burſting through the wainſcot into her chamber. She flew to the ſtair-caſe; and, in her confuſion, inſtead of going up ſtairs to call her children, who ſlept together in the nurſery over-head, and who might all have eſcaped by the top of the houſe, ſhe ran down, and, with much danger, made way through the fire into the ſtreet. When ſhe had got thither, the thought of her poor children ruſhed into her mind, but it was too late; the ſtairs had caught fire, ſo that nobody could get near them, and they were burned in their beds!</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>Sad, indeed! Now I will tell you of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conduct. A lady was awakened by the crackling of fire, and ſaw it ſhining under her chamber floor. Her huſband would immediately have opened the door, but ſhe prevented him, ſince the ſmoke and flame would then have burſt in upon them. The children, with a maid,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:035911_0117_1007BFEFF4CCFBA8"/>
ſlept in a room opening out of theirs. She went and awakened them; and, tying together the ſheets and blankets, ſhe ſent down the maid from the window firſt, and then let down the children, one by one, to her; laſt of all ſhe deſcended herſelf. A few minutes after the floor fell in, and all the houſe was in flames.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>What a happy eſcape!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; and with what cool recollection of mind was it managed! For mothers to love their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and be willing to run any hazards for them, is common; but in weak minds that very love is apt to prevent exertions in time of danger. I have heard a remarkable ſtory of the mother of that Mr. Day who wrote <hi>Sanford and Merton.</hi> She was diſtinguiſhed, as he ſo was, for courage and preſence of mind. When a young woman, ſhe was one day walking in the fields with a companion, when they perceived a bull coming to them, roaring and toſſing about his horns in the moſt tremendous manner.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>O, how I ſhould have ſcreamed!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>I dare ſay you would; and ſo did her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. But ſhe bid her walk away behind her as gently as ſhe could, whilſt ſhe herſelf ſtopt ſhort, and faced the bull, eyeing him with a determined countenance. The bull, when he had come near, ſtopt alſo, pawing the ground and roaring. Few animals will attack a man who ſteadily waits for them. In a while, ſhe drew back ſome ſteps, ſtill facing the bull. The bull followed. She ſtopt, and then he ſtopt. In this manner, ſhe made good her retreat to the ſtile over which her companion had before got. She then turned and ſprung over it, and got clear out of danger.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>That was bravely done indeed! but I think very few women could have done as much.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>Such a degree of cool reſolution, to be ſure, is not very common. But I have read of a lady in the Eaſt-Indies who ſhewed, at leaſt, as much. She was ſitting out of doors with a party of pleaſure, when they were aware of a huge tyger that had crept through a hedge near them, and was juſt ready to make his fatal ſpring. They were ſtruck with the utmoſt conſternation;
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:035911_0118_1007BFF2BB331B08"/>
but ſhe, with an umbrella in her hand, turned to the tyger, and ſuddenly ſpread it full in his face. This unuſual aſſault ſo terrified the beaſt, that taking a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious leap, he ſprung over the fence, and plunged out of ſight into the neighbouring thicket.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, that was the boldeſt thing I ever heard of. But is it poſſible, mamma, to make one's ſelf coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
                     <p>Courage, my dear, is of two kinds; one the gift of nature, the other of reaſon and habit. Men have naturally more courage than women; that is, they are leſs affected by danger; it make a leſs impreſſion upon them, and does not flutter their ſpirits ſo much. This is owing to the difference of their bodily conſtitution; and, from the ſame cauſe, ſome men and ſome women are more courageous than others. But the other kind of courage, may, in ſome meaſure, be acquired by every one. Reaſon teaches us to face ſmaller dangers, in order to avoid greater, and even to undergo the greateſt, when our duty requires it. The courage of women is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tried in domeſtic dangers. They are attendants on the ſick and dying; and they muſt qualify themſelves to go through many ſcenes of terror, in theſe ſituations, which would alarm the ſtouteſt hearted man, who was not accuſtomed to them.</p>

                     <speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
                     <p>I have heard that women generally bear pain and illneſs better than men.</p>

                     <p>I hope not. It was for that purpoſe I made you ſtand by me. And I would have you always force yourſelf to look on and give aſſiſtance in caſes of this kind, however painful it may at firſt be to you, that you may, as ſoon as poſſible, gain that preſence of mind which ariſes from habit.</p>

                     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                     <p>Very true, mamma, but I was ſo ſure of your liking her company, that I thought it no harm to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with ceremony for this time.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady D.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you give the name of ceremony to your duty? this ſhews you as heedleſs as uſual: but the young lady's behaviour has not that reſerve or diſcretion that I could wiſh in the perſon whom you deſire to make your friend. I think ſhe ſhould have waited for my invitation.</p>

                     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, ſhe was ſo impatient to pay you her reſpects—you cannot think how highly ſhe ſpeaks of you.</p>

                     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, that interview was enough to form her opinion of you. She has drawn ſo favourable a picture of your good qualities, that I ſhall always be proud of having ſuch a mother.</p>

                     <p>Perhaps you are joking, and yet ſhe was almoſt tempted to chide me for having too much. However, ſhe agreed at the laſt, that diffidence was more neceſſary to me than another, to diſarm the envy of ſuch as do not poſſeſs equal accompliſhments.</p>

                     <p>Only twice with the Miſs Delmores, at their houſe. She has a great deal of friendſhip for them, but they do not ſeem ſufficiently to return it.

                     <p>Becauſe they have ſometimes taken upon them to find little defects in me, which however I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf do not belong to me. I ſhould ſuppoſe them to be ſomething envious.</p>

Yes, my dear, we are now reunited forever. I perceived your ſurpriſe at ſeeing me treat Miſs Bland with ſo much freedom and ſeeming incivility; but you know that all my happineſs is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in you; judge then of my feelings, when I ſaw it ſo near being embittered by her ſeducing arts. You have as yet no idea of the unhappy condition of a woman, who is early ſpoiled by flattery. Coming into the world with pretenſions that nothing can juſtify, and an opinion of her own merit, in which nobody elſe joins her, what mortifications muſt ſhe experience! As to the homage ſhe expected, the more her pride exacts it, the more ſhe finds it withheld, and the ſneer of contempt ſupply its place. If, blinded as ſhe is by ſelf-opinion, a tranſient ray of reflection ſhould enlighten her for a moment, and ſhew her the true ſtate of herſelf, what ſhame muſt ſhe feel on finding herſelf deſtitute of a claim to thoſe qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, which ſhe imagined herſelf to poſſeſs, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret at having loſt the opportunities of acquiring them! On what ſhould ſhe, for the future, found her pretenſions to public eſteem, to the love of her huſband, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of her family? To ſtifle the reproaches of her mind as well as the troubleſome conſciouſneſs of her own want of merit, ſhe can ſuffer none about her, but deſpicable flatterers of the ſame ſtamp with thoſe, who firſt corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her underſtanding; and to crown her diſgrace, while ſhe contemns them, ſhe feels herſelf worthy of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Irritated by all theſe mortifications, ſhe is ſtill farther tortured at the ſight of deſert in another, even in her own children. If ſhe diſtinguiſhes any by her regard, it is thoſe whom ſhe has tutored to a ſervile compliance with her folly; and thus ſhe is condemned to the crime of corrupting their veracity, in order to make them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Even the flatterers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect her, even the envious receive her with a ſmile. By modeſtly yielding to her rivals all that they aſſume, ſhe takes the ſureſt way to gain a ſuperiority over them. She ſeems to appear every day with a conſtant addition of good qualities, as the eſteem which ſhe inſpires puts peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon finding new graces in her character. Aſſiſted by the advice of her friends, which her diffidence induces her to accept, ſhe is beloved by them as the creature of their good wiſhes. The homage addreſſed to her, from all quarters, enhances her value in the eyes of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who therefore ſtudies to become more worthy of her affection by his conſtancy and attention. Her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren nouriſhed by her virtues, look up to no other pattern; and indeed the experience of her own ſucceſs will make her the more proper to direct their education. She will be able to qualify them for the happineſs which ſhe herſelf enjoys.

But as to a beggar, it's quite another thing; he comes and aſks me for money; but what has be to ſhow for it? what does he bring me in exchange? why a long ſtory that he i'n't worth a penny! what's that to me? nothing at all.

                     <l>There liv'd a nymph, the pride of all the grove,</l>
                     <l>A lovely nymph, adorn'd with ev'ry grace,</l>
                     <l>An eaſy ſhape, and ſweetly blooming face;</l>
                     <l>Fanny the damſel's name, as chaſte as fair,</l>
                     <l>Each virgin's envy, and each ſwain's deſpair:</l>
                     <l>To charm her ear the rival ſhepherds ſing,</l>
                     <l>Blow the ſoft flute, and wake the trembling ſtring:</l>
                     <l>For her they leave their wand'ring flocks to rove,</l>
                     <l>Whilſt Fanny's name reſounds thro' ev'ry grove,</l>
                     <l>And ſpreads on ev'ry tree, inclos'd in knots of love;</l>
                     <l>As Fielding's now, her eyes all hearts inflame,</l>
                     <l>Like her in beauty, as alike in name.</l>

                     <l>The ſultry weather o'er her cheeks had ſpread</l>

                     <l>And ſuck'd in poiſon at the dang'rous ſight:</l>
                     <l>He ſighs, he burns; at laſt declares his pain,</l>
                     <l>But ſtill he ſighs, and ſtill he woos in vain;</l>

               <head>CONCLUSION. A SHORT SYSTEM OF VIRTUE AND HAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PINESS.</head>
               <p>I WILL ſuppoſe a virtuous young lady form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her mind the principles of her future conduct, and uttering the reſult of her reflections in the following ſolil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oquy.</p>
               <p>"At the time when I am approaching to maturity of reaſon, I perceive myſelf placed in a world abounding with external objects, and I alſo perceive within me fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties and paſſions formed to be powerfully excited by them. I am naturally tempted to interrogate myſelf, What am I? Whence came I? and, Whither am I going?</p>
               <p>"With a view to ſatisfy my own inquiries, I conſider others who appear to be juſt like myſelf; I liſten to the inſtruction of thoſe who are older and wiſer than I am; and I examine, with ſerious attention, the volumes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration.</p>
               <p>"The reſult of the whole inquiry is a ſincere convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I am placed here to perform many duties; that I originate from a ſupreme Creator; and that I am going on in the journey of life, to accompliſh ſome of his gracious purpoſes at the cloſe of it, as well as in its progreſs.</p>
               <p>"I divide my duty into three parts, according to the ſuggeſtions of my own reaſon, and the inſtruction of books. They conſiſt of the obligations which I owe to myſelf, to others, and to him, in whoſe hands are both they and I, the great Lord of the univerſe.</p>
               <p>"With reſpect to myſelf, as I conſiſt of two parts, a body and a mind, my duty to myſelf divides itſelf into two parts alſo. My body is a machine curiouſly organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, and eaſily deranged by exceſs and irregularity. When diſturbed in its economy, it ſubjects me to pain,
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:035911_0161_1007C0600796BFC0"/>
and diſables me from all neceſſary and pleaſant exertion. I owe it therefore to myſelf to live a regular, orderly, and induſtrious life; neither to turn night into day, by keeping late hours, nor to enter into gaming, which keeps the paſſions conſtantly irritated; not to indulge in eating or drinking to exceſs, nor to give myſelf up to ſloth and indolence, which would unnerve every faculty of the mind, and prevent my making a progreſs in any virtuous or laudable purſuits. I further learn from the religion of my country, that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit: conſequently it is my duty to live according to the ſtricteſt rules of chaſtity and virtue; a violation of which is not only injuring myſelf, but alſo ſinning againſt my great Creator.</p>
               <p>"But I have a mind alſo capable of great improvement by culture, or of becoming vain, fooliſh, and ſtupid, by neglect. I will not loſe any of the advantages of my education. I will not waſte my time in reading novels, which ſerve either to corrupt the mind, or to convey falſe ideas of life and manners. But I will devote my leiſure hours to reading books of real inſtruction, and to reflection; for whatever tends to improve the mind, tends alſo to ſweeten the temper and refine the manners.</p>
               <p>"My mind as well as my body is concerned in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every kind of intemperance. Senſual indulgencies debaſe and corrupt the mind. Their delights are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, their pains ſevere, and of long duration.</p>
               <p>"Inexperienced youth is ſurrounded with temptations. I will fly from the conflict in which my own paſſions would fight againſt me, and perhaps betray me to the enemy. I will pray to be delivered from temptation; for alas! I am too much inclined to vice, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of my nature, and the violence of my paſſions. But I will not be a recluſe. The world abounds in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent enjoyments, and the kind God of nature intended I ſhould taſte them; but moderation is eſſential to true pleaſure. My own experience, and the experience of mankind from their origin, has declared, that whenever pleaſure exceeds the bounds of moderation, it is not only highly injurious, but diſguſtful. In order to enjoy pleaſure, I ſee the neceſſity of devoting part of my time
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:035911_0161_1007C0600796BFC0"/>
to uſeful employments, becoming my ſex and ſituation. The viciſſitude is neceſſary to excite an appetite and give a reliſh. Nay, the very performance of neceſſary duties, is attended with a delightful ſatisfaction, which few of the moſt boaſted amuſements are able to confer.</p>
               <p>"While I take care of myſelf, of my health, of my improvement in morals and underſtanding, I will not harbour pride, or look down with ſuperciliouſneſs or ill-nature on thoſe who live, as it were, at random, and who acknowledge no other guide of their conduct but the ſudden impulſe of a temporary inclination. With all my improvements and endeavours, I ſhall ſtill feel imperfections enough to humble me. Candour and humility are ſome of the leaſt fallible marks of ſound ſenſe and ſincere virtue. I ſhall have ſufficient employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in correcting myſelf; nor ſhall I preſume to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure others, unleſs my duty renders it neceſſary. My duty to myſelf is, indeed, intimately connected with my duty to others. By preſerving the faculties of the mind and body, and by improving them to the utmoſt, I am enabled to exert them with effect in the ſervice of thoſe around me.</p>
               <p>"I am connected with others by the ties of conſanguin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and friendſhip, and by the common bond of partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame humanity. As a daughter, I ſhall be tender and dutiful; as a ſiſter, uniformly affectionate; as a wife, faithful and friendly; as a mother, kind and attentive; as one of the human kind, benevolent to all perſons in whatever circumſtances, and however ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from me by country or religion.</p>
               <p>"But univerſal benevolence muſt not be an inactive principle. If it proceed not to real beneficence, I fear it will have more in it of oſtentation than of ſincerity. I will then prove its ſincerity by doing good, and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of every kind, as far as my abilities allow me, and my influence extends.</p>
               <p>"But before I pretend to generoſity, I will be ſtrictly juſt. Truth ſhall regulate my words, and equity my actions. In all my intercourſe with ſociety, I will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollect that heavenly precept, of doing to others as I wiſh they ſhould do to me, and will endeavour to obey it.
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:035911_0162_1007C0619EDCCD78"/>
I may, I certainly ſhall offend from the violence of my paſſions, the weakneſs of my judgment, the perverſeneſs of my will, and from miſtake and miſapprehenſion. But while I keep the evangelical rule in view, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely labour to conform to it, I ſhall ſeldom commit ſuch offences againſt others, as will be either perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently or deeply injurious.</p>
               <p>"With reſpect to my duty to my Creator, I derive an argument in favour of religion, from the feelings of my own boſom, ſuperior to the moſt elaborate ſubtilties of human ingenuity. In the hour of diſtreſs, my heart as naturally flies for ſuccour to the Deity, as when hungry and thirſty I ſeek food and water; or when weary, repoſe. In religion I look for comfort, and in religion I always find it. Devotion ſupplies me with a pure and exalted pleaſure. It elevates my ſoul, and teaches me to look down with a proper contempt upon many objects which are eagerly ſought, but which end in miſery. In this reſpect, and in many others, it effects, in the beſt and moſt compendious method, what has been in vain pretended to by proud philoſophy.</p>
               <p>"And in ſelecting a mode or peculiar ſyſtem of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, I ſhall conſider what that was in which my anceſtors lived and died. I find it to have been the religion of Chriſt. I examine it with reverence. I feel within me an internal evidence, which, uniting its force with the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, forbids me to diſbelieve. When involuntary doubts ariſe, I immediately ſilence their importunity by recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the weakneſs of my judgment, and the vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of haſtily deciding on the moſt important of all ſubjects, againſt ſuch powerful evidence, and againſt the major part of the civilized world.</p>
               <p>"I will learn humility of the humble Jeſus, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept the beneficial doctrines, and glorious offers which his benign religion reaches out to all who ſincerely ſeek him by prayer and penitence.</p>
               <p>"Human life abounds with evil. I will ſeek balſams for the wounds of the heart, in the ſweets of innocence and in the conſolations of religion. Virtue, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, is the nobleſt ornament of humanity, and the ſource of the ſublimeſt and the ſweeteſt pleaſure; and
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:035911_0162_1007C0619EDCCD78"/>
piety leads to that peace, which the world, and all it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes cannot beſtow. When the gaudy glories of faſhion and of vain philoſophy ſhall have withered like a ſhort-lived flower, ſincere piety and true virtue ſhall flouriſh like the cedar of Lebanon. But I repreſs my triumphs. After all my improvements, and all my deſires of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I ſhall ſtill be greatly defective. Therefore, to whatever degree of excellence I advance, let me never forget to ſhew to others that indulgence which my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, my errors, and my voluntary miſconduct will require both from them, and from mine and their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and moſt merciful Father."</p>
