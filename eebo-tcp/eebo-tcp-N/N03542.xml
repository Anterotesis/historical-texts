            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO ſee the Diverſity of Men's Opinions and the many Cenſures that ſome caſt upon Truth, brought me to a ſerious Concern to appear in this manner, that, if poſſible, I might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to remove the Clouds of Prejudice from ſome Minds; and by ſpeaking intelligibly to Men of moderate Tempers and common Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citys, as much as in me lieth, to demonſtrate what I have clearly ſeen, to wit, <hi>CHRIST the Hope of Glory, the only means of Man's Salvation.</hi>

            <p>I have uſed as much Brevity as I could, with Clearneſs, in this little Piece, knowing there are many Books of the ſame Tendency wrote by Men of larger Gifts; yet as ſmaller Tracts are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Service, when bigger Volumes cannot eaſily be got: And as I have writ with Charity and Plainneſs, I hope it will be acceptable &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to my Readers; which with great Sincerity and Affection is the real Deſire of (Courteous Reader) Thy Souls Friend.</p>

            <p>ALTHOUGH many Books have been wrote on this Subject; yet I conceived the writing of this ſmall Tract to be my Duty: And have therefore caſt my Mite into the Treaſury.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with that heavenly Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> bears of Chriſt: <hi>In the Beginning was the Word,</hi> (here he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares where the Word was) <hi>and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> Here (he affirms what it is,) he further goes on to confirm the foregoing Words, <hi>The ſame,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was in the Beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made: In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi> John i. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>It was the Eternal Word which made all things, that upholds all things by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, who was with the Father before the World was made: For we find he was in the Beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing made that was made; in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004327_0004_100454FAB12C3608"/>
Hence it is plain, that CHRIST was and is the WORD of GOD, and the only Means of Man's Salvation. The holy Scriptures are a divine Declaration of him, his Work and Power, whoſe Work was with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both to make Man and ſave him. For although Man by his Diſobedience had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Wrath of God; yet he was pleaſed to provide a divine Mediator, who wrought with the Father for the Salvation of Men; and this was Chriſt the Eternal Word.</p>
            <p>This the holy Scriptures abundantly prove; for it was impoſſible for Man of himſelf to make an Attonement to God for the Sin he had committed in breaking his Command. Now, God in his great Mercy ſhewed his Love to Men thro' <hi>Chriſt, reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto them, but,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. Now, this Word of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, was Chriſt, was that Word that was the Mediator for Man, and it is that Word that is the Saviour of Man; 'tis this Word nigh in the Heart, that Man is to hear: <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things that are made, even his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1.20. Thus we may ſee the heavenly Harmony of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004327_0005_10045508163443E0"/>
holy Scriptures how they concur; and that Spirit and Power that gave them forth, brings Man to a right Underſtanding of them.</p>
            <p>Now, after Man had fallen by Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he was received into Mercy by the Means and Mediation of Chriſt; Life and Death was ſet before him, with this annexed to it, <hi>Chooſe Life, that both thou and thy Seed may live,</hi> Deut. 30.19. Man was created after the Image of God in Holineſs, but for his Tranſgreſſion incurred the Wrath of God; then he was made ſenſible he had ſinned; then he was afraid of that Divine Preſence he had before injoyed; and in that State it ſeemed meet to divine Wiſdom, to provide a Mediator, which was Chriſt the Eternal Word of God. Now, we find, that <hi>Adam</hi> after he ſell, ſought to hide himſelf from God; and had not God in infinite Mercy called unto him, he had been utterly loſt: But willing to bring Man to Repentance he called unto Adam, <hi>Adam where art thou</hi>? Now, <hi>Adam</hi> of himſelf could not come to a State of Repentance, neither could he fly from the Voice of the Lord, no; <hi>I heard thy Voice and was afraid, becauſe I was naked, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hid my ſelf. And he ſaid, Who told thee thou was naked? haſt thou eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded thee, Thou ſhouldeſt not eat</hi>? This was great Condeſcention thus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004327_0006_1004550B32CF4360"/>
the Caſe with <hi>Adam,</hi> thereby to open his Underſtanding and bring him to Repentance.</p>
            <p>The great Love of God to Mankind is alſo plainly ſhewn, in providing a Mediator to make Attonement for their Sins; for altho' Man's Diſobedience occaſioned his being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of Paradiſe, a Means of Reſtauration was provided for him; the Serpent who tempted him was curſed above every Beaſt of the Field, and the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> it was promiſed ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head. This promiſed <hi>Seed</hi> was <hi>CHRIST</hi>; and for this End did he make his Appearance unto Mankind through divers Diſpenſations. His Appearance to the holy Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> was in the ſimilitude of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and he gave to faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> a Sign and Seal of his Mercy, to wit, Circumciſion in the Fleſh, as a Type and Figure of what was to follow: Then followed the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> added becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, in order to bring Man near to the Lord; the Ceremonial Part of which ſtood in outward Obſervations, and were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative of what was to follow, as the Paſchal-Lamb, which was to be ſlain and the Blood to be ſprinkled on the People, ſignified, that it ſeemed meet to Divine Wiſdom, that no Attonement ſhould be made without Blood,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004327_0007_10045517E5BA7E38"/>
and the Burnt-Offerings made by Fire, typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the one Offering made by Chriſt for the Sins of the World. And Chriſt being come, the Subſtance of that Law, all Types and Figures in the Law were fulfilled in him; for <hi>Chriſt is the End of the Law, for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.4.</p>
            <p>Now, true Believers in Chriſt they ſee through the Law, that Chriſt came not to deſtroy it, but to fulfill it; and as it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, the Service of the Law is at an End: <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Sin in the Fleſh; that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4. This is enough, one would think, to ſatisfy all ſorts of Men profeſſing Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to forſake all outward Shadows, and come to Chriſt the Subſtance of all.</p>
            <p>For even under the Law, in Performance of the Service required in that Diſpenſation, the Upright in Heart with an Eye of Faith ſaw through the End of the Law, to wit, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was to follow; in this Faith they ſtood who were faithful in that Day, and it is the ſame in this: For that Spirit then that reſted in the bare Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of outward Performances, even that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004327_0008_1004551EBB144098"/>
denied him, when the Fulneſs of Time was come for his bleſſed Appearance to do his Father's Will in him. They would not receive, but preferred <hi>Barrabas</hi> a Robber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Saviour of the World; yet they were many of them learned knowing Men as to worldly Wiſdom, but the World by Wiſdom knows not God. This is the Caſe of many in this very Age, they will not receive him in his ſpiritual Appearance, no, no, that's too mean for them, they are too learned to come there: But, hear what Chriſt ſaith to the unbelieving Jews? <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the Son, hath everlaſting Life; and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Joh.3.36</p>
            <p>Now, the Jews who reſted in the outward Obſervation of the Law, not coming to the Subſtance of the Law, crucified him in the Fleſh; and the profeſſing Chriſtians that reſt in outward Obſervations and will not come to him, they crucify him in Spirit. Hear what Chriſt ſaith to the unbelieving Jews <hi>Ye ſent unto John,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and he bore Wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs unto the Truth; but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have greater Witneſs than that of John: For the Works which the Father hath given me to fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh, the ſame Works that I do, bear Witneſs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Witneſs of me: Ye have neither heard his Voice at any time, nor ſeen his Shape; and ye have not his Word abiding in you: For whom he hath ſent, him ye believe not. Ye ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which teſtify of me: And ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</hi> Further adding, <hi>I am come in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Name, and ye receive me not.</hi> Joh. 5. v. 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43. I have made this large Citation to open my Reader's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: Theſe Texts are ſo clear and full to the ſubject Matter I am upon, I think no Man can with Reaſon be diſſatisfied. Here Chriſt plainly and fully ſhews his Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Power, which was to bring Man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in ſhort, He that comes not to him, will never be ſaved by him; no, no: For his Invitation is, <hi>Come unto me all you that are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Now, there is nothing can lead to him but the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from him: For if the Performance of outward Things could have made Men perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, there had been no need of his being crucified for the Sins of the World; but in that they were imperfect in themſelves, he came and offered himſelf as a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, that, as he was lifted up upon the Croſs, he ſhould draw all Men after

him. <hi>Wherefore remember,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that ye being in time paſt Gentiles in the Fleſh, who are called Uncircumciſion by that which is called the Circumciſion in the Fleſh made by Hands; that at that time ye were without Chriſt, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the World: But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt. For he is our Peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the Middle-wall of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition between us; having aboliſhed in his Fleſh the Enmity, even the Law of Commandments, contained in Ordinances, for to make in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of twain, one new Man, ſo making Peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one Body by the Croſs, having ſlain the Enmity thereby: And came and preached Peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh: For through him we both have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi> Epheſ. 2. v. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>I think theſe Texts clearly demonſtrate the great Work he has done for Man, even from the Beginning down to this very Day: For he it was that made Peace, and he it is that makes Peace between God and Man; He it was that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Red Sea and through the Wilderneſs; he it was that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004327_0011_1004553EF82C5348"/>
ſtood between <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his choſen <hi>Iſrael</hi>; he it was that led them through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prove them and to try them; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he it was that brought them to the good Land, which, was a Figure of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> or Place of Reſt. And as the great Work of travelling from <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Land of Promiſe outwardly was compleated in time through Faith and Patience in them that continued faithful to the End, and as thoſe were ſaved by that divine Power they truſted in; ſo undoubtedly ſhall every one be in this Day, that retain their Integrity to God in the ſame Faith and Spirit that they did. But we find there were but few of that great Number which came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> entred into the good Land: For tho' they ſaw the mighty Works which were done for their Preſervation, ſuch was the Hardneſs of their Hearts, they daily provoked God to Wrath, in ſo much that he threatned to deſtroy them, and ſaid to his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> Now therefore, let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot againſt them; for I will conſume them; but I will make of thee a mighty People. But <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed unto the Lord his God to turn away his Wrath from his People; and the Lord heard his Prayer and ſpared them. Thus we ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> under the Law became a Mediator for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004327_0012_10045549D6311B48"/>
a lively Type and Figure of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the Goſpel, who ever lives to make Interceſſion for the Sins of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> made Interceſſion for the People under his Conduct; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the whole World, that all Men through him might be ſaved. And it is certain, that, as he ſhed his precious Blood for the Sins of the whole World, ſo all that will come and abide with him, ſhall be ſaved by him; as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the Ends of the Earth; for I am GOD, and there is none other,</hi> [or as ſome Tranſlations render it, <hi>none elſe,</hi> which is of the ſame Effect,] Iſai. XLV. 22. Here the Prophet directs Man to look unto him, and not to outward Obſervations: No, no; for his Meſſage was of another Tendency; theſe were as Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that paſſed away, they all directed to him, and centred in him. This I lay down for Chriſtian Doctrine, not to be confuted by the wiſe and learned in worldly Wiſdom: For it is not all the learned Men in the World by their Learning in Tongues and Books, can bring Men to the ſaving Knowledge of Chriſt; for <hi>Paul</hi> whilſt he followed human Learning, and fed upon the Leaves of the Tree of Knowledge, perſecuted the Church of Chriſt which were gathered by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004327_0013_1004554F3A3A8650"/>
of which; but when by that Spirit he was enlightned, not conſulting with Fleſh and Blood, he ſoon learned another Leſſon; it was then no more Book-Learning, but Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge he exhorted Men to, and that was Chriſt in them the Hope of Glory; here <hi>Paul</hi> centred, he was at his Journy's End, his Travel was to bring Men to Chriſt, this was the End of his Meſſage, he was not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel, which Goſpel is Chriſt the Power of God unto Salvation; this Goſpel teaches Men perfect Faith in Chriſt, there is no waveing, there is no running from one Place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, no; Chriſt is come the Hope of their Salvation, he it is they believe in, he it is they look unto, and by him they are ſaved. To multiply Words upon this Head is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for all Men profeſſing Chriſtianity will in Words own Chriſt Jeſus to be their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: This is a general Confeſſion Men make; but they will not come to him in that way he requires that they may be ſaved by him. He ſaith, <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth:</hi> This is the Way he directs Men to; then certainly if it be in Spirit &amp; Truth, Men muſt worſhip God; they muſt have a Meaſure of that Divine Spirit to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip withal, which leads from the Teaching
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004327_0014_1004555E1A378470"/>
that is meerly of Men, and out of the World from the Noiſe of Lo! here and Lo! there.</p>
            <p>Oh! how full is the World of Forms and Opinions! One admires one Form, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other another Form: But the Spirit of Truth leads out of empty Forms to Life and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; yea, into all Truth, as thoſe that are led by it do certainly know. It therefore behoves all to beware of a Spirit of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; for that bleſſed immaculate Lamb of God, when he was upon the Earth in that prepared Body his Father gave him to do his Will in, and who did the Works that no Man could do; yet ſuch was the Hardheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Unbelief of the Jews, they believed not in him, but ſaid, He hath a Devil, why hear ye he him? Others more moderate ſaid, Which of the Rulers hath believed on him? Bring this home to the Age we live in, and it runs too like a Parallel with many: For now, to ſpeak of the Light of Chriſt within Man for a Teacher, gives great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; his divine Revelations to Mankind are disbelieved by many Wiſe and Learned in worldly Wiſdom; many of them ſay, Revelation is ceaſed, Men muſt look to the Word of God and his Miniſters to be direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Way in which they are to go: And the holy Bible is what they call the Word of God, &amp; the learned Men in Tongues
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004327_0015_1004556448E05E90"/>
they call the Miniſters of Chriſt; although they never were ſent by Chriſt to preach the Goſpel. Now, this is the very Rock the Jews ſplit upon, when Chriſt came in the Fleſh; they had the Law and the Prophets, by which they had a Hiſtorical Belief of <hi>Moſes,</hi> reading of him in thoſe holy Writings, which directed them to believe in the bleſſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was to come, and of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was a lively Type and Figure: Yet, when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time was come, they rejected <hi>Chriſt,</hi> reſting in the formal Part of thoſe figurative Things, which pointed to him the Subſtance, and through the Hardneſs of their Hearts they crucified him, and ſaid, <hi>His Blood be on us and our Children.</hi> A dreadful thing indeed! that Man which was created a noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and bore the heavenly Image in his State of Innocency, ſhould fall ſo far below his Station!</p>
            <p>Now, what do they do better, that deny him in his ſpiritual Appearance, and cry, Revelation is ceaſed, our Miniſters tell us ſo; and ſure, they who are learned Men know better than we, therefore let us hear them; often making uſe of that Text, <hi>The Prieſt's Lips ſhall preſerve Knowledge.</hi> Under the Law it was ſo; but under the Goſpel-Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the high <hi>Prieſt</hi> and Biſhop of our Souls, and to him we muſt adhere.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004327_0016_1004556D5C0CA230"/>Now, from the foregoing Obſervations I hope it is plain, That Revelation is not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For if that be ceaſed, by what Spirit muſt Man learn to know his Duty? God gave Man in the Beginning his good Spirit to be a Leader, and there was no other way whereby he was led to God but that. But Man's rebelling againſt it incurred his Wrath to the diſobedient; this was the Caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall: Yet God through the Son of his Love extended his Mercy to Mankind, that by Repentance and Faith in him they might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Now, through all Ages of the World the Upright in Heart ſaw the Day of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and rejoyed therein. Time would ſail to enumerate what might be writ in Defence of the Truth I contend for. Should I trace the holy Scriptures throughout, it would ſwell to a large Volume; and I ſee no great Neceſſity for it: They are plain and clear in themſelves, and thoſe who are led by the Spirit of Truth may read them with Comfort; but thoſe that reject that Spirit, they are a Myſtery unto, and ſo will remain till they come to be led by it: For it is the Spirit of Truth that gave forth the Scriptures, which can only unſeal them and no other; and without this, neither learned nor unlearned can ever lead them to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004327_0017_1004557AC47E5848"/>Yet to confirm the foregoing, I ſhall add what the Wiſe Man ſays concerning Chriſt: <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the Beginning of his way before his Works of old: I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the Beginning, or ever the Earth was. When there were no Depths, I was brought forth; when there were no Fountains abounding with Water: Before the Mountains were ſettled, before the Hills was I brought forth; while as yet he had not made the Earth, nor the Fields, nor the higheſt part of the Duſt of the World: When he prepared the Heavens, I was there; when he ſet a Compaſs upon the Face of the Deep; when he eſtabliſhed the Clouds above; when he ſtrengthned the Fountains of the Deep; when he gave to the Sea his Decree, that the Waters ſhould not paſs his Commandment; when he appointed the Foundations of the Earth; then I was by him, as one brought up with him; and I was daily his Delight, rejoycing always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; rejoycing in the habitable part of his Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</hi> Prov. VIII. 22, to 31. Now, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of his Earth which he took Delight in, was Man, that he had made for a Purpoſe of his own Glory; he made him of the Duſt of the Earth, and breathed into him the Spirit of Life, and Man became a living Soul. This was the habitable Part of his Earth he took Delight to ſolace in; and a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004327_0018_1004558268363C38"/>
heavenly Solace it was to Man, whilſt he ſtood in the State he was created in: But falling through Tranſgreſſion, he loſt that heavenly Enjoyment, which is only renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again in Chriſt the Lamb of God, who never fell; and is the only Means of Man's Salvation. And ſeeing then he is the Means, let us come to him for the Effect. And the Way to come to him, is through the divine Influence of the Spirit of Grace, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Father and the Son, who are one. To confirm this my Aſſertion, I ſhall quote divers Texts of Scripture, ſufficient to prove it to Men of common Capacities.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with Chriſt's own Words: <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation, but is paſſed from Death unto Life,</hi> John V. 24. Here the Doctrine I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is ſo plain and intelligibly laid down by the Lip of Truth, that it needs no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall next add the Teſtimony of ſome of his Followers: The Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life: For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004327_0019_1004558D81E513B0"/>
might be ſaved,</hi> John III. 16, 17. Oh! the Harmony there is betwixt the Lamb of God and his Followers! 'Tis ſweetly Refreſhing to read thoſe holy Lines, by ſuch as are gathered unto Chriſt by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>My next Inſtance parallel to the Subject I am upon, to wit, <hi>CHRIST the Eternal WORD the only Means of Man's Salvation,</hi> is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Moſes deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, That the Man which doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them. But the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine Heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? (that is, to bring Chriſt down from above) or who ſhall deſcend into the Deep? (that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the Dead) But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, (that is, the Word of Faith which we preach) That if thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Rom. X. 5, to 9.</p>
            <p>Now, this is the Word which the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt preach, and exhort Men to; and this they do by the divine Influence of the Spirit of Grace, revealed unto them: For no Man can truly ſpeak or write of the Things of God but by the Inſpiration of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004327_0020_100455925CE216B8"/>
Spirit of Truth; for God is inacceſſible in his own pure Eſſence and Being, and cannot be approach'd to by Man, without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influence of a bleſſed Mediator, which is Chriſt the Hope of Glory to all them that believe. Such the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; but how did he preach? by human Learning only? no; for in that ſtate he perſecuted the Church of Chriſt: But he plainly tells us, how he came to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt; hear what he ſays: <hi>But I certify you, Brethren, that the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after Man: For I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Galat. I. 11, 12. My Reader may, if he pleaſeth, read the whole Chapter for further Information, where he treats of this Matter at large, as well as in many other Places in his Writings; of which for Brevity-ſake I ſhall inſtance but few; every one may read them with Profit, if they will follow the Spirit of Truth; and without that, their reading will do them no good: For if they reject the Fountain from whence good comes, how can they drink of the Streams of it? But to return to <hi>Paul's</hi> Account, how he came to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, hear his own Words: <hi>For this Cauſe I Paul the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of Jeſus Chriſt for you Gentiles; if ye
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004327_0021_1004559EDB1BDD78"/>
have heard of the Diſpenſation of the Grace of God, which is given me to you-ward: How that by Revelation he made known unto me the Myſtery, that I wrote afore in few Words</hi>; he yet goes on, <hi>whereby,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when ye read ye may underſtand my Knowledge in the Myſtery of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. III. 1, 2, 3, 4. Here <hi>Paul</hi> declares how he came to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, and tells the Cauſes to the Gentiles: Now, if Revelation be ceaſed, as many Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and learned Men have affirmed, how ſhall Men come to the Knowledge of God, ſince our bleſſed Lord ſays, <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no Man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Son will reveal him</hi>? Matth. XI. 27. Such evident Proof from the holy Writ, one would think were enough to convince all who gainſay it.</p>
            <p>Seeing then there is no other way to come to the Knowledge of God, but by Divine Revelation, it is a great Error in Men to deny that which is Eſſential to Salvation. This Error crept into the World ſince the Apoſtles Days, by going from the Spirit of Truth, and ſetting up Idols in its Place, like the Jews of old, who ſet up a Calf in the Wilderneſs, through which they were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing towards the good Land, and cryed,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004327_0022_100455D29CA27D78"/>
               <hi>Theſe be thy Gods, O Iſrael, that brought thee out of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, when Men's Hearts are gone from the Lord, they run into Idolatry, and ſet up ſomething in their own Will, to pleaſe their own Minds; and whilſt they continue in this impenitent State, to ſuch Revelation may ceaſe: For the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man</hi>; although God in his Mercy to Man (whom he created for a Purpoſe of his own Glory) gave him a Meaſure of his good Spirit to lead him, and invites all in the Son of his Love, ſaying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Now, it is certain, there is no greater Burthen than Sin, and no greater need of Reſt than to ceaſe from it; which is altogether impoſſible to be done, if Revelation be ceaſed: For <hi>no Man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him</hi>: This is confirmed by the Lip of Truth, and the whole World can never reverſe it. Now, how the Wiſe and Learned Men can ſtem the Current of this Teſtimony, I cannot ſee. If they deny Revelation, what Spirit muſt they learn of, to teach Men to come to Chriſt? For there is the Center of all Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and if Men deny the Way that leads
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004327_0023_100455E0F541C230"/>
to him, they will never come to him. <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004327_0025_1004129C32347678"/>The Way to come to a State of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is to learn of Chriſt through the divine Influence of his holy Spirit; none ever was converted to Chriſt but by it, nor ever will without it. And if People would come to ſit down under their own Vine and under their own Figg-Tree, they would not want an outward Prieſthood to teach them. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, <hi>It ſhall be in the laſt Days, that the Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed on the Top of the Mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it,</hi> Iſai. II. 2. The Prophet ſpeaks in general Terms, <hi>All Nations</hi>; then ſurely all Nations muſt have a Meaſure of the Spirit of Grace, to lead them to this Mountain; and who ſhall diſpenſe this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but the Fountain from whence it flods? Great and Learned Men by their Skill in Tongues cannot do it, no; they (many of them) direct Men to their learned Miniſters, Men who are skilled in Tongues and Books; but the Grace of God directs Men to Chriſt, who is the Giver of Divine Knowledge; for there is a ſaving Knowledge, and a Hiſtorical Knowledge, a Knowledge which ſaves the Soul, and a Knowledge which puffs up the Mind; and that Mind that is led by a wrong Spirit, is too apt to think it ſelf ſafe, and guards it ſelf with Natural Reaſon; but
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004327_0026_100455ECA9F14248"/>
ſaving Knowledge looks to its Center, from whence it came. Now, learned Men from Human Learning can never bring Men to ſaving Knowledge; no: We find <hi>Paul</hi> was a learned Man, and zealous in the way he was learned in; and in that learned Zeal perſecuted the Church of Chriſt: But when the Light ſhone round about him, as he journied to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the Viſion brought him to ſaving Knowledge; it was then no more outward Learning which he depended on, but <hi>Chriſt the Power of God unto Salvation.</hi> Oh! then he became a true Miniſter of Chriſt, and then he ſaw the Effect of the Miniſtry of Chriſt; he then ſaw, it was not limited to Time, nor Place, nor School-Learning, nor to preach for Hire by the Year, no; it was a free Miniſtry, freely received, and freely diſpenſed to Mankind.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, By this Man's writing we muſt have no Miniſters to teach us, nor have any Meetings of Worſhip to go to, but every Man is left to the Light of Nature to do as he pleaſes? This is the Way that ſome will argue; but there's nothing further from my Thoughts. For the Tendency of my Labour is, <hi>To bring Man to the Knowledge of God through Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; for <hi>that is Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</hi> I am not againſt Meetings of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to worſhip the true God in Spirit and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004327_0027_100455AD3997A700"/>
in Truth, nor am I againſt Miniſters, to preach or teach the People; but I would have them be taught by the Spirit of Chriſt ſo to do. Were this obſerved, we ſhould all be in Unity one with another; and 'tis the Want of this keeps us ſo wide apart, the more is the Pity. But the Satisfaction which would reſult from ſuch an Union, we are not yet come to, although much deſired by the honeſt-hearted. In all gatherings, where an uncharitable Opinion is let in, in any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, they loſe Ground from the Chriſtian Principle; for as Truth leads Men to Chriſt, ſo Conteſt and Debate in a wrong Spirit ſcatters from him. Men may toyl all Night about their Forms, and catch nothing till Daylight come, that they ſee Chriſt. Oh! he that told his Diſciples to caſt the Net on the right Side, muſt direct Men ſtill, or they may toyl all Night in vain: Forms and Shadows are but Night-work without the Life and Power. The one ſtands in Man's Will, the other in the Power of an endleſs Life. They that reſt in Forms, are like a troubled Sea; but thoſe who are in Chriſt, they are in Peace. Now, Chriſt has diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Grace to all Mankind, that thereby all the Ends of the Earth may look unto him, and be ſaved; this is the Effect of his great Love; it is expreſſed in general Terms
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004327_0028_100455F74F07EE50"/>
to all; none are exempted from him that will come to him. And bleſſed be the Lord, he has raiſed up a Miniſtry and People to bear a Teſtimony to his Name, which the World can neither refute nor confound, who have been like Trumpets to the Nations, by whom many have been awakened out of that drowſy Eaſe they were in, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and converted. And if Men would come to hear Truth, and not ſit down at Eaſe with ſlumbering Eyes, half awake and half aſleep, there would not be ſuch Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt Men as there is, nor ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt as there is, running after Lo! here, and Lo! there. Theſe being abroad, loſe the Bleſſing, for want of being at home: But my Counſel is to ſuch, Retire and repair home, before your Sands of Time be run, before the Midnight-cry be come upon you. Oh! remember, at that Time there is none can enter in, but thoſe who have Oyl in their Lamps: It was ſo in the Parable, and ſo it will undoubtedly be. Oh! then where will all your empty Forms be? For want of Oyl your Lamps will go out; 'twill be too late then to buy or borrow, and the Wiſe will not have to ſpare. Be perſwaded then to take hold of Mercy in the Day of Mercy, and here improve your Time whilſt 'tis to Day; cloſe with the Offers of his Love,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004327_0029_100455FDB8958CC8"/>
whilſt Mercy is extended to you, before the Sun be ſet upon you, and the Curtains of the Night be drawn. Oh! remember, in the Grave there is no Repentance; 'tis here in Time ye muſt return, or elſe ye are loſt for ever. Oh! trifle not with Eternity, nor ſlight the Day of your Viſitation: Deſpiſe not the Reproofs of Inſtruction, but hear them, leſt Darkneſs overtake you. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what a woful State that is; for he that walketh in Darkneſs knoweth not whither he goes. Oh! then prize the bleſſed Light and walk in it; it will lead you in the Way to Peace: Deſpiſe it not to your own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; for that will comprehend your Darkneſs, and your wonted ſcoffs againſt it, will vaniſh away. Oh! remember theſe Things, whilſt here you have Time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them in.</p>
            <p>Oh! what was it that ſtrengthned <hi>Daniel,</hi> and gave him Power to ſtand ſo valiantly for his God, but the Influence of that divine Spirit I have been ſpeaking of? He feared not the evil Counſellors, nor the King's Rage; he matter'd not their Images, nor all their threatning Tortures; he would not bow down to any but the true God, no, neither the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage nor the Beaſt could deceive him; he ſaw the little Stone cut out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without Hands, which broke the Image
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004327_0030_100454D5812C4EE8"/>
and all his Compounds. And that Stone which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw, is able to break all the Images in our Days; and thoſe that are led by the Spirit of Truth, ſee the Image when it is ſet up, and by that Spirit they fear it not, nor bow down to it; but thoſe that are not led by that Spirit that <hi>Daniel</hi> was, will ſooner bow than go to the Lion's Den: But I would have all to truſt in that God that <hi>Daniel</hi> did, and they ſhall be preſerved as he was.</p>
            <p>Divers Inſtances might be brought out of the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> to corroborate this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and to ſhew how zealous and faithful they were to their Teſtimony in their Days; Fire and Faggot were trying Things ſurely, and they muſt have had ſomething more than Human Learnings or Notional Forms to ſupport them, or they could not have ſtood the Tryal of that Day; they were led by that Spirit that <hi>Daniel</hi> was, no doubt, and that ſupported them as it did him, and enabled them to refuſe the worſhip of Images in their Day, and to offer their Bodies living Sacrifices to God. Now, bring this home to this Age we live in, and ſee how remiſs too too many are in their Duty to God, that have known a Day of good Things: Oh! how does Pride abound in this Land in too too many! Well, let ſuch know that Duſt and Worms will be their Portion, and their

haughty Spirit will ſome Time be brought low.</p>
            <p>But to return the holy <hi>Martyrs,</hi> Hiſtory informs us, That <hi>Richard Woodman,</hi> a valiant Martyr, his firſt Examination before one of the dark <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops in thoſe Days, was as followeth:</p>

               <p>Here we may ſee, how valiant the Martyr was for the Truth, which he had learned through the Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004327_0034_100412C1AB0D5108"/>
which Grace led him into all Truth; and that Grace and Spirit ſupported him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphingly through all thoſe fiery Trials. But hear yet further this holy Man, what a Godly Zeal he had for God in his Day: <hi>No Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can believe that Jeſus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt: For he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, is none of his.</hi> And again, <hi>We have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father; the ſame Spirit certifieth us that we are the Sons of God.</hi> Alſo <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not, that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is an Antichriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth both the Father and the Son:</hi> Further adding, <hi>And he that believeth in God, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi>

                  <hi>Julius Palmer</hi> at <hi>Newberry,</hi> before Doctor <hi>Jeffries,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and others, gives this Account of his Faith and Hope in the Lord, being enabled by the Spirit of Truth ſo to do. After many needleſs Queſtions put to him, he anſwered very boldy in the Lord:</p>
               <p>I know, that of my ſelf I am able to do nothing; yet if you and all mine Enemies ſhould do your worſt, you ſhall not be able to bring that to paſs, [meaning to bring him to their Superſtition] neither ſhall you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt God's mighty Spirit, by which we underſtand the Truth, and ſpeak it ſo boldly.</p>

               <p>Ah! are you full of the Spirit? Are you inſpired with the Holy Ghoſt?</p>

               <speaker>Jul. Palmer.</speaker>
               <p>No Man can believe but by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if I were not a ſpiritual Man and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with God's Holy Spirit, I were not a true Chriſtian; he that hath not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, is none of his.</p>

               <speaker>Palmer.</speaker>
               <p>Chriſt hath promiſed not only to give us Store of Words neceſſary, but with them ſuch Force of Matter, as the Gates of Hell ſhall not be able to confound or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it.</p>

               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>Chriſt made ſuch a Promiſe to his Apoſtles; you will not compare with them.</p>

               <speaker>Palmer.</speaker>
               <p>With the Apoſtles I may not compare; but this I am certain pertaineth to all ſuch as are appointed to defend God's Truth againſt his Enemies, in the time of their Perſecution for the ſame.</p>

               <speaker>Palmer.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I am right well aſſured that it pertaineth unto me; as it ſhall appear, if you will give me Leave to diſpute with you before this Audience, in the Defence of all that I have there written.</p>

               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>Thou art but a beardleſs Boy, ſtart up Yeſterday out of the Schools; and dareſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004327_0036_1004561CAE22CA80"/>
thou preſume to offer Diſputation, or to encounter with a Doctor?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Palmer.</speaker>
               <p>Remember Mr. Doctor, <hi>The Spirit breatheth where it pleaſes,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Out of the Mouth of Babes</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe Things from the Wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. God is not tied to Time, Wit, Learning, Place, nor Perſon. Thus far that worthy Martyr <hi>Palmer.</hi> And had the Envy of that Age thought on it, might have branded him for a <hi>Quaker,</hi> with many more of thoſe who were faithful in their Day; divers of whom, according to the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> preached againſt <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Swearing upon a Book,</hi> and that ſome worthy <hi>Women preached,</hi> who were joyned to Chriſt's little Flock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agnes Aſhford,</hi> being one of the ſaid People, for preaching theſe Words following, was articled againſt, viz. <hi>We be the Salt of the Earth; if it be putrified and vaniſhed away, it is nothing worth: A City upon a Hill may not be hid: Ye light not a Candle and put it under a Buſhel, but ſet it on a Candleſtick, that it may give a Light to all in the Houſe: So ſhine your Light before Men, that they may ſee your Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And further ſhe did teach, ſaying, <hi>Jeſus ſeeing his People, as he went up a Hill, was ſet, and his Diſciples came to him, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his Mouth and taught them, ſaying, Bleſſed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004327_0037_100412C6589D1238"/>
be the poor Men in Spirit; for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs: Bleſſed be the mild Men; for they ſhall rule the Earth.</hi> For teaching this Doctrine, the Biſhop ſtrictly enjoyned and commanded her to teach no more Leſſons to any Men, eſpecially to her Children.</p>
               <p>Many more might be inſtanced out of the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which I omit for Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſake, which ſhewed their Chriſtian Zeal, and what Spirit they were led by, how the the Doctrine they taught agrees with the Doctrine of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in this Day. For let Men draw up what Forms they will, and make what Shew of Worſhip they will; till they come to know Chriſt to be their Teacher through the divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Holy Spirit of Grace which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Father and the Son, they worſhip but an Image, a Shadow in ſtead of a Subſtance.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>So this I do affirm and lay down for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, <hi>CHRIST JESUS which was with the Father before the World was, by whom all Things were made, this is the WORD we muſt hear, this is the Teacher we muſt learn of.</hi> 'Tis not the Forms Men can make will bring the Soul true Peace, no, 'tis nothing but that WORD that gave it a Being can give it Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:004327_0038_1004562F313B3DB0"/>Now, if Men would come to be led by the Spirit of Truth, they would ſoon leave off Contention, and be of the <hi>Woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria's</hi> Mind, <hi>Come ſee a Man that told me all that ever I did:</hi> Is not this the <hi>Chriſt</hi>? Here ſhe was touch'd with a lively Senſe by the divine Influence of the Holy Spirit; and her Fellow-Citizens when they heard the ſame Chriſt, they came to be of the ſame Mind ſhe was of; their Eyes were then no more to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> no more to the Mount; no, a Saviour was come, and him they believed in. Oh! then the Angel of his Preſence was come; Oh! then the Fountain was open; <hi>Drink, and thirſt no more:</hi> Oh! bleſſed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, O! heavenly Solace! what would Man have more? O! that Men would prize the Mercy offered to them in this the Day of his Love, and come to drink of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſprings up to Eternal Life; and not break their own Peace by chuſing Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than Light, which leads to the Chambers of Death.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Friendly Reader,</hi> thou haſt a Soul to ſave, or to loſe, and Life and Death is ſet before thee; a Saviour is nigh unto all, that all may be ſaved by him; there's none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted that will come to him: And in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that thou mayſt come to him, he has given thee a Meaſure of his good Spirit to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004327_0039_100412CD9C2C5760"/>
lead thee: This it is thy Duty to hear, to follow, and to obey: It proceeded from him, and it will lead to him. Time would fail to ſay all that might be ſaid or writ on this Subject, to wit, <hi>CHRIST the Teacher of his People.</hi> And there are many Volumes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant wrote by worthy Men, who are gone to their Reſt, and whoſe Works follow them, whoſe Memory is dear to Poſterity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall draw to a Concluſion, greatly deſiring all the Inhabitants of this Land may prize the Day of Mercy while it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>To Day.</hi> You have enjoyed great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings beyond many Nations: You have had the Angel of his Preſence to ſurround you, when many have been involved in Blood: Have a Care you don't incur his Wrath upon you by your Diſobedience; for he is a God of Juſtice as well as of Mercy. My honeſt Caution can do no Harm, if it finds no Room in the Crowd of worldly Minds.</p>
            <p>So to CHRIST the WORD nigh in the Heart I recommend my <hi>Reader</hi>; there's no other Way will bring the Soul to Peace: And ſhall conclude this little Piece with the <hi>Supplication</hi> following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND now, O LORD, if it ſtands good with thy Divine Will, cauſe thou the Light of thy Countenance to ſhine upon the Children of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004327_0040_100455CF4C264A60"/>
Men, whom thou haſt created for a Purpoſe of thy Glory: Let the Sun of thy Love ariſe and ſhine more and more upon them, that they may ſee the Day of their Redemption, and thereby livingly come to praiſe thee. And thoſe that are in Darkneſs and Hardneſs of Heart, O LORD enlighten their Underſtandings, and tender their hard Hearts, in Order to their Salvation. Keep thoſe that are in thy Way to the End of their Pilgrimage: And thoſe who are wandring from thy Pold, do thou be pleaſed to bring Home, that they may come to worſhip thee the true GOD in thy own Way. Grant this, O LORD, to the Children of Men, in and through thy dearly beloved Son, our bleſſed LORD and dear Redeemer JESUS CHRIST. To whom with thee be all Glory and Honour aſcribed now and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
