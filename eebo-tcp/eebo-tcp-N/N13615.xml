            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE attributes of Deity ſhine gloriouſly in all his works, in the whole frame of nature, in the courſe of providence, and moſt gloriouſly of all in the wonders of redeeming love.—The living and true God is clearly diſplayed on every ſide, and we can turn our eyes or our attention no where, but we may behold him; the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament his handy work; the ſun when "he goes forth as a bridegroom from his chamber, and rejoiceth as a ſtrong man to run his race;" "the moon walking in brightneſs;" the ſtars in all their courſes, the earth with all its vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous productions, "the great and wide ſea, in which are things innumerable both ſmall and great:" All theſe diſplay Jehovah's glory, and according to their various natures and ſtations, bear teſtimony for him, and praiſe his adored name. The language
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017190_0003_0FA077DC0722C070"/>
of nature is univerſal and intelligible to all that have minds to underſtand, "there is no ſpeech nor language where their voice is not heard." And if we conſider any particular creature in the great family of the Moſt High (for he is parent of all) we may behold much of the power, wiſdom and goodneſs of the Creator diſcovered in that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual. Attend, for inſtance, to the formation of man, his very body, the mortal, the inferior part is "fearfully and wonderfully made, and curiouſly wrought," it bears the natural image of Deity; and the ſpiritual, immortal part, the living ſoul allied to angels, and the father of angels, diſcovers yet more of the perfections of the univerſal parent, even his moral, as well as natural image, in its primeval ſtate.</p>
            <p>The human body is the well choſen emblem which the great apoſtle keeps in his eye, in my text and context; and that with a view to illuſtrate the importance of health, order and ſympathy, with due ſymmetry and ſubordination in the myſtic body of Chriſt, that is, his beloved church in the world; and no paſſage of ſacred ſcripture would more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lead into a proper diſcourſe on that ſubject: But as I mean now to ſpeak concerning the various duties of the body politic, from this text, my war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is a full parity of reaſon; the emblem in my text is juſt as fitly adapted to the one caſe as the other. Order and harmony, ſymmetry and due proportion, ſubordination, mutual care and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in church and ſtate, are equally neceſſary for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017190_0004_0FA077DD52CD27F8"/>
the good of each, equally beautiful and beneficial; and if theſe are wanting in either, diſtempers will ſeize on the body, pain will enſue, much diſorder will ariſe, and deſtruction or diſſolution may be the fatal iſſue.</p>
            <p>Therefore, now beloved, favor me with your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, while I ſhall attempt to diſplay the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a ſtate or nation, under the ſimilitude of the human body in health and perfection, and the miſery of a commonwealth, from oppoſite conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>How much of the divine wiſdom, power and goodneſs is ſeen in the formation of the human ſtructure? How uſeful? How beautiful? How complete in every part? We deſire not a member more than we have, and we are very averſe to the loſs of any one, though it be the leaſt. What ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and proportion do we obſerve? What mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual harmony and ſympathy? What convenience in the location and office of every limb and every member? We could not be willing to have one organ, limb or member placed any where in the body but where it is; we could not be willing to have one more or one leſs than we have; we would by no means have any one of our members, organs of limbs take the place of any other pertaining to the human body. How loth ſhould we be to have our head's placed in our breaſt's, or where our legs or feet are, or any where except where they are, above the body and all the members? How ſad ſhould we think it to have our legs and arms change place with each other? Or to have our toes
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017190_0005_0FA077DD87A5A058"/>
on our hands and our fingers on our feet: Or were we to walk on our heads, we ſhould find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very miſerable: Were our eyes and mouths placed on the oppoſite ſide of our heads, or in the body ſomewhere below, we ſhould be frightful monſters in our own view. We cannot think of the leaſt alteration in the number and ſituation of any of our members, but what would much diſpleaſe us. God has formed and arranged the whole in his own infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, and all is right, perfectly right; and well might the great Creator ſay of his own work, as it came out of his own hands, <hi>All is very good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every part, organ, limb and member of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body act in perfect union and concert, guided and actuated by the ſame ſoul, the ſame will; all the parts aſſiſt one another in the performance of every action; all are fed by the ſame vital nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have the ſame care one of another, and as the apoſtle in the context moſt elegantly deſcribes it, "Whether one member ſuffers all the members ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with it, or if one member be honored all the members rejoice with it." Every part of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body finds and feels the need of every other part; the hand can by no means ſay to the foot, or the foot to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor can the eyes, or mouth or ears ſay ſo to any part of the body, or to any member of it, or any part, or member to them; every part of the body is far the more complete and happy for each particular part, and even the head needs the body and the members as much as they do the head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017190_0006_0FA077DE4963EE40"/>
Every part is juſt where it ſhould be, and is framed and adapted to the very office it ought to perform, and we ſhould ſhudder at the thought of any alteration in the number, office or ſituation of the reſpective members of the human ſtructure; to looſe an organ or a member, we juſtly account a great loſs, and to have one ſuperadded would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as diſagreeable to us; we would not looſe an eye, perhaps, for the world, yet we ſhould think it full as great an evil to have three eyes; the head we have, we cannot be willing to part with, but who of us would he willing to have two heads upon his ſhoulders? Two arms and two legs each of us want, but who would chooſe to have the number doubled? One mouth is a great bleſſing, but more than one would turn a man into a monſter. Our number of ears we find exactly right; the fingers and toes we have are juſt enough for us; our vital parts are juſt ſuch as we need, and they are placed within the body, juſt where we would chooſe to have them; and the ſame nutriment, blood and ſpirits, feed, ſupply and move the whole; and of this our reaſon and choice highly approve.</p>
            <p>We ſee a fitneſs and great propriety that the head and the body, every organ and every member, ſhould attend to their own buſineſs, and do their own offices reſpectively, and not in the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with one another; but all keep their diſtinct places and functions. We chooſe the head ſhould be above the body, and that four of the ſenſes ſhould have their ſeat in it, we chooſe that our ears ſhould hear and our eyes ſee; we chooſe to ſmell with the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017190_0007_0FA077DF08B3B4F8"/>
noſe and taſte with the mouth; we alſo highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that the other ſenſe, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that of feeling, ſhould be diffuſed through every part of the body, and ſpread over the whole; and we ſhould abhor that the ſenſes ſhould be confounded with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and intrude upon the peculiar offices of each other. What man is there that wiſhes to have his head and feet change places with each other? Or to have his breaſt and his back tranſpoſed? Who wiſhes to ſee with his ears, or hear with his eyes, or to taſte with his noſe, and ſmell with his mouth? Who would walk upon his hands, and with his feet handle the ſword, the ax, or the reaper's ſickle? Or who would wiſh the ſenſe of feeling confined to one part, and not ſpread through the whole body? We find all is beſt as God has ordered; "what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God doth, nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it," but what would make it far leſs perfect than it is. If the human body be perfect in every part, and enjoy perfect health, no man, no angel, no creature can mend it; ſo it is with the body politic, according to the divine conſtitution, or the plain manifeſtation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom and will.</p>
            <p>The infinitely wiſe and good Being has given us the ſum and ſubſtance of the moſt perfect form of civil government in his word, or, to keep up the ſimile of the apoſtle, in my text and context, he has drawn out and formed a moſt perfect <hi>political man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mean that ancient plan of civil policy, deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for the choſen tribes of Iſrael; there we find
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017190_0008_0FA077DFC80C5168"/>
no king, no deſpot, no emperor, no tyrant, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual dictator allowed of: We find the nation, by divine order, compoſed of a number of ſtates, that is to ſay thirteen, called the tribes of the children of Iſrael.—Jacob had twelve ſons, but then you know the tribe of Joſeph was ſubdivided and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came two tribes, <hi>i. e.</hi> the tribe of Ephraim and the tribe of Manaſſeh, which made thirteen <hi>united, free and independent ſtates:</hi> Each of theſe managed their internal police within themſelves; had each of them their legiſlative body, for their own ſtate or tribe; alſo their judges, and courts of juſtice—theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whether legiſlative or executive, were called the elders of the tribes, and governed the particular tribe or ſtate they were ſet over; and were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the immediate voice of God, or were elective by the people, which is equally the voice of God, though in a different manner, for where God does not immediately indicate his will in ſome other way, then the voice of the people in caſes of this nature, is <hi>the voice of God;</hi> and in the united ſtates or tribes of Iſrael, officers were elected by the people at large, or by thoſe to whom the people delegated power for that purpoſe, except when God himſelf immediately interpoſed in a ſpecial manner for their appointment; hence it was a well known maxim, that whom God and his people choſe to rule, he ſhould be received as ruler; and God always acknowledged the election of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as his own appointment, when he did not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe interpoſe in the matter.</p>

Moreover, theſe Thirteen United States or tribes of Iſrael, had by divine appointment a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral congreſs, with a preſident at their head; Moſes was the firſt, Joſhua ſucceeded him, ſo on till the days of Samuel, when the conſtitution was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; by whom the whole nation were united and cemented in all things that were of general concern to the whole nation, and who gave advice and direction to the elders of the tribes, or general aſſemblies of theſe United States; I mean the Sanhedrim or ſeventy elders, firſt appointed in the wilderneſs, in the days of Moſes; theſe compoſed the great council of the nation, or <hi>General Congreſs;</hi> and thus all the States were united and conſolidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all their general and common concerns, and ſo long as they abode firm in this reaſonable and divine conſtitution, ſupported it, and made the beſt of the happy privileges contained in it, they were in their civil policy as well as in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, far the happieſt nation under heaven.<note n="*" place="bottom">In ſupport of what I have ſaid as to the antient Jewiſh form of government, before that people were curſed with deſpotiſm, and its ſimilarity, for ſubſtance to that of theſe united ſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee Exod. iii. 16.

ſhould enjoy, I mean as to the general plan or drama of government; many circumſtantials may, and ought to vary, according to the various peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of different times, ſtates and nations: I do not imagine that every nation ought certainly to conſiſt of thirteen ſtates or tribes, becauſe it was ſo in Iſrael, after the tribe of Joſeph became two, nor do I ſuppoſe it neceſſary that the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of a nation ſhould conſiſt of juſt ſeventy men, and neither leſs nor more; or that the general aſſembly of each ſtate ſhould always be compoſed of juſt as many members as the choſen elders of each tribe in Iſrael conſiſted of; nor do I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Moſt High in ſetting up that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ever meant to direct or bind the nations of the earth as to thoſe circumſtances, which may admit of variation according to the different exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of a nation or ſtate; but thus much in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral God has plainly taught us, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that no king, no monarch, no tyrant, or deſpot, ought ever to be admitted to rule over his people, or any people under heaven; and hence, when Iſrael rejected that glorious form of government, and would have a king to govern them, God expreſsly declares <hi>they rejected him.</hi>

            <p>The great ruler of all worlds has hereby taught us that all power and privilege to make and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place rulers is, under him, lodged with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that ſince the days of miraculous divine interpoſition are ended, it is the right of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to elect all their rulers, in every character,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017190_0011_0FA077E2083D0240"/>
either mediately or immediately, and to ſet them aſide whenever they ceaſe to conſult the public good and elect others in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>That rulers, in every department, are for the good of the people, are to act the part of kind parents to them, and that the people, though they have the power of appointing and removing rulers as they ſee fit, yet ought to obey and honor them, while they remain in their reſpective offices, as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and obedient children; and that every ruler, from the higheſt to the loweſt, while in public office ought to do his own proper work and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his own proper office, with wiſdom, zeal and fidelity, and that every private perſon ought to abide in his own calling, and do the duties God has aſſigned him, and that <hi>rulers</hi> and <hi>ruled</hi> ſhould all conſpire together as one, to promote the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt and beſt good of the whole, that there be no ſchiſm in the body, but that the head and body, every organ and every member have a ſenſe of their neceſſity of, and dependence upon each other, and that all have the ſame care and mutual ſympathy which is found in the natural body—theſe principles, I ſay, are the plain dictates of the voice of the Moſt High, not only as the reaſon he has given to man is his voice in every man, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in that ancient form of government which God himſelf marked out for that people, which he had choſen to be his own peculiar people out of all the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>And as in the formation and ſtructure of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body we eaſily ſee the uſe, deſign, and proper
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017190_0012_0FA077E2C7484200"/>
buſineſs of each and every part, ſo from that plan of civil order and government which God has point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by the voice of reaſon and his own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate voice from heaven, we may eaſily ſee the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and duty of every conſtituent part; and as the health of the body natural depends upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per functions union, and harmony of the parts, ſo does that of the body politic; and as a ſenſible defect in any part of the natural body, or jarring and diſcord among the various parts of it, gives pain to the whole, brings on ſickneſs and diſtreſs, and ends in diſſolution, unleſs a cure is obtained, even ſo it is in a community, a body of people, a ſtate, or a nation.</p>
            <p>The head that is placed on high above the body, no doubt points out the proper ſtation of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative and ruling powers in a commonwealth: The ſeat of thought, council and underſtanding is in the head, there the eyes are placed to ſee and the ears to hear; there all the ſenſes but one have their ſeat; the ſenſorium is there, the memory is lodged there; the head is ſituated where it may have the beſt proſpect of all things, its buſineſs is to ſtudy, invent, compare, judge and direct what is beſt for the whole man; the head in its own ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and with all its organs and ſenſes, is well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted for its own buſineſs; but how unfit a thing is it to walk upon inſtead of a foot, or to uſe in the place of an arm or a leg? If the head is clear and well, the brain and all the organs of it in good order, and a good underſtanding ſeated there, it will do its own proper office, to think, ſee, hear,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017190_0013_0FA077E387490D20"/>
ſpeak and direct, which the whole body and all the members beſide could not in any wiſe do: So the buſineſs of civil guides is a diſtinct buſineſs, which they are to attend to, and when the right perſons, qualified perſons are in that ſtation, they have a work to do, and will wiſely and kindly perform an important work, as diſtinct from that of a private perſon as the buſineſs of the head is from that of one of the fingers.—A good political head is as eſſential to the happineſs of the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, as a good natural head is to the body natural, and the ſtation of each ought to be eſteemed equally honorable in relation to the body.</p>
            <p>The natural ear, ſituate in the head, receives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, the natural eye ſees dangers, ſpies out the way in which the feet are to walk and the whole body have its courſe and motion, ſearches out the work of the members, directs them in their reſpective employments, and ſees, or ſhould ſee, that all is well done; or if any thing is done amiſs, reviews and points out proper amendments which the body and members perform.—And this is the end and deſign for which God has appointed civil rulers, or a political head to every commonwealth; they are to watch for, and collect all intelligence; they are able and neceſſary to guide and conduct, ſecure and guard the body; they are to ſearch and point out the way in which the body politic is to walk and move, with proper employment for the hands and feet and every part, that every branch may be harmoniouſly employed and engaged for the good of the whole; ſhould always maintain
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017190_0014_0FA077E447305CD0"/>
and exerciſe the ſame kind, wholeſome, directive authority over the body politic, and every part of it, which the natural head does over the body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.—If the head ſhould undertake to do the office of any other part, it would make miſerable work of it, and become a plague to the whole body; even the little finger will do its own work better than the head can do the work of that finger; the head, though a moſt noble and honorable part of the man, is good for nothing in any other ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or buſineſs but its own. I would not hereby inſinuate that civil rulers are not fit to do the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of private members of the commonwealth, were they in private capacity; doubtleſs thoſe who are good public guides, would do very well in any character of life, were they placed in other ſtation than that in which they are; alſo there are many men in private character that would make excellent civil guides, were they put in that ſtation; all I mean is to ſhew the utter confuſion that muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue when rulers depart from their ſtation and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, neglect their own buſineſs, and deſcend to that which is allotted to others; or when people in any other character and ſtation, depart from the duties of their ſtation; and take upon them the buſineſs of rulers; this is like changing the place of the head and the feet, it is "turning things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down and muſt be eſteemed as the potter's clay."</p>
            <p>The arms and hands of the natural body are a very natural emblem of the executive powers in the commonwealth, both civil and military. It is true the ſame perſon may ſuſtain ſeveral capacities, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017190_0015_0FA077E50ACCC928"/>
be in ſeveral diſtinct offices; the ſame man may be a member of the legiſlative body, an executive officer, and a commander in the army, though perhaps it is not beſt for the community that this ſhould be generally the caſe; yet, if ſo, ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is of the head in one character, and of the arm in another, and ought to act very diſtinctly in his different capacities. The arms and hands are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts that effect and put in execution what is directed by the head, ſo all armies, and executive courts, and miniſters of juſtice, with officers under their command, ought always religiouſly and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly to obey the ſupreme council of the nation or ſtate. Our arms and hands would be worſe to us than nothing, if they would exert their ſtrength without, or contrary to the direction of the mind, or counſel of the head; no life would be ſafe in our hands, no not even our own; ſo all the courts of juſtice, and all military powers muſt do as they are directed by the ſupreme power, they muſt have law, direction and warrant, from the whole people, given out by the proper mouth of the people; which, as in the body natural, ſo in the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, can never be found any where but in the head.—The underſtanding or head is good to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and the arms and hands are good to execute, they are ſtrong, and active, and wonderfully neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and beneficial, under ſuch direction: but ſet the arms to hear and ſee and direct, and the head to ſtrike the blow for the execution, and what then would ever come to paſs? The head can do no work but its own and the arms and hands none
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017190_0016_0FA077E5C7B392A8"/>
but theirs; and as it is a great bleſſing to have a clear, diſcerning, judicious head, ſo it is to have ſtrong arms; a good legiſlative and a good exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power are equally neceſſary, and each an ineſtimable bleſſing to a commonwealth, and God himſelf hath appointed both for the good of the body.</p>
            <p>The vital parts in the human body moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally allude to that which is common to the whole nation or commonwealth, as theſe are of general and common concern to the head and body, every member, every veſſel, nerve, and fibre in the human frame; and as the vitals are well or ill, ſo is the whole man: The head, the body and every part are very ſenſibly affected by the ſtate which the vital parts are in. Theſe therefore ſtand in the ſimilitude for the general principles, or prevailing ſpirit which is in the body politic, and by which a nation as ſuch move and conduct themſelves; ſo in days of old when rulers were very wicked as to the greater part of them, and the ſpirit and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the nation were very corrupt, the moſt tells them, "the whole head is ſick and the whole heart faint." True religion and good morals deeply fixed in the ſouls of men and generally prevailing in a nation, communicate that health, ſtrength, and vigor to every part, which make the political man active and honorable, powerful and happy, "righteouſneſs exalteth a nation." If the vital parts are all well the caſe is happy in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body; if the heart with all the adjacent parts are right, and all the blood and ſpirits that paſs
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017190_0017_0FA077E71C9C8DF0"/>
through the heart are good, the favor is great to that man; but if the vitals are much diſeaſed, the whole maſs of blood and animal ſpirits will be much infected thereby, and that inward diſorder will ſoon be communicated to every part, and not the remoteſt member, not one nerve or fibre, not one gland or veſſel in the whole ſyſtem will long remain free from the awful contagion: Juſt ſo it is in a nation;—if true religion and good moral principles prevail and rule, that nation is in health, and never fails of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant honor, ſtrength and glory; but if religion dies away, morality decays, infidelity, vice and iniquity prevails among the people in general, ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in a ſickly ſtate, is greatly diſhonored, greatly weakened, and unleſs a cure is obtained, the diſtemper muſt firſt or laſt prove fatal. "Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no phyſician there? Why then is not the health of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my people recovered?" It is very eaſy to ſee that it is eſpecially incumbent on that order of men who are inſtructors in righteouſneſs, and who ſhould continually attend to the great things of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the health of the ſoul, and the morals of mankind, to act that part in the man politic, for the health of the body in this world and the world to come, which a ſound heart and well regulated vital parts do in the body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; that by the bleſſing of God, without which they can do nothing, ſuch ſpiritual and moral health and ſtrength may be diffuſed through the whole community as that ſtrength and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017190_0018_0FA077E7479E8FC0"/>
glory, honour and bleſſing may reſt upon the whole nation and dwell in it forever.</p>
            <p>That order of men which in the body eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic are, under Chriſt, in the place both of the head and the vital parts, do in the civil community take only the place of the latter, and their proper place they muſt be careful to keep; their work is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly important and beneficial to a community, when by the bleſſing of Almighty God on their labours, they are made inſtrumental of turning a people from their ſins to the living and true God, from their vices, iniquities and immoralities to a life of religion, to the practice of holineſs and virtue; for whenever a nation is happy, firm and ſtable and the times are bleſſed times, then "righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and holineſs are the ſtability of their times and the ſtrength of their ſalvation."</p>
            <p>And this order of men, as well as all others muſt keep their own place, and attend their own important and ſpecial duties, the heart and the vital parts can do the body no ſervice, in any place but where they be; place the heart where the head is, and the head where the heart is, and the man would not ſurvive the exchange; or remove any of the vital parts and join them on the foot, and they would be of leſs ſervice than the toes, which indeed are proper and uſeful there. The inward parts are very precious to us, where they are, and for their proper functions; our life and all our natural comforts muſt depend on the good order of theſe; but even the heart, the moſt precious part of all, is good for nothing to us, but only in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017190_0019_0FA077E8098DE858"/>
the place where it is, and for thoſe very purpoſes for which it was made.—The body of man in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and thoſe ſtrong and ſtately pillars which ſupport the body, by means of which we walk or run, and which are as neceſſary to compleat the man as the head, the heart, the arms, or any other part of the human ſtructure; this body and theſe noble pillars, I ſay, with every adjoining part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the body of the people of which a nation is compoſed; they have union and connection with the whole; they have one common ſympathy with the head, the arms, and the vital parts; they are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, ſupplied and kept in vigor, by that ſame nutriment, of which the head partakes, and by which it is nouriſhed: Thus the induſtrious body of the people in a nation, by diligence and oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in their various callings, are the grand ſupport and ſtrength of the whole, and while they are well engaged, each one in his proper work, well united in virtue and good order, in love to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in a ſpirit of harmony and quietneſs, in fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, induſtry and temperance, in patience and fortitude and in a becoming regard and affection to the whole, they are altogether as neceſſary to the head and the heart, as the latter are to them; neither can the eye ſay to the hand, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you: If the people in general are not engaged to promote the ſtrength and honor, wealth and happineſs of a nation, if they do not uphold rulers and teachers, courts of juſtice and the military power, all muſt fall to the ground; theſe are the ſtrong and noble pillars on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017190_0020_0FA077E8C8802D90"/>
which, under God, the whole civil fabric ſtands, and without thoſe all the efforts of rulers and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in every department, muſt become empty and ineffectual as a viſion of the night.—And it is of great importance that theſe keep their proper place, as well as every other order of men; it is altogether as monſtrous to ſee the legs where the arms ſhould be, as the arms where the legs ſhould be; it is as great an evil to have the feet growing on the head as the head growing on one of the feet: As the people mainly ſupport and uphold the whole, and as all rulers and teachers are for their good and though in ſtations of honor, are indeed to ſerve the people, ſo there is no ſcruple but that it is the right of the people to elect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their civil rulers as they find moſt for the good of the commonwealth; but, ſo long as ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers being made the head by the free choice of the people, are continued ſo by the ſame choice, then for people in general to aſſume the province of their rulers and civil guides, is exceedingly wrong. For people in general to turn guides and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and refuſe to be guided and counſelled by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to ſay what ought, and what ought not to be done, in the higheſt and moſt important concerns of the ſtate, of which, indeed, moſt people are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant, is juſt as if a madman ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to pluck his eyes from his head, and place them in ſockets made in his feet for that purpoſe, or wiſh his ears grafted on either leg, and the ſenſes which are ſeated in the head removed to the lower
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017190_0021_0FA077E989396F58"/>
parts of his body. The common people are no better, out of their place, than thoſe I have ſpoken of before and in their proper place no leſs neceſſary and important.</p>
            <p>The thoughts now ſuggeſted may lead us to ſome reflections exceeding proper for the inhabitants of theſe United States in the preſent day. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed happy in ſpeaking, at this time, to an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence very well affected to the common important cauſe we are engaged in, an audience that have a ſenſe of the importance of unanimity, harmony and good order through the whole; yet even ſuch a people can never have theſe good principles too deeply fixed in their minds; and from what has been ſaid we learn the great wiſdom and goodneſs of the Moſt High, in forming the political as well as the natural man; each according to the plain direction of his will, is alike perfect in every part, and in every member; and harmony, concord, unanimity, and mutual ſympathy are alike neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in each, that health, ſtrength and happineſs may prevail and abound through the body. What a wretched thing would the human body be, if the head and vitals, limbs, organs and members were alternately to change their places, and aſſume the offices of each other? If the head ſhould ſay I will be one of the feet, and will exerciſe myſelf in walking, if the vital parts ſhould ſay we will be the fingers and toes, and they ſhall come within the body and take our place, if the eyes ſhould ſay we will no longer ſee but hear, and the ears ſhould ſay we will leave off hearing and try how well we
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017190_0022_0FA077EA483B0670"/>
can ſee, if the arms ſhould ſay to the legs, come let us change places and the legs ſhould reply we will gladly take your place; we are tired of walking and running and ſupporting the body, we will henceforth handle the ax, the ſcythe, the ſickle, the ſword and the pen of the writer. In ſuch a caſe what would the man be good for? Would he not be the moſt uſeleſs frightful monſter in the univerſe!</p>
            <p>Juſt ſo in the political man, the commonwealth, the head and every member muſt keep their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective places or it becomes a hideous and a horrid monſter; the legiſlature muſt do their own buſineſs and none muſt interfere with them; the executive authority muſt do theirs without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; the military muſt act their own part, and every officer and ſoldier keep his own place and ſtation; they that are ſet to inſtruct in the great things of religion, to promote virtue, and to mend the morals of men, muſt alſo attend to their own proper work, and then, by the bleſſing of God, the body, the whole civil man, the ſtate, the commonwealth may expect health, ſtrength, vigor and glory.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you, my dear audience, that we of this nation have now for ſubſtance, that very ſame plan of government, which infinite wiſdom and goodneſs pointed out to the choſen the much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved tribes of Iſrael, in the conſtitution of which we ſee a political man perfect, or how the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ought to be organized and regulated, as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we ſee in the formation of the human body,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017190_0023_0FA077EB08259A10"/>
what is moſt convenient, fit and perfect for ſuch a creature as man. We have our Sanhedrim, <hi>i. e.</hi> our General Congreſs, anſwering for ſubſtance to the ſeventy elders of Iſrael that were over all the tribes as their ſupreme council; we have our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ſtates as they had their diſtinct tribes, and it is really worthy of notice that our number ſhould be exactly the ſame, even in the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of our independency. Thus, "when the Moſt High divided to this nation their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſeperated us from all the other ſons of Adam, he ſet the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Iſrael," we have a General Aſſembly, in each of our States, the ſame, for ſubſtance, with the elders of each tribe or ſtate in Iſrael of old: We have our courts, judges, and teachers formed on the ſame general plan, varying only in a few circumſtances, which ought always to be the caſe, as times and the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of States and nations are altered: We have the ſame rule to walk by which they had, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the perfect word of God, but in this we have much the advantage of them, the ſcripture canon is now compleat, which then it was not, and we have the divine light abundantly clearer than they had; we have the ſame church, but with privileges much enlarged, the ſame ordinances but is a milder form, we are "grafted into that old, good olive tree, and partake of all the fatneſs of it;" and even in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and political view, we are the compleateſt man, the beſt regulated commonwealth that ever the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of God formed, except that I have
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017190_0024_0FA077EBC91516A8"/>
been ſpeaking of, and with that we are, for ſubſtance, the ſame.—And now, all we want for the moſt conſummate happineſs a nation can enjoy on this ſide heaven, is that the head, the vitals, the arms and hands, the body and every member be in good health, each keep their proper place, and every one do its own duty, and that no part impede, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with any other: Every part has one common intereſt, we are all partakers of the ſame nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, to keep up the ſimile, the ſame blood and ſpirit are common to every part, and, Oh! may we find one common ſoul, and that a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, holy and virtuous one, actuating and animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole, that rulers, teachers, and people may be one for God, and for the happineſs of this nation, that all the wheels in church and ſtate, in the army and navy, and in every department throughout the nation may be inſpired and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly turned like the glorious combination in the viſion of the prophet, the whole machine moved together in the moſt glorious order. "When thoſe went theſe went, and when thoſe ſtood theſe ſtood, and when thoſe were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over againſt them, for the ſpirit of the living creature was in the wheels." Conſult the firſt chapter of Ezekiel's prophecy at large. Thus a commonwealth ſhould be as a living creature, every part acting in concert, and all actuated by the ſame living ſoul. Though the offices and ſtations are various, yet the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſuffering is common; there is as much pain in the head or the heart, as in any of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017190_0025_0FA077EC89183B58"/>
high ſtations do not make men happy, but that man that does his duty well, whatever be his ſtation, is a happy man: If the head or heart have ſometimes more pleaſure than the limbs, yet at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times their pain as much exceeds, and when I hear any of the common people murmuring againſt rulers, and manifeſting bitter envy againſt them, as though ſuch had peculiar happineſs not common to the body in general, and as though they, <hi>the common people,</hi> were excluded the privileges and happineſs of the great, I look upon it juſt as tho' the foot ſhould ſay, "becauſe I am not the hand I am not of the body." And that perſon, whatever ſtation he is in, who has not a tender concern for the whole, and a ſympathy with the whole, is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid part or member, utterly paſt feeling, and calls for immediate amputation.</p>
            <p>All perſons that are unwilling to keep their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſtations, and do their reſpective duty, all incendiaries, all tories and traitors, all that hold il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit correſpondence with the common enemy, all that have any diſpoſition to throw themſelves and this favored nation into the arms of tyranny and deſpotiſm, all mal-contents that would ſtir up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, anarchy, and confuſion in the bowels of it, or in any part, all that do not rejoice in the common good and mourn in the common calamity, all extortioners and ſelfiſh wretches that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves, though at the expence of the ruin of the nation, all ſuch, I ſay, are the very excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body politic, or they are well compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a gangrene, or to baneful putrefaction which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017190_0026_0FA077ED48C0C0D0"/>
calls for the inſtruments of inciſion, that it may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; or to any nauſeous infection which muſt be purged out, or diſtemper that muſt be ſubdued, before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health can return, or deſired ſtrength and vigor be recovered.</p>
            <p>We learn moreover, how exceeding thankful we ought to be for the happy and divine conſtitution God has favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with, and how dreadfully wicked it is to murmur and complain about it. God can make the head, the vitals the body, and every member better than they are if he pleaſes, and let us all cry to him continually, to give more wiſdom and grace to the whole; but a better form or model of government, a better plan we never can have.—When a man is ſick and in pain, he does not complain that God has made him a man, nor does he want the Almighty ſhould unmake him; no, he wants that every diſordered part ſhould be brought into good order; he would by all means be a man ſtill, but a man in good health: Even ſo, let none of this nation deſire any other, than that this moſt perfect political man may be in good health in every part. Since the fall, there muſt needs be troubles and the marks of the curſe in all bodies, whether natural, eccleſiaſtical, or political; but let none wiſh for the annihilation of that which is the moſt perfect in its kind, that can ever be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this very imperfect ſtate of things. If we have pain in our heads or vitals, or any other part, we do not want thoſe parts deſtroyed but cured; and for this end we uſe all means, and for this we pray to that God in whom we live. When I hear any perſon ſay, our political head is liable to err, and has made miſtakes, and therefore I wiſh it was diſſolved and that we had no ſuch council to guide us, I look upon it as great a ſpecimen of folly, as if I ſhould hear a man ſay, "my head is in pain and therefore I wiſh it was cut off." Whenever there be diſorder in the body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, eccleſiaſtical or civil, we ſhould ſeek a cure by fervent prayer and by all proper means, and not the diſſolution of the body: And as it is in God the natural body doth "live, and move and have its being," juſt ſo is it with the body

politic; in the former, if one part is diſordered, the reſt do not hate it and feel a bitterneſs towards it; but ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with it and contribute all they can to its healing and comfort; even ſo in the latter, we ſhould all ſympathize together, maintain a common feeling, and whereſoever the defect or failure is, every other part ſhould "be watchful and ſtrengthen the things that remain that are ready to die."—How ſoon would the human body die, if when a dangerous diſorder has ſeized one part, the other parts would act as though they hated that ſickly part, and would lend no kind aſſiſtance, to ſupport, comfort, or heal it? Even ſo it is in the caſe I have been ſpeaking of; if there be not mutual care, ſympathy and kind aſſiſtance, in every part, diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and death muſt be the awful conſequence.</p>
            <p>Oh! may every ruler and every ſubject throughout theſe United States, have a deep, influential ſenſe of all theſe things! may each one keep his proper place and do his proper duty, with wiſdom, firmneſs, and vigor, and with an heart ſincere in the ſight of God: It is the glory and bleſſedneſs of man, whatever be his ſtation, to ſerve God and his generation faithfully, according to the divine will.</p>
            <p>And finally, there can be nothing more obvious from what has been ſaid, than the abſolute neceſſity we, and our whole nation ſtand in, of the powerful and effectual viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the divine ſpirit, in every part of the land; this, my dear friends, and nothing ſhort of this will ſet us right as to our diſpoſitions and vital principles of action; this would make us love our God ſupremely, and then we ſhould "love one another with a pure heart fervently." This would make us Chriſtians indeed, and then we ſhall be patriots of real conſequence:—Oh! then for this let us pray day and night, for this let us cry aloud and not ſpare, in this let rulers and ſubjects, miniſters and people all unite as the moſt important favor on which all our happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; for this let us all pray and not faint, "until the righteouſneſs of our nation go forth as brightneſs, and the ſalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth."</p>
