            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT will be readily acknowledged, that the minds of youth are greatly attracted by <hi>novelty</hi> and <hi>variety;</hi> and that the moſt judicious Collections, however entertaining they may be at firſt, become leſs pleaſing by being frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſed.</p>
            <p>I have, for a number of ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, taken conſiderable pains to collect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a variety of delightful and uſeful materials for this work. Great care has been token, to avoid the inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch pieces as have appeared in former compilations for the uſe of Schools.</p>
            <p>That a collection of this kind, appropriated ſolely to the benefit and amuſement of the <hi>fair ſex,</hi> would be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful to Schools, has been frequently ſuggeſted by a number of literary friends, and likewiſe by ſeveral judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious females who conduct the education of young Ladies.</p>
            <p>Having been about twenty years engaged in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Teacher, I have had many opportunities of noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the diſpoſitions of children; they naturally love read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but cannot reliſh dry or profound ſubjects, however excellent in their kind;—they want ſomething to delight the fancy, and fix their volatility: How far this Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is calculated to anſwer theſe ends, is left to a diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Public to decide.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to obſerve here, that ſome alterations have been made in a number of the following pieces, with a view of adapting them to the preſent undertaking; but as the original ſentiments are ſtill retained, I truſt, the Authors, from whom they are ſelected, will readily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this neceſſary freedom.</p>
            <p>Having neglected to diſtinguiſh the different pieces in this work, at the time they were ſelected, with the names of the reſpective Authors,—as I then deſigned them only for the uſe of the young Ladies under my care,—I regret that it is not now practicable wholly to remedy the omiſſion.</p>

That the leader of the Hebrews was a poet, is undeniable. He embelliſhes religion with all the ſublimity of imagery, and all the graces of diction.

               <head>ON RELIGION.</head>
               <p>Having in the former part of this work, attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale my fair readers, with a variety of pleaſant flowers, —I would now beg leave to invite them to partake of a more ſolid repaſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THROUGH all the viciſſitudes of life, from the cradle to the grave, religion proves the never-failing friend of man. Launched on a tempeſtuous ocean, and buoyed up with the phantom hope, we vainly think ourſelves ſecure, till the fanciful picture is withdrawn from our ſight, and we find the need of a more ſolid comfort and companion. In proſperity, when every thing around us wears a pleaſing aſpect, and mirth and conviviality attend our ways, conſcience, that intruder on ſenſual delights, interpoſes betwixt us and ruin, and ſhews us the danger of weaning our mind from heaven. It is then we view the deſign of thoſe comforts of which we are poſſeſſed; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſe, and the too frequent abuſe, is exhibited to our view.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Diverſify this ſcene with the more melancholy idea of adverſity, and all the complicated woes of life. View an aged father and a declining mother, tortured by the pangs of their ſuffering little ones, for that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which, alas! they are unable to afford; and yet, amongſt all this accumulation of miſery, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion impart animation to their dejected ſouls. They are conſoled in the remembrance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing participants of the benignity of that Providence who ſupported Elijah in the wilderneſs, and who is able to alleviate the horrors of their ſituation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor is the ſuperior excellence of religion more conſpicuous in this, than in the common occurrences of life. A mind deprived of the idea of reſponſibility,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037446_0063_100CDAC5893E8FD8"/>
is regardleſs of its conduct here; and tho' the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monitor may ſometimes ſuggeſt an alarm, yet they proceed in a careleſs indifference, till at laſt they ſink into the abyſs of ruin.</p>
               <p>Religion may be juſtly called the greateſt enjoyment of man. It is a never-failing ſource of delight to thoſe who happily embrace its ways, as its tendency is ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately and ſecurely to poſſeſs felicity.</p>
               <p>If ſuch, then, appears the conſolations reſulting from this divine perfection, how egregiouſly ſtupid do they appear, who, ſatisfied with preſent enjoyment, are regardleſs of the future!</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the hour of diſſolution, when all the plaudits of the world ſhall be found ineffectual to quiet the pangs of remorſe, religion would adminiſter the moſt ſoothing ideas to their perturbed hearts. To look back on their paſt exiſtence, is a vacuum ſo replete with diſmay, and time ſo infamouſly perverted, that they are petrified with horror at the awful retroſpect. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the future ſtill heightens their melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and what would they now give, could but one hour be recalled, to make peace with that being whom they have ſo long wantonly deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>Could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught ſoar beyond the boundaries of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and pourtray to imagination the realms of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, it could not ſufficiently ſhew the matchleſs beauties of religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Dr. Gregory has juſtly obſerved that, the ſcenes of diſtreſs, in which women are very frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, religion is their only ſolace and ſupport. They cannot, when oppreſſed by ſorrow, or harraſſed by worldly cares, fly to buſineſs or thoſe tumultuous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which diſſipate, if they do not calm, the mind: condemned to fight on even ground and liſten to the very echo of their grief, piety alone can ſtill the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of diſcontent, and give ſtability to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037446_0064_100D0D4F3A67FEF0"/>
but piety is not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> acquired in the hour of trouble; it muſt have been a cheriſhed inmate of the ſoul, or it will not not afford conſolation when every other ſource fails.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The general opinion of mankind, that there is a ſtrong connection between a religious diſpoſition and a feeling heart, appears from the univerſal diſlike which all men have to infidelity in the <hi>fair ſex.</hi> We not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look upon it as removing the principal ſecurity we have for their virtue, but as the ſtrongeſt proof of their want of that ſoftneſs and delicate ſenſibillty of heart, which peculiarly endears them to us, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſecures their empire over us, than any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they can poſſeſs.</p>

               <p n="7">7. If young ladies, ſays the ingenious Mr. Creſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, would liſten to me a few moments, I would endeavour to prove to them that the moſt ſedulous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the perſon will never improve it, whilſt a cultivated mind renders the moſt graceful form more pleaſing:—What do I ſay?—there is no grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; nor any beauty, that will charm for half an hour, which does nor ariſe from an artleſs diſplay of virtue or ſenſe. But it is not neceſſary to ſpeak, to diſplay mental charms—the eye will quickly inform us if an active ſoul reſides within; and a bluſh is far more eloquent than the beſt turned period.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is ſomething peculiarly ſoothing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in a firm belief that the whole frame of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſupported and conducted by an eternal and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent being, of infinite goodneſs, who intends, by the whole courſe of his providence, to promote the greateſt good of all his creatures; a belief that we are acquainted with the means of conciliating the divine favour, and that in conſequence of this we have it in our power to obtain it; a belief that this life is but the infancy of our exiſtence, that we ſhall ſurvive the

               <head>ON THE RESURRECTION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I HAVE ſeen the flower withering on the ſtalk, and its bright leaves ſpread on the ground.—I looked again, and it ſprung up afreſh; the ſtem was crowned with new buds, and the ſweetneſs thereof filled the air.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen the ſun ſet in the weſt, and the ſhades of night ſhut the wide horizon: there was no colour, nor ſhape, nor beauty, nor muſic; gloom and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs brooded around. I looked; the ſun broke out again from the eaſt, and gilded the mountain tops; the lark roſe to meet him from her low neſt, and the ſhades of darkneſs fled away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have ſeen the inſect, being come to its full ſize, languiſh, and refuſe to eat; it ſpun itſelf a tomb, and was ſhrowded in the ſilken cone; it lay without feet, or ſhape, or power to move. I looked again; it had burſt its tomb; it was full of life, and ſailed upon coloured wings through the ſoft air; it rejoiced in its new being.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhall it be with thee, O man! and ſo ſhall thy life be renewed.—Beauty ſhall ſpring up out of aſhes, and life out of the duſt.—A little while ſhalt thou lie on the ground, as the ſeed lieth in the boſom of the earth:—but thou ſhalt be raiſed again; and, if thou art good, thou ſhalt never die any more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Who is he that cometh to burſt open the doors of the tomb; to bid the dead awake, and to gather his redeemed from the four winds of heaven? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth on a fiery cloud; the ſound of a trumpet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before him; thouſands of angels are on his right hand:—It is JESUS, the ſon of GOD; the ſaviour of

men; the friend of the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He cometh in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his father; he hath received power from on high! —Mourn not, therefore, child of immortality! for the ſpoiler, the cruel ſpoiler that laid waſte the works of God, is ſubdued:—JESUS hath conquered death.— Child of immortality, mourn no longer.</p>

               <head>ON TRUE POLITENESS.</head>
               <p n="1">1. POLITENESS is the firſt medium between form and rudeneſs. It is the conſequence of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent nature, which ſhews itſelf to general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in an obliging unconſtrained civility, as it does to more particular ones in diſtinguiſhed acts of kindneſs. This good nature muſt be directed by a juſtneſs of ſenſe, and a quickneſs of diſcernment, that knows how to uſe every opportunity of exerciſing it, and to proportion the inſtances of it to every charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſituation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a reſtraint laid by reaſon and benevolence upon every irregularity of the temper, which, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, is forced to accommodate itſelf even to the fantaſtic cares which cuſtom and faſhion have eſtabliſhed, if by that means it can procure in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the ſatisfaction or good opinion of any part of mankind; thus paying an obliging deference to their judgment, ſo far as it is not inconſiſtent with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obligations of virtue and religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This muſt be accompanied with an elegance of taſte, and a delicacy obſervant of the leaſt trifles which tend to pleaſe or oblige; and though its foundation muſt be rooted in the heart, it can ſcarce be perfect without a complete knowledge of the world. In ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety it is the medium that blends all different tempers into the moſt pleaſing harmony, while it impoſes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the loquacious, and inclines the moſt reſerved to furniſh their ſhare of the converſation.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:037446_0067_100D0D1AE7FE4418"/>4. It repreſſes the deſire of ſhining alone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the deſire of being mutually agreeable. It takes off the edge of raillery, and gives delicacy to wit. It preſerves a proper ſubordination among all ranks of people, and can reconcile a perfect eaſe with the moſt exact propriety. To ſuperiors it appears in a reſpectful freedom; and no intimacy can ſink it into a regardleſs familiarity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To inferiors it ſhews itſelf in an unaſſuming good nature. Its aim is, to raiſe them to you, and not to let you down to them. It at once maintains the dignity of your ſtation, and expreſſes the goodneſs of your heart. To equals it is every thing that is charming; it ſtudies their inclinations, prevents their deſires, attends to every little exactneſs of behaviour, and all the time appears perfectly diſengaged and careleſs.</p>

Such and ſo amiable is true politeneſs: by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of wrong heads and unworthy hearts diſgraced in its two extremes: and by the generality of mankind confined within the narrow bounds of mere good breeding, which, in truth, is only one inſtance of it.</p>

There is a character of perfect good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that loves to have every thing about it happy and merry.—This is a character greatly to be loved, but has little claim to the title of politeneſs. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have no notion of freedom without noiſe and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult: and by taking off every proper reſtraint, and ſinking themſelves to the level of their companions, even leſſen the pleaſure theſe would have in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of their ſuperiors,</p>

WE all know the power of <hi>beauty,</hi> but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it permanent and make human life more happy and agreeable, it muſt have the beauties of the mind annexed. For, as Dr. Blair very juſtly obſerves, "Feeble are the attractions of the faireſt form, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>within</hi> correſponds to the pleaſing appearance <hi>without." Love</hi> and <hi>marriage</hi> are two words much ſpoken of, but ſeldom found united.

To enliven our hours, to paſs our life agreeably, let us enrich our mental ſoil; for this, joined with love, will for ever adorn the marriage ſtate. A young lady, being aſked her opinion of <hi>love,</hi> ſaid—"If youth and beauty are the objects of your regard, <hi>love,</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on youth and beauty, cannot poſſibly endure longer than youth and beauty laſt.

But love, at this time of day, is raiſing the imagination to expectations above nature, and thereby laying the ſure foundation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment on both ſides, when Hymen ſhifts the ſcene." Love then according to this ſenſible young lady's opinion, is a <hi>paſſion founded on eſteem:</hi> A ſincere regard for the object of our affections, joined with a love, the moſt pure, and rational.</p>

               <head>The following judicious remarks are ſelected form a tract entitled, "<hi>Thoughts upon Female Education,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the preſent ſtate of ſociety, manners, and government, in the United States." Addreſſed to the Viſitors of the young ladies' Academy, in Philadelphia, by that eminent patron of the fair ſex, <hi>BENJAMIN RUSH, M. D.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE firſt remark that I ſhall make upon this ſubject, is, that female education ſhould be accommodated to the ſtate of ſociety, manners, and government of the country, in which it is conducted.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral circumſtances in the ſituation, employments, and duties of women, in America, which require a peculiar mode of education.</p>
               <p>The early marriages of our women, by contracting the time allowed for education, render it neceſſary to contract its plan, and to confine it chiefly to the more uſeful branches of literature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtate of property, in America, renders it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the greateſt part of our citizens to employ themſelves, in different occupations, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their fortunes. This cannot be done without
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037446_0071_100D0D1FE1EC20B8"/>
the aſſiſtance of the female members of the community. They muſt be the ſtewards and guardi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands' property. That education, therefore, will be moſt proper for our women, which teaches them to diſcharge the duties of thoſe offices with the moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and reputation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The branch of literature moſt eſſential for a young lady, in this country, appears to be, —a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Engliſh language. She ſhould not only read, but ſpeak and <hi>ſpell</hi> it correctly.</p>
               <p>Pleaſure and intereſt conſpire to make the writing of a fair and legible hand, a neceſſary branch of female education. For this purpoſe ſhe ſhould be taught not only to ſhape every letter properly, but to pay the ſtricteſt regard to points and capitals.</p>
               <p>I once heard of a man who profeſſed to diſcover the temper and diſpoſition of perſons by looking at their hand-writing. Without enquiring into the probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſtory; I ſhall only remark, that there is one thing in which all mankind agree, upon this ſubject, and that is, in conſidering writing that is blotted, crooked, or illegible, as a mark of vulgar education: I know of few things more rude or illiberal, than to obtrude a letter upon a perſon of rank or buſineſs, which connot be eaſily read.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some knowledge of figures and book-keeping is abſolutely neceſſary to qualify a young lady for the duties that await her in this country. There are certain occupations in which ſhe may aſſiſt her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with this knowledge; and ſhould ſhe ſurvive him, and agreeable to the cuſtom of our country be the executrix of his will, ſhe cannot fail of deriving immenſe advantages from it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An acquaintance with geography, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in chronology will enable a young lady to read hiſtory, biography and travels, with advantage;
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:037446_0072_100D0D59CED0ADC8"/>
and thereby qualify her not only for a general inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the world, but, to be an agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for a ſenſible man.</p>
               <p>Dancing is by no means an improper branch of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for an American lady. It promotes health, and renders the figures and motions of the body eaſy and agreeable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The attention of our young ladies ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, as ſoon as they are prepared for it, to the reading of hiſtory, travels, poetry, and moral eſſays. Theſe ſtudies are accommodated, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the preſent ſtate of ſociety, in America, and when a reliſh is excited for them, in early life, they ſubdue that paſſion for reading novels, which ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally prevail among the fair ſex.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There have been many controverſies upon the ſubject of public and private education. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal objection to the former has always been derived from its miſchievous influence upon the morals and manners of young people. The folly and vice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcholar, it has been ſaid, are diſſeminated; ſo that in a little while, each ſcholar poſſeſſes the follies and vices of the whole. But is there no remedy for theſe evils? yes there is—the <hi>principles and precepts of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi> are a ſovereign antidote to them. Let, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all the branches of education, which have been mentioned, be connected with regular inſtruction in the chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For this purpoſe the principles of the different ſects of Chriſtians ſhould be taught and explained, and our pupils ſhould early be furniſhed with ſome of the moſt ſimple arguments in favour of the truth of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. A portion of the Bible (of late improperly baniſhed from our ſchools) ſhould be read by them ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery day, and ſuch queſtions ſhould be aſked, after read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as are calculated to imprint upon their minds the intereſting ſtories contained in it.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:037446_0073_100D0D2209262DA8"/>9. <hi>Roſſeau</hi> has aſſerted, that he great ſecret of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation conſiſts in "waſting the time of children pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly." There is ſome truth in this obſervation. I believe that we often impair their health, and weaken their capacities, by impoſing ſtudies upon them, which are not proportioned to their years. But this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not apply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> religious inſtruction. There are certain ſimple propoſitions in the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that are ſuited in a peculiar manner, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſtate of reaſon and moral ſenſibility.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A clergyman of long experience i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. Dr. Nicholas Collin, miniſter of the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh church in Wincocoe.</note> informed me, that he always found children acquired religious knowledge more eaſily than knowledge upon other ſubjects; and that young girls acquired this kind of knowledge more readily than boys. The female breaſt is the natural ſoil of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity; and while our women are taught to believe its doctrines, and obey its precepts, the wit of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, and the ſtyle of Bolingbroke, will never be able to deſtroy its influence upon our citizens.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I cannot help remarking in this place, that Chriſtianity exerts the moſt friendly influence upon ſcience, as well as upon the morals and manners of mankind. Whether this be occaſioned by the unity of truth, and the mutual aſſiſtance which truths upon different ſubjects afford each other, or whether the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the mind be ſharpened and corrected by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the truths of revelation, and thereby prepared to inveſtigate and perceive truths upon other ſubjects, I will not determine, but it is certain that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſcoveries in ſcience have been made by Chriſtian philoſophers, and that there is the moſt knowledge in thoſe countries where there is the moſt Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:037446_0074_100D0D5C09F1D278"/>12. By knowledge I mean truth only; and by truth I mean the perception of things as they appear to the divine mind. If this remark be well founded, then thoſe philoſophers who reject chriſtianity, and thoſe chriſtians, whether parents or ſchool-maſters, who neglect the religious inſtruction of their children and pupils, <hi>reject</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> the moſt effectual means of promoting knowledge in our country.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If the meaſures that have been recommended for inſpiring our pupils with a ſenſe of religious and moral obligations be adopted, the government of them will be eaſy and agreeable. I ſhall only remark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head, that <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> of diſcipline will always render <hi>ſeverity</hi> unneceſſary, and that there will be the moſt inſtruction in that ſchool where there is moſt order.</p>
               <p n="14">14. A philoſopher once ſaid, "Let me make all the ballads of a country, and I care not who makes its laws."—He might with more propriety have ſaid, let the ladies of a country be properly educated, and they will not only make and adminiſter its laws, but form its manners and character. It would require a lively imagination to deſcribe, or even to comprehend the happineſs of a country, where knowledge and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were generally diffuſed among the female ſex.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Our young men would then be reſtrained from vice by the terror of being baniſhed from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The loud laugh, and the malignant ſmile, at the expence of innocence, or perſonal infirmities— the feats of ſucceſsful mimickry—and the low-priced wit, which is borrowed from a miſapplication of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſes, would no more be conſidered as recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to the ſociety of ladies. A double enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, in their preſence, would then exclude a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forever from the company of both ſexes, and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037446_0075_100D0D2431B357C8"/>
probably oblige him to ſeek an aſylum from contempt, in a foreign country.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The influence of female education would be ſtill more extenſive and uſeful in domeſtic life. The obligation of gentlemen to qualify themſelves by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and induſtry to diſcharge the duties of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, would be increaſed by marriage; and the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, the hero, and the legiſlator, would find the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reward of their toils, in the approbation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of their wives.—Children would diſcover the marks of maternal prudence and wiſdom in every ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life; for it has been remarked that there have been few great or good men who have not been bleſſed with wiſe and prudent mothers.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was taught to revere the gods, by his mother <hi>Mandane—Samuel</hi> was devoted to his prophetic office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was born, by his mother <hi>Hannah—Conſtantine</hi> was reſcued from paganiſm by his mother <hi>Conſtantia</hi>—&amp; <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth inherited thoſe great and excellent qualities, which made him the delight of the age in which he lived, from his mother lady, <hi>Jane Seymour.</hi> Many other inſtances might be mentioned, if neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from anci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Doctor concludes his excellent addreſs to the viſitors, with the following intereſting remarks to the young ladies of the ſeminary.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Young Ladies—An important problem is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for ſolution; and that is, whether our preſent plan of education be a wiſe one, and whether it be calculated to prepare you for the duties of ſocial and domeſtic life. I know that the elevation of the female mind, by means of moral, phyſical and religious truths, is conſidered by ſome men as unfriendly to the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic character of a woman. But this is the prejudice of little minds, and ſprings from the ſame ſpirit which
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037446_0076_100D0D5D969DE2F0"/>

                  </gap>e among the citizens of our republic. If men believe that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is favourable to the government of the female ſex, they are certainly deceived; for a weak and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant woman will always be governed with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulty. I have ſometimes been led to aſcribe the invention of ridiculous faſhions in female dreſs, entirely to the gentlemen,<note n="*" place="bottom">The very expenſive prints of female dreſſes, which are publiſhed annually in France, are invented and executed wholly by <hi>GENTLEMEN.</hi>
                  </note> in order to divert the ladies from improving their minds, and thereby to ſecure a more arbitrary and unlimitted authority over them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. It will be in your power, Ladies, to correct the miſtake and practice of our ſex upon theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by demonſtrating, that the female temper can only be governed by reaſon, and that the cultivation of reaſon, in women, is alike friendly to the order of nature, and to private as well as public happineſs.</p>

Nothing becomes a child ſo much as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to parents or governors; therefore never refuſe to do what they order. When in the room with your parents or relations, never ſlip out privately, for it is mean and unhandſome.

               <p n="12">12. In ſeating yourſelf take care you leave the beſt places for the company, and never ſit with your back to any one. Study your exerciſe when alone; and never read or look upon a book, in company. If other children are in company never whiſper with them.— Never laugh at what the company does not know, for it will ſeem as if you laughed at them!—This is too common a cuſtom, with ſome ladies, though a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt breach of good manners!</p>
               <p>Look in the face of the perſon you ſpeak to, and the ſame when he ſpeaks to you: but do this modeſtly and decently. Appear always eaſy and placid when you are in company, and in return you will be amply rewarded by the company being pleaſed with you.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Speak ſlow and not too loud. Take care to pronounce your words diſtinctly. Uſe few words, and know when to hold your tongue. Wait the reply of the perſon that ſpeaks, and whatever it be, hear it with good temper: if he contradicts you, do not think of arguing with him; for more years muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have made him wiſer than yourſelf. For the ſame reaſon, never do you contradict an elderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If any one ſays a thing that you know to be wrong, do not contradict him or her—Modeſty and humility are the beſt things a young lady in company can practiſe. When you are going to retire from any company, riſe gracefully and ſlowly from your ſeat; addreſs your eyes modeſtly to the principal perſon in the company, and courteſy retiring—make a general courteſy to the reſt. Never make any more courteſies than here directed, for they are vulgar and troubleſome.</p>

               <p>WHILE you lived under my immediate care and inſpection, I endeavoured to ſet before you a good example, and to inſtil into your, tender mind ſuch maxims of virtue and prudence, as were ſuitable to your age and capacity. But now that you are ſettled in Mrs. Bromley's boarding-ſchool, I can no longer follow this method of inſtruction. However, what I cannot perform in perſon, I will endeavour to ſupply by letters. For, though you are removed out of my ſight, you are not, for all that, baniſhed from my though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. I feel my concern for your happineſs rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed than diminiſhed by abſence; and I confeſs, that nothing in this world would give me ſo much pleaſure, as to ſee you, one day, prove an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woman To enable you to become ſuch, no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of education ſhall be wanting Mrs. Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley is a woman of ſuch approved abilities and fidelity, that there is no danger of any neglect on her part; and the beſt advice and directions I can give, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in a ſeries of letters, which I propoſe to write to you from time to time; and, I hope, I ſhall have the pleaſure of ſeeing the good effect they have upon you, by your daily improvement in knowledge and virtue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Firſt of all, then, my dear Sophy, let me adviſe you to obey Mrs. Bromley in every thing ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. She is a gentlewoman of ſo much good ſenſe, that ſhe will deſire you to do nothing but what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; and, I know, ſhe will explain to you the

reaſonableneſs of all her injunctions, where you are able to comprehend it: and, where you are not, you muſt take it for granted, that they are for your real intereſt and advantage. In a word, you muſt behave to her with all the reſpect and obedience of a child; as, I am confident, ſhe will treat you with all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and tenderneſs of a parent. Your next care muſt be to procure the love and eſteem of your ſchool-fellows, by an inoffenſive and obliging behaviour.— Hurt nobody; ſpeak ill of nobody; tell no lies of any body; but do to every one all the kind and civil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices you can. Lying, indeed, is a vice I never found you guilty of; and, I believe, I might have ſpared my advice on that head.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But there is another vice, againſt which I would caution you, I mean tale bearing? not that I ever perceived you more inclined to this vice than any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but becauſe you will now, perhaps, be under ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er temptations to the commiſſion of it; and becauſe, of all others, it will render you moſt odious to your companions. The nature and limitations of this vice I ſhall explain to you more fully in ſome ſucceeding letter, when you will be more capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me. As many of your companions are much old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than you, and farther advanced in their learning, take care to pay them that reſpect and deference which is due to their ſuperior age and knowledge; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if, at any time, they are employed by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or teachers to direct you in your taſks.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I have got a thouſand things beſides to ſay to you, but theſe muſt be the ſubjects of ſome future letters. Let me adviſe you, however, before I conclude, to be punctual in ſaying your prayers every morning and evening. You know I gave you peremptory inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this head at parting, and, I hope, you will not forget them. I expect to hear a good account of

                  <salute>My dear Sophy,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p n="1">1. I HAD lately the pleaſure of hearing from Mrs. Bromley that you make great progreſs in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Engliſh, and that ſhe expects you will ſoon be one of the beſt readers in the ſchool. To be able to read with propriety is certainly a very genteel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, and not ſo eaſy to be acquired as moſt people imagine; and, perhaps, you will not find one woman in five hundred that is poſſeſſed of it. There are ſo many faulty ways of reading, which young people, are apt to run into, that it is difficult to avoid them all; and when once a bad habit is contracted, it is almoſt impoſſible to correct it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is your aunt Filmer, who reads with ſuch a canting tone as grates the ears of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. She has frequently almoſt ſung me to ſleep, though reading one of the moſt diverting books in the world. Your couſin Pulteney, you know, reads with ſuch hurry and rapidity, and ſuch neglect of the proper ſtops and pauſes, that the moſt attentive hearer cannot underſtand one ſentence ſhe pronounces; whilſt Mrs. Daſhwood reads in ſuch a ſlow and ſlovenly manner, and draws out the words to ſuch an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate length, that nobody has patience to follow her. Mrs. Nugent reads with ſuch a loud ſhrill voice as ſtuns the ears of the whole audience. It might do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well in a public aſſembly, but is altogether unfit for a tea-tale; whereas Miſs Littleton's accent is ſo
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:037446_0097_100D0D3F33B48E98"/>
faint and feeble, that you muſt apply your ear almoſt to her mouth, before you can underſtand the ſubject.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would therefore, have you form yourſelf upon the example of your governeſs, who indeed, is one of the beſt readers I ever heard. She reads with the ſame eaſy natural voice as ſhe uſes in converſation. She obſerves the ſtops and pauſes with great exactneſs. She reads ſo ſlow as to be eaſily underſtood by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who will give a proper attention, and is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely dull; and yet ſo faſt, as not to diſguſt thoſe of the quickeſt apprehenſion. Her voice ſhe carefully adapts to the number and extent of her audience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When ſhe reads to a large company, her voice is high without being ſhrill; when to a ſmall one it is low, but withal diſtinct. In a word, ſhe is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete miſtreſs of the art of reading; and you cannot fail to become ſo too, if you imitate her manner, and follow her directions. There are, beſides, ſome niceties in reading; which I am afraid are above your comprehenſion at preſent; but when you are farther advanced in your learning, I will explain them to you in ſome future letter. Your papa, your brothers, and ſiſters join me in offering our love to you.</p>

God grant I may prove as good a woman as you wiſh me to be! it ſhall always be my endeavour to become ſuch. I live very happily; my ſchool fellows are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fond of me, and Mrs. Bromley is very kind and careful. I am learning Engliſh, ſewing, writing, cyphering, and dancing: and Mrs. Bromley ſays I ſhall ſoon begin to learn French.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would have written to you before now; but, you know, you forbade me, at parting, to ſend you any letters, till I could write a pretty good hand. I am afraid you will think it ſtill very indifferent; but I have written as well as I could, and, I hope I ſhall improve daily. I have followed your directions in ſpelling; for I have ſcarce written one word without looking for it in the dictionary which you ſent me, and for which I am obliged to you: but if I have made any miſtakes, you will be ſo good as to let me know in your next letter.

I am glad that Mrs. Bromley gives you ſo favourable an account of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs I make in muſic: perhaps it is more than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.

gives you greater pleaſure than to hear of my improvement: ſo, you may be aſſured, nothing gives me ſo great pleaſure as to receive your approbation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For, though I am ſenſible of the uſefulneſs and importance of all the different accompliſhments, which you recommend to me; yet if I know my own heart, I think it is rather from a proſpect of making you happy, than from any regard to my own intereſt, that I apply to my learning with ſo much pleaſure and dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. How happy am I in having a mother, who places her chief delight in the welfare of her children! God grant I may never render myſelf unworthy of ſo good a parent! I hope I never ſhall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have been learning French for a conſiderable time paſt, and my maſter ſeems to be very well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with my progreſs.

               <p n="1">1. I HAD, lately, the pleaſure of hearing from Mrs. Bromley, that you are daily improving in all the different branches of your education, and particularly
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037446_0100_100D0D78D447B620"/>
in geography, which, ſhe ſays, you have been learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome months paſt. This is an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equally uſeful and genteel; but in which, I am ſorry to ſay it, moſt of our ſex are ſhamefully defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; as I could prove by a variety of examples. Your aunt Delaval has frequently aſked me whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople lay in Aſia or Africa, and a thouſand other queſtions no leſs ridiculous. Miſs Fenton, whoſe wit is greater than her knowledge, and her vanity greater than both, is perpetually committing blunders of this kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. Grenville happened, the other day, to be reading the news-papers to a large company, and, among other articles one from Warſaw, giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a certain nobleman, who, for ſome ſlight cauſe, had divorced his lady. He had no ſooner finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than Miſs, with her uſual forwardneſs, obſerved that theſe Spaniards were the worſt huſbands in the world. Some of the company ſmiled, others bluſhed, and the reſt remained demurely grave. Miſs, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her error, was confounded and abaſhed. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e gentleman, out of his great humanity, endeavoured to apologize for her, as well as he could, by adding, that the young lady's remark was very juſt; that, tho the place mentioned in the news-papers was the chief city of Poland, he believed there was a town of the ſame name ſomewhere in Spain, and it was a very eaſy matter to miſtake the one for the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Into ſuch ſhameful blunders do young ladies fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall, from their ignorance of geography; and to ſuch pitiful ſhifts muſt their friends have recourſe to ſave them the bluſh of confeſſing their ignorance. But the knowledge of geography will effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your committing any blunders of this kind, as it will teach you the names of all the principal towns in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orld. Nor is this all; it will further acquaint
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:037446_0101_100D0D42E5CD5E40"/>
you with the climate, the ſoil, and produce of all the different parts of the earth; and with the cuſtoms, manners, government, and religion of the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; by which means you will be enabled to talk pertinently on moſt ſubjects that occur in converſation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But there is ſtill a higher part of geography, which, however, I dont think to be above the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a young lady; I mean that which treats of the figure of the ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h; of its turning round its own axis once in twenty-four hours, which occaſions the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of day and night; and round the ſun once a year, which cauſes the regular changes of the ſeaſons: beſides a variety of other truths, equally curious and entertaining, which will greatly open and enlarge your mind, and free it from a thouſand prejudices, that cloud the minds of the ignorant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What an infinite pleaſure it is for a lady to ſit in her own room, and, by the uſe of the globe or maps, to examine all the various parts of the earth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſweetneſs of your temper, and your great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the needle. To ſay that I was glad on this occaſion, is flat and unmeaning: I was over-joyed: I felt an emotion of pleaſure, known only to thoſe who have a daughter whom they love with the ſame warmth of affection. Go on, my dear Sophy, thus to increaſe the happineſs of your mother, by conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own intereſt; and, indeed, you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult it more effectually, than by making yourſelf a complete miſtreſs of the needle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For though there are many other female accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments more ſhowy and ſpecious, yet there is not any one more uſeful; nay, I may venture to ſay, there is none equally ſo. What an infinite number of the female ſex, and, perhaps, the moſt virtuous part of it too, live by the needle! How greatly does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to render our perſons more decent, more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and more beautiful! What a ſurpriſing differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is there between the appearance of Lady Morton whom you have often ſeen at church, &amp; Dol Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the cinderwench. And yet this difference is chiefly owing to dreſs; and dreſs depends chiefly on the needle. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as you advance, you will have ſuch patterns ſet you for ſewing, as will, at once, entertain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your fancy, and enable you the better to learn the art of drawing, which is one of the higheſt parts of your education.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After all, my dear, I do not deſire you to apply to your needle ſo as to hurt your eyes, or weaken your conſtitution: far from it. On the contrary, I would have this, and all your other ſtudies, carried on in a perfect conſiſtency with your health, which is never to be ſacrificed to any conſideration whatever. All I mean is, that you ſhould not neglect this qualification as uſeleſs, nor deſpiſe it as mean, or beneath a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman. Uſeleſs it cannot be, for there is no ſtation
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:037446_0103_100D0D4535196240"/>

               </opener>
               <p n="1">1. I HAVE received ſeveral letters from you of late; and indeed nothing gives me ſo much pleaſure; as they contain an account of your own welfare, and that of the reſt of the family, with the moſt tender ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of love, and the beſt directions for purſuing my ſtudies. How ſhall I ever repay the obligations you are daily laying upon me! I never can; nor do you expect it. The only return, I know, which you deſire, is, that I ſhould, at laſt, become a virtuous and accompliſhed woman; and, if I do not, I muſt certainly be reckoned the moſt inexcuſable creature in the world; as few are bleſſed with ſo many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But, I hope, you ſhall never have reaſon to complain of my negligence: I am ſure you never ſhall of my want of duty and obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I enjoy a very good ſtate of health, and am as happy as I could wiſh in every reſpect. Mrs. Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley is very agreeable in her behaviour, and very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in her commands, except that, I think ſhe is rather too ſtrict and peremptory with regard to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of cleanlineſs: for we muſt, every day, appear
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037446_0104_100D0D7D898600E8"/>
at dinner, as neat and clean as if we were going to church. Now this conſumes a great deal of time, which, I imagine, might be employed to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Pleaſe to give me your advice on this ſubject in your next letter. I have no more to add, but to offer my duty to my papa and you, and my love to my brothers and ſiſters.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>My dear Sophy,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p n="1">1. YOUR laſt letter, which I received ſome weeks ago, gave me the greateſt pleaſure. You are as much improved in your writing as I could have wiſhed; and more indeed than I could have expected. Your expreſſions of duty and obedience are extremely agreeable: they, at once, diſcover a good heart and a clear head. Do not make yourſelf uneaſy, my dear, becauſe you can never repay the favours I have done you. I am repaid already. I enjoy as much pleaſure in beſtowing, as you can poſſibly do in receiving them; and, if I ſhould have the additional happineſs to ſee you become a polite and virtuous woman, I ſhall be doubly rewarded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To receive favours from a ſtranger, indeed, which we can never return, is always diſagreeable, and ſometimes dangerous. But, with parent and child, the caſe is very different. The connexion between them is ſo cloſe by nature, that all the good offices in the world can hardly make it cloſer. I am glad to hear that you live ſo happily. It is no more than I had reaſon to expect, from the ſweetneſs of your own diſpoſition, and the prudence of your governeſs; and I ſhould be ſorry if you conſidered her orders, with
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037446_0105_100D0D47635FAA00"/>
regard to cleanlineſs, as any diminution of your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; for ſhe is certainly in the right.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Cleanlineſs, my dear, is a habit, I had almoſt ſaid a virtue, which you cannot learn too ſoon, nor retain too long, both from a regard to yourſelf, and to the world around you. It will, at once, contribute to the eaſe and health of your body, and be the means of introducing you into polite and genteel company; at leaſt, the oppoſite extreme of dirtineſs will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprive you of that advantage; it will either make your company to be ſhunned; or, if that cannot be done, it will always render your preſence diſagreeable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But beware, my dear, that you do not confound cleanlineſs with finery; nor miſtake the one for the other. They are as diſtinct in their nature as any two things can well be; and, though not inconſiſtent, are frequently found to be ſeparated. A woman may be very neat and clean, in a plain and ſimple dreſs; and ſhe may be very dirty and tawdry, in a fine and coſtly one. There is Miſs Moleſworth: She never wears any thing above a plain ſilk gown; but that, and all the other parts of her dreſs, which are equally ſimple, ſhe puts on and adjuſts with ſuch elegance and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as pleaſes the eye of every one that beholds her: whilſt Lady Dormer, on the contrary, though dreſt in the richeſt ſatin brocade, and loaded with a profuſion of jewels and pearls, is, after all, ſo ſlovenly and taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, that ſhe may rather be ſaid to <hi>carry</hi> her clothes like a porter, than to <hi>wear</hi> them like a well-dreſt lady.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I therefore expect you will obey your governeſs's orders in this, and in every thing elſe, becauſe I am confident ſhe will never order you to do any thing but what is juſt and reaſonable, But you ſay, it conſumes a great deal of time: I am perſuaded you will always find as much as you ought to beſtow (in order to be near) between the time that is uſual for leaving off
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:037446_0106_100D0D7FB18B8090"/>
ſchool, and that of going to dinner. Beſides, it will, every day, require leſs, for the more you practiſe it, the eaſier it will become; and a twelve month hence, I dare ſay, you will be able to dreſs yourſelf as well in half an hour, as you can do, at preſent, in a whole one. You may likewiſe conſider it as a kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or relaxation from more ſerious buſineſs; and diverſions, you know, of one ſort or other, you muſt have. Your papa, your brothers and ſiſters join in love to you.</p>

               </opener>
               <p n="1">1. I RECEIVED your very kind letter, and am greatly obliged to you for your good advice, which I ſhall ever conſider in the light of a command. I think myſelf bound in duty to obey all your orders; whether I underſtand the reaſonableneſs of them or not; tho ever ſince I was capable to diſtinguiſh right from wrong, you have always had the good-nature and condeſcenſion to convince me, that whatever you deſired me to do was for my own intereſt and advantage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is ſtill another particular, in which I muſt beg your advice; as I am reſolved to do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your permiſſion. What I mean is the choice of my friends: for, though we are commonly all in the ſame room, yet I have no more than a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with any one of my fellow boarders. I have not contracted a friendſhip and intimacy with any one of them. I might indeed have done it long ago. I have had frequent opportunities. I have been invited, and even importuned to it. But, ſenſible of my own incapacity to judge for myſelf, I have decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:037446_0107_100D0D498E212448"/>

               <p n="3">3. I do not chooſe to find fault with the behaviour of any of my companions. They are all as good, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are better than I am; and, I know, you would condemn any thing that had the leaſt appearance of detraction. But ſtill, I muſt own, there are three or four of them, for whom I have a particular eſteem. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </opener>
               <p n="1">1. HOW ſhall I expreſs the joy I received from the peruſal of your laſt letter! how happy am I in having a daughter, who, at an age, when moſt young ladies imagine they can think and act for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is ſo humble and dutiful, as to undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the permiſſion and advice of her mother! But can't I conceal my joy within my own breaſt?— Or, if it muſt have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent, can't I be ſatisfied with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting it to others? Why tell it to my daughter? Why, my dear, I tell it to you for two reaſons; both
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:037446_0108_100D0D81906FBBB0"/>
becauſe I like to think of you, and talk to you, and alſo becauſe I am perſuaded it will be an additional mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to your perſevering in the ſame virtuous courſe. For, I believe, you have ſuch a tender regard for my happineſs, that, when once you know how greatly it depends on your good behaviour, you will never leſſen it by a contrary conduct.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And now, after this flow of parental affection, I come to give you my beſt advice with regard to the choice of your friends. This, my dear, is one of the moſt important ſteps in life, and ſhould be conducted with the greateſt prudence; otherwiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſource of happineſs and pleaſure, as it may and ought to be, it will prove the occaſion of much pain and uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The firſt thing then, and indeed the principal thing, to be conſidered, in the choice of your friend, is, that ſhe be entirely free from all manner of vice, and from foibles too, as much as poſſible; for if ſhe is not, you will be in danger of being corrupted by her bad example. We naturally, and, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly contract the manners of thoſe with whom we converſe. In a vicious example, eſpecially, there is a kind of contagion, which rages like a plague, and inſects all thoſe who are within the reach of its bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence. It undermines our virtue impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. It ſteals upon us unawares, and takes us by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is an old proverb to this purpoſe, which is not the leſs true for being common, viz. "that birds of a feather flock together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" by which I think is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally underſtood, that perſons of the ſame ſentiments and character are apt to aſſociate with one another. But, I apprehend, it will likewiſe bear this conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is not ſo commonly attended to, that, let their tempers and diſpoſitions be ever ſo different when
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:037446_0109_100D0D4B34050828"/>
they meet, yet, by a long and intimate acquaintance, they will, in the end, become nearly alike.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But, leſt you ſhould not be able to apply gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rules to particular caſes, I ſhall point out ſome of the vices and foibles, which you ought chiefly to guard againſt in the choice of a friend. Above all things, then, let her be free from falſehood and deceit, from hypocriſy and diſſimulation. Let her be open, honeſt and ſincere, in all her actions. Sincerity is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it is the ſoul of friendſhip; without this it cannot poſſibly exiſt. For how can you cultivate a friendſhip with one who is always endeavoring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you? Upon whom you cannot depend for the truth of any word ſhe ſpeaks, or the ſincerity of any action ſhe performs? A friendſhip with ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if indeed there could be any, would be alarmed and diſturbed by perpetual fears and ſuſpicions, which are utterly inconſiſtent with the nature of this ſacred union.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Flattery is another vice, nearly a-kin to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and no leſs an enemy to friendſhip. It conſiſts in praiſing us for accompliſhments which we do not poſſeſs, and in concealing or extenuating the faults of which we are, unhappily, guilty. By the former we are puffed up with a ridiculous pride; by the latter we are lulled into a dangerous, and often fatal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is the part of a true friend, on the contrary, to inform us of all our foibles and imperfections, and to give us all the aſſiſtance in her power to correct and amend them. For how elſe can we acquire a thorough knowledge of ourſelves?</p>
               <p n="7">7. The vice directly oppoſed to flattery is calumny and detraction. It is, of all others, the moſt odious in its nature, the moſt pernicious in its effects, and the moſt inconſiſtent with friendſhip. A friend! can that honourable name be beſtowed upon one, whoſe
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:037446_0110_100D0D83302DA228"/>
whole life is ſpent in the low and dirty arts of ſcandal and defamation? whoſe greateſt pleaſure it is to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and ſully the reputation of every perſon ſhe knows. To contract a friendſhip with one of this temper, would argue the height of folly. You might then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have all your foibles and weakneſſes expoſed to the view of the whole world, and your character loaded with a thouſand blemiſhes, from which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it is entirely free: like the ſilly clown in the fable, who finding a ſnake in the fields, chill'd and benumb'd with cold, put it in his boſom; but no ſooner was it recruited by the genial warmth of his body, than it ſtung him to the quick, and made him pay dear for his ill-judged humanity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Your friend ſhould likewiſe be free from pride, vanity, and ſelf-conceit. For one that is immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of herſelf, is not likely to be very fond of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſhe that has a high opinion of her own accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, will probably have but a very low opinion of yours. There is nobody, ſhe imagines, ſo virtuous as to deſerve her affection, or ſo ſenſible as to merit her eſteem; and without eſteem and affection there can be no friendſhip.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let her have nothing awkward, ridiculous, or affected in her manner. If ſhe has, beſides the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being infected by her example, you will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be put to the bluſh on her account. For one bluſhes for her friend almoſt as naturally as for herſelf.</p>
               <p>And now, my dear, having thus mentioned ſome of the principal vices and foibles, from which your friend ought to be free, I ſhould next proceed to conſider thoſe virtues and good qualities, which ſhe ought to poſſeſs: but this ſhall be the ſubject of another letter. In the mean time I conclude, by recommending you to the divine protection, and am,</p>

                  <salute>My dear Sophy,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p n="1">1. AS I would not wiſh to leave you long undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a matter of ſo much conſequence as the choice of a friend, I have taken the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, you ſee, of reſuming the ſubject; and ſhall now endeavour to point out thoſe virtues and good qualities which you ought chiefly to regard in her character.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, then, my dear, let her be one who is dutiful to her parents: for ſhe that is undutiful to her parents, will never be faithful to you. She that is deficient in this moſt important of all duties, is not likely to be very obſervant of any other. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, from a young lady's behaviour in this reſpect, you may form a pretty juſt notion of her character in general; for one that is ſo ungrateful, ſo unnatural, as to have thrown off all reſpect and deference to her parents, may, and probably will, run into every other kind of vice and wickedneſs. Such a perſon, I hope, you will never make your friend. With ſuch a one I would not even have you to keep company. If you do, you may be worſe for it: it is impoſſible you can ever be the better.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another eſſential ingredient in the character of a true friend, is humanity and good nature; a certain ſweetneſs of diſpoſition and equality of mind, not to be ruffled by every trifling accident, nor ſoured by any misfortune. A perſon, bleſſed with this happy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, poſſeſſes within herſelf a perpetual fund of cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and good humour, and diffuſes joy and gladneſs wherever ſhe comes. Pleaſed with herſelf, ſhe is the more apt to be pleaſed with thoſe around her. Slow to anger, ſhe is not provoked by ſlight offences; and ready to forgive, ſhe never harbours reſentment in her breaſt. As ſhe is happy in her own mind, ſhe delights to communicate happineſs to others; and, therefore,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:037446_0112_100D0DBBDAE72178"/>
is willing to cultivate a friendſhip with any perſon, that ſeems deſerving of her confidence. And, as ſhe is ſteady and uniform in her conduct, ſhe never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes her old friends, unleſs, by their folly or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, they have forfeited all claim to any further regard.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In a word, without good-nature, there can be no ſuch thing as friendſhip. The ill-natured, the peeviſh, and the paſſionate, are utterly unqualified for this virtuous intercourſe. A heart over-run with theſe vicious paſſions, is not ſuſceptible of ſuch fine and delicate feelings. Friendſhip is a tender plant, and will not grow in ſuch a coarſe and uncultivated ſoil. A paſſionate perſon; in the violence of her anger, or rather madneſs, will ſay and do a thouſand things which are intirely inconſiſtent with all the laws of friendſhip; and the misfortune is, that every trifle is ſufficient to rouſe her paſſion. The breaking of a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na diſh, the treading on a lap-dog, any thing will do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fuel is within her, and the leaſt ſpark will kindle the fire, and blow it up into a flame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Secreſy, my dear, is another quality, which your friend ought to poſſeſs. She that cannot keep a ſecret, can never be a true friend. For what is a friend? It is one to whom we can unboſom ourſelves without reſerve; to whom we can impart all our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts, wiſhes and deſigns, without the leaſt fear of being betrayed, or having them expoſed to the view of the world. Secrets are of two ſorts; thoſe which we would not diſcloſe from the motives of ſhame, and thoſe which we would not diſcover from the dictates of prudence. Of the former kind, I am perſuaded, you have none as yet; I hope you will never have any. Of the latter, I ſuppoſe, you have ſome already, and the longer you live, you will have the more. But to betray either the one or the other
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037446_0113_100D0D88DFF077C8"/>
is equally unworthy the character of a friend, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually injurious to us; and ſhe that has acted ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once, ſhould never have it in her power to deceive us again.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next thing, my dear Sophy, to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the choice of a friend, is, that her ſentiments and diſpoſitions be nearly the ſame with your own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwiſe you can never agree. If you are fond of buſineſs, and ſhe of diverſions if you love to ſtay at home, and ſhe to be always gadding abroad; if you delight in plainneſs and ſimplicity, and ſhe in pomp and ſplendour; if you are pleaſed with ſenſible and ſerious converſation, and ſhe with nothing but fun and frolic; if you are fond of reading, and ſhe of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; if you are happy in peace and quietneſs, and ſhe only in crowds and company.—In a word, if you love what ſhe hates, and if ſhe likes what you abhor, there can be no concord and agreement, no ſympathy of temper, no harmony of ſentiment, no mutual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and without mutual happineſs, friendſhip can not exiſt</p>
               <p n="6">6. After all, my dear, a perfect ſimilarity of taſte and ſentiment is not to be expected (our minds being as different as our faces) nor, indeed, could it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, do I think it ought to be deſired. The faireſt characters are ſtained with many ſpots and blemiſhes. The moſt virtuous perſons have many foibles and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections hanging about them, which they are not likely ever to correct, by converſing only with thoſe of their own caſt and complexion. Should the grave converſe only with the grave, would they not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be in danger of ſinking into dullneſs? If the gay and ſprightly keep company with none but thoſe of the ſame humour, will they not frequently be apt to ſoar into—mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s? By the ſame practice, the frugal would probably become avaricious, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:037446_0114_100D0DBE0C6BEE80"/>
prodigal and profuſe. It is therefore, my dear, an inſtance of the greateſt wiſdom, to cultivate a friendſhip and acquaintance with thoſe, who are poſſeſſed of ſuch virtues and good qualities as are moſt oppoſite to our own weakneſſes and foibles. Are we ſubject to melancholy and low ſpirits? let our friend be a perſon of cheerfulneſs and good humour. Are we, on the other hand, too much addicted to levity and mirth? let our friend be more ſerious and ſedate. Are we naturally hot and paſſionate? let us chooſe a friend of a cool and calm diſpoſition.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let me, therefore, beſeech you, my dear Sophy, by the regard you have for your own happineſs, and what, I believe, you value no leſs, by the regard you have for mine, to be very cautious and careful in the choice of your friend. As you have a great deal of ſpirit and vivacity, let her be ſomething more compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſedate. As, I know, you are very generous and open hearted, let her be more frugal and prudent. In a word, let her poſſeſs, as much as poſſible, all thoſe virtues and good qualities, which you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that you yourſelf moſt want. Your papa, your ſiſters and brothers, join me in wiſhing you all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of happineſs.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I HAVE all your letters on the ſubject of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip lying by me, and have read them ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſo carefully, that, I believe, I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt repeat them by heart.

I never imagined that ſo many qualifications were neceſſary to form the character of a true friend; but, upon reflection, I am fully convinced it muſt be ſo, and that every thing you have ſaid is founded in reaſon and good ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is one young lady here, and indeed but one, who ſeems to anſwer the character you have drawn. She is, I think, free from all the vices and foibles, and poſſeſſed of all the virtues and good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which you have deſcribed. Beſides, ſhe has always taken a particular pleaſure in my company and converſation, as, indeed, I have ever done in hers. We have a mutual regard and eſteem for each other, which it ſhall not be my fault if I do not ſoon improve into a ſettled and confirmed friendſhip. And, what is a very lucky circumſtance, ſhe is to leave the board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſchool, and come to town much about the ſame time with me, which you ſaid would be in a few months.

It is true, ſhe is pleaſed to compliment us by ſaying, that we ſeldom tranſgreſs againſt any of theſe virtues, but alleges, at the ſame time, that we do not ſufficiently underſtand their real nature and importance, nor how abſolutely neceſſary it is to poſſeſs and practiſe them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For how ſhould ſhe, who vainly thinks ſhe is wiſe and learned enough already, ever endeavour to become more ſo? How ſhould ſhe, who fondly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="3">3. Your aunt's lectures, my dear (as you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call them) on temperance, chaſtity, modeſty, humility, charity, benevolence, and the like, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely proper and neceſſary. Theſe are virtues, which it is the duty of every young lady diſtinctly to underſtand, and carefully to practiſe: they are, as your aunt juſtly obſerves, the glory and ornament of the female ſex: they add an inexpreſſible grace and luſtre to all our other qualifications and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and without them, wit, beauty, knowledge, and learning are not only uſeleſs and inſignificant, but what is ſtill worſe, pernicious and deſtructive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A beautiful perſon, with a vicious mind, is no better than a painted ſepulchre, fair and comely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but ugly and deformed within. A wit, without humanity and good-nature, is a peſt and nuiſance; like a venomous waſp, or poiſonous ſerpent, ſhe ſtings and bites every one ſhe meets, without diſtinction of friend or foe. And a perſon of knowledge and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without humility and modeſty, is generally a va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, conceited, and prattling pedant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. On the other hand, a beautiful young lady, if ſhe in virtuous at the ſame time, becomes by that means,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:037446_0119_100D0D8E742A5EC0"/>
at once more virtuous and more beautiful: more vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, becauſe her temptations to vice are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſtrong; and every time ſhe reſiſts theſe temptations, ſhe gives the moſt convincing proof of her untainted chaſtity and unſpotted honour: more beautiful; for what is beauty? It is not a ſet of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures formed with the niceſt ſymmetry and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is not a complexion compoſed of the pureſt red and white: no; but it is both theſe informed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, lighted up, and animated by the emanations of a virtuous mind: it is chaſtity, modeſty, good-nature, compaſſion, benevolence, and all the other virtuous diſpoſitions and tender affections ſtreaming forth from the eyes, thoſe windows of the ſoul, and playing in every lineament of the face. Unleſs theſe virtuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> prevail in the ſoul, and are ſtrongly marked and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the countenance, the fineſt features and complexion are little better than the face of a painted baby, or lifeleſs ſtatue: all is dull, dead, and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; or, what is ſtill worſe, gloomy, ſour, and ſullen.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence the graceful bluſh of modeſty, and the pleaſing ſmile of good-nature, ſo frequently and ſo awkwardly affected by thoſe who are poſſeſſed of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe virtues, but perhaps are remarkable for the oppoſite vices: no matter, they are paying a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to virtue; they confeſs, by their hypocr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſy and diſſimulation, that the appearance of it is amiable and lovely; and if the appearance of it be lovely, how much more muſt the reality be ſo? The truth is, virtue is the only thing that is good and amiable:— ſenſe, wit, knowledge, and learning, are in their own nature, indifferent; they are either good or bad, juſt as they are well or ill employed. In the hands of a virtuous perſon, they may be the means of much good, in the hands of a vicious perſon, they may be the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:037446_0120_100D0DC5966AE058"/>
means of much ill: but, virtue, in its own nature and conſequences, is certainly and infallibly productive of happineſs, as well to the perſon poſſeſſed of it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as to the world in general.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence too, my dear, you will eaſily perceive what, I believe, you never dreamed of before, that no young lady can be beautiful without virtue. This opinion; I dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſay, will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e you ſtare.—What! are there not ſeveral ladies in London, who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all title to virtue and honour, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are reckoned among the greateſt beauties of the age? are courted, careſſed, and almoſt adored, by crowds of young gentlemen. But ſoftly, my dear, and don't be in ſuch a hurry; allow me only to aſk you a ſingle queſtion: what is the character of theſe ſame young gentlemen? are they men of ſenſe, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taſte, learning, knowledge, and virtue? or, are they not rather the vain, the ignorant, the ſilly, and fooliſh, a parcel of empty coxcombs, and abandoned debauchees?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Why, as for that, you'll ſay, you can't anſwer. But if you cannot anſwer for that, my dear, how can you be ſure, whether theſe ladies are beautiful or not? For if the young gentlemen, that admire and adore them ſo much, are not proper judges of beauty, all their praiſes and compliments go for nothing; they are but mere empty ſound, without ſenſe or meaning.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, my dear, a deaf perſon were to tell you, that Miſs Manley had a charming voice: or a blind one, that Lady Aſton had a fine complexion; would you believe them, pray? No, you'll reply; becauſe the one having loſt the ſenſe of hearing, can be no judge of ſounds; and the other, having loſt the ſenſe of ſeeing, can be no judge of colours: and ſo far you are right.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now, what if I ſhould undertake to prove that
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:037446_0121_100D0D91DEC24098"/>
theſe young gentlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n are almoſt as improper judges of beauty, as the deaf perſon is of ſounds, or the blind one of colours? that they have either loſt entirely, or at leaſt greatly corrupted and depraved, thoſe fine and delicate feelings, which alone can diſtinguiſh true and genuine beauty, from that which is falſe and ſpurious. I don't pretend, my dear, to be a philoſopher, and tho I were, I know it would be extremely improper to entertain you with abſtruſe and refined ſpeculations: which, perhaps, you could not underſtand, or, if you did, could be of no real uſe to you in the conduct of life. But this, I imagine, is a thing, which is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to common ſenſe: and, beſides, it may be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to you, as it will teach you what opinion to form of theſe empty fellows, and to pay no greater defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their judgment than it deſerves.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Allow me, therefore, to aſk you a few queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and you'll find that your own anſwers will prove the point in diſpute. Firſt of all then, my dear, do you think it poſſible for a perſon, who has loſt all ſenſe of chaſtity and modeſty himſelf, to be a proper judge of the expreſſions of theſe virtues in others? 'Tis abſolutely impoſſible!</p>
               <p n="11">11. For it may be affirmed in general, that every deviation from the paths of virtue, every indulgence in criminal pleaſure, has a natural tendency to vitiate the taſte, to corrupt the heart, and to ſtifle and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh all the finer feelings and affections of the mind. A perſon immerſed in ſenſual pleaſure, grows leſs and leſs rational every day: he degenerates by quick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till at laſt he ſinks down into a mere animal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and loſes all reliſh for every thing that is virtuous, noble, and manly.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MY time for ſome months paſt has been ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely engroſſed with company and buſineſs, that I have been obliged, in ſome meaſure, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt my epiſtolary correſpondence. But now being ſomewhat more at leiſure, I ſhall reſume the ſubject of your education.</p>
               <p>In my two laſt letter, you know, I endeavoured to explain to you, as well as I could, the nature of temperance, and to convince you of the great utility and importance of that virtue. In this I ſhall give you my ſentiments of another virtue, which is, no leſs, or rather, which is infinitely more neceſſary; nay, I will venture to ſay, which is the moſt neceſſary and indiſpenſible of all others, and without which, wit, beauty, ſenſe, knowledge, and every other female ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, are not only uſeleſs, but even perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and deſtructive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You will eaſily gueſs, my dear, that the virtue I mean is chaſtity, the greateſt glory and ornament of our ſex, and what moſt effectually recommends us to the love and eſteem of the other. Perhaps I may be accuſed of indelicacy, in entertaining a lady, ſo very young as you are, with a diſcourſe on ſuch a tender ſubject; though, I think, the character I bear as your mother, and conſequently the concern I muſt have for your happineſs, may well free me from any imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kind: for I do not ſee how any thing can be called indelicate, which a virtuous mother can write to a virtuous daughter. Beſides, as it will be allowed to be extremely difficult, and, perhaps, even impoſſible, to fix the preciſe time when a young lady ſhould receive inſtructions on this head, every mother of conſequence is left, in a great meaſure, to follow her own judgment; and, I muſt confeſs, it is my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:037446_0123_100D0D9382E15DA0"/>
that it is much better to be a whole year too early, than one day too late: the inconveniences of the former method, if indeed there be any, are very trifling and inconſiderable; but the bad effects of the latter are always dangerous, and frequently fatal and irreparable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Young as you are, my dear, you cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what I mean by the virtue of chaſtity: and therefore I ſhall obſerve the rules of delicacy ſo far, as not to explain the nature of it more particularly. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me only to mention a few things, which may ſerve to convince you of its ineſtimable value; and to give you a few plain directions, by the obſervance of which, you may eaſily preſerve it pure and untainted.</p>
               <p>Whilſt a young lady is poſſeſſed of this virtue, ſhe is bleſſed with the approbation of her own conſcience, beloved and careſſed by her friends and relations, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed and reſpected by all her acquaintance. But if, by ſome unlucky and fatal accident, ſhe is once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this precious jewel, that moment ſhe loſes all inward peace and tranquility of mind; ſhe is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and abandoned by her neareſt friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſhe is deſpiſed and contemned, hiſſed and hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yow know, my dear, the once happy, but now wretched Miſs Grey. She was poſſeſſed of wit, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſenſe, knowledge, character, and fortune, in as high a degree, as moſt young ladies in England; but ſhe was—my heart bleeds when I think on her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable fate—ſhe was decoyed, deceived, and at laſt abandoned by a perfidious and inhuman villain. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from her father's houſe, deſerted by her friends, ſhunned by her acquaintance, and thrown on the wide world! what could ſhe do? or whither could ſhe go? Poverty, ſhame, infamy, and diſgrace, in their moſt hideous and ugly forms, ſtared her in the face, and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:037446_0124_100D0DCA49E74358"/>
drove the poor deſponding and diſtracted creature into a courſe of life, at the very thoughts of which ſhe would once have ſhuddered with horror. Her father ſtript her of her fortune, the world deprived her of her character, her wit degenerated into obſcenity, her beauty was changed into deformity, and her ſenſe and knowledge ſerved only to render her more dexterous and expert in the ways of vice and wickedneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In this picture, my dear, which is as true as it is terrible, you ſee the dangerous and deſtructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of lewdneſs and debauchery: tremble at the very thoughts of ſuch an abominable vice; and learn, from the folly and miſery of others, to be wiſe, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and happy yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Do not imagine, my dear, that what I have now ſaid is only my own private opinion: no; it is, and ever has been, the opinion of the wiſe and good, in all ages and nations of the world. In ſome particular countries eſpecially, this virtue of chaſtity has been held in ſuch high repute and eſtimation, that rather than loſe it, or ſurvive the loſs of it, ſome have even choſen to be deprived of life itſelf.</p>

I dare ſay, my dear, you have heard the common obſervation, that chaſtity is as neceſſary and ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in a woman, as courage is in a man: but, in fact, it is infinitely more ſo. For though perhaps a coward may be as contemptible among the men, as a proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is among the women, ſtill there is this material difference between the two caſes, that if a man loſes his character for want of courage, in one inſtance, he may, by ſome extraordinary effort of valour, recover i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not floods of tears,—not whole years of ſorrow and repentance,—not the moſt conſtant prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all the other virtues of a good life,—not even the moſt rigid obſervance of the rules of chaſtity for the future,—nothing will avails; they can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her loſt reputation, nor replace her in the rank of pure veſtals.</p>

My aunt, I believe, who carefully inſpects every part of my conduct, will do me the juſtice to acknowledge, that I have always been pretty obſervant of both theſe virtues. The rules of temperance, I think, I have never tranſgreſſed in any material inſtance; and, I am ſure, I never had the leaſt inclination, nor ever diſcovered the leaſt propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to violate thoſe of chaſtity. But, I muſt confeſs at the ſame time, that till the receipt of your letters, I never underſtood the nature of theſe virtues ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, nor was ſo fully convinced of their great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and importance. Your laſt letter, eſpecially, has made ſuch a deep impreſſion upon my mind, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I could now ſacrifice every thing to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my chaſtity: rather than loſe my honour, I would cheerfully loſe my life.</p>

The ſhort but affecting hiſtory you wrote me of her miſerable fate, pierced me to the very heart,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:037446_0129_100D0D99B648CA20"/>
and made the tears guſh into my eyes: I am ſure I ſhall never forget it ſo long as I live.</p>
               <p>But, my dear mamma, what I have chiefly to beg of you at preſent, is, that you will be ſo good as to write me your ſentiments of the virtue of modeſty, which I think you gave me ſome reaſon to expect by what you ſaid in the cloſe of your laſt letter.

This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe will not allow to be a ſufficient apology; for though ignorance, ſhe ſays, be leſs criminal than impudence, yet it is far from being excuſable in young ladies of our age and education.

Modeſty, my dear, is the outward expreſſion of a pure and chaſte mind: and therefore, every w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> you ſpeak, every action you perform, every geſture of your body, every look of your eyes, every part of your dreſs; in fine, every thing, by which the inward diſpoſitions of the mind can be expreſſed and diſcovered, comes under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of this virtue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Modeſty, as it relates to dreſs, has already been conſidered under that article: as it relates to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, it has been, in ſome meaſure explained, in treating of that and the ſubject of chaſtity. After the advice I then gave you, to ſhun the lewd and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt converſation of others, it would certainly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to uſe any other arguments to diſſuade you from running into the ſame error yourſelf. There is ſomething in this practice ſo baſe and vulgar, as well as ſo, indecent and abominable, that I will not even ſuppoſe you capable of a thing at once ſo unpolite and immoral.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But, my dear, modeſty regards not only the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your converſation, but alſo the manner of it; not only what you ſay, but likewiſe how you ſay it. And, indeed, this is ſuch an eſſential part of modeſty, that it frequently appears more viſibly in the manner of expreſſing a thing than in the nature of the thing itſelf. There is Lady Langley; ſhe returns thanks for a favour, and to people as good as herſelf too, with ſuch a careleſs and indifferent, and ſometimes indeed with ſuch a haughty and overbearing air, that a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander, who only obſerves her manner, would be apt to conclude, that ſhe was rather beſtowing one upon ſome of her dependants, or giving orders to her foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:

This is very unbecoming even in a man, but much more in a woman, and moſt of all in a young woman, whoſe accent ſhould be low, ſmooth and gentle, an emblem of the inward ſoftneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of her mind.

frown, humility by an unaſſuming air, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by a wanton glance, modeſty by a chaſtifed mien, and ſo of the reſt. And though I am no great friend to phyſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gnomy, or the judging of people's characters by their looks, yet, I believe, there is ſomething in it. Tho I know the face is ſometimes a falſe glaſs, ſtill I am perſuaded it is as often, and much oftener, a true one; and that the countenance is frequently a faithful picture of the mind.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In a word, my dear (for I muſt repeat it to you again) the only way to have a modeſt look, a modeſt gait, or a modeſt behaviour in general, is to have a modeſt mind. Without this, all the formality, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and grimace in the world, will ſignify nothing: for, though by this means you may be able to impoſe upon the thoughtleſs and ignorant, yet the ſenſible and judicious obſerver will always ſee through the maſk, and perhaps but deſpiſe you the more for your hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical ſolemnity. But, my dear, do not miſtake me, While I adviſe you to be modeſt, I do not adviſe you to be ſheepiſh and baſhful; far from it. Modeſty and ſheepiſhneſs, however alike they may be in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are as different in their nature, as any two things can well be. A modeſt perſon will not talk too much or too high in company, becauſe ſhe knows it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper: a ſheepiſh perſon will hardly talk at all, or at leaſt not ſo as to be underſtood, becauſe ſhe is afraid. A modeſt perſon looks with a decent aſſurance: a ſheepiſh one is abaſhed, and bluſhes at ſhe don't know what. A modeſt perſon will never contradict the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral taſte of the company, unleſs it be inconſiſtent with decency and good manners: a ſheepiſh perſon will hardly contradict it, even when it is. The one acts from principle, the other from mere inſtinct: the one is guided by the rules of right reaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is conſiſtent in her conduct: the other is guide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:037446_0133_100D0D9D9896E048"/>
by no rules at all, and conſequently has no uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of character.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This ſheepiſhneſs naturally leads to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ends in, a kind of falſe modeſty, which is ſuch an extreme degree of complaiſance, ſuch a yielding ſoſtneſs of nature, as is not able to refuſe any thing. A perſon of this character has no choice of her own: ſhe reſigns her own judgment, and is content to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the judgment, or rather by the humour and caprice, of other people. When any thing is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe never examines whether it be reaſonable, but only whether it be faſhionable; and if it is, ſhe is ſatisfied: ſhe aſks no more: ſhe will comply with it, let the conſequence be what it will. She is aſhamed to refuſe any thing that is faſhionable, however vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; or to do any thing that is unfaſhionable, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever virtuous. Should it ever become unfaſhionable to go to church, or to be obedient to parents, or even to obſerve the rules of modeſty, it is ten to one but ſhe would be aſhamed to perform any of theſe duties; ſo that, from an exceſs of modeſty, ſhe perhaps might be tempted to violate the laws of modeſty itſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Let me, therefore, adviſe you, my dear Sophy, carefully to guard againſt falſe modeſty, which is one of the greateſt enemies of virtue, and perhaps has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed young people into as many vices as the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned impudence. Never be ſo extremely modeſt as to comply with any thing that is bad, how much ſoever it may be in vogue; nor ever be aſhamed to follow what is good, however ſingular and uncommon. True modeſty, my dear, is meant to be the preſerver, not the betrayer of your virtue: it will be a kind of guard and protection to your chaſtity; it will ſecure you from the rudeneſs and impertinence of the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and abandoned part of the other ſex. There is ſuch a dignity and majeſty in a modeſt behaviour, as
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:037446_0134_100D0DD5A138AB50"/>
never fails to command reſpect: it confounds and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhes even the moſt profligate, and makes them either aſhamed or afraid of giving vent to their low and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene ribaldry, when they are ſure it will be received with a bluſh or a frown, with contempt or averſion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. After all, my dear, I don't mean to recommend to you a ſtiff, formal, and preciſe behaviour, no: this is not modeſty; it is prudery, which is as far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from modeſty on the one hand, as coquetry is on the other. Modeſty does not need any foreign gloſs to ſet it off: it appears moſt amiable in its own native colours. The prude affects an appearance of more modeſty than ſhe really has: the coquette affects an appearance of leſs. The former will not probably gain credit: the latter certainly will: The prude will not be believed to poſſeſs ſo much modeſty as ſhe pretends to, perhaps not even ſo much as ſhe actually has: the coquette will readily be allowed to have no more than ſhe ſeems, and poſſibly even leſs. Since ſhe is ſo very anxious to convince the world, that ſhe has little regard for modeſty, the world, if ſhe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, will be ſo complaiſant, as to believe that ſhe has none at all; whereas they will puniſh the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prude, for putting on the appearance of more modeſty than ſhe has, by even ſuſpecting the reality of what ſhe actually poſſeſſes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The prude is ſo extremely nice and delicate, that ſhe is offended at every thing: the coquette is ſo very eaſy and indifferent, that ſhe is offended at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The prude ſtartles at the moſt innocent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as rude and indecent: the coquette hears what are really the moſt rude and indecent, without any concern. The prude has frequently a grave and demure look, when her heart is light and cheerful: the coquette has frequently a gay and ſprightly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, when her heart is heavy and ſorrowful. The
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037446_0135_100D0D9FCBEDFC50"/>
prude is often ſilent when ſhe ought to ſpeak: the coquette often ſpeaks, when ſhe ought to be ſilent. The prude frequently ſtays at home, when her heart is at the play or opera: the coquette frequently goes to the play or opera, when her heart is at home. In a word, the prude ſtudies to be ſingular; the coquette to be faſhionable: the former wants to paſs for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the moſt rigid virtue; the latter for an agreeable companion. The prude deſpiſes the coquette as a giddy fool: the coquette laughs at the prude as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited hypocrite; and the lady of true modeſty pities them both, as well meaning, perhaps, but miſtaken creatures. And objects of pity they certainly are;— for their error proceeds rather from the weakneſs of their heads, than the badneſs of their hearts.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The one imagines, that a prude is the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous character in the world, and that therefore the farther ſhe is from it, ſo much the better; the other thinks the character of a coquette ſtill more contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, and endeavours to ſhun it with the ſame care. Hence the one naturally becomes a coquette, and the other a prude; not ſo much from a love to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they have aſſumed, as from a hatred to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they have avoided. Thus, like all fools, while they fly from one vice, they run into its oppoſite, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remembering, that in this, as in moſt other caſes, virtue lies in the <hi>golden mean;</hi> that modeſty is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle point between coquetry and prudery, both of which are equally ridiculous and contemptible.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But, my dear, though the prude and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette be characters equally ridiculous, ſtill, it mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> be acknowledged, they are not equally dangerous.— The prude has at leaſt the appearance of modeſty but the coquette has not even that: and though ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> may be an appearance of virtue, where there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; yet 'tis hardly poſſible there can be any reality
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:037446_0136_100D0DD728300278"/>
where there is no appearance, or (what is worſe) where there is an appearance of vice: at leaſt the world will always judge ſo, becauſe it is only by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances they can judge.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that a prude frequently preſerves her reputation, after having loſt her innocence; whilſt a coquette ſometimes preſerves her innocence after ſhe has loſt her reputation. Beſides, the coquette is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to many temptations, from which the prude is, in a great meaſure, free. The behaviour of the prude keeps the men at a proper diſtance; the behaviour of the coquette admits, and even invites them to impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per familiarities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how very dangerous theſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities are, is more eaſily conceived than expreſſed: indeed it is from this quarter that our greateſt danger ariſes, as perhaps I may take occaſion to ſhew you in ſome other letter.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But, though the prude be expoſed to fewer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers than the coquette, ſtill ſhe is expoſed to ſome, and to many more than ſhe would be, were ſhe but ſimply and unaffectedly modeſt. For, as the world ſees that her modeſty is partly counterfeit, they will be apt to conclude that it is entirely ſo, and that it is aſſumed only to ſave appearances; and, upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, many attempts will be made on her virtue, which never would have been made, but for her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery and affectation. And, from a general review of the hiſtory of our ſex, I imagine, it will appear, that the arts of deſigning and deceitful men have ruined as many prudes as coquettes; and that almoſt all thoſe who have been thus ruined, have been remarkable for one or other of theſe foibles.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Let me therefore adviſe you, my dear Sophy, carefully to ſhun both theſe characters, as they are not only ridiculous, but (what is ſtill worſe) as they are dangerous. Never affect an appearance of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037446_0137_100D0DA290EDBD80"/>
gaiety on the one hand, nor of greater ſolemnity on the other, than true and unaffected modeſty requires. Endeavour to poſſeſs your mind with a deep ſenſe and a ſincere love of this virtue, and then look and act as nature directs. This, in my opinion, is the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible method of having a modeſt deportment. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, indeed, your behaviour may be compoſed, ſedate, formal, ceremonious, and what not; but it can never be truly and unaffectedly modeſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. DOROTHY SCHLOZER, is the daughter of Auguſtus Lewis Schlozer, profeſſor of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy in the Univerſity of Gottengen, and well known as an able politician and hiſtorian. She was born Auguſt 10, 1770, and in her earlieſt years, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an uncommon ſhare of underſtanding, which has been ſince improved by extraordinary application. Her father encouraged perhaps by the ſucceſs he met with in the care of the education of his preſent Lady, whom he inſtructed when only eight years of age, hath had the ſole direction of her ſtudies. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhe made in her infancy was very rapid. She ſoon learned to articulate, and at the age of two years and eight months, was taught low German, a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage almoſt foreign to her own, and plain needle
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:037446_0140_100D0DDB4AD48988"/>
work. Soon afterwards ſhe began the French, not by burthening her infant mind with Grammar rules, but by habituating her to converſe with a female ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a native of France, whom her mother engaged for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In her fifth year ſhe was taught to read German in its preſent purity, by books compoſed for her amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by her father. When ſhe was only five years and a quarter old, ſhe received ſome leſſons in Geometry. This deviating from the common way of commencing with arithmetic; but her father wiſhed to try the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, and ſucceded ſo well, that in a fortnight's time, before ſhe had received ten leſſons, ſhe was able to anſwer very difficult queſtions. Her progreſs in the acquirement of modern languages was really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. She ſoon learned both to read and ſpeak Engliſh, Italian, Swediſh and Dutch. Having taken a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with her father to Rome; in leſs than five months ſhe was able to talk Italian as fluently as her native tongue—According to the evidence of the <hi>Abbe Denina</hi> in his <hi>Lettere Brandenburghen,</hi> printed at Berlin in 1786. Beſides her knowledge of languages, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them to their proper uſes, and made herſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with almoſt every branch of polite literature. Her father has not confined her to the ſtudy of any ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in particular, but ſhe has been led by choice to pay the greateſt attention to the Mathematics.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Miſs Schlozer, though highly celebrated for her erudition, does not neglect what are eſteemed the firſt female accompliſhments. She plays upon the harpſicord, and ſings with as much taſte as ſhe draws and works.</p>
               <p>Her perſon is pleaſing, and her dreſs as unaffected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaſy as her deportment. Her knowledge of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and other literary acquirements render her very
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:037446_0141_100D0DA603E86590"/>
agreeable in company, for ſhe has too much good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be reſerved, and too much ſenſe to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Her ſurpriſing talents and accompliſhments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the general topic of converſation, ſhe was propoſed by the great <hi>Orientaliſt, Michaelis,</hi> as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject for Academical honors. The philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faculty, of which Profeſſor Michaelis is dean, was judged to be the fitteſt, and the 25th of Auguſt was fixed upon, at her own requeſt, for examination. The examination was held at the Dean's houſe, in the preſence of the Profeſſors—Kaeſtner, Neyne, Gatterer, Meiſter, Feder, and Kulenkamp.</p>
               <p n="6">6. She was introduced by Michaelis himſelf, and diſtinguiſhed as a lady, with the higheſt ſeat.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Several queſtions were firſt propoſed to her in mathematics, all of which ſhe anſwered to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.—After this ſhe gave a free tranſlation of the thirty-ſeventh ode of the firſt book of <hi>Horace,</hi> and explained it. The examination laſted from five o'clock till half paſt ſeven, when ſhe was deſired to withdraw for a few minutes, and in her abſence unanimouſly pronounced worthy of the degree of <hi>Doctor of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8, When ſhe was deſired to return, and received the hearty congratulations of her examiners, ſhe thanked them for the honor, and told them, ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was conferred too early; but that ſhe hoped to be deſerving of it in five years time As ſoon as ſhe was declared ſucceſsful, Miſs Michaelis, one of the Profeſſor's daughters, preſented her with a wreath of laurel, with which, at the requeſt of the Profeſſors, ſhe returned crowned, to her father. Her degree was publicly conferred in the Univerſity Church, and her Diploma preſented to her, on the grand day of the jubilee, September 17, 1787.</p>

               <head>LIFE OF MADAME DU CHATELET.</head>
               <p n="1">1. GABRIELLA-EMILA, Marchioneſs du Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet, was deſcended from a very ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, of Picardy. She was the daughter of the Baron de Breteuil, introducer of foreign Princes and Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors at court, and was born on the 17th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1706. At a very early age ſhe diſplayed great ſtrength of genius, and vivacity of imagination. She ſhewed a peculiar fondneſs for the Belles Lettres, and deuoted great part of the early period of her life to the ſtudy of the ancients. Virgil, above all, was her favorite author. She applied alſo to the foreign lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; and, in a little time, made herſelf ſo far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Engliſh and Italian, as to be able to tranſlate <hi>Milton</hi> and <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:037446_0143_100D0DA794FF7D00"/>2. Madame du Chatelet, however, did not confine herſelf to the ſtudy of the Belles Letters. Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics and Mathematics were objects alſo of her purſuit; and Leibnitz, a philoſopher equally profound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, was the guide whom ſhe choſe to direct her in this new path. By cloſe application, ſhe was ſoon enabled to write an explanation of that celebrated German's Philoſophy, under the title of "Inſtitutions of Phyſics," which ſhe compoſed pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cipally for the uſe of the Count Chatelet-Lelomont, her ſon:— Among other things ſhe requeſts him to attend to the early improvement of his mind—"You muſt accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom your mind early, ſays ſhe, to think; and to find reſources in itſelf; you will be ſenſible, throughout life, what comfort and conſolation ariſes from ſtudy; and you will even ſee that it can afford pleaſure and delight."</p>
               <p n="3">3. Madame du Chatelet had too much judgment, and was too ardent in the purſuit of truth to dwell long on the Chimeras of metaphyſics; ſhe readily quitted, therefore, the imaginations of Leibnitz, in order to giue herſelf up to the clean and perſpicuous doctrines of Newton. Having by cloſe application, gained a complete knowledge of that eminent Philoſopher's principles, ſhe undertook the arduous taſk of making a tranſlation of them from the original Latin, into French, which publiſhed, with an admirable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and by this enterprize rendered an eſſential ſervice to ſcience; This commentary, which is far ſuperior to the tranſlation, is compoſed of two parts, and is preceded by a ſhort hiſtory of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> from <hi>Pythagorus</hi> to the preſent time.</p>
               <p>When we reflect on the dryneſs of the ſubject, and the little analogy it has with the delicacy and vivacity of the fair ſex, we cannot help admiring the abilities of the Authoreſs, and calling to mind the following
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:037446_0144_100D0DDFB0AFBAD8"/>
lines, which a French philoſopher addreſſed to her, in epiſtle on Newton's Philoſophy.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Madame du Chatelet's manners were no leſs eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable than her talents. Though formed by her figure, her rank, and her knowledge, to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the greater part of thoſe among whom ſhe lived, ſhe ſeemed never to be ſenſible of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which ſhe enjoyed. She was fond of glory without oſtentation. A woman, who has no other merit than that of being learned, is certainly wanting in her duty to ſociety: No reproach of this kind can be juſtly thrown out againſt Madame du Chatelet, on this head. Her fondneſs for books never made her forget what ſhe owed to her family; ſhe did not think it below her, to enter into all thoſe details which are required in the management of a family. Inſtead of delighting in ſlander, or ridicule, ſhe often became the advocates of thoſe who in her preſence, were made the object of either.</p>
               <p>She died at Lunneville, in the year 1749, ſome time after ſhe had been delivered of a child.—She was a member of ſeveral foreign academies.</p>

                  <p>Well, Fanny, <hi>now</hi> I think you more to blame, than I did before I heard this part of your ſtory.</p>

                  <p>Then, according to your notion, I underſtand, if my papa ſhould loſe his money, and grow poor, you would not care to keep me company any longer.</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, indeed, I ſhould, Nancy. Why ſhould you entertain ſuch a thought of me?</p>

                  <speaker>N.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I can think no otherwiſe, by what you ſay yourſelf. At firſt I thought you only meant, that you did not like to keep company with the ordinary ſet of children; but now I find, the chief of your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections lies in their parents not having juſt ſo much money as yours, and not being able to keep them ſo fine. Now I would only have you conſider how you would like it, ſuppoſing your papa ſhould loſe the moſt of what he has, as many opulent men have done, (by the unavoidable changes in life) if you found your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſlighted and deſpiſed on that account, and thought unfit company for any of your old acquaintance: what think you of it Fanny, make the caſe your own?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>N.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I hope you will ſee reaſon to alter both your opinion and conduct, and beware of ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                  <p>Why, Mamma, I ſaw ſeveral graves that muſt have been made for children, that were about my ſize, and are now, very probably, reduced to duſt; and I could not help reflecting with myſelf, that this might have been my caſe, as well as poor Miſs Anthony's, the ſight of whoſe grave, as one of my late dear play fellows, drew tears from my eyes plentifully.</p>

                  <p>Why thoſe words, child, have no relation to the ſleeping duſt; but are deſigned as an admonition to the living, and to ſuch girls as you, while you are playing in the church yard, and trampling on the dead, to tell you, that you muſt <hi>remember</hi> death; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how apt we all are to forget that awful hour, it is neceſſary we ſhould be often reminded of it.</p>

And you may farther remember that the judge of all the earth muſt do right: he that made us, and brought us firſt into being, has ſurely a right to diſpoſe of us as he pleaſes; and 'tis our great happineſs, that we are at the diſpoſal, not only of a being of infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom, but alſo of a gracious, benevolent, and merciful God, that is willing to beſtow happineſs on all his creatures, that act conſiſtent wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſider, child, that your thinking of death is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make you unhappy, but quite the contrary; they that often think of it, are moſt likely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, by not committing any of thoſe ſins and iniquities that make them afraid of dying. The child that is diſobedient to its parents, that ſteals, tells lies, breaks the ſabbath, or is guilty of any bad actions, is not only afraid, but aſhamed to be brought into their preſence, either to implore their pardon or to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his crimes: and is it not a thouſand times worſe to die in your ſins, and be brought into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and there to be ſentenced to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and miſery? For though God is merciful, he is alſo juſt; and will certainly appoint ſuch a degree of puniſhment to all his rational creatures, that die without repentance and remiſſion of their ſins, by the blood of his ſon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as is the exact demerit of their iniquities. If you often think of death, you
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:037446_0158_100D0DEFB6C7D1A8"/>
will be afraid of ſin, as 'tis that alone can make you unhappy in dying.

And as our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept; as your bible tells you, ſo certainly, at the laſt day, he will, by his almighty power, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the ſleeping dead, in order to demonſtrate, in the face of the whole world, the equity of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; when the wicked ſhall be ſentenced to miſery, and the juſt and faithful received into manſions of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, where they ſhall be forever with the Lord:— Thus, Nancy, you ſee, what encouragement you have to pray often to God for his grace, to ſupport you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt temptations; and to uſe your utmoſt endeavors

               <p>We may prove the being of a God, by the light of reaſon and conſcience, by the general acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and conſent of all nations, and by the holy ſcriptures.</p>

               <p>Firſt, by reaſon, the heavens declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work. The ſun, the moon, and ſtars; the birds in the air, the fiſh in the ſea, the beaſt in the field, the herbs, graſs and flowers, which grow therein, do all mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally demonſtrate this great truth; for theſe could not make themſelves, nor be the product of chance; but were effected by a divine power who is the firſt cauſe of all things, and on whom they ſolely depend. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, By conſcience, this is a witneſs eſtabliſhed by God in every man's breaſt, to preſerve the notice and memory of him. We never do our duty, but we perceive a pleaſing ſatisfaction in our minds; and we never tranſgreſs, but conſcience ſeverely corrects and rebukes us; the truth of this every one knows by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Thirdly, By the conſent of all nations; the belief of a God is as ancient as the world, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all ages by all men, both learned and unlearned: and fourthly, by the ſcriptures: God hath not left himſelf without good and ſufficient witneſſes of his having made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all things therein, Acts xiv: 15, 17. The inviſible things of God from the creation of the world are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made even his eternal power and God-head: Rom. 1, 20. Whatever we obſerve in nature, in the heavens and upon the earth; and whatever is ſupernatural, as
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037446_0161_100D0E55529CA218"/>

               <p>No; for we find in the beginning of all things the origin of nations, arts and ſciences, the erection of Empires, the time when the ſeveral parts of the world were firſt inhabited; and there is no hiſtory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix thouſand years, which proves the world was not eternal, but had a beginning; it muſt therefore be created by an Almighty Power, and none could do this but God; a being infinite and ſelf exiſtent.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The Jews and other enemies of the Chriſtian Religion agree, that there was formerly in Judea, a man named Jeſus, who ſaid he was the ſon of God; and the hiſtories of Jews and Pagans inform us, that it was in his time, and by him, that this Religion was firſt ſet up; and the Jews confeſs he wrought many miracles, and foretold many things which came to paſs after his death, particularly the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and the eſtabliſhment of his church throughout the world: and as to his reſurrection from the dead, we ſhall ſpeak of that hereafter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>By the Apoſtles; who did not conſtrain men to embrace it by force, but only had recourſe to their preaching and miracles, even when force was made uſe of againſt them.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>From the very nature of it; for all that it teaches and commands men to believe and do is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to right <hi>reaſon</hi> and juſtice. The Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion requires nothing but what is reaſonable, juſt, and worthy of God and man; it tends to make order, juſtice and peace reign amongſt men; it ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, comforts, and procures them the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they can enjoy in this world, and in a future ſtate.</p>

and excellence: but whoever fairly and candidly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, will find, that there is nothing more true, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, or neceſſary than this holy religion; and if we believe what it teaches, and perform what it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, we ſhall be everlaſtingly happy, or if we fail therein, we ſhall be eternally miſerable.</p>

               <p>No; becauſe they were inſpired by God; and beſides, there were a great number of perſons who knew that what they wrote was true; and had it been falſe, their writings would not have been received as divine.</p>

               <p>By the hiſtories it relates, by the doctrines it teaches, and by the commandments it preſcribes. The ſacred hiſtory agrees as to time, events, perſons and circumſtances, with other credible hiſtories, even with the Pagans, who wrote before and after Chriſt. The doctrines agree with the light of reaſon, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſentiments of men, ſuch as that there is a God, and future puniſhments for the wicked, and rewards for the good. The commands are alſo agreeable to that which nature, reaſon, and conſcience dictate;

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe we find ſeveral things therein which could come from none but God. As 1ſt, A doctrine moſt holy, ſublime, and perfect. 2dly, It is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the power of the ſpirit of God, which ſanctifies the heart, and produces inward conſolation and joy. 3dly, The miracles which the prophets and apoſtles wrought, clearly demonſtrate that God ſent them, and ſpoke by them. 4th, The prophecies or predictions of things to come, prove it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evidence. Many ages before Chriſt, the Jews had the predictions of the prophets in the Old Teſtament as we now have; and the three firſt goſpels were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed long before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and other events therein foretold, came to paſs.</p>

               <p>To inſtruct us in God's will, as to what is neceſſary for us to do and know in order to be ſaved: ſo that it is the only rule of our faith, the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Religion, and we ought carefully to read and meditate upon it with an attentive mind, a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, and a ſincere intention to do God's will.</p>

prieſt, and king; as Chriſt is a prophet, he taught us his father's will; as a prieſt, he offered himſelf a ſacrifice to make atonement for our ſins, by his moſt precious blood; and as king, he reigns over all things and is our Lord, patron and judge: we ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to truſt in him as our only ſavior, to believe the doctrine he has taught us, and to ſerve him faithfully, that he may grant us ſalvation and life eternal.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; becauſe the truth of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion depends upon it: if Chriſt is not riſen, our faith is vain, 1 Cor. 15, 17.</p>

               <p>By the teſtimony of his, the watchmen ſet by the Jews at his ſepulchre, and of the Apoſtles, who ſaw him often after his burial, St. Paul alſo informs us, he was ſeen by above five hundred perſons after his reſurrection, 1 Cor. 15, 6.

               <p>It proves that he is the ſon of God, that he has made atonement for our ſins, and is a pledge to us, that we ſhall riſe again at the laſt day, Rom. 1, 4: 4, 25. 1 Cor. 15, 20, 21, 22.

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; for if the dead riſe not, Religion is vain, 1 Cor. xv. and our Lord ſays, the hour is coming in which all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They will be incorruptible and glorious: for this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality, 1 Cor. xv, 53.

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That Jeſus Chriſt will deſcend from heaven at the end of the world, to judge all men.</p>

               <p>The ſame reaſons which prove there is a God and a Providence; that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſon of God, and Savior of the world; that the holy ſcriptures are divinely inſpired, and that the chriſtian religion is true, do equally prove a future judgment; for had we nothing to fear or hope for after death, all theſe things would be falſe: beſides, the conſciences of men do prove that there is a difference between virtue and vice, by exciting in their minds, fears and remorſe when they do evil, affording pleaſure and ſatisfaction when they do well; which would not be ſo, were there not rewards and puniſhments after this life.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The heathens believed that after death there were rewards for the good, and puniſhments for the wicked; but this doctrine is more clearly deſcribed by the goſpel; we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,

whether it be good or evil, 2 Cor. v.10. And then all wicked men, and every worker of iniquity, Chriſt will condemn to everlaſting deſtruction, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and glory of God, in the lake that burneth with fire unquenchable; but all virtuous good men, and juſt, righteous, and religious perſons, who have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavored to obey the commandments of God, ſhall be then rewarded with glory unſpeakable in the kingdom of heaven, which is the life everlaſting.</p>

               <p>He will judge all mankind, both the dead and living, and puniſh or reward them according to the good or evil that they have done: when the righteous ſhall go into life eternal, and the wicked be ſentenced to eternal torments, Mat. xxv.</p>

               <p>Lean moſtly upon your left arm, and keep it out from your body upon the deſk, let the right be cloſer to your ſide, but as much at liberty as poſſible. Do not move your head from ſide to ſide, when you write; for it is not only ungraceful, but tends to deceive you

in the ſlopes of your ſtrokes, and to render your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting irregular.</p>

               <head>OF HOLDING THE PEN.</head>
               <p n="5">5. Point the pen, in writing the round hand, up to your right ſhoulder; and always let both ſides of the pen have an equal ſtrain upon them in coming down; for this will prevent any of the ſides from wearing ſooner than the other: but, in writing the ſquare hands, keep it more perpendicular.</p>
               <p>Lean the weight of the hand which writes upon the tip of the little finger; keep the ring-finger lying within the little one; keep the fore and mid fingers nearly ſtraight, and the two firſt joints of the fore fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lying moſtly upon the back of the pen. Keep the firſt joint of the thumb bending outwards, and the point againſt the pen oppoſite to the firſt joint of the fore finger.</p>
