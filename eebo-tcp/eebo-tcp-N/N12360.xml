            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Then all the Children of Iſrael, and all the People went up, and came unto the Houſe of GOD, and wept, and ſat there before the Lord, and faſted that day until even, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace offerings before the Lord. And the Children of Iſrael enquired of the Lord—ſaying, Shall I yet again go out to Battle againſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> BENJAMIN <hi>my Brother, or ſhall I ceaſe? And the Lord ſaid, go up, for to-morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the Context, we find the men of Iſrael gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, from one end of the land, even to the other, in a general aſſembly, to ſee juſtice done upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators of an horrid <hi>rape,</hi> committed upon the Levite's concubine: Which, alſo, carried <hi>murder</hi> with it; for ſhe preſently died of the abuſe.</p>
            <p>AFTER a particular account of this tragical ſcene, had from the Levite, the party injured,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015602_0003_0F998D818D3AC3B8"/>
they ſend meſſengers through the tribe of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> to which the profligate wretches, who had done this deed, belonged, to make further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and demand the criminals to be delivered into their hand, to be puniſhed as their crime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the guilt thereof might be put away from Iſrael: But they refuſe to deliver them, and prepare for <hi>war.</hi> Upon this the men of Iſrael conſider the guilt of this horrible wickedneſs, as lying on the whole tribe, who had undertaken to ſkreen the criminals from juſtice; and reſolve to avenge it on them, accordingly, by the ſword. But firſt, they religiouſly conſulted Heaven upon the ſolemn affair: Not ſo much indeed, as to the thing, whether they ſhould go on with their deſign; the reaſon and right of this, being even ſelf-evident, and apparent at firſt view; but rather as to the manner, and circumſtantial management of the cauſe. "<hi>The children of Iſrael aroſe, and went up to the houſe of</hi> GOD, <hi>and aſked counſel of</hi> GOD, <hi>and ſaid, which of us ſhall go up firſt to the battle againſt the children of</hi> Benjamin? <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall go up firſt</hi>" They proceed to battle; <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> prevails that day, and kills twenty-two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the men of Iſrael. This ſeems to have made them ſomewhat ſuſpicious of their cauſe, whether it was juſt and right in the ſight of GOD: However, upon the whole, they are ſo far ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it is ſo, that they reſolve to go on with it, if the Lord does not forbid them; under whoſe awful hand, they firſt humble themſelves, and aſk fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counſel of him: "<hi>The men of Iſrael encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves, and ſet their battle in array; and went
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015602_0004_0F998D823579E930"/>
up, and wept before the Lord until even, and aſked counſel of the Lord, ſaying, ſhall I go up again to battle againſt the children of</hi> Benjamin, <hi>my brother? And the Lord ſaid, go up againſt him.</hi>" They go up, therefore, a ſecond time; but, ſtill <hi>Benjamin</hi> prevails, and deſtroys of them eighteen, thouſand more. Whereupon, not only the men of war, but all the people that were aſſembled on this ſad occaſion, repair again to the houſe of the Lord, and ſpend the remainder of the day in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious mourning, faſting and prayer, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifices of atonement for ſin: For they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, by this time, that the Lord is angry with them. Yet they do not deſiſt from their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; but, in this way of humbling themſelves under the awful, and repeated rebukes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and earneſt ſeeking GOD'S reconciled face and favor, they determine ſtill to proſecute the cauſe in hand, and if poſſible, to carry it through, if the Lord does not forbid them; whoſe will, they yet further enquire after, on this occaſion: "<hi>Then all the children of Iſrael, and all the people went up, and came to the Houſe of</hi> GOD, <hi>and wept, &amp;c.</hi>" And in their next encounter with the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites,</hi> their arms had full ſucceſs. It pleaſed GOD to permit <hi>Benjamin</hi> to prevail againſt them, in a firſt and ſecond engagement, becauſe there were with them, even with them, great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſins againſt the Lord their GOD, for which he would puniſh them, in this awful way; and yet, in his own time, he appeared for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and carrying through of the cauſe in which they were engaged. An awful ſcene, truly this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015602_0005_0F998D82DE46D2F0"/>
was! And yet, on the ſide of Iſrael, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt. Not only a part which they might act without ſin, but a part which they were in duty bound to act, and could not neglect, without great ſin, however ſeverely they ſuffered by it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as a juſt puniſhment for their other ſins. Although there is not a univerſal correſpondence of circumſtances, yet in many reſpects, the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will undoubtedly ſee an evident agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my ſubject, and the ſad occaſion of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity—the awful war in which we are engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Britain,</hi> and our duty and intereſt depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in reference whereunto, we are profeſſedly humbling ourſelves before the Lord, this day, and aſking counſel of Heaven.</p>
            <p>MY ſubject opens a large field before us; time will be wanting to travel it fully over: I ſhall ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy brevity, and, therefore, omit many points that are contained in the text: Neither ſhall I run the length, with thoſe I take under conſideration, which they might naturally lead me. Let me crave your ſerious attention to theſe four things, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That in certain circumſtances, it is juſt and right, and agreeable to the will of GOD, for his <hi>own profeſſing, covenant people,</hi> to take the ſword and go to war, even againſt their brethren.—That, in firſt commencing, and after proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a war, eſpecially with brethren, there ſhould be a fair, impartial, often-repeated enquiry into the right of it, that we may act with a ſafe conſcience, and be able to juſtify our proceeding—That it is nothing ſtrange and new, if, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015602_0006_0F998D8468D61618"/>
a juſt war, for our ſins againſt heaven, we meet with ſevere and repeated rebukes. And therefore, although this calls for mourning, and deep humiliation before the Lord, and a ſerious concern to obtain pardon and reconciliation with him; yet it is not ſufficient ground of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a further proſecution of the cauſe, with hope in the mercy of GOD, to ſupport and carry it through, in his own, wiſe and holy, time and way.</p>
            <p>PROPOSITION I. IN certain circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is juſt and right, and agreeable to the will of GOD, for his own profeſſing covenant people, to take the ſword, and go to war, even againſt their brethren: Shall I go up to battle (ſays Iſrael) againſt my brother <hi>Benjamin?</hi> Yes, ſaith the Lord, go. They repeat the enquiry again and again, (ſtumbled, perhaps, at their ill ſucceſs) and the Lord as often repeats his affirmative anſwer, Go, go.</p>
            <p>WAR, indeed, is an awful ſcene; that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, all made of one blood, ſhould kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another, and by the deſtroying ſword, make even rivers of human blood to flow—how horrible the thought!</p>
            <p>THE individual that ſheds the blood of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his own private will (except in ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular caſes of extreme neceſſity) is guilty of the higheſt wrong to his neighbour—horribly violates the law, the righteous law of GOD and man—is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015602_0007_0F998D851B068888"/>
a murderer—near a-kin to him, who was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the beginning, and forfeits his life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of juſtice: And ſhedding human blood in a more public way, by a community war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt another community, always, I think, muſt carry a murderous guilt with it, unleſs the cauſe be great and good.</p>
            <p>THE ſword can never be lawfully uſed for the ſupport of an unjuſt cauſe: Nor may a people have recourſe to arms, to redreſs every little tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling wrong, and ſupport a real right and intereſt, if it be but ſmall; for, if ſo, the world would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be full of wars, and conſtant ſcenes of blood. Even reaſon, and plainly our holy chriſtian inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, not only forbids private revenge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires forbearance of individuals towards their neighbours; but, it alſo, forbids communities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending by the ſword, with other communities, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſmall, and inconſiderable matters; or, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, about their higheſt rights and intereſts, 'till other, and milder meaſures have been tried and purſued, as long as there was any encouragement to it, or any rational hope and proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>IF ſin had not depraved the human heart, war had never been practiſed among mankind. Not only private and perſonal feuds and quarrels, but alſo public and national ones, derive their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the luſts of men. War has always a ſinful root and cauſe ſomewhere; I ſuppoſe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can poſſibly be juſt on both ſides, in any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015602_0008_0F998D88A033C258"/>
whatſoever; yet, on one ſide, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may be.</p>
            <p>THE great Sovereign, the righteous Governor of the world has committed his ſword into the magiſtrates hand, to reſtrain therewith, or if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to deſtroy the wicked; that ſo his people may be in a capacity to "<hi>lead quiet and peaceable lives in godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>" (For you are to know that the end and aim of every juſt and lawful war is peace, ſafety and happineſs, in the way of duty and obedience to the great Sovereign, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord.)</p>
            <p>THE Magiſtrate is not only to defend his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from private violence, but alſo from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and national injury and abuſe: And where there is no ſettled form of government—no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ſtanding magiſtrate, to whom this truſt has been properly delegated, there the right and authority to defend themſelves from extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and abuſe—to reſtrain, and if it cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be done, even to deſtroy the notoriouſly wicked and injurious, is in the hands of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY we find the common-wealth of Iſrael, when they had no ſupreme Magiſtrate, to whom they had committed this truſt to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it for them, once and again acting in virtue of this right themſelves, on neceſſary occaſions. Thus the ten tribes intended to make war upon their brethren, on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015602_0009_0F998D8A159CBAE8"/>
as they ſuppoſed, they had fallen off from the true worſhip of the GOD of Iſrael, into ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry—and actually did ſo, againſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> for protecting the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of an horrid crime, from deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>IF the ſupreme magiſtrate, in a community, violates the ſacred truſt repoſed in him by the people, if "<hi>inſtead of being a miniſter of God for good</hi>" unto them, he becomes an oppreſſor, diſregards the conſtitution, by which he was as much bound as the people, and which gave him all the authority, which he has over them—if he wantonly tramples on their moſt important and ſacred rights, and is deaf to their multiplied, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and loyal complaints and prayers, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of their grievances and wrongs, 'till there remains no hope in this way, but their oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are continued, encreaſed, and multiplied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them more and more; they have a plain right in the ſight of Heaven and earth, to recall the delegated power, that is thus abuſed; otherwiſe, the caſe of the people would be wretched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; inaſmuch as thoſe that are exalted, in power, above others, are ſo apt to abuſe it, and turn oppreſſors, and to perſiſt irreclaimably in it when they have ſo done. If the people have not a right to recal this delegated power, when, thus groſly abuſed; they had better (I think) never entruſt it in the hands of any man, but keep it in their own.</p>
            <p>

As to the doctrine of paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance, it is ſo contrary to religion, and even to common ſenſe, that it is high time it were baniſhed out of the world. It flatters and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Tyrants in their pride and wickedneſs, and is highly injurious to the rights of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: It has been ſo often, ſo ſolidly and clearly confuted, by many worthy treatiſes, wrote, ſome in theſe times, and ſome in former unhappy times, ſimilar to theſe; ſome or other of which muſt be ſuppoſed to have fallen into the hands of almoſt every one, unleſs any have been ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and criminally inattentive to the very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and intereſting ſcenes that have been acting of late, between Britain and America, that it is needleſs, as it would probably be fruitleſs, to add many words upon it.</p>
            <p>AWAY with that unreaſonable doctrine of the divine right of Kings, or any other magiſtrates, in that abſolute ſenſe in which ſome plead for it. In a ſober, qualified ſenſe, I believe this doctrine: I believe that magiſtracy is of divine right; but I believe withal, that GOD has left it with the people, to chooſe their form of Government, and appoint and conſtitute the magiſtrate; although he expects them to act the rational part herein, and commit this great truſt, only into ſuitable and proper hands. "<hi>The powers that be, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God;</hi>" but, if I miſtake not, this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refers to Government in its various forms, than to Governors—to the office, rather than the perſon who ſhall fill it. Even in this, the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015602_0011_0F998D8B37574450"/>
of GOD is not to be denied, for it extends itſelf to all events; but none, I believe, can ſhew an ordinance of God, that this or that individual or family in ſucceſſion, ſhall fill the ſupreme office of magiſtracy, in this or the other community.</p>
            <p>THE great Governor of the world, from a kind regard to the welfare of mankind, hath ordained that there ſhall be magiſtracy among them; and when a community have, regularly and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſettled this authority upon particular men, they have a divine right to execute juſt that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the people, that is thus committed into their hands, but no more. I believe they have now, a divine right to rule well; but not to oppreſs the people, and infringe and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on their higheſt rights; which, if they do, and perſiſt in it, againſt the repeated complaints and prayers of the people, for redreſs of wrongs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted even to long ſuffering; I believe that as it was by covenant pointing out the duty of each party, and carrying in it the ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each to conduct accordingly, that they came into the relation of King (ſuppoſe) and ſubjects; this reſolved unrelenting violation on the one part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſſolves the obligation of it on the other; ſo that the people have a divine right to take the forfeiture, renounce their allegiance, and take the beſt care of themſelves they can.</p>
            <p>AND, if ſuch an oppreſſor purſues them with the ſword for ſo doing, I believe he greatly adds to his ſin hereby, and incurs the awful diſpleaſure
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015602_0012_0F998D8BE7492100"/>
of the great ſovereign, his maſter, as well as theirs. And that the people have a divine right, in caſe of ſuch manifeſt, extreme wrong—ſuch wanton abuſe of power to enſlave or deſtroy them, to take the ſword too, for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>NOT only may one State uſe the Sword againſt another, in caſes of weighty and urgent neceſſity, but ſo likewiſe may a part of the State, againſt the other part of the ſame, in like caſes. Not only may a people, driven to it by unavoidable neceſſity, draw the ſword againſt a foreign nation, but ſo may they likewiſe, againſt their own bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, tho' it is an awful thing indeed, and ſhould be conſidered as a ſore frown of Heaven on the whole community, that ever there ſhould be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it. Such, evidently was the caſe with Iſrael, in the awful ſcene, my text refers to; the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Benjamin</hi> were their brethren—a part of the ſame Common-wealth with themſelves; and yet their deſign of making war upon them, for a groſs and obſtinate violation of equity and right, the righteous Sovereign of the world expreſsly approves, and repeatedly bids them go on with it: And this, by the way, was an offenſive war; and if that was lawful and right, how much more evidently and apparently, a defenſive one, to ward off the aſſaults of violence and oppreſſion?</p>
            <p>AGAINST what has been offered, perhaps it may be ſaid, by way of objection,</p>
            <p>IT is enough for the Heathen, who know
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015602_0013_0F998D8CA07EDCE8"/>
not God, to fight and devour one another; Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſurely ſhould not fight.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Chriſtians ſhould never give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the uſe of the ſword; nor ſhould they, lightly and haſtily take occaſion to uſe it: But let them ſhew that can, where chriſtians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give up their liberty, and ſubmit to ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very—to give up their property and the great rights which indulgent Heaven has inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them withal, in common with the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, at the demand of an aſſuming community, with a Tyrant at the head of it, rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves by the ſword if it be in their power to do it, againſt ſuch great and manifeſt injury and wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. THE goſpel every where requires forbearance, and forbids revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> WHEN there is the greateſt neceſſity for uſing the ſword, it muſt not be from malice, and a deſire of revenge: Wo to them that uſe it thus, be it in ever ſo juſt a cauſe: Its juſt and lawful uſe, even on the weightieſt occaſions, is to obtain peace and quietneſs on terms of reaſon and right, which cannot otherwiſe be had: And further, if the objectors will impartially conſult their Bibles again, I am perſuaded they will find, that the moſt, if not all thoſe paſſages, on which this objection is grounded, refer to private revenge of private and perſonal injuries, and do not forbid a community to defend themſelves
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015602_0014_0F998D8D5C21C070"/>
from violence, and right themſelves from extreme wrong, not otherwiſe to be righted, even by the ſword. If this be duly attended to, I think it will certainly diſpel a cloud of objections againſt the point in hand, raiſed from theſe and ſuch like ſcriptures, <hi>Render to no man evil for evil. Do vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to no man. If any man will take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke alſo. If any ſmite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other alſo. Put up thy ſword into the ſheath, for all they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword,</hi> &amp;c."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. WHATEVER was allowed and practiſed in this reſpect, under the law, yet there is no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for it now under the goſpel,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> THIS point—the lawfulneſs or unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of uſing the ſword, on urgent occaſions, does not belong to the ceremonial law, but to the moral law, or law of nature, which is fixed and invariable, from the beginning to the end of time; and abides juſt the ſame, through all the various diſpenſations of GOD to his Church, in way of ceremonial, or poſſitive law. Therefore, the uſe of the ſword having been lawful heretofore, is plainly ſo now, and always will be, in ſimilar circumſtances. Self-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſelf-defence from extreme violence and wrong, is the great and univerſal law of nature, which I dare ſay the goſpel does not diſannul; for I have the Apoſtle's affidavit, <abbr>viz.</abbr> St, Paul's, to ſupport me in it: "<hi>Do we make void the law, through faith? God forbid: Yea we eſtabliſh the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015602_0015_0F998D8E1F14F090"/>
law.</hi>" And if I do not miſtake, the goſpel does plainly countenance the ſoldiers calling (and you know, the ſword, and the uſe of it too, on neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary occaſions, is cloſely connected with it) for, not to inſiſt on thoſe words of our Savior, which are ſometimes applied as a proof of the point in hand (though perhaps not much to the purpoſe) "<hi>He that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment and buy one,</hi>" we find ſoldiers, among others, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their duty of John, a famous preacher of righteouſneſs; upon which fair occaſion, he does not condemn the calling, and bid them relinquiſh it; but gives them direction how to behave in it; which I think muſt have been abſurd, if the calling was unlawful; for I cannot conceive it poſſible, to conduct and manage a calling lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well, which is itſelf wrong; and if ſo, then every kind and manner of conducting it, muſt be wrong too.</p>
            <p>So among others, we find upon a certain time, a centurion, a captain over an hundred ſoldiers, coming to Chriſt, with a requeſt that he would heal his ſervant that was ſick; upon which, that great Teacher ſent from GOD, who was conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful, on all occaſions, to reprove the faults, and rectify the miſtakes of the people, dont con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his calling, and bid him relinquiſh it, burn his commiſſion—throw away his ſword, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to an honeſter occupation; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he beſtows a high encomium upon him; "<hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi>" And here, by the way, we plainly ſee one very
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015602_0016_0F998D8F5AE3CDE8"/>
good man of the military profeſſion, under the goſpel. Oh! would to God, our centurions, our officers of every rank, and ſoldiers; yea, and we too, who ſtay by the ſtuff, were of a like cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, with him.</p>
            <p>BUT, perhaps it may be thought to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to inſiſt ſo long on a point ſo plain and clear: Well, my friend, ſuppoſe it is ſufficiently plain to me and thee; yet, ſome of our brethren pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs (and peradventure, this may be juſt the caſe with a number more, who do not openly profeſs it) that it is not ſo plain to them: Some profeſs to believe the cauſe, in which we are engaged, is not juſt; others are wavering and not eſtabliſhed as to the right and juſtice of it, and are eaſily ſtaggered by ſtumbling-blocks thrown in their way, and carried away by a plauſibility of argument: Now, if the cauſe depending be, in thy mind and mine, not only juſt and good, but alſo, exceeding great and important, is it not worth while to take ſome pains, clearly to prove it out, and confirm it, in order to ſettle and eſtabliſh the doubting, and wavering; and if it may be, to convince the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; or elſe if that cannot be, to leave them the more without excuſe?</p>
            <p>And now, my brethren, who are not ſatisfied of the juſtice of the cauſe in which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, for our defence, againſt the hoſtile inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Britain; if any ſuch hear me (and be that as it may, yet very probably curioſity will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015602_0017_0F998D9004BF7C10"/>
lead ſome ſuch to read theſe lines, now they are offered to a more public view) upon what ground can you raiſe an objection, which, my ſubject fairly conſidered and regarded, will not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remove? That Iſrael's taking the ſword, and going to war againſt <hi>Benjamin,</hi> was juſt and right, I think you will not deny; for when they conſulted Heaven upon it, once and again, by ſolemn faſting and prayer, the Lord expreſsly ſaid, go. Was it for ſkreening notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from public juſtice, that Iſrael made war upon <hi>Benjamin?</hi> Yes. Well, and has not Great-Britain, among many other unjuſt and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proceedings, done nearly the ſame thing? I allude to an act of the Britiſh Parliament, for exempting their ſoldiers that ſhould be impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for murders, committed in America, from being tried, in order to their being puniſhed if found guilty, by the law of the land. Are the Britons our brethren? So were the <hi>Benjamites</hi> theirs—Are we the profeſſing people of GOD? So were they—Or if it be ſaid, that ſcene was acted under the law, when many things were permitted, that are unlawful now, under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; I reply, it was not a bare permiſſion, that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had to wage war againſt <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command, and repeated too, go, go: And though it was indeed, under the law (ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) yet it was a point that did not belong to that law: and therefore, it makes no odds at all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were under, or during the authority of that law, or not; but it belongs to the law natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral, which forbad Iſrael every thing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015602_0018_0F998D922C805D50"/>
that it fordids us; and indulges Chriſtians in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that it did the Jews: It allowed them undeniably, in an offenſive war againſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> becauſe they undertook to ſkreen notorious criminals from public juſtice; and with what face then, or appearance of truth and reaſon, can it be pretended, that it does not allow us in a defenſive war with our brethren of Britain, who, after they have done the ſame, and a great many other high-handed acts of cruelty and oppreſſion againſt us, have ſent their Fleets and Armies—an huge hoſt, ſword in hand, to rivet on our chains of ſlavery, or elſe deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, it ſeems impoſſible for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who has his mind free from prejudice, and undue influence from every quarter; and has but a tolerable acquaintance with the ſtate and grounds of our controverſy with Great-Britain; and fairly compares it with the awful ſcene in the common-wealth of Iſrael, now under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any longer to doubt or heſitate about the lawfulneſs of the preſent war, on the part of America.</p>

                  <hi>Then all the Children of Iſrael, and all the people went up, and came unto the Houſe of</hi> GOD, <hi>and wept, and ſat there before the Lord, and faſted that day, until even, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings before the Lord. And the Children of Iſrael enquired of the Lord—ſaying, ſhall I yet again go out to Battle againſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> BENJAMIN <hi>my Brother, or ſhall I ceaſe? And the Lord ſaid, go up, for to-morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</hi>

            <p>WE have conſidered, that in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances, of urgent neceſſity, it is juſt and right, and agreeable to the will of GOD, for his own profeſſing people to take the ſword, and go to war, even againſt their brethren.</p>
            <p>LET us proceed, and conſider, according to <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. That in firſt commencing, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proſecuting a war, eſpecially with brethren,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015602_0020_0F998D95859F6C30"/>
there ſhould be a fair, impartial, often-repeated enquiry into the right of it; that we may act with a ſafe conſcience, and be able to juſtify our proceeding.</p>
            <p>So did the children of Iſrael, with reſpect to the war with their Brethren of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> they do not ruſh precipitately upon it, but firſt they ſeriouſly deliberate the matter with themſelves, and weigh the merits of the cauſe; whether it requires, and will juſtify ſuch a procedure: Thus they call upon one another, as the firſt ſtep to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, "<hi>Conſider of it, take advice and ſpeak your minds</hi>" And not only did they ſeriouſly weigh and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the matter, with themſelves, but they aſk coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Lord about it too, previous to the firſt beginning of the war, and repeatedly afterwards, during the continuance of it. No important enterprize ſhould ever be engaged in, without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fore-thought, and enquiry after the path of duty, "<hi>Remember and ſhew yourſelves men</hi>" let reaſon ſearch out the path of duty, and then let action follow, and exertion in proportion to the greater or leſs importance of the cauſe; <hi>Yea and why, even of yourſelves, judge ye not what is right.</hi>"</p>
            <p>REASON is to be conſulted, but Heaven muſt be conſulted too: "<hi>He that truſts in his own Heart, is a fool. The way of man is not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps:</hi>" Therefore, "<hi>truſt in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding.</hi>" It is true, "<hi>the ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord,</hi>" ſet up within him, to direct his goings;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015602_0021_0F998D970A26C140"/>
and the voice of reaſon, is always the voice of GOD; but our manifold corruptions and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, are in the greateſt danger, ſo to blind and deceive us, as to make us think that to be the voice of reaſon which is not; therefore, in ſearching out the dictates of reaſon, we muſt make diligent and honeſt enquiry at the oracles of GOD, and prayerfully conſult the ſacred pages of revelation, where things are ſtripped of their falſe guiſes and deceitful ſhows; and ſet to view in their ſimple truth: Withal, applying ourſelves to the Father of Lights—the fountain of Truth, "<hi>who giveth wiſdom liberally, to them that</hi> (honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>aſk it of him, without upbraiding,</hi>" to keep us from a falſe judgement, and miſtaken apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things, which would embolden us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in raſh and unjuſtifiable enterprizes. "<hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths;</hi>" and eſpecially, "<hi>with good advice make war.</hi>" Be it with ſtrangers and heathen, 'tis a matter of too ſolemn, and weighty importance, to be lightly and haſtily engaged in; eſpecially, when it is with Brethren, by blood, by profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or both.</p>
            <p>SUCH an awful ſcene ſhould never be entered upon, without the greateſt reluctancy; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never, without the moſt ſerious enquiry into the lawfulneſs, the duty, the neceſſity of it; and all other rational methods firſt tried, that could be thought likely to bring matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy to an amicable ſettlement, on terms of reaſon and right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015602_0022_0F998D972368BA50"/>
ALTHOUGH, in reſpect to the controverſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Britain and America, which has been ſome time ripened into the preſent awful ſcene of war, there is no doubt but that America has been faulty in many things; it is ſcarce ever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in public or private feuds and quarrels, that are carried to any conſiderable length, but that there is blame, more or leſs, on both ſides: It is hard, for ſuch depraved creatures to bear grievous injuries and wrongs, without being thrown out of proper temper by it, and getting quite beſide the path of duty: yet, I think, as it is plain that Britain was the aggreſſor, by whom the offence came; who firſt took the ſword, and began the quarrel; ſo it is pretty evident to a fair, and impartial mind, that America (I ſpeak not of individuals; the ſpeeches and conduct of ſome of theſe have been utterly too raſh and unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable; but of our public councils; the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative bodies of America) have proceeded with very conſiderable deliberation, moderation and caution, while matters were coming on to this ſad paſs, as much as could be rationally expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under ſuch ſore "oppreſſion as makes even the wiſe man mad," and bare and forbare, until violence had riſen to ſuch an height, as to make it a matter of plain duty, and indiſpenſable neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to take the ſword for ſelf defence: And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſince the commencement of the war, we have been frequently ſetting apart days of faſting and prayer, profeſſedly on the deſign of aſking counſel and direction of Heaven, how we ſhould proceed and conduct, in the embarraſſed,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015602_0023_0F998D97EB90B5C0"/>
and very diſtreſſing ſtate of our affairs; which, were they attended only with a moral ſincerity, I doubt not but they would be followed with ſome happy conſequences: But I fear the moſt of us do not obſerve them ſo well as that—do not attend them with that concern, and thoughtfulneſs, that even natural conſcience, and the common law of ſelf-preſervation, might well be expected to engage us to, at ſuch an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day as the preſent is, when a cauſe of ſuch high importance hangs, wavering, in doubtful expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Do not many of us regard theſe ſolemn days, only as mere matters of form, without heart, without the thoughtfulneſs, and proper temper and exerciſes of men, as well as without the piety and ſincerity of chriſtians? and ſo, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mock, and inſult Heaven, while we profeſs to humble ourſelves before the Lord, and aſk coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of him. But, oh! beware my friends, what you do. This is exceedingly provoking to GOD, and dangerous to yourſelves. However, I truſt there is a goodly number, ſcattered here and there, who truly fear the Lord, and tremble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his up-lifted hand; who, on theſe occaſions eſpecially, and indeed from day to day, are mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before the Lord, for the ſins of the Land, particularly their own, which have provoked him to ſuffer matters to come to this ſad paſs with us; and ſenſible of the great need of divine guidance and conduct in ſuch an awful embarraſſed, and threatning ſtate of things as we are in, are earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſking counſel and direction of Heaven; But as to a great many, I fear they are exceeding
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015602_0024_0F998D98A82BC488"/>
faulty, in not taking proper care and pains, by ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, prayerful enquiry, to inform themſelves into the ſtate of the controverſy in hand, and about the reaſon and right of our cauſe: And yet, perhaps they are zealouſly engaged, ſome on one ſide, and ſome on the other, while they neither know, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly concern themſelves to know with any clear, diſtinct knowledge, what the cauſe is. How can you be ſure to walk ſafe, when you do not know what ground you go upon? If the cauſe is good and juſt, what is that to you that neglect to ſearch it out as far as in you lies, and be at reaſonable and proper pains to ſee it to be ſo? Will you act in matters of weightieſt importance, upon a meer preſumption of right, without a rational ſight, and conſcientious ſatisfaction thereof? It will never do to ſee merely with others eyes, and take things of weighty importance upon truſt, where the way is open and fair, by proper enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſee for ourſelves. The awful ſcene now acting, muſt certainly have a further hearing: And how without a ſerious enquiry into the right of it, ſhall they that act for the cauſe, be able to juſtify their conduct at the great day? How ſhall they know but they are bringing blood guiltineſs upon themſelves? And how, without a fair en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, ſhall they that oppoſe the public meaſures of the day, or only ſtand neuters, know but they are bringing the curſe of Heaven (as well as Earth) upon themſelves? As it is written, "curſe ye Meroz, curſe ye bitterly, the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; becauſe they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the Lord, againſt the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015602_0025_0F998D995C3413D8"/>
mighty." Verily, the cauſe depending, is too great and ſolemn, to be treated with a careleſs indifferency: if it be an unjuſt cauſe, wo be to them that put an hand to it, to ſhed blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; and that the blood of brethren: If it is juſt, I am ſure it is great, and calls upon all to join heart and hand for its ſupport; left even by a neutrality in ſo important a cauſe, they greatly ſin againſt themſelves, againſt the public, againſt poſterity and againſt Heaven too. Therefore, what I urge here is, that every one that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, will ſeriouſly and prayerfully, without prejudice or undue influence from any quarter whatever; and with the beſt helps he can get to aſſiſt him, examine and ſearch out the cauſe for himſelf; honeſtly endeavoring to ſee it in its ſimple, undiſguiſed truth; that he may know how to act with a ſafe conſcience, and ſo as to be able to anſwer it, another day. Say not, it is too late now, to make enquiry into the merits of the cauſe: It is true, it ſhould have been done by every one capable of it, long ago; but if it has not been ſeriouſly attended to, thoroughly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated, and brought to a rational iſſue in any of your minds, it is high time to do it now, and better late than never—if it has, yet, in ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſolemn a matter, there is the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in a further, and often-repeated enquiry; after the example of Iſrael, in my text and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
            <p>THE cauſe depending is plainly, one that nearly concerns the honor of GOD, and our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,

religious intereſt, as well as civil and ſecular welfare: And therefore, if we have gone in a wrong path, it is time to ſee it, and ſtop, be the conſequence as it may: But if in a right one—if our cauſe is juſt, it is high time we were all rationally ſatisfied of it; and, with a cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al union, and ſpirited reſolution, engaged for the ſupport of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop</hi> 3. IT is nothing ſtrange, or new, if in proſecuting a juſt war, we meet with ſevere and repeated rebukes of Heaven, for our ſins.</p>
            <p>MANKIND are apt to judge of a cauſe by its good or bad ſucceſs, and that from ſome of the firſt and earlieſt events that turn up; and before it comes any thing near the turning point, and final iſſue. This has been the caſe with ſome, in reſpect to the controverſy ſubſiſting between us and Britain.</p>
            <p>BUT where did we learn that a good cauſe ſhall certainly have a conſtant, uninterrupted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſucceſſes, from beginning to end; or that a bad cauſe is never attended with any fortunate events, that for the preſent, ſeem to favor and ſupport it?—Not from a juſt obſervation of the courſe of things in our world, under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the great Sovereign—Not from the ſacred ſcriptures, certainly: When Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael was come over Jordan, to root out the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Canaan, and take poſſeſſion of their land, certainly their cauſe was juſt, for they were
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015602_0027_0F998D9AED2A06E8"/>
acting by expreſs orders from Heaven; yet they had not an uninterrupted courſe of ſucceſſes. When they went up againſt Ai, they were repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with loſs. There may be other Achans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a bad cauſe, which may occaſion bad ſucceſs. So when Iſrael went to war againſt their brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> they were right in this, their cauſe was juſt, GOD repeatedly approves of it, and bids them go on with it: And yet they met with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry awful ſcenes of divine rebuke, and ill ſucceſs, in the proſecution of it: Their two firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> coſt them no leſs than forty thouſand lives, with the loſs of the battle, each time; ſo that it is no new thing, for a people, proſecuting a juſt cauſe, to meet with ſore frowns and rebukes of Heaven, by the way:</p>
            <p>AND therefore, according to <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this calls for mourning and deep humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before GOD, and a ſerious concern to obtain pardon and reconciliation with him, yet it is no ſufficient ground of diſcouragement, from a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecution of the cauſe, with hope in the mercy of GOD, to ſupport and carry it through, in his own wiſe and holy, time and way.</p>
            <p>THIS head, I conſider as the improvement of my ſubject, and accordingly, ſhall handle it with a more expreſs and particular application to our own caſe. We ſee the conduct of Iſrael in my text, it is a worthy example; I pray come, let us ſet upon the imitation of it. Not only do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſearch further into the cauſe, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015602_0028_0F998D9C08E3C5A8"/>
ill ſucceſs, to ſee if it be agreeable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, that they proſecute it ſtill (which I have already ſpoken to) but alſo, with great and ſerious concern, they ſet themſelves to enquire out the cauſe of theſe ſore misfortunes, which had befallen them, and to put it away: "<hi>They went up to the Houſe of God, and wept, and ſat there before the Lord, and faſted until even; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings before the Lord.</hi>"</p>
            <p>WE are following their example this day, in externals: O that we might alſo, in the ſpirit and truth of theſe great duties, which we find them here engaged in. Many awful ſcenes have turned up, ſince the commencement of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy war, with our brethren of Britain; much American, as well as Britiſh blood has been ſhed: The enemy has at one time and another, gotten conſiderable advantage againſt us: And could we reaſonably expect any other, even in the natural courſe of things? Could a cauſe, ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as ours, be carried on without ſuch ſcenes of calamity and diſtreſs attending it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Lord would work very miracles for us, to prevent it? (which we have no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.) But as all events are in the hand of GOD, ſo the moſt natural occurrences are capable of a moral view, and ſhould be ever conſidered by us in that light: And in a moral view, that is to ſay, in a view of the character of the great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the world, and our own character as a people, had we not reaſon to expect all this
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015602_0029_0F998D9CAB6A3648"/>
that has already befallen us? Yea, and a great deal more ſcourging and correction from the Lord's righteous hand. Even though our cauſe was good, and he was determined to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, and give us the deſired ſucceſs, in the end. The ſerious, ſenſible and thinking part of America were, even ready to tremble with awful concern, at our plunging into this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral war with Britain, to think what a ſore ſcourge the righteous Governor of the world, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably make it to us, according to his wonted way with his people, under great degeneracy; even while they were fully perſuaded of the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the cauſe, and duty of proſecuting it; and entertained withal, a comfortable hope that it would pleaſe him to crown our efforts with final ſucceſs. When Iſrael met with repeated and heavy frowns and loſſes in the war with their brother <hi>Benjamin, "they wept before the Lord,"</hi> not only, nor chiefly, for their ill ſucceſs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and eſpecially, for their ſins, whereby they had procured theſe awful rebukes of Heaven—to be ſo ſeverely puniſhed, though on the right ſide of the queſtion, by the hand of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who were altogether in the wrong: Hereby they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſin, and brought to a concerned ſenſe of their guilt, not in reſpect to the cauſe in hand, but in other things; in reſpect to their general character, as being now, a very degenerate, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidden people, and of the divine anger againſt them herefor: Therefore they fall to offering ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of attonement to the offended Deity; which, if done in faith, looking forward, to the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015602_0030_0F998D9D24F3BB68"/>
great Propitiation to be offered in due time, to put away ſin, with broken, penitent hearts, and a fixed reſolution (Divine Grace helping) to put away their ſins, and reform their lives, was juſt the thing that Providence was ſo loudly calling them to; the likelieſt, yea, a ſure way to better ſucceſs: And it is with manifold wiſdom, that the Lord takes this method with his people, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when juſtly called to arms, to chaſten and correct them by the hand of the enemy, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they are grown very corrupt, before he ſmiles upon their enterpriſe, and works the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſalvation for them: Thus, he uſes to humble their pride, beat them off from ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and bring them to truſt in him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their hope and help to lie on him: Thus he prepares the way, for the glory of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and ſalvation to be given to him, to whom it of right belongs; which, otherwiſe, they would aſcribe to themſelves. This method is neceſſary to be taken with them, to bring them to a ſenſe of their ſins, of GOD'S righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anger thereat; and ſo, of their awful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and put them upon a concerned ſeeking his reconciled face and favor; and thus prepare them for mercy, that it may be conferred upon them, in a way, honorary to GOD, and his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Oh! that the ſore correction, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had from the hand of GOD, by our unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, opppreſſive and bloody brethren of Britain, as his inſtruments, might effectually anſwer
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015602_0031_0F998D9E62E3EE38"/>
theſe wiſe and holy ends of Providence with us. GOD'S ſuffering this diſtreſſing war to ariſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our brethren and us, is an awful token of his anger; and many things that have occurred, ſince the commencement of it, muſt in all reaſon be ranked under the ſame head; And will not all this alarm and rouſe us?—make us ſenſible of our ſin and danger, and fill us with a deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to obtain pardon and reconciliation with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Heaven. It is ſurpriſing to think how ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, careleſs and ſecure, we, in general are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very awful hand of GOD upon us: But truly, ſirs, this will never do, to ſleep on thus; if we do, I am afraid that GOD will preſently rouſe us with a dreadful vengeance; for it is an awful thing—a matter of higheſt inſult, and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Heaven, for a people, thus to trifle and play with the dreadful ſhaking of the rod of GOD over them, and brandiſhing his glittering ſpear about them: By and by, if thus we go on (and perhaps ſooner than we are aware) GOD will make us know it to our coſt. We cannot har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ourſelves againſt him, and proſper: But when he judges, he will overcome.</p>
            <p>IF peradventure for his own honor's ſake, as moral Governor of the world, and for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs of the cauſe, which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in againſt our oppreſſive brethren of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it ſhould pleaſe GOD to ſupport it, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it through; yet we ſhould have nothing, in reaſon, to expect at his hand, if we are not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and reformed by all this, but ſome more

            <p>COME then, I pray let us awake out of ſleep—let us "<hi>ſhew ourſelves men,</hi>" at leaſt, and, I truſt there is a goodly number yet left, ſcattered here and there, who are in a capacity, by virtue of new and divine principles implanted in them, to ſhew themſelves chriſtians: Let us ſet our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with a prayerful ſeriouſneſs, to that great, and all-concerning duty of conſideration, the neglect, or too ſlight performance of which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does the world; let us ſeriouſly conſider the great and manifold mercies of GOD to us—our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſtinguiſhing privileges, and ungrateful abuſe of them—the awful alarms of Providence, and our careleſs and impious contempt of them, and the like; and peradventure, while we are muſing, the fire may burn, and a divine influence concurring, our hearts be wrought by this means, to a broken, penitent, concerned frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſuch as GOD has promiſed to have reſpect unto. Let us ſet ourſelves to an immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the outward, groſs, abominable ſins, that are ſo riſe among us; extravagance, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, extortion, prophaneſs, intemperance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and the like; for which nothing is wanting, but a willing mind, and determined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; withal, uniting our earneſt, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and unwearied cries to Heaven, that GOD will pleaſe, by a plentiful out-pouring of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to ſet on foot, and carry on the great and bleſſed work, of real, internal, heart-reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vital piety among us.</p>

WHEN Iſrael was brought to this, in a broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted ſenſe of their ſins, "<hi>to weep before the Lord, and offer to him their burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings,</hi>" why now, ſays he, "<hi>go up again, and to-morrow I will deliver them into your hands:</hi>" This to-morrow (bleſſed be GOD) ſeems to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dawned upon us, in the late repeated, and very conſiderable ſucceſſes of the American Arms. If his judgments have not yet, oh! may the goodneſs of GOD to ſo undeſerving, and ill-deſerving a people, lead us to repentance: And while we evidently ſee that he is yet waiting to be gracious, let us immediately fall at his feet, on the knee of ſubmiſſion, and implore his further mercy and aid; and let us bear it in mind, that we have reaſon to expect GOD'S protection and help, only in the uſe of proper means, or by his bleſſing on our exertions.</p>
            <p>IT was an ancient maxim, "<hi>Wo! to the conquered.</hi>" This wo, my brethren, will be like to fall on us, with many a horrible circumſtance of aggravation; and ſo abide on our poſterity; if we are conquered by our aſſuming, imperious brethren of Britain.</p>
            <p>THEY told us long ago, before they were half ſo angry with us as now, that they had a right to make laws to bind us in ALL caſes whatſoever: Horrid power!

of the latter, I ſee not how it will mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much; for, if it means any thing, I think it muſt mean ſo much as this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that we lie, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their will (ſuppoſe in temporals only) and they are the ſole judges, how we are to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſpoſed of.

Is not ſuch a claim to be denied by free-men, and its correſpondent meaſures to be rectified, with a ſpirited, firm and perſevering reſolution? Surely, our cauſe is ſuch as calls for exertion, for its ſupport—an exertion not to be diſcouraged, not to be hindered, by a thouſand dangers and difficulties in the way, ſo long as there is any hope of ſucceſs left.</p>
            <p>NEVER let it be ſaid, that men are ſlow to run, when neceſſity calls; nor let a worthy reward (beſides the generous ſatisfaction of aſſiſting to reſcue invaded liberty, out of the hands of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming tyranny) be grudged to them, who willingly offer themſelves to the difficulties, and dangers of the camp and field, in defence of a cauſe ſo juſt, ſo great, and of ſuch intereſting importance to the common rights of mankind, and the Liberty and welfare of our dear country, not only in the preſent, but alſo, in ſucceeding times and generations.</p>
