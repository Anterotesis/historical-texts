            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE laſt Letter wherewith you Honoured us, Dated in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how Acceptable it would be, to receive a freſh and late Account, of the <hi>Progreſs made in Evangelizing the poor Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages in this Countrey:</hi> And we ſhall, as under all the Obligations imaginable to do it, Endeavour your ſatisfaction in a Point ſo worthy to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quird after; hoping that our Account may as <hi>Good News from a far Countrey,</hi> prove no ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Entertainment.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Magnalia Chriſti Americana,</hi> or, Hiſtory of <hi>New-England,</hi> Publiſhed at <hi>London,</hi> Two or Three Years ago, there is, The <hi>Life</hi> of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable ELIOT; In which there is a Letter to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001224_0003_0FB1815A68DA6B78"/>
Dr. <hi>Leuſden,</hi> a Profeſſor at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> relating the Succeſs of the Goſpel among our <hi>Americans;</hi> and a full Commentary upon every Article of that Letter, declaring <hi>Who</hi> were Employ'd in that noble work, and <hi>How</hi> they managed it. And in another part of that Book, there is a long Chapter, Entituled, <hi>The Triumphs of Grace, or, A Narrative of the Succeſs which the Goſpel has had among the</hi> Indians <hi>of New-England;</hi> a Narrative, as well Atteſted as it is Remarkable. We ſhall not now Tranſcribe any Paragraphs of that Hiſtory; becauſe tis eaſy to have recourſe unto it. But they that would inſinuate, as if the People of our Profeſſion, in <hi>America,</hi> (who are for Embracing &amp; Diffuſing, the Holy Religion of Chriſt, in the <hi>Original Purity</hi> wherein His Goſpel has given it unto us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Humane Additions and Inventions) did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Propagate the Religion we Profeſs, will there find a ſufficient Confutation.</p>
            <p>We will now proceed, where that Hiſtory leaves off; and lay before your Honour, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances of the <hi>Evangelical Work</hi> among our <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were in the Southern parts of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, about Four or Five Years ago, (when your Commiſſioners here ſent a Couple of Engliſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who were Maſters of the Indian Tongue, to viſit them,) no leſs than <hi>Thirty ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi> of <hi>Indians,</hi> who commonly Aſſembled every <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and a great part of them to

               <hi>Lectures</hi> on other Dayes alſo, for the Worſhip of the Great GOD, and our Lord JESUS CHRIST. We cannot underſtand, That the Number of the Congregations, is conſiderably altered from what it was, when the Gentlemen, who then Examined their Condition, brought us that Report of them.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the Number of <hi>Indians</hi> in this Land, is not Comparable to what it was Fifty Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. The Hand of God, has very ſtrangely waſted them; and the <hi>War</hi> which they began upon the Engliſh in the Year, 1675. haſtened a ſtrange Deſolation upon whole Nations of them. Almoſt all that remain under the Influences of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in this <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Province are ſo far Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anized, as that they Believe there is a God, and but One God, and that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World. Mr. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience Mayhew,</hi> who is Grandſon, to the Old Gentleman that firſt Inſtructed the Indians on <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> and like his Grandfather, a Laborious Teacher among them, informs us; That there are about One Hundred and Four-Score Families of <hi>Indians</hi> on that Iſland; and that of theſe there are no more than Two Perſons, which now remain in their Paganiſm. He is at this Time, gathering another Church of <hi>Indians,</hi> whereof he is himſelf to be the <hi>Paſtor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Indian Congregations, there were, at the Time of our laſt Viſitation, (which we ſaid, was about Four or Five Years ago,) about
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001224_0005_0FB1815D6B3A9AC8"/>
               <hi>Thirty Seven</hi> Indians, who were the conſtant Preachers of the Goſpel unto them, in their own Language; In which they have <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> and <hi>Bibles,</hi> and <hi>Pſalm-books,</hi> and other Books of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Tranſlated by the vaſt Labours of worthy Engliſh-men.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there are Seven or Eight <hi>Engliſh Miniſters,</hi> who have Learn'd the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, and Viſit the <hi>Indian</hi> Aſſemblies, and <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Preach</hi> among them, and give ſuch Directions, as they ſee needful for their Affairs. The <hi>Indian</hi> Miniſters, very frequently apply themſelves to theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones, for their Advice, about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing their Flocks under their Charge. And ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preachers, do conſtantly ſpend every <hi>Lords Day,</hi> with the <hi>Indian</hi> Aſſemblies; having taken the Charge of them.</p>
            <p>How the Ordinary Congregations among the <hi>Indians</hi> are inclined, and how inſtructed, may be a little apprehended, from ſome Lines in a Letter, now lying before us, Dated not many Weeks ago, from a very Valuable Servant of God, namely, Mr. <hi>Samuel Danforth.</hi> He ſayes; <q>They met me at <hi>Little Compton</hi> about two Months ſince, to hear me Preach: Had you been there with me to ſee how well they fill'd up the <hi>Seats;</hi> with what <hi>Gravity</hi> they behaved themſelves; what <hi>Attention</hi> they gave; what <hi>Affection</hi> they ſhew'd; how powerfully <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Pray,</hi> having never before heard him <hi>Pray,</hi> and being willing to have ſome Trial of his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in order to his Approbation for Office;) how melodiouſly <hi>Jonathan George</hi> [another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian] ſet the Tune for the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and carried it out; and how dexterouſly the Young Lads of Twelve Years old, could turn to the <hi>Proofs</hi> thro' out the Sermon; and how Thankful they were to me at the laſt, that I would take ſo much Pains, as to come ſo far from home, to Preach to them; I am ſure, you would have been much affected with it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' there are ſome Congregations of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which are not Advanced unto all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Evangelical <hi>Church-state,</hi> Combining for, and Enjoying of, <hi>all ſpecial Ordinances;</hi> yet a conſiderable Number of them are ſo. Some <hi>New Churches</hi> have been lately form'd, and fill'd; and more will quickly be Gathered. They have <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of their own; <hi>Ordained,</hi> ſome times by the Hands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters, and ſometimes by the Hands of <hi>Indian</hi> Miniſters, in the preſence of the Engliſh; all after the ſolemn Engliſh manner. And by <hi>Admonitions,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications,</hi> Publickly diſpenſed, they proceed againſt Scandalous Offendors, when any ſuch are found among them.</p>
            <p>We ſhall here inſert, an Extract of a late Letter, from Mr. <hi>Joſiah Torrey,</hi> an hopeful Young Man, who has Learned the Indian Tongue, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001224_0007_0FB181625317D910"/>
begins to Preach to them in their own Language. He having been an Eye-witneſs of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, writes to us in words following.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Worſhip, with the affectionate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of ſuch as are Admitted into the Church, make me hope, that many of them may have the work of the Spirit wrought in them, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the working of the mighty Power of God.</hi> Their method, reſpecting thoſe that are Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Church Communion, is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practiſed among the Churches in moſt parts. The perſon to be Admitted, ſtands forth, in the midſt of the Aſſembly; and firſt makes Declaration of his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and ſometimes deſires Informations in Things more arduous and doubtful. And then, he makes a <hi>Confeſſion of Sin;</hi> which they do, (as I have ſeen,) with <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> like him in the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And then, he gives an Account of <hi>Experiences</hi> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings, and Comforts, in which they are large and particular. After which, (much Counſel and Exhortation, to remain ſtedfaſt in the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Wayes</hi> of the Lord, being given them, by their <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Elder,</hi> they are Admitted. I would (and not ungroundedly) hope, That <hi>Additions</hi> are <hi>made unto the Church daily of ſuch as ſhall be Saved.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001224_0008_0FB18164AA0D59B0"/>
There are many, which maintain a Chriſtian Converſation, and are to be accounted, not <hi>Almoſt,</hi> but <hi>Altogether Chriſtians.</hi> And this does Encourage the Preaching of the Goſpel to them, when we ſee, it pleaſes God, to make it <hi>His Power unto Salvation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>About the <hi>Manner</hi> of performing the more <hi>Stated Exerciſes</hi> of Religion, in Publick, among the <hi>Indians,</hi> there needs no Account but this; They are Conformed unto the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But we have now before us, a Letter very lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, from as knowing and as faithful a Perſon as could be Enquired of, wherein he ſpeaks a little more particularly.</p>
            <p>He ſayes; <q>You may Remember, That your ſelf, with ſome others, were pleaſed once to bear me Company, to a Lecture at <hi>Aſſawampſet,</hi> and were an Eye-witneſs, of their Grave, Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Attentive Deportment, in their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and of their Excellent <hi>Singing of Pſalms,</hi> with moſt raviſhing Melody.

by any, but it will provoke them. Not long ſince, an <hi>Indian</hi> Lodg'd at an <hi>Engliſh mans</hi> Houſe one Night; and the next Day he viſited me, and ask'd, <hi>Why the man at whoſe Houſe he Lodg'd, did not Pray in his Family?</hi> Seeing that Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> taught the <hi>Indians</hi> to do it every Day, Morning and Evening: he thought it ſtrange, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould direct them to <hi>Pray in their Families,</hi> and yet not do it themſelves. But at laſt, he entertained the <hi>Diſtinction;</hi> That there were <hi>Matchet</hi> Engliſh men, as well as <hi>Matchet</hi> Indians; and that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not practiſe, as they had been taught to do. [<hi>Matchet;</hi> that is to ſay, Naughty, or Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.]</q>

            <p>The ſame Gentleman, thus proceeds in that Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To your laſt Enquiry, <hi>What I think there may be of Piety among them?</hi> Sir, I think, that there were many of the Old Generation, who were inſtructed by the Reverend ELIOT, and others, which <hi>Died in the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> of them are in Heaven, as an <hi>Earneſt</hi> of more to follow. I think, the <hi>Cenſorious Engliſh</hi> among us, are not to be the <hi>Rule for our Charity</hi> about them. Yet let me ſay; I could never yet En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of any Plantation, or Aſſembly of <hi>Indians,</hi> but the moſt <hi>Cenſorious Engliſh</hi> would grant, There were <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> Perſons in that Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who, they verily believed, were <hi>Sound
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001224_0010_0FB1816731D8E8F8"/>
Chriſtians,</hi> tho' they Condemned the reſt. Whereas a <hi>Charitable</hi> man, would have reckon'd theſe <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four,</hi> to have been the moſt <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Peity</hi> among them; and have granted the reſt, to have ſuch a meaſure of <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the Goſpel-method of Salvation, and to be ſo ready to ſubmit with moſt admirable <hi>Patience</hi> to the <hi>Church Cenſures</hi> among them, and ſo <hi>Penitent</hi> in their Confeſſions of their Faults, and Fearful afterwards of Relapſing into the ſame or like Faults; as might be a juſt Foundation to hope, That they are Travelling the right way to Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Frenchified Indians</hi> in the Eaſtern parts of this Province, have by their long Wars upon us, denied us an Opportunity to <hi>Chriſtianize</hi> them. While Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> was our Governour, we had One Years Peace with thoſe Indians; And in that Year, we furniſhed the Governour, with a Preacher, to carry the offer of the Goſpel unto them. But while the Preacher was preparing for his Journey, they perfidiouſly broke out into New Hoſtilities; by which our Attempt was then defeated. When the Earl of <hi>Bellomont</hi> became our Governour, we had a longer lucid Interval of Peace with them. In this time, there came ſeveral of their Chief men to <hi>Boſton,</hi> whom the Governour ſent unto one of us, to be diſcourſed about matters of Religion. When they were
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001224_0011_0FB18168A8427520"/>
told; <hi>That they ought to Worſhip none but that God, who made Heaven and Earth,</hi> and, <hi>That the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Graven Images, Crucifixes, the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and other Saints, was diſpleaſing to the Great and only True God;</hi> they ſtood like men amaz'd; they replied not a word. They were then told, <hi>That we would ſend Miniſters unto them, who ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the true way to Eternal Life, if they would receive them:</hi> Whereupon they declared, They were not willing that any ſhould be ſent unto them. The <hi>French Prieſts</hi> have made them, rather <hi>twice more the Children of Hell,</hi> (more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>) than while they were meer <hi>Pagans.</hi> Yet we gave not over. We found our Applications to <hi>Engliſh Preachers</hi> ineffectual; we applied our ſelves unto <hi>Indian Preachers,</hi> in hopes, that ſome ſuch might be prevailed withal, to run the deſperate Hazards of carrying the Goſpel unto that <hi>Fooliſh people,</hi> and imparting to them the Oracles which might make them <hi>Wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> But while we were proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this Deſign, they treacherouſly and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murdered near an Hundred of our Peo-who, upon the Faith of a <hi>Peace,</hi> which they had juſt before Sworn to, were Lovingly treating them in their Houſes; and Commenced that grievous and bloody <hi>War,</hi> which is not yet ended.</p>
            <p>We have heretofore been at conſiderable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, to Encourage the Eſſayes of Good men,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001224_0012_0FB1816BE42138C8"/>
to Chriſtianize the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Indians, in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Connecticut.</hi> But they have been Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their Paganiſm; and their Obſtinacy has put a ſtop at preſent unto our Endeavours; which yet we will Revive, as ſoon and as well as we can.</p>
            <p>A moſt Exemplary <hi>Indian Miniſter,</hi> whoſe Name is <hi>Japhet,</hi> has of late made ſeveral Viſits among his Countrey men the <hi>Pagan Indians,</hi> about the <hi>Narraganſet</hi> Countrey; and God has Crown'd his Endeavours with conſiderable Succeſſes. We Reſolve to give him all poſſible Encouragement.</p>
            <p>We have left no Stone unturned, that we might obtain ſome Able and Faithful <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> for the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> that are ſome Hundreds of Miles diſtant from us, to the Weſtward. All that we have hitherto accompliſhed, is, That we have Supported and Rewarded (and at this Day continue to do ſo,) the Pains of ſeveral <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters, who proceed as far as they can, in Communicating the Knowledge of GOD and CHRIST, unto thoſe diſtant Salvages. And of late, they have ſeen ſome deſirable Succeſſes of their Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The main Support, that we have had for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive part of this Work, has been from the Revenues, remitted hither, by the Honourable <hi>Corporation, for Propagating the Goſpel among the Indians.</hi> But then, the Liberality of Pious men,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001224_0013_0FB1816E1C3B5B20"/>
among our ſelves has alſo been Employ'd this way, upon multiplied occaſions. Particular Gentlemen in this Countrey, have often <hi>Deviſed Liberal Things,</hi> to promote Chriſtianity among the <hi>Indians.</hi> Beſides many other Expreſſions of Charity towards them, given by others, we ought not to leave unmentioned, the <hi>Meeting-Houſe,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Samuel Sewall,</hi> (the Secretary to your Commiſſioners here) has Built for them; and the Books, the Publiſhing and Scattering of which <hi>Mr. Edward Bromfield,</hi> (another of your Commiſſioners) has more than once procured to Fortify them againſt their Peculiar Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Enlighten them in the Myſteries of God.</p>
            <p>The Studies of your <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> are now Engaging more Particularly, upon the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of bringing the <hi>Indians</hi> into the moſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Circumſtances, that can be Propoſed. But this muſt be a work of Time; and in the mean time, tho' we could with the Evangelical Work among the <hi>Indians</hi> had leſs Difficulties to Clog it, yet we have Reaſon to be glad, that ſo much of Chriſtianity and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity does attend it, as there does.</p>
            <p>As the Converſion of the <hi>Natives</hi> to our Holy Religion, was One Special Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, by thoſe Good Men that firſt Planted this Countrey, when a waſt and vaſt Wilderneſs; ſo the Salvation of the many <hi>Natives</hi> that have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001224_0014_0FB1816F746B0588"/>
been here Converted unto God, has been richly worth all the Pains and Coſts therein Expended.</p>
            <p>We render to Your Honour, and to the Honourable Corporation, our moſt grateful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of all Your Pious Care, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Work, wherein the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and the Weal of many Souls, are ſo greatly Concerned: Recommending You to the Divine Favour, we Subſcribe,</p>
