            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>WHEREAS through the good Hand of God upon us, there is a College founded in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex</hi>

PRACTICES upon the Preceeding Laws of 42 and 50, which originally conſtituted the Overſeers and Corporation of <hi>Harvard-College.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The four preceeding Laws of 42, 50, 57, 72, were all the ſtanding Laws, on which the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſaid College was founded, in old Charter Times. And ſince Practices upon ancient Laws, neareſt the Times wherein ſuch Laws were made, do beſt explain and interpret them; here are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined ſome Acts of the Court, in thoſe early Times, which ſhow what Senſe the Court put upon theſe two Laws which originally conſtituted the Overſeers and Corporation of ſaid College; and what Powers the Court, without Reſerve to themſelves, had been <hi>pleaſed</hi> to grant in theſe Laws to the Overſeers and Corporation of ſaid College.

                  </hi> 1654. After the Court had conſtituted the Overſeers and Corporation of ſaid College; it appears from the Province Records, (Vol. 3. P. 245) That the Court <q>on Peruſal of the RETURN of the <hi>Committee</hi> appointed to conſider of the College-Buſineſs, ORDER that all the STOCK ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the College ſhould be committed to the <hi>Care</hi> and TRUST of the <hi>Overſeers</hi> of ſaid College.</q> Now by the Act of 42 the Overſeers had the <hi>College-Stock</hi> given to them; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Charter of 50 takes it out of their Hands and puts it into the Hands of the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and now in 54 the Court in an extraordinary Caſe INTERPOSE and <hi>ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At firſt View this may ſeem an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Act in the Court, who by a ſolemn <hi>Grant</hi> of the Charter of 50 had veſted the <hi>Property</hi> of that Stock in the ſaid Corporation.

And the Overſeers in <hi>November</hi> following provided another Preſident, and in the mean Time <hi>commit</hi> the Care and Government of the ſaid College to the Fellows thereof.—And thus the Overſeers of ſaid College acted through the whole of this Affair; not by any Power of their own, but by a delegated Power from the Court; for this Power <hi>expired</hi> as ſoon as, according to Order, they had made <hi>Return</hi> to the COURT who had <hi>employed</hi> them in this Affair.</p>
               <p>Let it be noted that this Reſignation of Mr. <hi>Dunſter,</hi> implied in it a <hi>proper</hi> Diſmiſſion of him; for a <hi>voluntary</hi> Reſignation is of a quite different Nature. Thus a Member of ſaid Corporation reſiding at Harvard College when he deſigns to ſettle abroad in the World may <hi>reſign</hi> to the Preſident of ſaid College, <hi>i. e.</hi> may <hi>inform</hi> the Preſident that he is determined to leave the College and quit his Poſt in it, (which none can hinder him from doing.) But this is far from implying that the ſaid Preſident can <hi>force</hi> ſuch a Member to reſign. But <hi>that</hi> Power that can rightfully <hi>force</hi> him to reſign, is moſt certainly A POWER which can rightfully <hi>diſmiſſ</hi> him. Now this was Preſident <hi>Dunſter</hi>'s Caſe. For the Overſeers of ſaid College, when they acted as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates</hi> from the COURT, tell him expreſsly tht <q>unleſs he would give <hi>Satisfaction</hi> according to the Rules of Chriſt they muſt be Conſtrained to furniſh the College with <hi>another</hi> Preſident.</q> So this Power included in it a Power from the COURT to <hi>diſmiſs</hi> him.</p>
               <p>N. B. The <hi>next</hi> and the <hi>only other</hi> Inſtance of a Diſmiſſion of a Member of ſaid Corporation was on Feb. <hi>laſt</hi> 1741, 2; without <hi>any</hi> Power from the COURT or <hi>any Act</hi> of ſaid Corporation for the ſame, but by the Sole and SOVEREIGN Authority of the Overſeers of ſaid College; who having no plain Law for it not from Times immemorial any Inſtance of ſuch a Thing on their Side, <hi>ſeemed</hi> now reſolved to <hi>make</hi> one, that ſo they might <hi>plead</hi> it in future Times.

               <p>AFTER the vacating the old Colony Charter of the Maſſachuſets in 1684, there were ſome new Laws or College-Charters made by the general Court of this Province. But theſe Laws (as all others made under our preſent Province-Charter) were of Courſe to be ſent Home for the Royal Approbation; And they all were ſent Home accordingly, and have been diſapproved. So that no Laws whatever remain, but the four preceeding Laws fo 42, 50, 57 and 72, as the Foundation on which the Government of the ſaid C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  <p>Saturday, Dec. 6. 1707. The Repreſentatives returned the Vote paſſed in Council the 4th current referring to the College, with their Concurrence thereto; and this further Addition thereon, viz. That the Sum for Salary be <hi>One Hundred and Fifty Pounds.</hi>

               <p>To which the Council voted and Agreement, and the Governour conſented</p>
               <p>This was the LAST Act of the COURT relating to the Government of ſaid College, and this Act refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that College back again to its original Foundation on the College-Charter of 50. <hi>Which had not been</hi> REPEALED <hi>or</hi> NULLED; as the old Colony Law of 42 had <hi>been,</hi> by the Incorporating Act of 1650.

               <p>IN Order to the Proof of This, Let it be Premiſed.
<list>
                     <item>1. That from all the Preceeding Laws it appears that the ſaid <hi>Harvard-College</hi> was originally the College of the General Court of the <hi>Maſſachuſett;</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; That the General Court of ſaid Colony <hi>built</hi> it and <hi>named</hi> it and ordered <hi>where</hi> it ſhould be built and <hi>what Kind</hi> of Building it ſhould be; And that all the Powers which any Perſons ever had from the beginning, or now have over the ſaid College, were originally derived to them from the General Court of the Colony aboveſaid; ſo that no Perſons whatever can have any Power over the ſaid College, but only ſo far as the General Court have been <hi>pleaſed</hi> to grant it to them.</item>
                     <item>2. It appears in particular that the Overſeers and Corporation of ſaid College owe their Being and all the ſtanding Powers They now have, or ever had over the ſaid College, To Four Laws of the General Court which were made in the Year 1642, 1650, 1657 and 1672. The <hi>Firſt</hi> of which Laws originally conſtituted Overſeers of ſaid College; The <hi>Second</hi> incorporated the ſaid College, and is called the Charter of 50; The <hi>Third</hi> is called an Appendix to ſaid Charter; And the <hi>Fourth</hi> confirmed, added to or altered, ſome or <hi>all</hi> of theſe preceeding Laws. So that no Powers can now belong to the Overſeers and Corporation of ſaid College but thoſe Powers which the Court granted to them in ſome or all of theſe four Laws.</item>
                     <item>3. That in the two latter Laws of 57 and 72, the Court gave to the Overſeers of ſaid College no <hi>New</hi> Powers of any Importance over the ſaid Corporation; And ſo there is no Occaſion to conſider any of theſe four Laws, but the two <hi>Firſt,</hi> in order to determine whether the Overſeers of ſaid College have an <hi>Independent</hi> and Sovereign Power over the ſaid Corporation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now from theſe two Laws, which conſtituted the Overſeers and Corporation of ſaid College, it manifeſtly appears that the Court did not veſt the Overſeers of ſaid College with ſuch a ſovereign Power over the ſaid Corporation; But that the Court, who originally had this Power, reſerved it to themſelves; And are VISITORS of ſaid College.

               <p>Some truly worthy and valuable teaching Elders of the ſix neighbouring Towns are of Opinion, <q>That the Law of 42 aboveſaid is the great STANDING Law that contains all the more important and ſuperior Powers over the ſaid College; And that the Charter of 50 was made as a Thing by the BY, and only empower the Preſident and Fellows to do ſome <hi>ſmall</hi> Matters; and for the Sake of the College-Stock, it being neceſſary that they ſhould be a Corporation in Law in order to acquire and hold a Stock.</q> But in Anſwer hereto. 1.

Or is this treating the Preſident and Fellows as ſtill in a State of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority and <hi>Pupillage</hi> under Overſeers, when a <hi>general</hi> Meeting of ALL the Overſeers can make <hi>no</hi> Concluſion at all, and that in the moſt <hi>great</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> Caſes, but by <hi>conſenting</hi> to a Concluſion made on ſuch Caſes by the Corporation? — Thus again 'tis enacted in ſaid Charter, <q>That the Preſident and Fellows ſhall forever hereafter in Name and Fact be one Body Politick or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate in Law to ALL Intents and Purpoſes</q> and therefore <hi>not</hi> to ONE Intent and Purpoſe <hi>only.</hi> viz.

And as a Law that incorporates a Town can by a very juſt Figure of Speech be called the ORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINAL of ſuch a Town, ſo the incorporating Act of 1650 above-mentioned is, in its own Nature, the ORIGINAL of Harvard-College, as well as it has been declared by the Legiſlature to <hi>Be</hi> the ORIGINAL of ſaid College. And therefore</p>
               <p n="2">II. The latter Law of 1650, which incorporated Harvard College, and not the Prior Law of 1642, contains thoſe Powers which the preſent Overſeers have over the Corporation of the ſaid College.</p>

Here let to be noted that a <hi>Guard</hi> was placed at the <hi>very</hi> Entrance on the laſt general Article (page 18) againſt ſuch a Power, as being no where granted in the Charter of 50, either to the Overſeer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus the General Argument on this Head, in the Preceeding Article, is carried on <hi>Hypothetically</hi> and by Way of <hi>Suppoſition</hi> only. viz. <q>That IF the Overſeers of ſaid College had any Power in ſuch a Caſe, it muſt be in Conjunction <hi>with</hi> the Corporation and not <hi>without</hi> Them.</q> But now the Writer of this Pamphlet comes to argue <hi>Categorically</hi> and <hi>Directly</hi> againſt ſuch a Power in the Overſeers and Corporation of ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005041_0027_10168D9D5CE362C0"/>the Court has <hi>communicated</hi> this Power to Others; and therefore this Power remains in the <hi>Fountain</hi> of ALL Power over that College, which is the GENERAL COURT alone! If any Thing farther need to be added, in <hi>ſo plain a</hi> CASE! there are two Things that may be urged which put it out of all Queſtion that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court reſerved this Power to Themſelves among other Powers of VISITATION which the Court <hi>never</hi> granted to <hi>any</hi> Perſons whatever!</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Firſt is that the explanatory Law of 57 is <hi>more Silent</hi> on this Power than the Charter of 50 itſelf! Now one <hi>great</hi> Deſign of this Law of 57 was to explain or determine what might <hi>ſeem</hi> obſcure and undermined in the Charter of 50; and of all <hi>Caſes</hi> that needed to be explained or determined in ſaid Charter, <hi>This</hi> Caſe (<hi>ſuppoſing</hi> it to be contained in that Charter!) needed it the moſt; take it <hi>either</hi> Way, viz. as a Caſe not determined <hi>at all</hi> in that Charter, or as of Importance to be determined and not <hi>fitting</hi> to be left at a looſe!—<hi>Yet</hi> does that explanatory Law leave this Clauſe in the Charter (which barely mentions the removing Members of the Corporation, <hi>without</hi> mentioning who had the Power to remove them) at as great a looſe as it was before! And though this Law deſcends to ſuch <hi>little</hi> Affairs as "How the Corporation ſhould hold a Meeting to agree with <hi>College-Servants</hi> and be reſponſible to the Overſeers for all <hi>ſuch</hi> Agreements; yet this Law ſays not one Word on ſo <hi>great</hi> and ſo <hi>undetermined</hi> a Caſe as this "Who ſhould have the Power of removing a <hi>Preſident</hi> or <hi>Fellow</hi> of ſaid Corporation" which (on <hi>both</hi> the Accounts <hi>above</hi>) needed more to be explained or determined by this Law of 57 than any Thing in that Charter whatever. Nothing therefore can <hi>account</hi> for the Reaſon why this explanatory Law ſhould paſs over ſo important a Matter in Silence, but this, viz. that ſuch a Power, not being granted in ſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to any Perſons whatever, was never looked on in <hi>thoſe</hi> Times to be contained in that Charter <hi>at all.</hi> And THEN the Wonder ceaſes why this explanatory Law did not determine or ſettle" Who had or ſhould have ſuch a Power; for this Law was to explain or determine what was IN the ſaid Charter, and <hi>not</hi> this Power which was <hi>Still</hi> in the General Court (for who can imagine that the Court in this explanatory Law deſigned to explain or ſettle their OWN Powers?) And hereon alſo <hi>Another</hi> Wonder ceaſes viz. Why the Overſeers of ſaid College ſhould be ſo <hi>wanting to Themſelves</hi> as no to put ſuch a Thing into their <hi>Propoſals</hi> to the Court for Explanation (though theſe PROPOSALS, which were for the <hi>Benefit</hi> of the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, was the very Occaſion of making this Law itſelf, as appears from the Preamble.) The Reaſon hereof ſeems to be very plain viz. Becauſe ALL Parties concerned with the Government of the College were <hi>conſcious,</hi> in thoſe early Times which were ſo near the Time wherein ſaid Charter was granted, that the <hi>Power</hi> of removing the <hi>Preſident</hi> or <hi>any</hi> Member of ſaid Corporation was never given BY Charter to any Perſons whaterver, but that the Court had reſerved it to themſelves. And therefore if one (among the reſt) of the PROPOSALS of the Overſeers to the Court had been to explain or determine "Who had the Power of removing the Preſident, or any other Members of the Corporation, on <hi>Male-Adminiſtration</hi> of when guilty of <hi>ſundry Crimes and Miſdemeanours;</hi> The Overſeers of ſaid College (with all due and <hi>ſincere</hi> Deference to them be it mentioned) might have been honourably <hi>reminded</hi> by the <hi>Court</hi> "WHO had <hi>This</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005041_0028_10168D9EF092AD58"/>Power <hi>in Themſelves</hi> but three Years before, in the Caſe of Preſident <hi>Dunſter</hi> "When the Court thought <hi>fit</hi> to appoint the Overſeers (without joining the Corporation <hi>with</hi> them) as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to manage that Affair, and "to make <hi>Return</hi> to the Court of what they had done therein."</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Thing which puts it out of Queſtion that the Court reſerved this Power to Themſelves, is, the manifeſt Difference made in the Charter between the removing a Member of the Corporation and removing inferiour College Officers and Servants. Now to exhibit this to <hi>Eye ſight,</hi> let thoſe two Paſſages be laid together, which are the <hi>only</hi> Paſſages in the Charter that mention the removing of Both theſe Kinds of Officers.</p>

                  </q>—</p>
               <p>FINIS to <hi>This</hi> Power granted in the Charter!</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chuſing</hi> and <hi>Removing</hi> College Servants <hi>by</hi> Charter. <q>And the Preſident and Fellows, or major Part of them, from Time to Time may meet and CHUSE ſuch <hi>Officers and Servants</hi> for the College, and make ſuch Allowance to them, <hi>and</hi> THEM <hi>alſo to</hi> REMOVE, <hi>and after</hi> DEATH <hi>or</hi> REMOVAL <hi>to chuſe ſuch others</hi>—as they ſhall think Fit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>equally</hi> expreſs and particular is this Law in ſpecifying Who ſhould have the Power of <hi>chuſing</hi> Both theſe Kinds of Officers. But when it comes to ſay Who ſhould have the Power to <hi>remove</hi> Then. -THEN <hi>appears the Difference!</hi> for as to the <hi>ſmall</hi> Power of removing College Servants, the Law is as plain and expreſs "Who ſhould have <hi>That</hi> Power, as it is "Who ſhould have the Power to <hi>Chuſe</hi> them. But as to the <hi>important</hi> Power of removing Members of the Corporation (which in Law can exiſt ſeparately from the Power of chuſing them, as well as in Conjunction <hi>

               <p>The <hi>only</hi> Objection that can be here made has, in Reality, been obviated already, viz. That <q>tis implied of Courſe, and in the Nature of the Thing that thoſe have the Power of <hi>removing</hi> who by Charter have the Power of <hi>making</hi> Members of the Corporation; ſince the Court mention not, in

For 1. The <hi>Former</hi> Suppoſition (on which the Objection is grounded) no Way <hi>accounts</hi> for the Reaſon why this Law ſo expreſly grants the <hi>ſmall</hi> Power of <hi>Removing</hi> (as well as chuſing) the <hi>inferiour</hi> Officers; and <hi>yet</hi> makes no Grant at all of ſo much <hi>greater</hi> a Power as that of removing the <hi>Superiour.</hi> Whence comes it <hi>to paſs!</hi> that this Law does not leave the <hi>leſſer</hi> Power of removing College Servants, to be <hi>implied of Courſe</hi> in the Power of <hi>chuſing</hi> them; as well as according to this Suppoſition, it does the <hi>greater</hi> Power of removing Members of the Corporation?—If this Law had not expreſly mentioned who ſhould have the Power of removing <hi>Either</hi> of theſe Kinds of Officers, the Objection would then have been of ſome Force— Or if the Law had expreſly mentioned who ſhould have the <hi>greater</hi> Power of removing Members of the Corporation and had ſaid nothing about the <hi>leſſer</hi> Power of removing College <hi>Servants;</hi> then it might have been ſuppoſed (what ſeems to be the <hi>true</hi> Way of arguing in ſuch Caſes) that the <hi>Greater</hi> Power being granted, the <hi>Leſſer</hi> was left to be <hi>underſtood</hi> and ſo <hi>implied of courſe.</hi> But ſince, unfortunately, for the Objection 'tis quite the contrary. "What poſſible Reaſon can be given [if this Law ſuppoſes <hi>of courſe</hi> and in the <hi>Nature of the Thing,</hi> theſe are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the POWER <hi>of removing</hi> who have the Power of <hi>making</hi> College Officers] that the Law is not as ſilent on the <hi>petty</hi> Power of removing a College <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> as it is abſolutely ſilent about the <hi>important</hi> Power of removing a Preſident or other Members of that Corporation? This is eaſily accounted for, on Suppoſition that the Court reſerved this <hi>greater</hi> Power entirely to themſelves; but 'tis impoſſible to account for it on Suppoſition that the Court made NO ſuch Reſerve. 2. There is no Connection in the <hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> between the Power of removing and the Power of putting into Office. So that it cannot be inferred that both theſe Powers are granted <hi>only</hi> becauſe One of them is ſo. Yea 'tis utterly untrue in <hi>Fact</hi> that thoſe always have the Power of removing, who have the Power of putting into Office. And of this the Repreſentatives themſelves, belonging to that Honourable Court who made this Law, are a known and publick Inſtance! For by the Choice of their reſpective Towns they are <hi>made</hi> Repreſentatives; but their reſpective Towns, 'tis well known, have not the Power of removing their Repreſentatives from out of the General Court; But the Houſe, alone, who have not the Power to <hi>make</hi> Repreſentatives for the Province, have yet the ſole Power to remove them from their Place in the Houſe. So that 'tis not true <hi>either Way,</hi> that thoſe have the Power
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005041_0030_10168DA60BE75918"/>of removing, who have the ſole Power of putting into Place or Truſt; nor thoſe the Power of putting into Place, who have the ſole Power of removing a Perſon from Place or Truſt—and that from one of the moſt Honourable PLACES and <hi>Truſts</hi> in the Province. Thus it appears, from ſo <hi>eminent</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that there is no Connection in the <hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> between theſe two Powers.—In Truth, they are ſometimes granted and conveyed ſeparately and ſometimes in Conjunction, juſt as the ſupreme Power from whom they are communicated thinks <hi>fit.</hi> Certainly then a <hi>General Court</hi> who originally had theſe two Powers over a College that was a Creature of their OWN, may grant the <hi>One</hi> and ſovereignly keep the <hi>Other</hi> to themſelves without granting it <hi>at all.</hi> Now an abſolute SILENCE, under ſome Circumſtances, upon One of theſe Powers (when the other is <hi>expreſly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> granted) is every Way equivalent to an <hi>Exception;</hi> and ſo makes an expreſs <hi>Negation</hi> of ſuch a Grant to be <hi>intirely</hi> ſuperfluous. And of this ſort is that <hi>Silence</hi> in the Charter on the Power of removing Members of the Corporation; for, by what has been obſerved above, it can be accounted for <hi>no other</hi> Way. But 3. and <hi>finally</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this Matter "On which Side of the Queſtion are ancient Practices upon this Law? Theſe are the beſt Expoſitors of ancient Laws.

IV. THE GREAT and GENERAL COURT who <hi>founded</hi> Harvard College, and appointed <hi>No</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors to it, when they finally incorporated the ſame, are the <hi>Sole</hi> local VISITORS of that College.</p>
               <p>Colleges <hi>muſt</hi> have Viſitors! "Every College, ſays <hi>Holt</hi> on Colleges, hath a VISITOR either by to Appointment of the Founder, or the <hi>Law</hi>" ſo that if the Founder appoints no Viſitor himſelf, the Law will do it for him. To imagine therefore that Harvard College has no Viſitor is not only a <hi>vain</hi> Fancy but a <hi>dangerous</hi> Deluſion!—If that Society has none, the Concluſion is ſhort "Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard College is NO Corporation in Law" And <hi>Then</hi> what will become of all their STOCK. 'Tis, on this Suppoſition, gone <hi>for ever</hi> out of the Hands of thoſe SEVEN that paſs by the <hi>idle</hi> Name of Preſident and Fellows of Harvard College."—<hi>The very</hi> FERRYMEN will deſpiſe them! And thoſe muſt be <hi>weaker</hi> than FERRYMEN who give any further Donations to an unincorporated Number of Men that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none, or Let them to Uſe, or ſue for them in again, by any NAME that they <hi>dare</hi> publickly own and can <hi>maintain</hi> in Law. But if that College is a Corporation, the Concluſion is as ſhort the other Way, that "VISITORS there are and <hi>muſt be</hi> Somewhere", and <hi>Theſe</hi> can call the whole Body of them to Account and make the loftieſt Head of that College to TREMBLE if they find him ſpoiling his LORD's <hi>Goods</hi> or ſmiting his Brethren with the FIST of Wickedneſs. The Power of VISITORS does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on any accidental or local Cuſtoms or Laws. It depends not even on the Appointment of the Founder himſelf! But has a <hi>neceſſary</hi> Exiſtence; and his Heirs <hi>will</hi> have it after him, if he appoints no VISTOR to a College or his own rounding. Now the Court alone founded Harvard College, and appointed no Viſitor to it. So <hi>None</hi> but the Court could be the Viſitors; and therefore, as Heir, none but the Legiſtature is or <hi>can be</hi> the local VISITORS of this College.</p>
               <p>Here let the Proof of this 4th Article and the general <hi>Aſſertions</hi> under it be made out. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part ſhall be taken from what Dr. <hi>Ayliff</hi> (i. e. L. L. D.) has written in his Account of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of OXFORD," in which this <hi>Doctor of</hi> LAWS has treated at large on the Power of <hi>Viſitors</hi> as warranted by Cuſtom, Law, and common Right. Here then 1. It <hi>muſt</hi> be ſaid that Harvard Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is a LAY <hi>Corporation.</hi> 
                  <q>A College, ſays the Dr. Vol. 2. Pag. 52, is an eccleſiaſtical Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by Cannon Law, if the Number of <hi>Clerks</hi> exceed or equal that of <hi>Laymen:</hi> If not; 'Tis confeſſed to be a LAY Corporation.</q> Now in the Charter of 50, which is the ſole Foundation of Harvard College <hi>as</hi> a Corporation, there is no Proviſion made for any <hi>Clerks</hi> at all! And ſo 'tis <hi>accidental</hi> to that Foundation, whether thoſe who are upon it be <hi>Clerks</hi> or Lawyers or Phyſicians. Yea as to the <hi>Fact,</hi> viz. What Function the firſt SEVEN on that Foundation <hi>happened</hi> to be of, it appears there were ſix <hi>Laymen</hi> to one <hi>Clerk.</hi> Yet further, if the Overſeers were here conſidered (as being <hi>on</hi> the Foundation though not incorporated upon it) it appears that the <hi>Honourable</hi> were twenty, and the <hi>Reverend</hi> not more than ten, when firſt ſet on the Foundation of 50. And thus if the ſaid Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are taken ſingly, or together with the Overſeers, and this in View either to <hi>Fact</hi> or <hi>Right,</hi> it appears that more <hi>Laymen</hi> were on the Foundation than <hi>Clerks.</hi> So that according to Dr. <hi>Ayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> 
                  <q>It muſt be <hi>confeſſed</hi> that Harvard College is a LAY Corporation.</q> 'Tis evident alſo from the expreſs Deſign of the Inſtitution that the ſaid Corporation is <hi>not</hi> accleſiaſtical. All the Paſſages in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This is plainly an Inſtitution <hi>at large.</hi> Again "For the Education of Youth in Knowledge and Godlineſs." Now Godlineſs does not diſtinguiſh a <hi>Clerk</hi> from a <hi>Layman</hi> any more than <hi>Knowledge</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:005041_0034_10168DAF9CDB5FF8"/>does. Laſtly <q>For the Advancement and Education of Youth in <hi>all Manner</hi> of good Literature Arts and Sciences,</q> This Deſign is as unappropriated as <hi>can</hi> be; 'Tis common and <hi>indifferent</hi> to all; and <hi>not</hi> as we are told in ELECTION Sermons that <q>the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> Deſign of our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anceſtours in founding this College was that it might be a NURSERY for the Goſpel-Miniſtry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and to ſupply our Churches with Paſtors and Teachers</q> nothing of this is written by <hi>our pious Anceſtors</hi> in the Charter; and 'tis <hi>directly</hi> againſt the very TEXT of the Charter itſelf; and ſo it muſt paſs for <hi>Oral</hi> Tradition. And thus this College taken in all Views is <hi>not</hi> an eccleſiaſtical Corporation: If it had been ſo, the Right of Viſitation (according to <hi>Ayliff</hi> Pag. 7. And <hi>Holt</hi> on Colleges) would have devolved to the CHURCH as <hi>Heir;</hi> but now we muſt look elſewhere for this Right. And therefore 2. It muſt be determined who were the <hi>Founders</hi> of this College. Now <hi>Ayliff</hi> Page 6. ſays <q>He is the Founder of a College who <hi>Firſt</hi> erects and endowes it and not He who incorporates it.</q> In this Senſe of Founding (as diſtinguiſhed from the incorporating ACT by which <hi>alone</hi> a College is founded as a Body politick) the Dr. goes on and ſays, <q>If the King and a common Perſon at the ſame Time gives Lands &amp;c. to a College <hi>on</hi> its Foundation [viz. o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n by a Parity of Reaſon; In the firſt Caſe, ſuppoſing any common Perſons had been <hi>as early</hi> in erecting and endowing that College as the Court was, yet the Court alone (by Reaſon of its <hi>Eminence</hi>) would have been the Founder; and theſe common Perſons could by no Means be ſtiled <hi>Co-Founders</hi> with the Court! But in the latter Caſe <hi>(a fortiori)</hi> the Court is the ſole Founder: For if a common Perſon, on being the <hi>Firſt</hi> in erecting and endowing that College, would have held the Name of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt the Court itſelf; certainly then the Court, who <hi>really were</hi> the FIRST, will hold the Name of Founder againſt all common Perſons; let theſe afterwards give ever ſo much to it. Now that the Court were <hi>Firſt</hi> in erecting and endowing it, appears from the <hi>Province</hi> and <hi>College Records</hi> compared Page 4. 5, of this Paper. The Court firſt began the FUND for erecting and endowing this College in 1636. But what all private Perſons gave to is was <hi>afterwards;</hi> and in particular what Mr. <hi>Harvard</hi> gave to it was by WILL in 1638. Hence then Mr. <hi>Harvard</hi> and all other private Donours were <hi>Benefactors</hi> to this College: but the COURT alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

'Tis originally in the Founder and <hi>Will</hi> deſcend to his Heirs if he appoint <hi>No</hi> Viſitor himſelf. Herein Dr. <hi>Ayliff</hi> and a greater than the Dr, are expreſs. <q>If there be no particular Viſitor appointed by the <hi>Founder's</hi> Statutes, the Law appoints the <hi>Founder</hi> and his <hi>Heirs</hi> to be Viſitors.

               <p>And now the only remaining Queſtion is, "Whether the Court who founded Harvard College <hi>ever did</hi> appoint a Viſitor to it?

The Name <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor</hi> or the Terms <hi>Viſitation, Viſitatorial</hi> &amp;c. do not once occur in theſe Laws. Now <hi>Ayliff</hi> (Page 74. 5)
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005041_0035_10168DB45A4BAC98"/>makes it ſo neceſſary for "a Viſitor to be <hi>appointed</hi> and <hi>named</hi> ſuch by the Founder in <hi>expreſs</hi> Terms" that he even labours to prove that <q>by the Deſcription of ſuch a Power given to any Perſons they are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Viſitors, whether expreſly <hi>ſtiled</hi> ſuch in the Founder's Statutes or not. Becauſe otherwiſe, ſays he, the giving ſuch a Power would be vain and the Clauſe uſeleſs</q> ſince none therefore are ſtiled or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Viſitors by <hi>Name</hi> in theſe Laws, let the Powers <hi>granted</hi> in them be conſidered and compared with that of Viſitation as deſcribed by <hi>Ayliff</hi> and chief Juſtice <hi>Holt.</hi> To begin then with the Law of 42 which appointed Overſeers to Harvard College <hi>before</hi> it was incorporated. And here 1. Viſitors are <hi>not</hi> the ſtated Legiſlative or executive Power of a College; but are appointed by the Founder to ſee that thoſe, who are ſuch, do their Duty. But by the Law of 42, <hi>before</hi> there was a Corporation, the Overſeers themſelves were the <hi>only</hi> ſtated and ordinary Power to make Laws and Orders for the College. By this then they are not deſcribed as having a Power of Viſitation, nor would the <hi>Power</hi> given them to make Laws and Orders <hi>be vain</hi> and <hi>the Clauſe uſeleſs</hi> though they were not Viſitors—Unleſs that College was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus on Appeals they are the <hi>dernier</hi> Reſort, <q>Who ſhall judge them? —Let their Sentence be <hi>right or wrong,</hi> the Party is <hi>concluded</hi> by it</q> ſays <hi>Holt</hi> on Viſitors. But by the Law of 42 the Overſeers in all Caſes of Appeals whatever, made from a Meeting of their Number that was not General <hi>to</hi> a General Meeting of their whole Number, could conclude <hi>Nothing</hi> againſt an Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant!

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005041_0037_10168DB8ECC31F28"/>(and 'tis fitting they <hi>ſhould</hi> not!) as they <hi>may</hi> do <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>common</hi> Caſes at a Meeting that is <hi>not</hi> General, but are to do it at a full and general Meeting of <hi>All</hi> their Number.</q> This alters not the <hi>Capacity</hi> in which they are to act in full and general Meeting on ſuch Caſes; but leaves them <hi>ſtill,</hi> what they were <hi>before,</hi> the Legiſlative and executive Power only. If it had <hi>altered</hi> their Capacity, ſo as to make them Viſitors—What Abſurdities would follow! For <hi>ever</hi> WHOM would it make them Viſitors? Why over the <hi>whole</hi> ſtated Legiſlative and Executive Power of the College (for ſo are ALL Viſitors of Colleges!) And thus the WHOLE Legiſlative and executive Power of that College would be Viſitors of the WHOLE Legiſlative and Executive Power of that College—<hi>Wholly</hi> Viſitors and <hi>Wholly</hi> to be viſited by <hi>themſelves.</hi> And ſo their WHOLE Number to ſet upon and give Sentence for (or <hi>againſt</hi>) their WHOLE Number. Such Abſurdities are too groſs to need any Refutation. Let <hi>One</hi> Conſequence of ſo abſurd an Interpretation of the Charter be mentioned: The only Ground on which <hi>Ayliff</hi> (and even <hi>Holt!</hi>) argues that a Power of Viſitation will exiſt of Neceſſity by Law, is, that they Charity might not be perverted by the incorporated, who have it in their Hands. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (what the very End of a viſitatorial Power <hi>obliges</hi> us to ſuppoſe <hi>may</hi> happen) that ſo great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a Caſe <hi>Should</hi> happen, as that the Corporation ſhould embezzle the College-Stock or pervert if from its devoted Uſes;—How could this Miſchief be prevented! Or how would it be <hi>poſſible</hi> to call the Corporation to an Account for it! When in this very Caſe and by this very Clauſe of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (if the Corporation with the Overſeers <hi>were</hi> Viſitors) the Concluſion muſt be made by the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>itſelf;</hi> and hereon the <hi>more</hi> they embezzled the College-Stock (and ſo the more they <hi>needed</hi> to be viſited!) the <hi>leſs likely</hi> they would be to make the Concluſion that they <hi>ſhould be</hi> viſited for it—or with the Overſeers to ſit in Judgment <hi>upon themſelves</hi> for ſo doing—unleſs it were for this <hi>fatal</hi> Purpoſs, viz. To vote themſelves <hi>innocent,</hi> and ſo come off Triumphant! For what could be done in ſuch a Caſe? None of <hi>theſe</hi> Viſitors could, BY Charter, make the <hi>Concluſion</hi> (for the Overſeers to <hi>conſent</hi> to) but the Corporation. So that if they ſhould be <hi>hardy</hi> enough to make ſuch a Concluſion (and <hi>ſtand by it!</hi>) They could go on to make Waſte of the College-Stock, and defy the whole Number of the Honourable and Reverend Overſeers to do <hi>their Worſt.</hi> Thus the very <hi>End</hi> for which the Law appoints a Power of Viſitation would be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> if this Clauſe in the Charter was to be <hi>taken</hi> as deſcribing ſuch a Power given to the Corporation and Overſeers. 'Tis Time then to give up this Senſe of the Clauſe and with it ALL Thoughts of finding a Power of Viſitation deſcribed in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: since this, which comes neareſt to the Deſcription of ſuch a Power, is not and <hi>cannot</hi> be a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
               <p>And thus it appears, after a thorough Examination, that there is NO Law in which the Founder of this College conveyed this Right of viſiting the ſame, <hi>away</hi> to others. And then this Right (<hi>which</hi> MUST <hi>exiſt ſomewhere!</hi>) Can exiſt in <hi>None</hi> but the <hi>Founder</hi> and his Heirs; That is, according to chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> the COURT in this Caſe is <hi>Viſitor of</hi> NECESSITY <hi>by Law!</hi> —Thus it is in all Colleges in <hi>England,</hi> when the Founder appoints <hi>no</hi> Viſitor.

Theſe publick Affronts offered them by that Corporation, the Writer of this Paper has ſeen with his own Eyes and has bluſhed to ſee what he <hi>could not</hi> help; at the ſame Time that he has trembled at what might follow on their thus treating the LEGISLATURE! — A Legiſlature who gave them their BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING at <hi>firſt;</hi> and by whoſe Bounty <hi>annually</hi> continued to them, they have <hi>Subſiſted</hi> ever Since!</p>
               <p>And now "who are the VISITORS of Harvard College" may appear to all Perſons who may have juſt and important Occaſion to apply to them.

As to the peculiar Office of a Viſitor, it primarily reſpects "the Revenues, the Poſſeſſions, the WHOLE Eſtate of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege! The inſpecting whereof is ſo eſſential a Part of this Office, that <hi>Ayliff</hi> and even chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> often repeats it as the grand Reaſon why the Law appoints a Viſitor <hi>at all,</hi> "It is not FITTING fays <hi>Ayliff,</hi> that Members endowed and who have Charity beſtowed upon them ſhould be <hi>Left</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves." To apply this to the Corporation of Harvard College; the State of whoſe <hi>Treaſury</hi> has-been kept in ſuch myſterious Secrecy as if they had <hi>No</hi> Maſters! As if <hi>None</hi> but themſelves had any Buſineſs with their Treaſury, or a <hi>Right</hi> even ſo much as to <hi>know</hi> what it conſiſted of—The Writer of this Paper has been for 10 or 12 Years a Member of that Corporation, and he cannot find by their Records that there has been a formal Viſitation of their Treaſury ever ſince the Times of the <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi> By what he has heard, the <hi>Viſitors</hi> of Colleges in <hi>England</hi> have a <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the whole Eſtate of their reſpective Colleges; and all the <hi>Additions</hi> thereto from Time to Time, are entered into <hi>ſuch</hi> Regiſters accordingly. And indeed how would it be <hi>poſſible</hi> for a Viſitor to know whether the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was perverted or not (which is the primary <hi>End</hi> for which the Law appoints a Viſitor) if the him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf knew not what the Charity <hi>was,</hi> nor the particular <hi>Uſes</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> for which it was beſtowed
