            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LET us conſider that we are in the Preſence of an Holy GOD, who made us, and gives us every good thing we enjoy; who will bring every Work into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with every ſecret Thing.—It becomes us therefore with the utmoſt awe and reverence, to behave ourſelves ſo as not to Break his holy Law, or merit his Divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: You may remember, that within theſe few years paſt there has been ſeveral Judgments threatened againſt this Land and Nation. The firſt that I ſhall mention, was in what is commonly called the <hi>Chebucto</hi> fleet, a large fleet ſent from <hi>France</hi> againſt the <hi>Colonies</hi>; big enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humane underſtanding, to have Deſtroyed our ſhiping, and at leaſt to have laid our Sea-Ports in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Ruin and Deſolation. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> fleet at that time by contrary winds, a meer act of providence, hindered from coming to our Relief. But mark, the French fleet taken with a Dreadful Diſtemper on their paſſage; they put into <hi>Chebucto,</hi> where they Died by Thouſands, and were not ſuffered to do the <hi>Colonies</hi> the leaſt Damage.</p>
            <p>A caſe ſomething ſimilar to what we have told us, Judg. 7.2. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Gideon, the People that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their Hands; leſt Iſrael vaunt themſelves againſt me, ſaying, mine own Hand hath ſaved me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another inſtance of Judgment threatened againſt us, was in the begining of the laſt War; Gen. Braddick was defeated by the French and Indians, who came in like a Flood on ſome of the Southern Colonies, burning Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, killing and taking Captive many of our People; it
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:043211_0003_101CD697A87479D0"/>
ſeemed as though they would devour the whole land: But mark—in the concluſion of the war, the French, quite from St. Lawrence river to the Miſſiſippi, were brought into ſubjection. Which brings to my mind the prophecy of Amos, who, after he had reproved Iſrael for divers ſins, ſays, chap. 7.1. <hi>Thus hath the Lord ſhewed unto me, and behold he formed graſshoppers in the beginning of the ſhooting up of the latter growth, and lo, it was the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter growth, after the king's mowings. And it came to paſs, that when they had made an end of eating the graſs of the land, then I ſaid, O Lord God, forgive, I beſeech thee; by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe? for he is ſmall. The Lord repented for this: It ſhall not be, ſaith the Lord. Thus hath the Lord God ſhewed unto me, and behold, the Lord God called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part. Then ſaid I, O Lord God, ceaſe, I beſeech thee; by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe? for he is ſmall. The Lord repented for this: This alſo ſhall not be, ſaith the Lord God.—Then ſaid the Lord, Behold, I will ſet a plum-line in the midſt of my people Iſrael.</hi>—Have we not reaſon to believe, from theſe ſigns, that there is ſomething among us that is very offenſive in the eyes of an holy God, that muſt be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ere we can expect to proſper. O that there were now a number of praying Amoſes, who would ſay, O that the Lord would ſpare his people! it may be that they will repent.—Are we now engaged in a more dreadful war, blood a running, killing one another? as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.4.</p>
            <p>I do not determine wherefore it is that the hand of the Lord is gone out againſt us: I ſhall here only obſerve, that God ſometimes brings his judgments by inſtruments, to whom his people have done no wrong; ſee <hi>Judges</hi> 10.6, and onward, <hi>And the children of Iſrael did evil again in the ſight of the Lord, and ſerved Baalim and Aſhtaroth.— And the anger of the Lord was hot againſt Iſrael, and he ſold them into the hands of the Philiſtines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.</hi> And what harm had the children
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043211_0004_101CD69A0722C458"/>
of Judah done to the Babylonians? yet how they deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and captivated them!—But what was the matter? ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.5,—7. <hi>If ye thoroughly amend your ways, and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; if ye oppreſs not the ſtranger, the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the widow, and ſhed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods, to your hurt: then will I cauſe you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is poſſible ſome of you may ſay, at leaſt in your hearts, 'We are wiſe men, and underſtand our intereſt exceeding well; who can teach us?'—But I deſire you to remember, that even the wiſeſt of men have ſometimes need of being put in mind of things they well knew. I will therefore conſider the words in the following order,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Endeavour to ſhow from the ſcripture, what is true wiſdom for men in a fallen condition:</p>
            <p>And in the next place, endeavour to ſhow what is true wiſdom for a people in a civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That whoſoever ſhall ſcorn the word of God, that they alone ſhall bear it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Shew, in ſome meaſure, what it is they ſhall bear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is wiſdom for men in a fallen ſtate? But let us firſt obſerve, that there is what hath been called wiſdom, ſee <hi>Daniel,</hi> 5.15. <hi>And now the wiſe men, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers</hi>; who were probably ſuch men, as by the help of the devil, pretended to foretel future events<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this is ſo far from the true wiſdom intended in the text, that it is the moſt dreadful folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Another ſort of wiſdom is mentioned in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghoſt teacheth</hi>: There is ſuch a thing then as what is called man's wiſdom; of this ſort of wiſdom, I ſuppoſe the apoſtle Paul had a large ſhare before his converſion, being brought up to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:043211_0005_101CD69E1E0610D0"/>
learning, who had the witneſs of miracles, and zealous in what he called religion; yet perſecuted the chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he received a light from heaven.</p>
            <p>We have an account, <hi>John</hi> 3. of <hi>Nichodemus</hi> likewiſe a ruler of the Jews, who probably had a great ſhare of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtanding or man's wiſdom, although he was ſo far convinced by the miracles, that he ſaid to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doſt, except God be with him</hi>: Yet when our Saviour told him, <hi>Except a man be born again, he connot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands nothing of this by his human wiſdom, but ſays, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old?</hi> And further ſaith, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi>—How ignorant was he of the new-birth, or the new heart which delighteth in hallelujahs and adoration to God! And we are told in plain words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And our Saviour himſelf ſays, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God—Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My anſwer then to the firſt queſtion (which is, What is wiſdom for men in a fallen eſtate) ſhall be, That it is their wiſdom to go to God by ſolemn prayer, for his mercy in teaching them, and to bring them into true religion by his mighty power, and that with an honeſt intention to be conformed to the will of God; for God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. For if the heart doth not believe that God is righteous to reject its requeſt, the prayer is like a demand: and it is therefore the wiſdom of ſinners to beg of God to ſhow them how vile they are, and know that God is ſovereign of his gifts, or they would ceaſe to be free grace. And I hope there are none
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043211_0006_101CD69FDE520620"/>
of you ſo wiſe in your own eyes, as to think you have no need that God ſhould teach you. Have you more wit than Nichodemus, or St. Paul, who were both taught of God?—And indeed, could men go to heaven by their own wit and invention, to whom would they ſing praiſe? Would it be to themſelves, while they neglect or deſpiſe to glorify God? What, ſelf-ſaved, and ſelf-glorified! No; if any are ſaved, it muſt be by the gift of God.</p>
            <p>Which brings me in the ſecond place, to ſay, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall ſcorn to beg of God, to renew his heart, and to be taught, he alone ſhall bear it; for it is written, 'As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God: So then every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf to God,' <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11, 12. 'Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap; for he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting,' <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8. And the text is a full confirmation of this. 'If thou ſcorneſt, thou alone ſhalt bear it.' But what ſhalt he bear; the anſwer is, 'The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,' 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. 'Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand, depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,' <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. The ſon of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall geather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth,' <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41, 42. 'And I ſay unto you my friends, be not affraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043211_0007_101CD6A1E09B9090"/>
can do. But I will fore-warn you, whom you ſhall fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fear him which after he hath killed the body, hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to caſt into hell: Yea, I ſay unto you, fear him,' <hi>Luke,</hi> 12.4. Can any perſon get any thing by ſcorning or ſlighting the counſels of their maker; to be caſt into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his engels, where the ſoul dies not, and the fire is not quenched. I conclude this point, with this word, fly from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>In the next place, or <hi>ſecondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhow what is wiſdom for men in a civil ſtate:—To this I anſwer, It is wiſdom for a people to do righteouſly, or what is the ſame, to keep the ten commands, for we have the words of the moſt high and holy God, the former of all things, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.20. 'That which is altogether juſt ſhalt thou follow, that thou mayeſt live and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.' <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.5. 'Ye ſhall therefore keep my ſtatutes, and my judgments, which if a man do, he ſhall live in them: I am the LORD.'</p>
            <p>For inſtance; Suppoſe a people ſhould have no law to puniſh the breaking any one of the firſt four of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and of conſequence have no regard to God; how dreadful muſt be their doom: ſee what was ſaid to the children of Iſrael; Go and cry unto the gods which ye have choſen, let them deliver you in the time of your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, <hi>Judges,</hi> 10.14.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider the fifth command, which is, Honor thy father and mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Now if there were no obedience or reſpect paid to parents, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, how would every villain invade the property of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpending their time in it ſo that there could be no ſuſtenance for the people; and if there were no law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt murder, how would people be in danger of loſing their lives, it would doubtleſs take ſo much time in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043211_0008_101CD6A3DC80E3E8"/>
them, as that they would not be able to raiſe any ſupport for life.</p>
            <p>And ſee what is ſaid againſt breaking the ſeventh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>Job,</hi> 31.11. 'For this is an heinous crime, yea, it is an iniquity to be puniſhed by the judges, for it is a fire that conſumeth to deſtruction, and would root out all mine increaſe. And with reſpect to the eighth command, were there no law to puniſh ſtealing, how would many think it eaſier to ſteal for a living, than to labor, which of natural conſequence, will ruin any people, and witneſs is the eyes of the law; how could the breaking of any one of theſe commands be puniſhed, if there were nothing but falſe witneſs; and the tenth command, which includes the whole, or all honeſty to our neighbour, to be neglected will be equally ruinous.</p>
            <p>But you will doubtleſs aſk in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when a nation, or a people, may be truly ſaid to break any one of theſe commands? To this I anſwer, That a people, or nation, may be guilty of one villain's ſtealing a horſe, for when the judges willingly and knowingly, clear the thief, when they know he is guilty, they are partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the thief; and indeed, for want of a proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into truth, they may become guilty: So when a people ſhall ſee that their judges do unrighteouſneſs, and willingly clear the thief; if they do not endeavor to know and diſplace ſuch judges, they all become guilty; for the people are commanded to ſee that righteouſneſs takes place: ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Judges and officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes; and they ſhall judge the people with juſt judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This command was given to the people, they ought therefore to have put in officers by election, and to be ſure to be left out when they did not do righteouſly. What greater encouragement to wickedneſs, than to have no judges; and what greater encouragement to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043211_0009_101CD6A607C88208"/>
than hinder their being found out and puniſhed; how ſeverely were the children of Iſrael puniſhed when they made no judges, but left every man to do as he pleaſed, or that which was right in his own eyes; ſee the end of judges: ſhould they not have made righteous judges a terror to evil doers, how guilty then of the blood of the Levites wife, and how dangerous was it to put in officers for life, if the people were juſtly charged for what they knew, and ſuffered their repreſentavives to do.</p>
            <p>Again, kings or rulers may be greatly to blame ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. For inſtance, ſuppoſe a king, or rulers, ſhould take from the people ninety-nine parts of an hundren of the produce from the people, or the value, and lay it up for themſelves, or give it to pentioners, or charity men, and enable them to carry on rioting, and drunkenneſs, while the people are greatly diſtreſſed to maintain it; it may be as great a burden, as to be ſlaves: and how wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is it to rate the people to maintain rioting, and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, right in the face of Gods commands, for even kings are not to make themſelves rich beyond bounds with the peoples money, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Neither ſhall he greatly multiply to himſelf ſilver and gold.</hi> Nevertheleſs, there is no doubt but that kings and rulers ought to have a reaſonable and honorable recompence for their labor, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6. <hi>For this cauſe pay you tribute alſo for they are God's miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould think it proper, under this enquiry, for us to conſider the conduct of the children of Iſrael, and ſee wherein they were blamed, and when they were not: For God is the ſame, yeſterday, to day, and forever? Therefore thoſe things that were diſpleaſing to him then, are diſpleaſing to him now if they are acted. And I do not remember any threatening againſt the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael for injuſtice, untill after Solomon's time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will then be, How did they conduct in that time? ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.10. <hi>When thou doſt lend thy brother any thing,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043211_0010_101CD6AD18141FA0"/>
thou ſhalt not go unto his houſe to fetch his pledge.</hi> Did they indeed when they ſold, or lent one another any thing, take a pledge as a witneſs to the debt? I anſwer, Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did; or what is the meaning of a pledge. Wherefore it is evident they took care beforehand to know how to do juſtice. But ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.12, 13. <hi>And if the man be poor, thou ſhalt not ſleep with his pledge: In any caſe thou ſhalt deliver him the pledge again when the ſun goeth down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why truly did they not truſt one another longer than from morning to night; for what profit could a pledge be that muſt be given up before the debt was paid. I anſwer, That the creditor could ſhow the pledge to a number of the neighbours, and thereby git witneſſes that the debtor owes for goods delivered? In that caſe a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor might recover his cauſe, or elſe it was loſt, for what advantage was it to have a pledge or witneſſes; if a perſon could recover upon his own ſay ſo, or by making a falſe book, and ſware it was truly and juſtly charg'd, nor could they make a book againſt any perſon for four times ſo much as the debtor would have given a pledge for; nor for things for which ſatisfaction had been made. Should they not have been as realy puniſhed had they had no law to prevent making falſe accompts, as they were for not having law, or judges, to prevent the wickedneſs done to the Levites wife; werefore they did well to take care beforehand, that one ſhould not defraud or wrong another. If we can find in their practice, what was the mind and will of God, let us hear it. But to return; It is probable, when perſons thought themſelves wronged, and could git no pledge; they went immediately to trial. I ſhall here produce the account of an action that was brought and tried in one of their courts, preſent, king Solomon judge, 1. <hi>Kings,</hi> 3.16, <hi>to the end. Then came there two women that were harlots, unto the king, and ſtood before him: and the one woman ſaid, O my lord, I, and this womam dwell in one
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:043211_0011_101CD6AEA7F533C8"/>
houſe; and I was delivered of a child with her in the houſe: and it came to paſs, the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered alſo, and we were together: there was no ſtranger with us in the houſe; ſave we two in the houſe. And this woman's child died in the night, becauſe ſhe overlaid it. And ſhe aroſe at mid-night and took my ſon from beſide me, while thine hand-maid ſlept, and laid it in her boſom, and laid her dead child in my boſom; and when I roſe in the morning to give my child ſuck, behold it was dead; but when I had conſidered it in the morning, behold it was not my ſon which I did bear: and the other woman ſaid nay; but the living is my ſon, and the dead is thy ſon: and this ſaid no, but the dead is thy ſon, and the living is my ſon. Thus they ſpoke before the king. Then ſaid the king, the one ſaith this is my ſon that liveth, and thy ſon is the dead: and the other ſaith nay; but thy ſon is the dead, and my ſon is the living. And the king ſaid bring me a ſword, and they brought a ſword before the king; and the king ſaid divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. Then ſpake the woman whoſe the living child was, unto the king (for her bowels yearned upon her ſon) and ſhe ſaid, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wiſe ſlay it: But the other ſaid, let it be neither mine, nor thine, but divide it. Then the king anſwered and ſaid, give her the living child, and in no wiſe ſlay it; ſhe is the mother thereof. And all Iſrael heard of the judgment which the ksng had judged, and they feared the king; for they ſaw that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was in him to do judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve, we have no account of any writ, or any officer to bring the defendant before the king, for it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was looked upon as a token of guilt, to be unwilling to attend the court: we have no account of any attorney to abate the writ, or plead demuror, or ſpecial plea; nor even to ſay, that the plantiff had produced no witneſs to prove her cauſe; neither could they go from court, to court, untill they had ſpent in the trial, three times ſo
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:043211_0012_101CD6B0AE28A680"/>
much as the cauſe was worth: But the judge hears the ſtory from the parties, and by policy finds out from them which was the true mother, and orders, that ſhe ſhould have her own child.</p>
            <p>But where lay the great wiſdom think you; was it in judging that a woman ſhould have her own child, or in ſerching the matter.</p>
            <p>See what is ſpoken by Job, who ſeems to have been a judge: <hi>chap.</hi> 29.16. <hi>I was a father to the poor, and the cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out. I break the jaws of the wicked, and pluck the ſpoile out of his teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from Solomons time, to their going into captivity, there are repeated threatenings for injuſtice, and violence, ſee <hi>Micah.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Woe to them that deviſe iniquity, and work evil upon their beds: when the morning is light, they practice it becauſe it is in the power of their hands—And they covet fields, and take them by violence, and houſes, and take them away: ſo they oppreſs a man and his houſe, even a man and his heritage:—Therefore, thus ſaith the Lord; Behold againſt this family do I deviſe an evil, from which ye ſhall not remove your necks:</hi> ſee alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord; Execute ye judgmdnt, and righteouſneſs; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the ſpoiled out of the hands of the oppreſſor; and do no wrong; do no violence to the ſtranger, the fatherleſs, nor the widow; neither ſhed innocent blood in this place; for if you do this thing, indeed then ſhall there enter in by the gates of this houſe, kings ſetting upon the throne of David rideing in chariots, and on horſes, he, and his ſervants, and his people. But if ye will not hear theſe words, I ſware by my ſelf, ſaith the Lord; That this houſe ſhall become a deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But did they do all this injuſtice, and violence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pretence of law? No, they did not; for we read, <hi>Micah,</hi> 6.16. <hi>For the ſtatutes of Omry are kept, and all the works of the houſe of Ahab</hi>; and <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Therefore the law is ſlacked, and judgment doth never go forth, for the wicked doth compaſs about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:043211_0013_101CD6B40235C3F0"/>But what was their law do you think; was it like a fiſh-net, that would catch all the little fiſh, and let all the great fiſh go through? I anſwer yes; it probibly was: but you will aſk, how can that be? I anſwer, That under a plauſable pretence of doing juſtice; that when either partiy thought themſelves wronged, they might revew or appeal, from court, to court; untill they had ſpent three times ſo much in the trial, as the cauſe was worth. The great men, by having very large fees for manageing the cauſes, probably run off with the moſt of the money, while they left the poor to ſuffer for want. Who having recovered hardly enough to pay the coſt, they loſt all that was taken from them by injuſtice, or violence: How did this deliver the <hi>ſpoiled.</hi> And when any one perſon did injuſtice, or violence to another, he was obliged to go to law, or looſe his right; and who knows but what that was next to his life; was not the nation guilty of this. And what were they better to to have a law which coſt more than could be recovered by it; could it relieve a diſtreſſed perſon who had been wronged by injuſtice or violence. But if the righteous loſt all, what become of the miſtaken party, who likely loſt more than three times all: Was not ſuch a law, like an iron brier, that tore the fleſh off every one that came near it: wherefore every mite of coſt that was made in trials more than was abſolutely neceſſary, was unjuſt; no better than other injuſtice. Let us conclude this point, with theſe words, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.6. <hi>To the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment.</hi> And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall break any one of the laws of God, they alone ſhall bear it: for if a people ſhall have no law to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the breaking any of theſe commandments, this is the natural tendency to bring them to ruin, as has been obſerved before; if a people ſhall carefully puniſh the breakers of theſe commands, it is ſtrange if any one
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:043211_0014_101CD6B865E124C0"/>
eſcapes without puniſhment, ſhame, and diſgrace; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they will certainly be under the curſe, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Curſed be he that confermeth not all the words of this law, to do them; and all the people ſhall ſay amen.</hi> Obſerve the word conferm; for all are required to confirm this law. Therefore, here is a curſe pronounced againſt every one who has a right to chuſe rulers who doth not endeavour to chuſe ſuch as will be moſt likely to keep this law.</p>
            <p>Here is a curſe pronounced againſt every one who doth not endeavor to know what rulers do not do well in keeping this law; who ſhall throw away his power, or doth not endeavor to diſplace, or leave out ſuch rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as do not do well in keeping this law. Here is a curſe pronounced againſt every one who although he has not a right to chuſe rulers eye or ear who ſhall do any thing which he knows is likely to hinder the keeping this law. Here is a curſe pronounced againſt every judge or other who ſhall not endeavor the keeping this law. In fine, here is a curſe pronounced againſt all the breakers of this law: and who hath ever hardened himſelf againſt his creator, and hath proſpered; therefore, every one that ſcorneth he alone ſhall bear it. But what ſhall he bear? I anſwer, That whoſoever ſhall ſcorn to obey the law of God, ſhall bear his wrath and diſpleaſure. See what (if it be practiced) will be an inſtance of this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.22. <hi>Ye ſhall not afflict any widow, or fatherleſs child; if thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry at all unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry; and my wrath ſhall wax hot, and I will kill you with the ſword; and your wives ſhall be widows, and your children fatherleſs.</hi> And I have have heard there is a diſtemper among the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is the moſt dreadfull and mortal to the well people, for when a number of men ſhall make unjuſt rules, they will not only enjoy the diſpleaſure of God, but they, and their's muſt be tried by the ſame law, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.10. <hi>Whoſo cauſeth the righteous to go aſtray in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:043211_0015_101CD6BBF6F86728"/>
evil way, he ſhall fall himſelf into his own pit; but the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſhall hvae good things in poſſeſſion: and Job,</hi> 18.8. <hi>For he is caſt into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a ſnare.</hi> I remember an old obſervation that has been maid; That when the children of Iſrael had good rulers, to whom they heard ſo much as that they could execute the laws, they always proſpered; on the other hand, when they had bad rulers, to whom they heared, then they ſuffered greatly: and thoſe rulers fared the worſt, witneſs Jereboam, Jehoiachim Baaſha, and Ahab. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point with that in <hi>Job,</hi> 27.8. <hi>For what is the hope of a hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let us conclude this part, with a word of exhortation to the hearers. As we are probationers here, for eternity: Let us ſet apart ſome time in every day, wherein to conſider ſolemnly what will become of us in another world; and if we are in any diſtreſs, and ſee that the rod of God is upon us; let us miſtruſt whether there be not ſomething in our practice that we have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look't, that is offenſive to an holy God. Let us ſeek to God by faſting and prayer, to teach us what is amiſs: ſee the example of David, when there was three years famine year after year; and David enquired of the Lord, 2. <hi>Samuel,</hi> 21.1. Let us examine carefully how our actions agree with the rules of the word of God, ſee <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Should ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the former prophets</hi>: and whatever is amiſs let us reform, and reſtore righteouſneſs; then by faſting and prayer ſeek to God for forgiveneſs, and mercy; who can tell if God will direct, and proſper our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, or find a way of redemption, that we periſh not. I conclude the whole, with that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you that feareth the Lord; that walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light: Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi>
