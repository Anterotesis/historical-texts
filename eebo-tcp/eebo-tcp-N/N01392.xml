            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMongſt all the Ornaments wherewith the Chaſte Mother is enriched, there is none more conſtantly worn, or more adorning than that of the Peremptory deſire of her Husband's Preſence. This cauſes her to record the time of his departure, keep an exact reckoning of his abſence; and with frequent Calculations and Enquiries, to long and look out for the appointed Seaſon of his Expected Return. And to every Meſſage, Letter, Bill of Exchange or Lading, the cloſe of her dutyful Anſwer is,</p>
            <p>—Attamen IPSE veni.</p>
            <p>This Conjugal Love is Honourable in it ſelf; and CHRIST has ennobled it, by ſpeaking to his Church, in Phraſes taken from it; <hi>My Siſter! My Spouſe!</hi> And we ſee the Churche's diſpoſition after the Receipt of her laſt Letter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17, 20. And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come! — <hi>Amen. Even ſo,</hi> Come LORD JESUS!</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Anno,</hi> One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Eleven, more than Sixteen Hundred Years are rolld away ſince CHRIST ſaid and Writ, <hi>Surely I come Quickly.</hi> Therefore an earneſt Looking out for the Time, and Place of His Appearance, muſt needs be very ſeaſonable, very beautifull. And might we take it for granted that the Antichriſtian Plantation ſpoken of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 45. intended their <hi>American</hi> Plantation; it would caſt a great Light upon the Apocalyptical Scenes: becauſe the Time of this Plantation is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001647_0003_0FB3EC5069670790"/>known. The Fables that have been Written of former Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, will give little diſturbance; ſeeing the Godly and Learned <hi>Witſius</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>Neque</hi> Hornij <hi>Conjecturam caſſa nuce emerim.</hi> Exercit. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </hi> had given better Words of Command for the Reduction of his <hi>Phoniden</hi> Colonies; none will be forward to chuſe him for their Leader. Lib. 2. p. 129. Suppoſe that hidden Age afforded Unparalleld Inſtances of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; Yet how came the Net-Cattel, the Horſes, the Swine by their Annihilation? To remove them from off <hi>America</hi> is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely impoſſible. Of theſe and many other Animals there was neither Name, nor Thing when the Spaniards arrived; Neither was there the uſe of Iron.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet be ſhall come to his end</hi> ] Notwithſtanding the great benefit accruing to Antichriſt by theſe Plantations; yet he ſhall come to his end. Or, <hi>and</hi> he ſhall come to his end. His planting of theſe Tabernacles was to be a Signal, whereby the Lovers of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might certainly know that <hi>Babylon</hi>'s downfall was near. <hi>In Media bac Plantatione aliquid ſiniſtri accidet huic hertulane. — Subito exorietur tempeſtas, quae naufragium adferet huic nauclere,</hi> Alſted. de Mille annis. p. 203.</p>
            <p>The Vulgar reads, <hi>Et veniet uſque ad Summitatem ejus</hi>] When Antichriſt ſhould clamber up to the top of his imperial Tyranny, by extending it over the New World alſo; then he was to come to his End.</p>
            <p>To make ſure work with Antichriſt, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1540. expreſſes this End, by <hi>Death.</hi> "for he ſhall come to his <hi>Death.</hi> And pertinent Places of the <hi>Revelation</hi> are noted in the Margin. Antichriſt is ſo to end, as never to begin again: No remnant of Life, no Reſurrection belongs to his Death.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the <hi>Time</hi> of this Plantation in the New World, and the <hi>Decay</hi> of Antichriſt; the Accommodation may ſeem fair. GOD appeared remarkably, when He raiſed up <hi>Nicolaum de Lyra.</hi> This Chriſtian <hi>Jew</hi> by his learned Commentaries on the whole Bible, did very much in clearing away the Rubbiſh, and beginning to lay the Foundations of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> This noble Work began more generally to be communicated in the year 1485. when it was Printed in a fair Character at <hi>Nuremberg.</hi> About the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001647_0004_0FB3EC51E9513D70"/>ſame time <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> was wholly taken up in Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Princes to afford him their Aſſiſtance in his Attempt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a New World. This was at laſt effected by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> October the Eleventh, One Thouſand four Hundred Ninety and Two: and the Plantation vigorouſly carried on in the Years following. In the beginning of the next Century, <hi>Anno</hi> 1517. the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Reformation ſprung up like the <hi>Palm</hi> Tree. The great Value <hi>Luther</hi> had for <hi>Lyra</hi> may be ſeen in his own Words; <hi>Ego</hi> Lyram <hi>ideo amo, et inter optimos pono, quod ubique diligenter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet, et perſequitur hiſtoriam: Quanquam authoritate patrum ſe vinci paticur, et non nunquam eorum exemplo deflectit a proprietate ſententiae, ad ineptas allegorias,</hi> Gen. 2. fol. 21. — <hi>Saepe dixi qualis Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia eſſet, cum ego primum hoc genus ſtudij ingrederer. Literam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebant occidere: igitur oderam ego, prae omnibus interpretibus,</hi> Lyram, <hi>quod tam diligenter literalem ſententiam perſequeretur. Sed nunc, hanc ipſam ob Commendationem, Omnibus fere Scripturae interpretibus eum antepono.</hi> Gen. 9. fol. 118. And <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> and Dr. <hi>John Raynolds,</hi> give <hi>Lyra</hi> a very good Character.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And none ſhall be able to help him.</hi>] When the Sixth Vial comes to be poured out, the Word at <hi>Rome</hi> will be,</p>
            <p>— Acheronta movebo.</p>
            <p>But as Heaven <hi>will</hi> not; ſo Hell <hi>cannot</hi> help her. When <hi>Henry</hi> the Eigth Writ a Book againſt <hi>Luther;</hi> Antichriſt expected ſome conſiderable Help from that Quarter, and for joy thereof, gave him the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> In this, like <hi>Balaam,</hi> or <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> the Pontiff unawares Propheſied of the great Things that Prince and his Succeſſors were to accompliſh in abrogating the Papal Power, and Supporting the Reformation.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Daniel,</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The Scattering the Power of the holy People</hi> there mentioned, may deſign the ſame Thing that is termed <hi>Slaying the Witneſſes,</hi> in the Eleventh of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> In Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s account, The <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> is <hi>Apocalypſis Contracta:</hi> 'Tis probable the Slain Witneſſes are to be found in this part of it; I know not of a more convenient Situtation. The Witneſſes are clothed with Civil, and Eccleſiaſtical Authority: When this is taken away from them, they are ſlain. The <hi>Jews</hi> have no Authority: <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ammi</hi> is their proper Name. That which is not, can't be taken

When the Witneſſes are ſlain, then <hi>Dimiel</hi>'s People ſhall be delivered; <hi>All Iſrael ſhall be Saved.</hi> And this Receiving the <hi>Jews</hi> into Favour again, ſhall be Life from the dead to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians. <hi>Oecolam<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>To paſs to the New Teſtament, I have for ſeveral years ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that ſomething of a Local conſideration is couched in the Parable of the Sower recorded <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>Mark,</hi> 4. and <hi>Luke,</hi> 8. The Parable comprehends the whole Series of Goſpel Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continued to the end of the World: and that not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a general Notion, as there are all theſe ſorts of Ground every where, and at all times: but alſo with notable diſtinguiſhing Chronological, and Chorographical Characters, reſpecting the Four Fields into which the World is parted.</p>
            <p>At firſt the Goſpel was Preached in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where this precious. Seed was quickly troden down and devoured; the Government ſetting themſelves with all Earneſtneſs againſt it; and the body of the People, by a fatal Miſtake, willfully chaſing away the Seeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Men from them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Africa,</hi> the numerous flouriſhing Churches were quickly ſcorch'd and dryed up by the Vehement Heat of Perſecution; not unlike the Graſs in Summer, in that burning Clime. For then the Trees only dare ſhew their heads; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Europe,</hi> 'tis too well known how it was choaked with Worldly Hypocritical Intereſts. Tho' it continued growing there; yet theſe Thorns rendred it, comparatively, Unfruitfull.</p>
            <p>Why may we not, without being Envied, or derided, hope that the <hi>Americans</hi> ſhall be made the good Ground that ſhall once at laſt prove Eſpecially, and Wonderfully fruitfull? 'Tis to be noted that the ſame order of the ſeveral ſorts of Ground is obſerved by all the Three Evangeliſts. This Parable marches in the Front of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001647_0006_0FB3EC54E9C603F8"/>all the Parables; and a mention of the Myſteries of the Kingdom, is annex'd to it in every Place of its Recital. I think [Myſteries] appears not elſe-where in the Goſpels. In <hi>Mark,</hi> it is uſhered in with a note of Attention, <hi>Hearken!</hi> And in <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> it hath for a Concluſion that Solemn Epiphonema, <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him bear.</hi> Our Saviour's going into a Ship to Preach, might intimate to his Country-men, that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to entertain his Doctrine; He would embark, and carry his deſpiſed Goſpel to far-diſtant Regions. Indeed He has made great uſe of Ships in Propagating the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Paul</hi> was carried in a Ship to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had the advantage of Sowing the Truth all over the Empire. This is the only way whereby <hi>Iſlands</hi> are Goſpelliſed; and whereby, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Kingdoms of the New World become the Kingdoms of our LORD, and of His CHRIST. 'Tis a great Encouragement to Miniſters in theſe later Ages, to be diligent in Sowing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have reaſon to believe that the Evening Seed will more abundantly proſper, in <hi>Aſis, Africa, Europe,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this be granted, or no; I am ſure it is well for the Aboriginal Natives of <hi>America,</hi> that the Apoſtle, whoſe Emblem is the <hi>Eagle,</hi> whoſe Character is <hi>Love;</hi> was inſtructed to begin his Goſpel with the Recognition of his Maſter's Title to the New World. For, if <hi>all</hi> Things were made by Him; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Him was not <hi>any thing</hi> made that was made: Then <hi>America</hi> was made by Him, with all its Inhabitants in all their Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Circumſtances. This that we call the New World, was made by Him, tho' it knew Him not. And when he Viſits thoſe that dwell in it. He comes to his Own. Oh that they would at laſt Receive Him! and that they might have Power given them to become the Sons of GOD, to believe in His Name! There is a fair Poſſibility of their being made the happy Subjects of this Royal Privilege and Authority: for all Saints are <hi>born not of blood, nor of the Will of the fleſh, nor of the Will of Min; but of GOD.</hi>

            <p>There is another portion of Scripture written by the ſame Apoſtle; the Tenth Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which I now paſs unto.</p>
            <p>Altho' moſt Expoſitors take the Angel therein mentioned, to be CHRIST, the great Angel of the Covenant; yet, amongſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001647_0007_0FB3EC5668F978B0"/>them that I have before me, <hi>Lyranus, John Bale, John Fox, Ribera, John Mayer, Cluverus,</hi> are otherwiſe minded. I ſhall content my ſelf with mentioning a few words of <hi>Bale,</hi> his Paraphraſe on this Chapter, fol. 139, 140. <hi>In the midſt of this moſt Vengeable time, wherein the Antichriſts and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites moſt fiercly ſtirreth about them to vex all the World with their fiery blaſts, their filthy ſmoke and their ſtinking Brimſtone, to reſtore again their pleaſant Euphrates: The Lord hath ſent to the comfort of his, certain peculiar and choſen learned Men, moſt conſtantly to defend his Verity: and them this preſent Revelation compareth to a ſtrong Angel. This Angel was cloathed with a Cloud, betokening theſe godly Supporters of the Lord's Truth to be compaſſed with many hard Showers, and troublous Croſſes of opprobrious Rebukes, Scorns, Slanders, Lies, and open Blaſphemies. And this Cloud hideth from the World all that is in them ſpiritual and godly, like as it did in Chriſt; that to many they ſeem not that they are indeed.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Petto</hi> in his <hi>Revelation Unvaild,</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>I am perſwaded that moſt of the Vials are poured out before the Witneſſes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> p. 93. <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Peter had their falls, their blemiſhes: ſo many pourers out of Vials, for the hardening of their Enemies, and humbling of themſelves; which here I intimate once for all.</hi> p. 102.</p>
            <p>To this may be added all other Evils of Affliction where-with they are made black, and as our Proverb is, are under a Cloud. Yet this Darkneſs is irradiated with the brightneſs and ſolace of the concomitant Rain-bow. And tho' the Storm increaſe and grow never ſo Violent; yet this Angel perſiſts with Courage and Conſtancy to Proclaim the certain approach of a Fair Day.</p>

               <hi>N.</hi> 2. <hi>And he ſet his Right foot upon the Sea; and his Left foot on the Earth.</hi> I humbly conceive that in the Words there is a Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the whole habitable Earth into the New and Old World; as if it had been ſaid, He ſet his Right foot upon <hi>America;</hi> and his Left foot, on <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> If we reſpect the quantity, the Diſtribution is not very unequal: for <hi>Brerewood</hi> makes the Proportion between the New and Old World, to be as Seven
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001647_0008_0FB3EC57EA5D0FF0"/>is to Fifteen. And <hi>America</hi> is more diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated by the Sea, from <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> than they are from each other. And in the Maps, <hi>America</hi> only and the adjacent Oceans are placed in the Right Hemiſphere. In the Opinion of the Ancients, the Sea it ſelf occupied all that ſpace.</p>
            <p>And he ſet his <hi>Right</hi> foot upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> but the <hi>Left</hi> upon the <hi>Earth</hi>] <hi>Id eſt, ad praedicandum trans Mare, et in univerſo orbe terrarum</hi> To Preach beyond Sea, and all the World over. Auguſtin, Tom. 9. Hom. 7. Col. 673. <hi>Pareus</hi> makes no queſtion but this ſtrong Angel is the ſame as <hi>Michael</hi> ſtanding upon the Waters, and Swearing by the Living God, <hi>Daniel,</hi> 12. 7. From whence this part of the Viſion ſeems to be taken. — Therefore this Angel is either CHRIST himſelf, or to be ſure, an Angel repreſenting the Perſon of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Set the Foot</hi> any where, is to challenge Poſſeſſion and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

It was infinitely profitable for the New World to be Entered upon, and Seiſed for CHRIST: Yet ſuch was the indiſpoſition and Averſeneſs of its Inhabitants; that it behoved this ſtrong Angel to put forth his Strength, and to Set the beſt foot foremoſt.</p>
            <p>If this Interpretation prove true, there will be this Advantage by it, the Chronology of Expoſitions on the Revelation will be thereby Rectified. The Time of this Mighty Angel, his Setting his Right Foot on the <hi>Sea,</hi> cannot probably be earlier than the Year of our Lord GOD, One Thouſand Four Hundred Ninety and Two, when <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> by his Diſcovery of it, brought the New World into Acquaintance with the Old.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001647_0009_0FB3EC59686C5BB0"/>whoſe Reign began in the Year 518. By his Imperial Power he ſubdued the Arrians, and reſtored. Orthodox Chriſtians to their Liberty. This ſeams to be much out of Time. And indeed, the appearance of this Angel, the Slaughter of the Witneſſes, the Drying up of Euphrates, and the Converſion of the Jews may fall in very cloſe together. It is matter of ſtrong Conſolation to the Two Witneſſes, in the proſpect they have of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, that they cannot be held long under the Power of it; and that their Death ſhall uſher in ſo great and glorious a Birth. This quick and ſudden Birth of the Hebrews, will make the Witneſſes to forget their Sorrows; and animate them to lay by their Sack cloth, and joyfully to undertake a moſt illuſtrious Reiteration of their Propheſie.</p>

                  <hi>The bodies of the two Witneſſes ſhall lye in the Street of the Great City.</hi> 'Tis to be obſerved, that in the Text, 'tis not <hi>in the Streets,</hi> in the Plural, as the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation reads: 'Tis <hi>in the Street,</hi> in the Singular. And I cannot hinder my ſelf from believing, that this hath a particular regard to <hi>France,</hi> which at this day is certainly the moſt eminent Country which belongs to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Kingdom. — And I believe, that 'tis particularly in <hi>France</hi> that the <hi>Witneſſes muſt remain Dead,</hi> i. e. that the Profeſſion of the <hi>True Religion</hi> muſt be utterly aboliſht. This is already done by the Revocation of the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> and by the enormous Cruelties of the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who have been let looſe upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> of whatſoever Sex, Quality, and Condition.</q>

            <p>Rev. 11. 8. <hi>The great City</hi>] I enquire whether this can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently Underſtood of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, or of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction? It ſeems probable, that ſeeing the Beaſt is to ſlay the Witneſſes, they muſt be, and muſt be ſlain within the compaſs of the Beaſt's Juriſdiction; if they were out of it, they would not be within reach. But if the Great City ſo graphically deſcribed, prove to be ſome more peculiar and limited Juriſdiction; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digitation of the Holy Ghoſt will appear with much more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity and Diſtinction; Perſons will be directed which way to look, that they may behold this ſad Spectacle. Now, may not the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001647_0012_0FB3EC5DF4A66C90"/>Juriſdiction of GREAT BRITAIN be this Great City? Ever ſince the Acts of the Parliaments which made the Union, this Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction has been Great both in <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing;</hi> Great in the Iſlands, which are the Seat of the Empire, at Home; and Great in the Iſlands and Continent of its Plantations, abroad. If the Elaborat Calculations of my Learned Country man Sir <hi>William Petry</hi> be Credited, <hi>LONDON,</hi> the Metropolis, is not only a Great City; but it excels in Greatneſs, if compar'd with <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi> And if the Regal Style in its Compleatneſs [GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, and IRELAND] be regarded; it will certainly be allow'd to be a Great Juriſdiction. This propoſal being admitted, what is Spoken of this Great City in the 13th verſe of this Chapter, will be more eaſily accounted for.</p>
            <p>Revel. 16. 19. This <hi>Great City</hi> is generally taken to be the ſame that is ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8. To me it ſeems to be mentioned as divers from great <hi>Babylon. And the Great City was divided into Three parts,</hi> [<hi>was made into three parts,</hi> as the Vulgar Latin, <hi>Stephanus,</hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> Tranſlate] <hi>and the Cities of the Nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the furceness of his Wrath.</hi>
