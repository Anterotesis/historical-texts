            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Now ſince love and enmity, holineſs &amp; ſin, evil &amp; good are exactly oppoſite to each other, it is evident, one muſt at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> prevail over the other, how long ſoever contention and ſtrife may continue, and ſince goodneſs is the perfection of GOD, and evil the imperfection of the creature, there can be no doubt, that as good exiſted before evil, ſo it ſhall to all eternity, when evil ſhall be no more. When every knee ſhall bow of things in heaven and earth, &amp; under the earth, and every tongue confeſs and ſwear allegiance to God; then ſhall all <hi>rebellions</hi> ceaſe! Iſa. 45. Phil. 9. Rev 5.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian experience proves the reſtoration of all things; when a man comes to ſee himſelf leſt &amp; undone, vile in God's fight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his mercy, and totally unable to deliver himſelf from his ſin and miſery, he is then brought by the power of GOD, to reſign himſelf into GOD's hands, without reſerve, to do with him according to his will; being convinced that God neither will nor can do him any injuſtice, he views him as an holy righteous good and merciful God, he ſees that he is undone without a Saviour, Chriſt is revealed to him as able and mighty to ſave, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the uttermoſt, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Then let me aſk you, can a ſmall drop be longer than the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed abys and ocean of love? Have you more compaſſion on your fellow-creatures than God that made them? Can any effect be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than its cauſe? Would you bring all to God and cauſe them to be happy if you could? And will not he, to whom nothing that he pleaſes is impoſſible, bring all creatures to be reconciled unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at laſt, and become obedient to him? He has infinitely more love to his creatures, than all the ſaints and angels have, he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of infinite power and wiſdom, as well as love, all means to accompliſh the works are known to him: He can do it in a way that ſhall cauſe his praiſe to abound exceedingly, it is his will and purpoſe ſo to do; what then can hinder him from fulfiling it?</p>
            <p>Our Lord hath commanded us, Matt. 5, 41—48.18, 21. Luke 6, 27—38. to love all mankind, even our enemies, to do good to them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> render good for evil, to forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us, to pray for them, that we may be the children of our father who is in heaven, whoſe tender mercies are over all his works: But if he doth not love all himſelf and do good to them, and will nev'r for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them who treſpaſs againſt him, and render them good for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, he hath commanded us to be more perfect in that reſpect, than himſelf: which to ſuppoſe is highly abſurd. What ſo all we ſay to that doctrine that teaches us, that God hates with a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred many of thoſe whom he hath commanded us to love as ourſelves?</p>
            <p>Now is it poſſible to ſuppoſe with any degree of reaſon, that our Lord would command us, upon pain of his higheſt diſpleaſure, to forgive thoſe whom he hated, and determin'd to puniſh while he ſhould exiſt, without having the leaſt deſire or deſign to do them good? Has he promiſed us the greateſt bleſſings, if we will forgive all men, and will he never forgive them? He that can believe this, let him believe it.—Paul exhorts to pray for all men becauſe it's God's will, that all men ſhould be ſaved, (or reſtored) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſt gave himſelf ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time, and commands, ſaying, Theſe things <hi>do</hi> and <hi>teach,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1-8. and 4, 9 10 11. to pray without doubting.

This doctrine of the reſtoration doth not tend to make us hate God, nor doth it tend to produce ſelfiſhneſs, nor prevent benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, meekneſs, humility, forbearance, forgiveneſs, charity and all goodneſs, it does not tend to produce pride, envy, malice, rage, fury, wrath or madneſs againſt our neighbours or fellow-creatures, but the contrary <hi>"Glory to GOD in the higheſt, and on earth, peace, good will towards men"</hi> It cannot be a licentious doctrine, for the above reaſons, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe it cauſes benevolence, meekneſs, humility, forbearance, forgiveneſs, charity and all goodneſs, to abound and increaſe, and does not fill our breaſts with ſelfiſhneſs or pride, nor cauſe our breaſts to ſwell with pale envy and rancarous malice, at the happineſs of others. 1 John II, 10.

The miſery of the wicked ſhall end, becauſe the kingdom of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhall end.</p>
            <p>The ſubjects of Chriſt are his natural ſubjects, he is their right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſovereign: But ſatan's ſubjects are ſlaves, led captive by him at his will, he is an uſurper, and all that are in bondage to him belongs to Chriſt, who will finally draw them all to himſelf. When evil is broken, its influence ſhall no more prevail over thoſe that are captivated by it; and they ſhall feel the conſequences of ſin in ſuch a manner as to loathe it, and they ſhall heartily return, and ſwear allegiance to their rightful <hi>king.</hi> All the influence of God and goodneſs, ſhall tend to diſolve the kingdom of darkneſs, and to put an end to the thraldom and miſery of it's unhappy ſlaves.</p>
            <p>If the lake of fire or ſecond death itſelf ſhall be deſtroyed, ſhall ceaſe and be no more; there is an end to tormenting pain, and that it ſhall be deſtroyed and be no more, read Iſa. xxv, 8. Hoſ. xiii, 14. 1 Cor. xv, 26.55. death the laſt enemy ſhall he deſtroyed, if this be true, then not one enemy ſhall be left! it would be abſurd to ſay, that altho' the very laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, yet many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſhall remain to all eternity, read 1 John iii, 8. Unleſs Chriſt finally deſtroys the works of the devil, even all ſin out of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, his purpoſe muſt eternally be fruſtrated. Heb. ii, 14,</p>
            <p>As to Judas Chriſt promiſed twelve thrones to the twelve apoſtles, Matt. xix, 28. and therefore he muſt be reſtored, or the promiſe can't be fulfiled. And Chriſt prayed for his murderers and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers &amp;c. As to what Peter ſays, Acts i, compared with Pſ. lix 25.

               </gap>8.30, If there was no ſuch a thing as repentance in hell, or the priſon after death, how came Chriſt to preach to the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in priſon? 1 Pet. iii, 19.20 dit. iv, 6.</p>
            <p>It may be queſtioned, whether there it not ſomething in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of limited, yet certain puniſhment, ſo juſt equitable, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and evident, that is more calculated to produce belief, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently more effectual to deſtroy falſe hopes of eſcaping it, and alſo to check that daring preſumption, which riſes out of the idea of <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> than can be found in the contrary doctrine. End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment ſeems to ſhock tender minds, at leaſt numbers have no better excuſe for finning greedily than this, that there is no hopes of there being ſaved, therefore they are determined to ſin on, ſince it can make no difference.</p>
            <p>Though damnation has been commonly underſtood for many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and has been preached as ſuch, yet it has not prevented evil
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025210_0008_0FCCA5246FF15890"/>at all, or very little: Thoſe people that believe in the univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration live ſtricter: than others who don't, in general: The german Baptiſts all believe it, yet no people live ſtricter or more moral than they do, and many hundreds beſides them, yet it don't tend to make them licentious. Endleſs damnation is too unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to be believed; but limited puniſhment being more reaſonable ſeems more certain. Certain it is, that where the idea of endleſs miſery prevails, it doth not prevent iniquity in the meaſure that might be expected, on the ſuppoſition of its being the truth of God. The great number of heathens, who die without ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favoured with the written goſpel, or ever of hearing of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſery; the many that die in their infancy and childhood, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the inſtances of ideots, and perſons born deaf; all convince me more than any logical arguments, that God has many ways of inſtructing and reclaiming his creatures in another ſtate, than we are acquainted with. It is not ſo much the intention of God, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely to reſtrain ſin, as to ſhow in all it's dreadful deformity, puniſh it according to it's deſerts, and finally ſhow the ſuperabounding of his grace, in overcoming and totally deſtroying it out of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ſhall be accompliſhed, when he that ſitteth upon the throne ſhall make all things new, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away, Rev. <hi>xxi,</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>I don't wonder that univerſal reſtoration is not admitted by the generality of learned preachers; for how wou'd it affect their preaching? for inſtance, would it not mar a modern ſermon, the ſoul and eſſence of which is — damnation — eternal damnation — the everlaſting torments of hell, &amp;c. &amp;c. expreſſions of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force and pathos, and that admit of a very convenient variety of change. Univerſal reſtoration gaining ground, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of pulpit rhetoric, ſo enobled as it has been by fire and flame, for ever more? by this craft, ſaid ſome of old: we have our wealth, and with as ſtrong a jealouſy, might others then cry out, — nay, ſpoil us not; for this is the ſecret fund, out of which we make up all deficiencies and fill up every chaſm.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the reſtoration of all things, is no new doctrine; many have wrote upon it, hundreds have preached it, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have believed it, ſince the reformation. The truth of this bleſſed doctrine was well known to the apoſtles of Chriſt, and to the firſt Chriſtians, was by the apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians declared, and handed down to ſucceeding generations, and ſome of the fathers, (as they are called) as Origen &amp;c. whoſe writing have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, were open witneſſes for it, and indeed it hath had witneſſes in all ages, down to the preſent day.</p>

Many preachers in our days believe it, although they preach of endleſs damnation: For as long as they want to belong to the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or council of learned miniſters, or prieſts, or ſanhedrims, they muſt conform to the rules and canons of their particular ſect, or corporation, which rules canons, traditions of their elders, or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of men, to them are more ſacred, than the writings of the apoſtles of Chriſt; for the ſcriptures they may turn, twiſt, obſerve ſome, reject other parts of them, diſobey ſome ſcripture commands, alter others &amp;c. but the rights, rules, ordinances and commands laid down in their ſymbolical and canonical books, muſt be punctually obſerved and kept, if ſome of the doctrines therein contained, ſhould even be found to be diametrically oppoſie to Chriſt's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And as univerſal reſtitution is contrary to their ſyſtem, they dare not utter it, for fear of man's diſpleaſure; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as endleſs damnation compoſes a part of their ſyſtem, they muſt preach it up, or be in danger of being anathematized, by their brethern in black, i. e. the tribe of Rubies, and then be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed of their titles of honour, greetings in the markets, chief ſeats in ſynagogues, uppermoſt rooms in feaſts, of fine clothings, great yearly ſallaries, gaudy trappings and furniture; and perhaps become as poor as one of the apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus, when they ſojourned on this earthly ball, or as Chriſt himſelf, who had not any thing to lay his head upon, much leſs fine houſes, lands &amp;c. But if there be a <hi>Heretick in the world,</hi> it is the man who for the love of money or applauſe, or through the fear of man preaches that to others which he himſelf doth not believe.—He that is ſuch is ſubverted, and ſinneth being condemned of himſelf, Tit. iii, 11.</p>

            <p>As Chriſt is alpha, ſo he will be omega; as he was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo he will be the ending; as he is the firſt, ſo ſhall he be the laſt: He will outlive all ſin enmity and evil, and totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh and deſtroy the works of ſatan, and the kingdom of ſatan: He will exiſt an endleſs duration, when ſin, enmity, and evil of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kind are no more!</p>
            <p>Paul ſays: that God is the ſaviour of all men, and commands Timothy, ſaying: theſe things command and teach, 1 Tim. iv, 10.11. but our modern preachers contradict Paul, and make him a liar, for they ſay, i. e. God or Chriſt ſaves only a ſmall number, and that ſatans kingdom ſhall remain to all eternity, and that he will have abſolute dominion over them, and torment and puniſh many millions of ſouls, that God made unto endleſs duration: At that rate Chriſt has not power ſufficient to conquer ſatan his enemy, nor to deſtroy his works, although ſcripture informs us that he both has, and will make his enemies his footſtool, and bring all things in ſubjection under him, and will reconcile all to himſelf, and that he is the head of all principality and power. <hi>O ye blind, guides! ye defenders of ſatans kingdom! how amazed you will be, when the time of the general reſtoration comes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every perſon, who by reaſon of ſin and rebellion againſt God, that will be caſt into the lake of fire, will continue for a time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and be ſufficiently puniſhed for the ſame: But will then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by Chriſt, as ſoon as they have undergone their puniſhment. I ſhould imagine, that if a poor damned perſon, ſhould only be a few thouſand years in the lake of fire and brimſtone, [as the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Noah's time, till Chriſt preached to them) it would be a ſufficient puniſhment for their wickedneſs committed in their ſhort lives of forty, fifty, or one hundred years, though I don't ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their pain will end as ſoon; but may perhaps may laſt many thouſand years, and after they are reſtored, they will not poſſeſs as great a degree of happineſs, as the elect, who have followed the Lamb, in the regeneration in their life, and preſerved therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end.</p>

That the fallen angels, as well as all mankind, will, by the judge of the quick and dead, be judged according to their works, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their reward, according to their deſert or deeds, I believe; but that is not againſt the reſtoration of all things. No creature can in ſuch a ſhort time, or a time that ſhall have an end, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit as much evil, as to deſerve endleſs puniſhment in a lake of flaming fire, for there is no proportion, or likeneſs between endleſs duration, and a time to end, and eſpecially between the ſhort life of a man in this world, and endleſs duration: And I ſhould think that the damned, would be ſufficiently tormented, and pay dear enough, for all their evil deeds, that they done in their thirty, forty or fifty years; if they ſhould remain but thirty forty or fifty thouſand years in hell, for one day's puniſhment in hell, would ſeem longer and ſeverer, than many years in this world, even on a bed of ſickneſs, God is as good as he is juſt, and will not give any of the damned one ſingle ſtroke more than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; but rather leſs, as he is a God of love, mercy and pity, and after all and every one hath received their puniſhment, for their evil deeds, they will certainly be ſet free out of priſon, and out of pain, redeemed through Chriſt, and made happy, both men and fallen angels. There is no ſuch words in all the ſcriptures, as endleſs death, endleſs damnation, endleſs deſire or will of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. There is no proportion between an endleſs puniſhment, and ſins or crimes of forty fifty ſixty or ſeventy or one hundred years committing: A man of common ſenſe would rather ſuffer the greateſt tribulations and anguiſh during a life of ſixty or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty or eighty years in this world, in order to enter into imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate happineſs after death: than live a life of great pleaſure here, and be afterwards tormented in fire and brimſtone, if his torments ſhould continue but a few thouſand years: He muſt be right foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh or mad, that would rather live here in pleaſure fifty ſixty or eighty years, and be tormented in hell, if it were but a few thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years: than live a godly life, and after death enter into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs glory.</p>
            <p>It is contrary to ſound reaſon, to ſuppoſe that an allmighty, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe allknowing good, and merciful God, ſhould have created ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſſions of ſouls to be tormented in a lake of fire, without end, as well as it is contrary to ſcripture. Or that he ſhould puniſh them ſo long, for the crimes committed in a few years. See Iſa. lxv 7. lxvi 22. compared with 2 Peter iii, 10.11.12.13. Rev. xxi, 1. concerning the creation of new heavens and new earth, and the earth being diſolved with fire.</p>
            <p>The reſtoration of all things, after the conflagration, will be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025210_0012_0FCCA52B8FB95848"/>gradual, but the earth will be firſt reſtored, at leaſt a conſiderable part of it, for as we read of the lake of fire burning with brimſtone into which the beaſt and falſe prophet were caſt alive, before or at the beginning of the millennium, and the devil himſelf at the end of it, before the ſecond reſurrection and the judgement, which lake of fire and brimſtone was doubtleſs in a part of the earth, before the conflagration turned the whole into an univerſal lake of the ſame kind, ſo a principal part of the earth may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and yet a part may continue as a place of torment, long after the deſcent of the holy city. But the new creation of the earth and its ſurrounding atmoſphere, together with the deſcent of the holy city from God out of heaven, cannot be for their ſakes who will have dwelt therein for ages before, and who ſhall go no more out; but for the ſake of thoſe unhappy beings, who being caſt into the lake of fire, experienced the amazing torments of the ſecond death. If God had deſigned to leave all thoſe who ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on the earth, and periſh in the general conflagration or lake of fire and brimſtone, to continue in that miſerable ſtate to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, we ſhould never have heard of the earth being created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, by the power of God, nor of the holy city deſcending from God out of heaven: But as Jehova, hath purpoſed to create all men anew in Chriſt Jeſus, in the ages to come, and in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fulneſs of times, to rehead or rally all things which now are ſcattered under one leader, therefore he will renew the earth, and make it the ſcene, or ſtage, whereon theſe moſt amazing wonders ſhall be performed. God will look down from heaven, upon the earth in it's melted ſtate, as he did formerly upon it, when it was overwhelmed with waters, or as a ſkilful founder watches the ſtate of the melted metal in his furnace, and knows exactly when to begin his operations, ſo the great ſupreme in his appointed time, ſeeing that the great fire hath diſſolved the earth, and thereby hath brought it to a proper ſtate for him to manifeſt his creating power upon, and alſo, that a conſiderable number of the ſufferers are humbled, and prepared for him to manifeſt his redeeming power, love and grace, in and upon; he will than without delay begin to put his gracious deſigns into execution, by firſt renewing a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for them, and then renewing them to dwell therein: than will he cauſe his holy city to deſcend from God out of heaven, to make a long continuance with men. In this glorious city, Chriſt and his ſaints ſhall reign for ages and ages, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
