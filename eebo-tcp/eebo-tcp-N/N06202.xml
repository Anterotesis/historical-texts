         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Deeds of Charity Rewarded, at the Judgment-Day, with everlaſting Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>MATT. XXV. 34, 35, 40.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger and ye took me in.—Verily, I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE paſſage of ſcripture, of which the words I have read to you are a part, contain an account of the proceſs of the great and general judgment: an account, perhaps, the moſt obſervable of any to be met with, in a ſingle view, throughout the new-teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007869_0004_102DECADAD800E58"/>
IT might be <q>profitable for our inſtruction in righteouſneſs,</q> to go over the particulars of this account: But the limits to which I am confined will not allow of this, nor indeed to diſcourſe upon every thing worthy of notice in the text it ſelf.</p>
            <p>THREE things only may come under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at preſent, as being of more ſignal importance.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The influence of deeds of charity on the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that will be pronounced, at the general judgment, on the righteous.</item>
               <item>II. The particular and diſtinct mention that is here made of this kind of deeds before any other.</item>
               <item>III. The endearing manner in which our Saviour, the great Judge of the world, ſpeaks of deeds of charity.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. THE firſt thing to be conſidered is, the operation of deeds of charity with reſpect to the ſentence, which will be pronounced on the righteous, at the judgment. The ſentence is that, ver. 34. <q>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the foundation of the world.</q>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007869_0005_102DECB01BD68A88"/>
And then follows, ver. 35, the influence of charity on the procurement of this happy ſentence, <q>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink,</q> and ſo on.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord, you ſee, has connected the ſentence, at the judgment-day, which pronounces and makes men bleſſed, with deeds of charity to the needy and diſtreſſed. This kind of deeds therefore are of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in ſome ſenſe or other, in order to the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſentence.</p>
            <p>BUT the queſtion is, what is their influence? How do they operate to the obtainment of bleſſedneſs at the judgment?</p>
            <p>IN anſwer whereto, we may be ſure, they are of no uſe, have no influence, as the <hi>meritorious</hi> cauſe, ground, or reaſon, of this bleſſedneſs. The church of <hi>Rome</hi> may think highly of the value of good works, hoping to be bid, at the judgment, to inherit God's heavenly kingdom, on account of the <hi>worthineſs</hi> of them; and they may ſupport themſelves in their hope, from what our Lord has ſaid in my text. But they certainly miſtake his meaning. To ſpeak of works, whether of righteouſneſs or charity, as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007869_0006_102DECB370823680"/>
of heavenly bleſſedneſs is an abſurdity too groſs to be entertained by any, who are allowed the free uſe of their reaſon, and the word of God.</p>
            <p>'TIS one of the moſt obvious truths, that all that we have, and are, we derive from God. Not only our ability, but our very inclination, to every good work, is the free gift of God. The apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> therefore makes thoſe appeals, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 7 <q>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</q> And his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon is ſtrictly concluſive; <q>Now, if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</q> This ſame apoſtle makes that ſolemn challenge, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 35. <q>Who hath firſt given to him?</q> If any are able to anſwer and ſay, we have given to God that which we did not firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him they may then claim, as is conceded in the next words, <q>to have it recompenſed to them again.</q> But as no meer man could ever juſtly plead thus, it muſt forever be acknowledged, that an admiſſion to bleſſedneſs in heaven is a reward of grace, and not of debt. Eſpecially,</p>
            <p>IF it be conſidered, that, when we have done our all in ſerving God, and doing good to men, we have done only our duty. And where is the merit of this?
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007869_0007_102DECB589E3D088"/>
As our Saviour argues, <hi>Luk.</hi> xvii. 9, 10. <q>Doth he thank that Servant, becauſe he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewiſe ye, when ye have done all thoſe things which are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our duty to do.</q> And we have the more reaſon, after we have done our all, to eſteem ourſelves "unprofitable ſervants," becauſe our beſt ſervices carry in them ſo great a mixture of frailty and imperfection, and are accompanied with ſo many faults and follies, that we ſtand abſolutely in need of the pity and mercy of God. Beſides all which,</p>
            <p>"Our goodneſs extendeth not unto God:" Nor if we are ever ſo righteous, or charitable, can we "be profitable to the Almighty." Excellent is the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the book of <hi>Job</hi> to this purpoſe. "Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or gain to him, that thou makeſt thy ways perfect? Look to the heavens, and ſee, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. If thou ſinneſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, what doſt thou againſt him? Or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doth thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him? Or what receiveth he of thine hand?" The words are a moſt ſolemn check to the fond conceit, we are too apt to entertain of ourſelves, and of the ſignificancy of our ſervices, as they reſpect
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007869_0008_102DECB7C9118C68"/>
God. When we look up to the heavens, and behold the ſky, and the clouds, we ſee them to be high above us: But the great God is ſtill infinitely higher; exalted far above all heavens, and as far beyond the reach of being affected by any conduct of our's to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. We may be ready to indulge the tho't, as if the glorious God was mightily diſſerved by our ſins, and as much benefited by our acts of goodneſs: But this is altogether a vain imagination. If we are wicked, it's no hurt to the Almighty: Nor if we are righteous, is he at all advantaged by it. He is neither the worſe for our ſins committed againſt him; nor the better, tho' we ſhould make our ways perfect before him. And whatever our carriage is, he unchangeably remains the ſame bleſſed God forever more. How impoſſible is it then, that we ſhould <hi>merit</hi> at his hands! If he receives nothing from us, if he is nothing bettered by any goodneſs of our's, all tho't of <hi>deſert</hi> muſt be totally laid aſide; eſpecially that moſt vain of all imaginations, the pretence of <hi>merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſo great a reward from God as heaven, and the everlaſting bleſſedneſs of it.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' all claim of reward upon the foot of works, in point of <hi>merit,</hi> muſt be forever excluded; yet are they far from being uſeleſs. And works of charity may properly be conſidered as having ſome
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007869_0009_102DECB973971B88"/>
influence on the beſtowment of bleſſedneſs, at the judgment-day. And their influence ſeems to lie in this, that they are among thoſe fruits of faith and love, which, as there is opportunity therefor, are made requiſite, in the goſpel-covenant, in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualified for the rewards of the heavenly kingdom. It having pleaſed God, of his meer mercy, upon the account of Chriſt, for his ſake, and in virtue of his merits, to make the promiſe of heavenly everlaſting bleſſedneſs to perſons ſo and ſo qualified, our having "fed the hungry, and cloathed the naked," and this, from a principle of faith that has wrought in theſe effects of love, operates to our advantage, at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it declares us to be the perſons that are qualified, according to the goſpel-ſcheme, for the kingdom, God has prepared from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p>WHEN therefore our Saviour, in the text, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the happy ſentence on the righteous, "come ye bleſſed of my Father"—, and adds this account of the matter, "FOR I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat"—, his deſign is, not to point out the proper cauſe, the meritorious ground, of this reward; but the connection the goſpel has made between the reward, and the way to it. He would hereby, in the ſtrongeſt manner, give us to underſtand, the neceſſity of deeds of charity in order to an admiſſion to future
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007869_0010_102DECBCE3F46438"/>
bleſſedneſs; and that there can be no ſuch thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution of the goſpel-covenant, as our being tho't <hi>meet,</hi> at the general judgment, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom of God, unleſs we are the ſubjects of that faith, which has wro't by love, not only love to God, but to our brother alſo, evidencing it's reality by all proper acts of beneficence, as there has been opportunity therefor.</p>
            <p>IN a word, the chief thing aimed at by our Lord is, to aſſert the abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity of deeds of charity, ſo far as God gives opportunity; to declare it, in the moſt ſolemn and formal manner, that if we have this world's goods, and are of ſuch a temper as that we can "ſee our brother have need, and ſhut up our bowels of compaſſion from him," we ſhall in no wiſe be counted worthy, at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-day, to receive the ſentence, "come, ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world"!—But I may not enlarge any further here. To go on,</p>
            <p>II. THE ſecond thing obſervable in the text, is the particular and diſtinct mention of deeds of charity, rather than any other. "I was an hungred, and ye ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink",—You obſerve, deeds of charity are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007869_0011_102DECBEA9243618"/>
ones our Lord his inſtanced in. And theſe are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out, and mentioned with particularity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctneſs.</p>
            <p>"Not but that many (as one expreſſes it) will be found at the right hand of Chriſt, who never were in a capacity to "feed the hungry, or cloth the naked"; but were themſelvs both fed and cloathed by the charity of others." 'Tis particularly recorded of <hi>Lazarus</hi> a poor beggar, ſo reduced as to deſire to be "fed with the crumbs which fell from <hi>Dives'</hi>s ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble", that, when he died, he was "carried by the angels to <hi>Abraham'</hi>s boſom". And, to ſay the leaſt, as great numbers from among the poor, as from among the rich, will hereafter be admitted into the kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>NEITHER may we think, becauſe works of charity are here particularly mentioned, that other good works are needleſs; or that theſe will atone for the want of the other. Charity is not here ſingled out to exclude the concurrence of other chriſtian virtues. We may not imagine, that 'tis of little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration how a man lives in other reſpects, if he is but bountiful in his diſtributions to the neceſſitous. No; how pleaſing ſoever the ſacrifice of alms may be to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007869_0012_102DECC19E566350"/>
the Father of mercies, 'twill be of no account, another day, if we are negligent of our duty in other regards. We muſt be pious towards God, ſober as to ourſelves, and righteous, as well as charitable, towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Nor otherwiſe ſhall we, at the judgment, be pronounced "good and faithful ſervants," and be bid to "enter into the joy of our Lord."</p>
            <p>BUT if other works beſides charitable ones are thus neceſſary, why, you will ſay, are theſe latter ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out, and diſtinguiſhed, as it were, from the reſt?</p>
            <p>SEVERAL good reaſons may be aſſigned for this; and they are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>ONE may be obviouſly collected from the very ſentence itſelf, which is here paſſed on the righteous. For 'tis a ſentence of mercy; pronounced, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rigors of juſtice, but the allowances of grace. Our Lord and Judge is now exerciſing the moſt illuſtrious act of grace towards righteous men: And what works ſo proper to be particularly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by name as works of mercy? At ſuch a time as this, there ſeems to be a ſpecial fitneſs in our Saviour's taking a diſtinct notice of the charitable deeds, which good men have done, in obedience to his goſpel, and in relief of thoſe who needed their compaſſion.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007869_0013_102DECC343AC1BF8"/>
IT ought alſo to be remembred, that deeds of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are often performed in ſo ſecret a manner, that they will never be known, unleſs they are revealed at the day of judgment. Many good men ſo punctually, in many caſes, obſerve the direction of their Lord, that they ſuffer not their "left hand to know what their right hand does," in the article of "giving alms," Their good deeds to the diſtreſſed members of Jeſus Chriſt lie concealed from the knowledge of the world. 'Tis not imagined, and would ſcarcely be believed, how frequently, and with what liberality, they make diſtributions to the neceſſities of the ſaints. And is it fit ſo much goodneſs ſhould forever be buried in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy? It ſhall not, but, according to the promiſe of Chriſt himſelf, be opened to the world, and rewarded. So we read, <hi>Matt.</hi> vi. 3, 4. "When thou doſt alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth, that thine alms may be in ſecret: And thy Father, which ſeeth in ſecret, himſelf ſhall reward thee openly." Our Lord might, probably, have in view this promiſed reward; ſo wording his account of the judgment, as to aſſure good men, that all their deeds of charity ſhould then be openly acknowledged, and particularly related, to their eternal honor, before the general aſſembly of men and angels.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reaſon of this conduct of our Lord might be, the great ſtreſs he has laid upon the duty
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007869_0014_102DECC56304FF10"/>
of charity, in the new-teſtament-writings. Of all the duties we owe to our neighbour, there is no one, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in the whole ſyſtem of chriſtian morality, that is more particularly, frequently, and preſſingly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon us. That we ſhould love one another, not in profeſſion only, but with a love expreſſing itſelf in all inſtances of beneficence, was the great meſſage the Son of God came into the world to deliver to us. So we are told, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 2. "This is the meſſage ye have heard from the beginning, that ye ſhould love one another." The law of love, as diſcovering itſelf "in deed and in truth, and not in word and tongue" only, is emphatically the law of chriſtianity. Says our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> xv. 12. "This is MY command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ye love one another." Says the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his name, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 14, "Above all theſe things put on charity." And the apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſo connects the duty of loving one another with the firſt and great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of loving God, that if we do not love one another, neither can we love God. His words are theſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 17. "But whoſo hath this world's goods, and ſeeth his brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him"? The manner of diction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a moſt vehement denial. It does not dwell in him, be his pretences what they will. In fine, this charity is made ſo to enter into the very being of chriſtianity itſelf, as that, without it, we are not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007869_0015_102DECC8DD1A7C38"/>
the character of real chriſtians. To this purpoſe we read. 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 10. "In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the devil; whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God: neither he that loveth not his brother." So in the 14th ver. "We know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren: He that loveth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abideth in death." Vaſt ſtreſs, you ſee, is laid upon this duty of love, not the name, but the thing, that is to ſay, love as it diſcovers itſelf in all proper deeds of charity. And we are herefrom taught the pertinency of the diſtinguiſhing notice our Saviour takes, at the general judgment, of this kind of deeds. It cannot be thought ſtrange, that he ſhould thus ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them out, ſince they are ſo emphatically particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized in the goſpel, and ſpoken of as neceſſary in order to an acquittance at the bar of judgment.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, deeds of charity, ſpringing from a principle of love, are a ſure proof of our being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally qualified for the rewards of God's heavenly kingdom. For our whole duty, both to God and man, is nothing but love diverſified in its working.</p>
            <p>WHAT is our duty to God but love varied in its actings? It is the root of all holy obedience to him, and ſeminally comprehends it all. The apoſtle <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:007869_0016_102DECCA85BF7368"/>
therefore obſerves, 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 3. "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments." And, if our love be real and hearty, it will expreſs itſelf in a dutiful regard to him as our King and God, in a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy care to obſerve whatſoever he has commanded.</p>
            <p>AND the ſame may be ſaid of love to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. It includes in it virtually all the offices of juſtice and charity, and whatever duty we are obliged to, with reference to one another. So we are expreſly taught by the apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 8. "Owe no man any thing but to love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law." It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the two next verſes, "Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, thou ſhalt not kill"—; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.—Therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."</p>
            <p>So that where love is, that love which expreſſes itſelf in deeds of charity to the poor members of Chriſt, there no other chriſtian grace can be totally wanting. Our Saviour therefore, by mentioning deeds of charity, as ſpringing from love, has done the ſame thing in effect, as if he had mentioned every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007869_0017_102DECCD25895448"/>
IN fine, another reaſon, why our Saviour takes ſuch diſtinguiſhing notice of acts of charity may be, becauſe he looks upon every one of them as a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs done to himſelf. And this leads me to the next thing to be diſcourſed to from the text; and that is,</p>
            <p>III. The endearing manner in which he ſpeaks of deeds of charity. "I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink," and ſo on. What is done by the righteous, in a way of charitable diſtributions to the diſtreſſed members of Chriſt, he graciouſly ſpeaks of as done to himſelf. For this is the meaning of the words, as our Lord has himſelf explained them. For 'tis obſervable, when the great Judge of the world had ſaid, "come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you,—for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat"—; The righteous, to whom he had thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, filled with humble wonder, to find ſuch poor and worthleſs ſervices of their's, ſo graciouſly ow<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d and amply rewarded, break forth in the following admiring addreſs to their King and Judge, "Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink? when ſaw we thee a ſtranger, and took the in"—? To which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our makes the aſtoniſhing anſwer, in the latter part of my text, "Verily, I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007869_0018_102DECD0C8AEB7A0"/>
have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have done it unto me." Me indeed, in my own perſon, ye have not relieved, refreſhed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; but theſe offices of charity ye have done to my brethren, to thoſe I am nearly related to, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly concerned for: And what ye have thus done to them, even the leaſt of them, I take kindly at your hands, looking upon it with the like friendly regard, as if done to myſelf.</p>
            <p>O WONDERFUL condeſcenſion of the Son of God, our Saviour and Judge! That he ſhould take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the charities of ſuch poor, imperfect, ſelfiſh creatures, deſerves our humble and grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments; but that he ſhould make ſo great account of them, eſteem them as ſo many kind ſervices done to his own perſon, ſpeak of them as ſuch openly in the face of all angels and men, and admit us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to the rewards of grace in his Fathers heavenly and eternal kingdom;—it is unſpeakably aſtoniſhing! Nothing could have been ſaid more powerfully adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to convey an idea of the warmth and ſtrength of the grace of Chriſt towards men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we muſt be loſt to all ſenſe of ingenuity, if our hearts are not touched with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:007869_0019_102DECD26C3B1EC0"/>
BUT that we may be led into a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this language of our Lord and Judge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aright of the propriety of his ſaying, "inaſmuch as ye have done it to the leaſt of my brethren, ye have done it to me," let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p>THAT, as he was pleaſed to become a partaker of fleſh and blood, in faſhion as a man, mankind in common are his brethren. Their relation to him as ſuch ariſes from his being a man, like as we are, ſin only excepted. And in conſequence of his poſſeſſing manhood, he may properly be conſidered as, in ſome meaſure, intereſted both in the joys and ſorrows of them, who, in common with him, partake of the ſame nature. He is accordingly ſpoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 15. as "an high-prieſt, who could be touched with the feeling of our infirmities." What is done to us may, in a ſenſe, on account of his alliance to humanity, be ſaid to be done to him.</p>
            <p>BUT there is an higher and more glorious ſenſe, in which the words of our Lord may be underſtood. As we are chriſtians, not in profeſſion, and appearance only, but in reality and truth, we are, in the moral and religious ſenſe, whatever nation or kindred we are of, members of that body of which Jeſus Chriſt is the head. The inſpired pen-men often ſet the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007869_0020_102DECD4B33227C8"/>
matter before us in this light. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 12, 13. "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, are one body: So alſo is Chriſt. For by one ſpirit we are baptized into one body." In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is obſerved of believers, ver. 27th, "Ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular." Now, according to the reaſoning, in this ſame chapter, 26th ver. "Whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it." And as Chriſt is the head of the body, the church, it is eminently true, with reſpect to him, that he is a ſharer with its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral members in their joys and griefs. As they are parts of his body, it cannot be but he ſhould have a tender ſympathy with them.</p>
            <p>'TIS in alluſion to this manner of ſpeaking, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently uſed in ſcripture, that what is done to the diſciples of Chriſt, is repreſented as done to himſelf. In this point of light, we are, at once, let into the meaning of that ſurprizing voice from heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> ix. 4, 5. "Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?—I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt." In the ſame light, we may readily ſee the propriety, and force, of that remarkable paſſage, in the goſpel, "Whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones, a cup
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007869_0021_102DECD65FB36310"/>
of cold water only in the name of a diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward." And 'tis with a view to the ſame conſideration of good men as the body of Chriſt, that he ſays, "I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink."—And again, "Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have done it to the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</p>
            <p>HAVING, with as much brevity as I could, gone over the ſeveral particulars propoſed to be conſidered, there is time to turn the diſcourſe into a ſerious exhortation, calling upon my ſelf and you to abound in deeds of charity. Nor can the wiſdom of men or angels preſent to our view, for our quickning and encouragement, ſtronger arguments than thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in my text. Our Saviour and Judge will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it kindly of us, if we open our hearts at the cry of his needy diſciples, and ſtretch forth our hands to their relief. Yea, he will reckon it an act of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence done to himſelf, and acknowledge it as ſuch before the general aſſembly at the great day. And can we withſtand ſo moving, ſo endearing, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Where, in that caſe, is our love to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, our beſt friend, and greateſt benefactor? Was our dear Lord now on earth, and could we behold him, with our bodily eyes, in a ſuffering ſtate, as he once was, ſhould we think any thing too much to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007869_0022_102DECDAA8865BF0"/>
part with for his comfort? Let us make it appear, that we ſhould not, by miniſtring to the neceſſities of poor ſaints. In this way, we may now miniſter even to Chriſt himſelf. For he is the head of that body, of which believers, however poor and needy, are parts; and the kindneſs we ſhow them, we ſhow it conſtructively to him: Yea, there is no office of love we can expreſs towards them, even the meaneſt of them, but our Lord will take it as though perſonally done to himſelf. O the aſtoniſhing ſtupidity of thoſe men, who are not made willing, by this conſtraining motive, to do good, as they have opportunity, and ability, to the houſhold of faith!</p>
            <p>IF this ſhould be the truth with reſpect to any of us, let us look forward to the coming day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and know, that our admiſſion to the rewards of an eternal kingdom is eſſentially connected with that "love to the brethren," which will ſhow it ſelf in all ſuitable inſtances of beneficence towards them. The inquiry, at the judgment, will be, what have been our charities, in obedience to the goſpel? What diſttributions have we made to Chriſt's poor, which we have always had with us to move our commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Nor will it be in our power to give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ourſelves, if we cannot ſay, that we have fed the hungry, and cloathed the naked, in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007869_0023_102DECDC58D4FEA0"/>
according to the ability God has given us. It will not then avail us, tho' we ſhould have done no hurt, if we have done no good. It will not then ſuffice, that we have been fair and honeſt in our dealings, that we have been ſober and temperate in our enjoyments, or that we have appeared zealous and devout towards God, if, at the ſame time, we have been heard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and uncharitable; if, while we have had it by us, we have ſaid to our poor neighbour, "go, and come again to morrow, and I will give thee"; if, while we have had ability, we have ſaid to this and the other "brother and ſiſter, when naked, or deſtitute of daily food, depart in peace, be ye warmed, be ye filled, and have not given them thoſe things which are needful for the body."</p>
            <p>IT may be worthy of our particular notice, and moſt ſolemn remembrance, that the dreadful curſe ſpoken of, in the context, as denounced againſt the wicked, is grounded on their neglect of deeds of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. "Depart from me ye curſed; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink," and ſo on. They were, no doubt, ſinners in other reſpects; [the want of charity is commonly accompanied with many other ſins] but their uncharitableneſs only is mentioned by name; and 'tis on this account, in ſpecial, that they are doomed to "the fire prepared for the devil and his angels."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007869_0024_102DECDE790DD5C0"/>
Do we, my brethren, believe a coming day of judgment? Do we expect to ſee the Son of man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from heaven, in great glory, with his holy angels, to ſummon both quick and dead to an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before his tribunal? Let us prove our faith by our works. "To do good and communicate, let us not forget; for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed." Do we hope to be found at the right hand of our Judge, when he ſhall "appear a ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation"? Let us then be "rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate": So ſhall we "lay up in ſtore for our ſelves a good foundation againſt that time, and ſhall lay hold on eternal life."</p>
            <p>THE bleſſed ſentence, we have heard, will, at the judgment-day, be pronounced on thoſe, and only thoſe, who have "fed the hungry, and cloathed the naked." If therefore we have not, when God has given us ability and opportunity, done theſe kind offices to the diſtreſſed in Chriſt, and are conſcious to our ſelves that we have been thus uncharitable, we can be at no loſs to determine, that we are not in the number of thoſe, concerning whom the great King and Judge of the world will ſay, at his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "come, ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007869_0025_102DC734A5FEE9D8"/>
SURELY, if we had faith in a judgment to come, and did but realize the advantage, the unſpeakable and everlaſting advantage, it would then be to us, to have abounded in deeds of charity, we ſhould not be diſpoſed to "with-hold more than is meet," as we too commonly are. 'Tis a certain truth, however backward we may be to admit it, that the beſt thing we can do with "the mammon of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs" is, to "make to ourſelves friends of it," by employing it to the uſes of charity, that "when we ſail, they may receive us to everlaſting habitations." We are hardly brought to believe it, but 'tis a goſpel truth, that we then moſt conſult our own intereſt, when we do the moſt good with our eſtates. We may, in this way conſtructively remit them to another world, where we may enjoy the benefit of them forever. Every deed of charity, ſpringing from a principle of faith in Chriſt, and love to God and our neighbour, is as ſo much treaſure laid up in heaven. We may be ready to think, all that is done this way is loſt, eſteeming it as "bread caſt upon the waters." as the wiſe man ſpeaks; but we ſhall "find it again after many days: perhaps, in this world, without a poſſibility of failure in the coming eternal world. The leaſt good we do to the leaſt diſciple of Chriſt, done in faith and love, ſhall be remembred, and taken notice of, by him at the judgment, and amply rewarded. And the more good we do, the more diſtinguiſhingly glorious will
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007869_0026_102DECE39E77B690"/>
the ſentence of our Judge be, when he bids us "enter into the joys of our Lord."</p>
            <p>SOME, perhaps, may be ready to find fault with me for not bringing a diſcourſe better fitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of a communion-day. But it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, our being hereafter admitted to ſet down at the eternal ſupper of the Lamb, in God's heavenly kingdom, is connected, in the text I have been upon, even by our Saviour himſelf, with the regard we have paid to that duty of charity I have been recommending.</p>
            <p>AND 'tis obſervable, that very death, which we commemorate, at the holy ſupper, was owing to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the bleſſed Jeſus to the periſhing ſons of men, greater charity than was ever before expreſſed in this world of our's, or ever will be expreſſed again. And the ſupper, at which we are about to communicate, is an appointed memorial of this very charity of our Saviour and Lord: Nor can we ſuitably remember his death, without remembring that charity of his, which made him willing to undergo this death for our eternal good.</p>
            <p>AND 'tis, moreover, a feaſt of charity that we are about to attend. And if we would attend it aright, it muſt be in the exerciſe of that charity, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence us to "love one another, even as Chriſt loved us," when he "gave himſelf an offering for our ſins."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:007869_0027_102DECE66D34B160"/>
BESIDES all which, the ſubject I have been upon is, at this time, the more ſeaſonable, as, in the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, there is an opportunity, and a fair call, to preſent to your view an illuſtrious inſtance of one of thoſe righteous ones, of whoſe deeds of charity to the poor, we have reaſon to believe, our Redeemer will take particular notice, at the great day of judgment, and publiſh to the general aſſembly of angels and men to his eternal honor.</p>
            <p>YOUR thoughts, I doubt not, are at once fixed on that dear brother of our's, and friend of Chriſt and the poor, who departed this life yeſterday Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>WHAT is ſaid upon ſuch occaſions is ſometimes apt to give diſguſt, as being eſteemed a compliment to the dead, rather than their juſt character. But, in the preſent caſe, I am in no fear of giving offence, the perſon I am to ſpeak of was ſo unexceptionable, ſo unenvied unleſs for his goodneſs, and ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally well ſpoken of, both while living, and now he is dead.</p>
            <p>IT was his glory and happineſs, that he began early to ſeek and ſerve God; and he made good progreſs in religion, exemplifying in his temper, and conduct, the things that were virtuous and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:007869_0028_102DECE81F070DE0"/>
HE had upon his mind an habitual awe and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the great God; was a man of undiſſembled piety; prayerful and devout; conſcientious in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lord's day; a conſtant ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on all the inſtitutions of goſpel-worſhip; a bright pattern of meekneſs and humility, patience and ſubjection to the Father of ſpirits; remarkable for his regard to juſtice, which he ever diſcovered in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his dealings, punctual veracity to his word; for his uprightneſs and integrity; his generous and public ſpirit; his plain-heartedneſs and ſimplicity; his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from deceit and guile; his diſregard to the pomps and vanities of the world; his peaceable, inoffenſive and kind carriage towards all men.</p>
            <p>HE was of an active ſpirit, diligent in buſineſs; but did not purſue it to the neglect of the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. His ſhare of this world's goods, the fruit of his own labour, under the divine bleſſing, was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; but he did not keep it to himſelf. He "honored the Lord with his ſubſtance"; chearfully embracing the opportunities providence put into his hands of relieving the neceſſities of the poor. He was "rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate": Tho' how often he did ſo is not fully known, nor will it be known, till the day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Jeſus Chriſt. And what added much to the beauty and value of his charities, he diſpenſed them
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007869_0029_102DECEA3B205658"/>
without noiſe and buſtle, without ſhew or oſtentation; not ſeeking, not regarding, the praiſe of men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned chiefly to approve himſelf to his great Lord and Judge. He was, in a word, one of thoſe "good men for whom (as the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) one would even dare to die." He "gave much alms to the people," and they went up "for a memorial before God."</p>
            <p>HE was, as might be expected of ſuch a man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the thoughts of death, willing to be "ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the body," as hoping he ſhould go to "be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all. And when Chriſt ſhall come in the clouds of heaven, in great glory, and his holy angels with him, to judge the quick and dead, then we ſhall, I truſt, ſee this his ſervant at his right hand; and that, we have reaſon to believe, will be the ſentence, he will pronounce on him, "Come, thou bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungry, and thou gaveſt me meat; I was thirſty, and thou gaveſt me drink; I was a ſtranger, and thou took<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me in; naked, and thou cloathedſt me; I was ſick and thou viſitedſt me; in priſon, and thou cameſt unto me: Inasmuch as thou haſt done theſe things to theſe and thoſe of my brethren, thou haſt done it unto me."</p>

            <p>LET us be concerned to follow thoſe who through faith, and patience, and charity are gone to inherit the promiſes. Let us labour that we may abound in every good work doing all the good we can eſpecially to the houſhold of faith. Let us deal our bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and draw out our ſouls to the diſtreſſed: So will our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he appears to judge the world in righteouſneſs, place us at his own right hand, pronounce us bleſſed in the audience of all angels, and the whole race of men, and give us an open and an abundant entrance into God's everlaſting kingdom. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
