            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT the Churches which are called <hi>Reformed,</hi> have attained unto but an <hi>Imperfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> is a Truth not to be denyed: The defect has not been so much in <hi>Doctrine</hi> as in <hi>Worship and Discipline.</hi> Nevertheless, in this respect some Churches have gone beyond oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs. In <hi>Geneva, France, Holland,</hi> they have made an higher Progress then in <hi>Germany:</hi> of which the chief <hi>Reformers,</hi> such as <hi>Melancthon, Martyr, Musculus, Zanchy</hi> and others were very sensible, bitterly complaining that many who were willing to cast off <hi>the yoke of Antichrist,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:000938_0004_0FAD923713729788"/>
yet were not willing to Subject to <hi>the Yoke of Christ.</hi> Amongst all the Reformed Churches, some have given the Preference to the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-Brethren,</hi> who sprang from the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and they from the true Apostolick Church, not corrupted with Popery. These did <hi>Luther</hi> in the year 1524 mislike, because of their <hi>stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For which change of his Judgement Popish Authors do unworthily upbraid him, since it was a change for the better. <hi>Lasitius</hi> (the Polish Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) sayes, that if any where in the World <hi>the Primitive Apostolical Churches</hi> were to be seen, it was amongst the <hi>Ecclesiolae,</hi> the poor little Churches of the <hi>Bohemian Brethren.</hi> When Learned <hi>Bucer</hi> heard one of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (who was sent on purpose into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> for that end) give an account of <hi>the Order of their Churches,</hi> he burst out into Tears, saying to the other Divines Present, <hi>This is Heaven upon Earth. Vergerius,</hi> (that famous Preacher who having been the <hi>Popes Legat</hi> to the Emperor, taking <hi>Calvins Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> into his hands with a design to confute him, was Converted thereby) wrote to an

Now that wherein these Churches did chiefly Excel, was their <hi>Order</hi> Especially in <hi>their great strictness as to Admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to the Lords Supper.</hi> It was in those dayes objected against them, <hi>Fratres non habent Ecclessam apertam,</hi> that their <hi>Churches were enclosures,</hi> and their Church doors were too strai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

degenerated, and wonderfully lost their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, until the Jealousy of the Lord dissipated and destroyed them all.

And what has God done to them all at this day? It was spoken to the Church in <hi>Ephesus, Rev.</hi> 2 4, 5. <hi>Thou hast left thy first Love, Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and do the first works, or else I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place.</hi> The <hi>Revelation</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Forty year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is not <hi>my own Cause,</hi> but <hi>Yours,</hi> which I have here undertaken and plead for. Did I say <hi>Yours</hi>? Nay, it is <hi>Christs Cause.</hi> The defence of these Truths is now become <hi>the Cause of Christ and of his Churches in New-England</hi> I am also very sensible that <hi>Young Divines,</hi> who have not Studied these <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,</hi> are apt to think, that what has been <hi>Ordinarily professed and practised in the Churches of New England,</hi> is <hi>Novelty and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</hi> It may in that respect be a Service to the Churches that something be written, which may be for the Information and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of such, in <hi>Questions</hi> of this nature,

by means whereof they may be the more fit to Serve the <hi>Churches of God</hi> wherever the Divine Providence shall see good to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of them.</p>

               <hi>New-England</hi> (I mean the Churches in it) was <hi>Planted a Noble Vine wholly a righ seed.</hi> We are all concerned in our several Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities (Ministers in theirs and People in theirs) to Labour what in us lies, that they who shall come after us, may not prove <hi>Degenerate Plants</hi>; much more should we Endeavour that they may not be so in our Dayes. It is a sad Observation often Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Experience, That <hi>Religion in the Purity and Power of it, seldome continues long in the same place.</hi> When the <hi>Church of Israel</hi> was in a Setled State, <hi>They Served the Lord all the dayes of Joshua, and of the Elders that out lived Joshua; that Generation was gathered to their Fathers, and there arose another Generation after them which knew not the Lord. They turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quickly out of the way which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Voice of the Lord, but they did not so.</hi> It was the <hi>Third Generation</hi> of Church Members which proved Degenerate and Apostate: Pray God it be not so in <hi>New-England.</hi> The <hi>First Generation</hi> of his Servants whom he brought into this Wilderness are gathered to their Fathers. And many of the <hi>Second Generation,</hi> such of them as are yet living are now in years, and soon will be all gone. The <hi>Third Generation</hi> are coming to take their turn:

Some of them are great Blessings to the Churches, as inheriting the Principles, Spirit, and Grace of their Fathers and Grand-Fathers, but many of them do not so. On which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is not at all to be wondred at, if they Dislike <hi>the Good Old way of the Churches</hi>; yea, if they Scoff at it, as some of them do; or if they are willing <hi>to depart from what is Ordinarily Practised in the Churches of Christ in New-England</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For <hi>the Congregational Church Discipline,</hi> is not Suited for a Wordly Interest, or for a <hi>Formal Generation</hi> of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. It will stand or fall as <hi>Godliness in the Power of it</hi> does prevail or otherwise. That there is a great decay of the Power of Religion throughout all <hi>New-England</hi> is Lamentably true. If that revive, there will be no fear of <hi>Departing</hi> from the Holy Discipline of the Churches of Christ. But revived it will be amongst those who are Enemies to <hi>Explicit Covenanting</hi> with God and His People, against whom the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Societies of the Church of England Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> now in <hi>London,</hi> will rise up and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them. Was it ever known that <hi>Collapsed Churches</hi> were restored to their Primitive State of Purity, but in this way, and by this means of <hi>Explicit Renovation</hi> of their Covenants with God and with one another. But I hope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough is said about that in the Subsequent <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</hi>

Interest and theirs, and not Hanker after new and loose wayes. This is a matter of no small concernment. For if the Fountain whose <hi>Streams should make glad the City of God,</hi> be corrupted, Posterity will be Endangered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. The poor Churches in <hi>Bohemia</hi> before mentioned found it so. If the begun <hi>Apostacy</hi> should proceed as fast the next thirty years as it has done these last, surely it will come to that in <hi>New England</hi> (Except the Gospel it self <hi>Depart</hi> with the <hi>Order</hi> of it) that the most Conscientious People therein, will think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves concerned to gather Churches out of Churches. But as yet the <hi>Declension</hi> is not gone so far but a Stop may be put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and the Interest of Religion be Retrieved. It was said to one of the decaying Churches in <hi>Asia, Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain, and are ready to Dy; — Remember how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast.</hi> Do's not the Lord Jesus Christ say so to the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi>:) And does He not say, as unto another of the Churches, <hi>Hold fast that thou hast, that no man take thy Crown.</hi>

what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> relates concerning a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of Eminent Christians who being met together on other accounts, it was proposed whether they could all give an account of the Exact Time of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; and there was but one of them all that could do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The natural Tempers and Infirmities of some are such as make them uncapable of relating publickly what God has done for them. Some have a natural Hesitancy of Speech.

               <p n="3">3. It is possible that the Occasion of a mans Conversion may have been something not fit to be publickly related. It may be the words of some persecuted Saint who is in obscurity.

satisfyed neither with the necessity nor yet with the Expediency of it. True it is, that the reason of that Opposition against it which is in the minds of some, proceeds from their own want of Experience. The <hi>American Apostle,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls him) good old Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> who was very Zealous for publick Relations, has sometimes told us of a man that Joyned himself to the Church in <hi>Roxbury,</hi> who had been a very bitter Enemy to this Holy practice of the Churches in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> until the Lord changed his Heart: And then when he offered himself to the Communion of the Church, he began his publick Relation after this manner. <hi>It may be it will be wondred at that I who have been such an Enemy to these Relations, and have so often inveighed against that practice of the Churches, should now be willing my self to Relate what impressions the Word and Spirit of God has made upon me. I must Confess, that when I was against that Practice, the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was because</hi> I had nothing to say; <hi>but it has pleased the Lord to Open my eyes, and to Change my heart: and now I am willing to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto all you that fear the Lord, what God has done for my Soul.</hi> After this manner did that Converted man Express himself. Yet nevertheless, some who have had Experience of the Regenerating Grace of God in their own Souls, have not thought it necessary, to declare this Publickly, when they Joyn in Church-fellowship. I remember my Worthy Friend
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000938_0032_0FAD92591C840898"/>
and Ancient acquaintance, the Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>John How</hi> (who was Pastor of a Congregational Church in great <hi>Torrington</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> where I was his Successor in the work of the Ministry forty years agoe) informed me of one in that Church, who had been very averse to make a Relation of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Experiences, as supposing there was no Rule in Scripture obliging all that joyned to the Church so to practice: But at last he yielded to the Importunity of them that desired it from him; and made such a Relation of the work of God on his Soul, that (as Mr. <hi>How</hi> assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me) there was not one man in all the Church that had dry Eyes at the hearing of it. These things considered, we shall readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede unto those who are Scrupulous about Relations, that <hi>A Formal Relation is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary</hi> in order to Admission into Church Fellowship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The practice of the Churches in <hi>New England</hi> as to this particular, is Lawful, Laudable, and Edifying. It is Lawful for Churches to desire those that offer themselves to their Holy Fellowship, to give an account of their Faith and Repentance: And when a Church desires it, no capable person ought to refuse it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is Scripture warrant for this practice <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>I have not hid thy Righteousness within my heart, I have declared thy Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and thy Salvation, I have not concealed thy

loving kindness and thy Truth from the great Congregation. Psal.</hi> 40.10 And in another place, he sayes, <hi>Come and hear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my Soul. Psal</hi> 66.16. These Expressions show that a Christian should be willing upon just occasion, to declare the Goodness and Gracious workings of God upon his Soul, and this too in the Assembly and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his People. Now if a Church does desire it, thats a just occasion for the doing of it: and therefore it then ought to be done. Moreover, the Scripture sayes, that Christians should be <hi>ready to give a reason of the hope that is in them to every one that asketh.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. This Expression of <hi>A reason of their hope</hi> shews that they must not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what good things they hoped for in this or in another world, but also upon what grounds they did so hope. For else they might shew their hope, but not <hi>the Reason</hi> of their hope. Now if a man has Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a work of Saving Conversion, causing him to acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that he has no reason to hope but the contrary. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Therefore he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the reason of his hope, must declare his Faith and Regeneration If the Apostle does specially intend that Christians should be ready to do this before Persecutors, who would probably be offended with them for

it, surely they should be ready to do this before a Church of Christ who will not be offended with them, but bless God for what they shall hear. The Presbyterian <note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vindication of Presbyterian Government. p.</hi> 67.</note> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of <hi>London</hi> say well, whose words are these, <hi>If Christians are bound to give an account of their Faith and Hope to every one that asketh, yea even to Heathen Persecutors, how much more ought they to do it to the Officers of the Church? especially at such a Time when they desire to be admitted to such an Ordinance as is not common to all sorts of Christians</hi> I add, And how much more to a whole Church of Christ, if they ask it? There are also Scripture Examples to encourage this Holy practice. They who were admitted to <hi>Johns Baptism,</hi> made an <hi>Open Declaration</hi> of their Conversion. <hi>Math</hi> 3.6. And those Converts in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. did manifest that serious desires were wrought in their Souls to be delivered from their Sins, which lay upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and pricked their hearts, and that they gladly received the word of promise. If this was publickly manifested by them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Admittance to Baptism; why should not the like be done now by Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Admission to the Lords Table? It is also recorded concerning the Converted <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that they not only believed, but <hi>Came and Confessed. Act.</hi> 19.18. which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes <hi>A Publick Declaration of their Conversion</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:000938_0035_0FAD925CD092A148"/>
And we find that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was ready upon all just occasions to relate the story of his Conversion. This does warrant Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now to practice the like on just occasions. And consequently when a Church of Christ shall call for it. The great <hi>Austin</hi> in his Book of Confessions, relates the story of his Conversion: The like we find in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished lives of many Saints. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his disputation with <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Jew giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Marvellous account of his Conversion, by means of a Reverend old man, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to Read the Scriptures and to pray to God for illumination, and then departed out of his sight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is necessary that Churches should know that those whom they admit to their Communion are duely qualified for that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. That they have in them (so far as men are able to judge) that which is the matter of Self-Examination, <hi>viz.

Now one way for the Church to know that they are such, is, by a <hi>Relation of Experiences.</hi> Nor can it be known except by a <hi>Relation,</hi> or that which shall be <hi>Equivalent</hi> thereunto; as our worthy <note n="(k)" place="bottom">

               <p n="3">3. The person that does thus joyn himself to the Lords People will have more of their Love and Affection than could otherwise be expected.

               <p n="1">1. Nothing is more Indisputable then that under the Old Testament, the Church was Constituted by a Covenant.

The like may be said as to the Church Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000938_0040_0FAD9261D6E1B638"/>
on moral Equity, and often mentioned in the Old Testament. Moreover (as is noted by a Learned Author) the name <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Covenanting,</hi> was that which would have made the Churches in those dayes Obnoxious to the Civil Powers, who were then Enemies to Christianity. Therefore the Apostles did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the <hi>Names,</hi> but Established the <hi>Thing</hi> by Similitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>Now
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000938_0052_0FAD927020E956B8"/>
let us suppose there are Forty Meetings in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that in each Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a Chapter is read every Lords-day, for three quarters of the year, by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, there will be near Eight hundred Chapters read in these Meetings in a year. But will the Bishop perswade us that there is as much read in one day in the Parish Church. Mr. <hi>Boyse</hi> moreover sayes, that there are few Sermons of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> in which there is not as much of the Scriptures recited to the people as if put together would make up two or three Chapters. And that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> have better reason to blame the <hi>Conforming Clergy</hi> for casting out the Exposition of Scripture when read (as that Exercise is distinguished from Sermon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed the Superstitious Jews made a <hi>Canon</hi> that their <hi>Compendious Prayer,</hi> which they call <hi>Majan q. d</hi> a <hi>Fountain Prayer,</hi> and require their Disciples to say it Eighteen times every day, shall be Expressed in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, though he that sayes it has no man with him, and they make him Guilty of Sin that shall Pray that Prayer in the singular number though in his Closet, because he must never look on himself as Separated from the Synagogue. But does any man believe, that if a Christian shall say, give <hi>me</hi> my daily bread, forgive <hi>my</hi> debts, lead not <hi>me</hi> into Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deliver <hi>me</hi> from evil, that he offends by not speaking plurally in the very Syllables of the Lords Prayer? It would be so, if the design of the precept were to tye us up to Words and Syllables.</p>

For in the <hi>Fifth Petition</hi> they vary therefrom. The words in <hi>Matthew</hi> are, <hi>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors,</hi> Math. 6.12. The words in <hi>Luke</hi> are, <hi>Forgive us our Sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us,</hi> Luk. 11.4. When as they that say

the Lords Prayer use the words which are in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> viz <hi>Forgive us our Trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.</hi> It will be said, that is the same <hi>thing</hi> though not the same <hi>words</hi> with the other. But this is to give up the cause, since our Question is not concerning <hi>things</hi> but <hi>words.</hi> Moreover, by this small alteration of the words a Great Truth, viz. <hi>That our Sins are our Debts,</hi> is lost. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is justly blamed for making a little change in the <hi>Sixth Petition,</hi> for he expresseth it, <hi>Ne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaris nos induci &amp;c Suffer us not to be led into Temptation,</hi> whereby a great and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Truth respecting the Activity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in Leading men into Temptation is obscured. They that pretend they are bound in Conscience to use the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> as a <hi>Form,</hi> and so to keep exactly to the words therein contained, are not able to Extricate themselves from this Argument against them. Nor can I give any reason why they express the <hi>Fifth Petition</hi> as they commonly do, excepting this, that they have taken their use of the Lords Prayer, not out of the <hi>Bible</hi> but out of the <hi>Common Prayer Book.</hi>

is evident that <hi>Origen</hi> did sometimes use this prayer; but without an opinion of its being necessary.

But suppose that an hundred years after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were all dead, <hi>this Formality</hi> had been generally practised, we could not from thence infer, that it was so in their dayes. For <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations</hi> and <hi>Declensions</hi> from the <hi>Primitive Purity</hi> were soon brought in unawares amongst the Churches.

                  <hi>Early Superstitions</hi> And although we read nothing of their keeping the Feast of <hi>Christ's Nativity</hi> for more than an hundred years after this; nevertheless, <hi>Whitsunday</hi> and <hi>Pentecost</hi> was observed in Commemoration of the descent of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles.

To which has been replyed, that the <hi>Decalogue</hi> does contain in it, all the Duties which God requires of men, <hi>Matth</hi> 22 40.

to a <hi>Repetition of the Lords Prayer,</hi> at the Conclusion of their own imperfect ones. Moreover, we may not think that <hi>Words and Syllables</hi> will make amends for the <hi>Defect</hi> of our Prayers; for that is (as shall be further said) to give to them what is proper to the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is also pretended that every <hi>Rabbi</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> amongst the Jews delivered a <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> to his Disciples.

Learned Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> has declared, that if the <hi>Congregationals</hi> would all come up to what Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> asserts in his Book of the <hi>Keyes of the Kingdom,</hi> he would meet them half way.

For we have received to our Communion those that have come to us with Testimonials from Presbyterian Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> and divers that have come to us from <hi>Scotland</hi> Yea, and some <hi>French Refugees</hi> of whose sincere Piety we have had Testimonials.

Churches who Elected them with fasting and prayer, without any laying on of hands. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> not long before his departure to a better World, drew up some <hi>proposals</hi> for the <hi>Acccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation and Vnion</hi> of these two Reforming Perswasions, in which his Spirit was very much ingaged. My most dear Brother <hi>Samuel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (who was well known to the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> above forty years ago, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he ended his days) not long before he finished his Course, wrote a small Book which beareth the Title of <hi>Irenicum,</hi> or an <hi>Essay for Vnion</hi>; wherein he shows how inconsiderable the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are between those of the <hi>Presbyterian and Congregational Judgment,</hi> and that they may without any selling of Truth to purchase peace, mutually own and give the Right Hand of Fellowship to each other, as true Churches and Ministers of Jesus Christ, that they should lay aside all their Animosities, and remember that Golden Rule, Rom. 14.3. <hi>Let not him that Eateth, despise him that Eateth not, and let not him that Eateth not, judge him which Eateth, for God has received him.</hi> So let not him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the way of Classical Subordination, despise him that dependeth not, and let not him that dependeth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Amongst those who go under the name of <hi>Congregational,</hi> there is a variety of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in some <hi>Disciplinary Controversies.</hi> Some of them have thought that no Children should

be admitted to Baptism whose Parents are not admitted to the Lords Table. This was the opinion of our Learned Mr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> who was many years Praesident of the Colledge, and of Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> and some few others of the first Ministers in these Churches. But Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> my Father <hi>Mather,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> and the generality of our <hi>New-England</hi> Divines were for a greater Latitude as to the subject of Baptism. Some esteem none to be Members of the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> excepting those that belong to <hi>Particular Churches:</hi> So Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> and most of our Ministers. But in this the generality of <hi>Congregationals</hi> in <hi>England</hi> vary from them.
