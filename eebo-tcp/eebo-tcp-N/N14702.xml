            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE tribes of Iſrael, to whom the words juſt read were originally addreſſed, were aſſembled together, by the expreſs command of GOD, to hear their prophet recapitulate the many and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018658_0005_0FA80A6279550C38"/>
ſignal bleſſings, which a kind Providence had conferred upon them; that the recollection might warm their hearts with gratitude; and diſpoſe them with the greater cheerfulneſs, and ſtricter ſincerity, to devote themſelves to the ſervice of their divine Benefactor.</p>
            <p>HE begins with the awful diſplays of divine power upon their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, upon Pharaoh and his people; that all the nations around might be convinced, that GOD had a gracious care for his choſen people, and that his people might have their minds eſtabliſhed in full confidence, in the power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Providence they had put themſelves under.—He mentions the ſurpriſing manner in which they had been ſupported.—"<hi>Ye have not eaten Bread, nor drank Wine,"—" And your cloaths waxed not old upon you.</hi>"</p>
            <p>AND when the Kings of the country were ſo regardleſs of that divine prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018658_0006_0FA80A63152B01A0"/>
which ſaid, <hi>touch not my people,</hi> as to oppoſe them with their armies, they were deſtroyed, and their land divided among the conquerors for an inheritance.</p>
            <p>THESE were Reaſons calculated to impreſs their minds with a laſting ſenſe of divine goodneſs, and that they might attend to them; they were called off from their ſecular employments, to ſtand, all of them, before the Lord.—</p>
            <p>From which we may infer,</p>
            <p>THAT there are certain occaſions peculiarly proper for looking back upon the various dealings of providence towards a people. And that the moſt rational and ſcriptural way is, for a People to aſſemble themſelves together, that they may jointly conſider and improve the ways of providence.</p>
            <p>THERE are certain occaſions peculiarly proper for recollecting the dealings
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018658_0007_0FA80A64F3473668"/>
of providence towards a particular People.</p>
            <p>WHEN the divine Being hath been pleaſed to diſplay his wiſdom, power and goodneſs, he expects to receive declarative glory from his rational offspring:— That mercies ſhould be acknowledged and rejoiced in.—It was the aggravated ſin of Iſrael, <hi>not to conſider</hi> the dealings of GOD with them; and it is injoined with peculiar force—"That <hi>they remember the work of the Lord, that they meditate on all his works, and talk of his doings.</hi>" And this was ever the practice of the moſt eminent characters mentioned in holy writ.—When Noah had experienced the ſignal care of Heaven, in the preſervation of himſelf and family from the univerſal deluge, the firſt thought of his heart was gratitude; and the firſt work of his hand was, to erect a memorial of the divine favour.—When Abraham had
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018658_0008_0FA80A655703C8E0"/>
given proof of his faith; and the life of his ſon was ſpared, he perpetuated his ſenſe of the divine goodneſs, calling the name of that place <hi>Jehovah-jireh.</hi>— So, when the nation of Iſrael was reſcued from the cruel bondage of Aegypt, they were expreſſly commanded to keep that day for a memorial of the goodneſs of GOD, forever. I might go on to mention the examples of David, of Joſhua and of Solomon, in ſhort, of religious perſons in every age and nation.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt obſerve, that reaſon and the ſacred Scriptures, teach us to acknowledge public favours, in a ſocial and public way. Many individuals uniting together conſtitute a community; therefore expreſſions of gratitude for common bleſſings, muſt come from a collective body. And it was the manner in which the ancient church of GOD acknowledged the ſpecial favours of Heaven.—It was their method, <hi>to go up
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018658_0009_0FA80A665693ADA8"/>
to the houſe of</hi> GOD, to declare that the Lord had done great things for them.— When they had been miraculouſly delivered from ſervitude, and in a wonderful manner led to the land of Canaan;—the language of every pious heart was, come let us go up to the houſe of the Lord, and acknowledge all his wonderful works, and ſhew forth his praiſe.</p>
            <p>AND, when the nation of Iſrael was under the immediate government of GOD, he was pleaſed frequently to aſſemble them together, to acknowledge the mercies they received.</p>
            <p>AND when Moſes drew nigh the cloſe of his life, ſtill deſirous of the good of the people over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom he had ſo long preſided, he calls the tribes of Iſrael together before the Lord, to hear him relate the remarkable providences of GOD in their favour; becauſe this was the moſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018658_0010_0FA80A66D26A3FA8"/>
probable method of fixing a grateful remembrance of divine favours upon their minds.</p>
            <p>FROM ſuch motives as theſe we are this day, <hi>all of us,</hi> aſſembled before the Lord our GOD, our captains of our tribes, our elders and our officers, with all the men of our community, that we may recapitulate the goodneſs of providence towards this church and town, by tracing the hiſtory of our firſt ſettlement, our growth and eſtabliſhment of our preſent proſperity.</p>
            <p>HERE it may be proper juſt to obſerve, that the nobleſt motives the human heart is capable of, influenced the firſt adventurers to America. "After the chriſtian religion had flouriſhed in ſimplicity and purity, for many ages; deſigning men marred its beauty with impure doctrines, turning aſide after the viſionary phantoms of enthuſiaſm and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018658_0011_0FA80A67865F4D48"/>
bigotry.—When by far, the greateſt part of the chriſtian world, lay under the deluſion of popiſh errors, 'till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 16th century, when the glorious reformation began in Germany, and ſoon extended its benign influences to the inhabitants of Great-Britain. But the great enemy of human happineſs, ſtirred up a ſpirit of pride and ambition in the reformed church of England, ſo that men of tender conſciences ſuffered grievous trials, 'till our anceſtors, who for the ſtrictneſs of their manners were called puritans;—unable, any longer, to ſubmit to the unreaſonable demands of the church of England, conſulted together, and concluded to fly to ſome land of liberty and peace.</p>
            <p>ANIMATED by ſuch motives, they cheerfully relinquiſhed their attachment to their native country, the ſweets of tranquil life, and, with reſpect to many, they gave up affluent eſtates for the hope
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018658_0012_0FA80A684AB66E80"/>
of enjoying the liberty of worſhiping GOD in peace, in the manner their conſciences approved.—Sweetned with the pleaſing expectation of leaving the fair inheritance to their children and their children's children; and about one hundred and ſixty years ago, firſt landed on this American ſhore.</p>
            <p>MANY and great embarraſſments attended the firſt ſettlement of Plymouth colony, ſo as to prevent the planting of Maſſachuſetts for about half a ſcore years.</p>
            <p>BUT the noble motives which enabled them to undertake, ſtill animated them to go through the labours and dangers they met with, and muſt needs expect to meet, in ſo great an undertaking;— they overcame difficulties, by daring to encounter them, ſo that the ſettlement ſpread to Charleſtown, Salem, Boſton, and other places. Large tracts of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018658_0013_0FA80A690E55E048"/>
inteterval and medow, promiſed a more immediate ſupport, and invited our anceſtors to inland places, that within twenty years after the firſt planting this colony, the towns immediately around us, were taken up; and about one hundred and thirty years ago, two adventurers from Charleſtown—Meſſi'rs Kettle and Boon with their families, ſettled upon lands they had purchaſed of the natives, which land is known by their names to this day; but in the year 1675, the tribes of Pawkamauket, Uncompan, Wotolaom and Samkana, with Phillip at their head, were defeated by governor Winſlow, and obliged to leave their country, ſcattered among the Monhegins, Pequods, Nipnetts and Naſhawas, whom they perſuaded to join with them in aſſaulting Lancaſter, Sudbury and Medfield, leaving the veſtiges of their cruelty behind them: This ſo alarmed our two defenceleſs ſettlers, as to induce them to remove
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018658_0014_0FA80A69CBF825E0"/>
with their families; but unhappy Boon, in attempting to remove his houſhold goods, was ambuſhed and murdered, by the Indians.</p>
            <p>THE affairs of this village, as it was then called, were managed by a committee under the appointment of the general court until their incorporation; when the inhabitants of Pompſiticutt elected their firſt town officers, in the month of April, 1683, Sergeant Benjamin Bozworth, Thomas Stevens, Stephen Hall, Boaz Brown and Joſeph Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſelect-men;—Thomas Gates, conſtable.</p>
            <p>BUT the ſpring following, 12 adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers from Boſton, Watertown and Concord, as proprietors of Pompſiticutt, petitioned the general court, to be incorporated into a town by the name of STOW, which petition was granted on the 16th of May, 1683.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018658_0015_0FA80A6A86847500"/>SOME of theſe original proprietors have numerous deſcendants, who ſupport their names with reputation to this day, though many of them have not even their names remaining with us.</p>
            <p>AGREEABLE to the principles of their anceſtors, their firſt concern was to enjoy the public worſhip of GOD. In 1686, they conſiſted of 37 rateable polls, to ſupport the expence of building a meeting-houſe for divine worſhip, and a manſion-houſe for a miniſter.—They had a conſiderable number who preached with them for ſhort terms. In 1682, one Mr. Green, and in 1685, Mr. Harris, then Mr. James Minot from Concord, whom they about two years after invited to ſettle in the miniſtry with them, but ſucceeded not.—But in 1686, the records mention the great affection of the town towards one Mr. William Woodroffe, in chooſing a committee to give Mr. Woodroffe, a ſolemen invitation to come
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018658_0016_0FA80A6B6B6F8D78"/>
preach and ſettle with them in the work of the goſpel, but ſucceeded not.—Mr. Overton, in 1689, then Mr. Jonathan Winborn, miniſtered to them ſix years. After him Mr. Morſe and Mr. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from Dedham, ſupplied them for two or three years—'till the year 1699, when the Rev. Mr. John Eveleth, recieved an invitation, and the next year was ordained the firſt miniſter of the church of Chriſt in Stow, who continued ſeventeen years.—The church then applyed to Mr. Sparhawk and Mr. John Gardner, the laſt of whom received an invitation from the church and town in the month of April, and on the 18th of November following, was ordained to the work of the goſpel miniſtry, and continued his labour with great faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for above half a century, died on the 10th of January, 1774; and on the 11th of October, 1775, the preacher was ordained in colleagueſhip with the Rev. Mr. Gardner.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:018658_0017_0FA80A6E828EB190"/>BUT to return to the civil affairs of the town; the firſt meeting-houſe being decayed in June, 1713, they built their ſecond houſe for divine worſhip, about a quarter of a mile eaſt from the preſent houſe.—But in about 40 years, the number of inhabitants was ſo increaſed, and the ſituation of the meeting not convenient, they erected their third houſe on the 27th of Auguſt, 1752; at which time the town conſiſted of 118 families, i. e. 260 ſouls, which was an increaſe of 88 families in about half a century; and in 1776, which is 24 years, there was an increaſe of 220 ſouls.—And in the year 1783, the number of inhabitants had increaſed to 935, which is 95 in 7 years, beſides about one hundred that have been taken away by death in that time.— And on the 25th of February laſt, 154 from us were incorporated into the diſtrict of Boxborough.</p>
            <p>DURING the miniſtry of the Rev. Mr. Gardner, 209 communicants were
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018658_0018_0FA80A7001582978"/>
admitted to the Lord's Table.—Our preſent communion conſiſts of 108.— 1346 received the ordinance of baptiſm, from January, 1719, until October, 1774; and from 1774, to this time, 260, which amounts to 1606 that have been baptized in this church.</p>
            <p>THESE are the moſt material facts that reſpect the ſettlement and proſperity of this town—unleſs it is the very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing care of providence for its inhabitants.—For while the inhabitants of other towns have been carried into the moſt cruel captivity, or ſlain in the field of battle, we have been protected in the midſt of equal dangers, both in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and in the late bloody wars, that not an individual has fallen by the enemy.</p>
            <p>SO have we been exempted from the ſpecial calamities of the preſent war. If we turn our eyes to the field, where the barbarous Britons ſpread their encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018658_0019_0FA80A718EA35850"/>
rioting in the ſpoils of the induſtrious, indiſcriminately plundering the rich and the poor, the widow and the orphan; there we ſhall behold moſt ſorrowful families, bereaved parents, diſconſolate widows, and weeping orphans. How many bleeding boſoms call for our compaſſion!—What afflicted multitudes, deprived of their once pleaſant dwellings and the means of ſubſiſtence—the ruins of beautiful houſes in their ſpeechleſs but flaming oratory, implore the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic tear from every eye!—How many virtuous and reſpectable families, ſpoiled of their ſubſtance and driven from their once peaceful abodes, to ſeek a refuge among ſtrangers—and in many places the temples of the holy GOD, where the glad tidings of the goſpel of Chriſt, had been ſtatedly diſpenſed to ſerious and dovout worſhippers, have been ſacrificed to the wantonneſs of barbarity, or made receptacles of idle and profane ſports; while we have dwelt in ſafety, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018658_0020_0FA80A720AA386A8"/>
enjoyed our ſabbaths in peace, have had the advantage of that religion, which is beſt calculated to make its profeſſors rationally and ſubſtantially good—where wiſdom and beauty diſplay their charms in the devotion of ſincere worſhippers.</p>
            <p>AND it is with heart-felt joy, I can this day congratulate you, not only that your perſons and property are ſecure from the deſolations of war; but that peace is reſtored to our bleeding land. Tidings grateful to our ears, as cooling waters to the thirſty ſoul.—Let us then conſecrate the gladneſs of our hearts to GOD, who has graciouſly heard our prayers, and granted our deſires—given us in ſecurity to enjoy the rewards of induſtry—"<hi>terque quaterque foelices</hi>;" happy people if we are but ſenſible of our privileges. The preſent ſtate of this town is an evidence of the care of a good providence over the virtuous.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018658_0021_0FA80A72CEBB4D20"/>THESE places, which one century ago, were the dark and inhoſpitable abodes of beaſts of prey or more cruel ſavages, now preſent to the eye beautiful landſkips of extenſive and well cultivated fields; which with ſmiling and exuberant eloquence praiſe the induſtrious labourer, and give glory to the great Lord of all.</p>
            <p>HAPPY in the regularity of our internal police for many years paſt, gratitude obliges us to acknowledge the prudent and benevolent ſervices of a GARDNER<note n="*" place="bottom">The Hon. HENRY GARDNER, Treaſurer of this State, who died October 7th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1782.</note>; whoſe clear head and honeſt heart, were ever devoted to the intereſt and proſperity of his native town. We may well regret our own with the publick's loſs.</p>
            <p>THIS, with the many ſorrows of a more private nature, will ſwell our boſoms with a ſigh, and ſtrongly mingle tears with the joys of this day.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:018658_0022_0FA80A738B990268"/>BUT let not ſuch reflections prevail, to hinder that harmonious ſervice of praiſe, which the mercies we have received, as a particular town, and part of America, juſtly demand.</p>
            <p>I CONGRATULATE you, my people, and this whole aſſembly, on the very acceptable tidings of peace.—What ſcenes of happineſs now open upon us— the hope of ſecuring the increaſe of our ſettlements—converting the nothern wilderneſs into fruitful fields!—We may rationally anticipate the happineſs of poſterity, to whom we hope to tranſmit the fair inheritance, with improvements and ſecurity unknown to our fathers.</p>
            <p>I CONGRATULATE you, my friends! who appear in all the glittering pomp of war, to grace this memorable day, that hence forth our ears ſhall no more hear the thunders of war, or anxiety ſwell our

            <p>I CONGRATULATE you, gentlemen, the civil fathers of this town, on the arrival of a day ſo intereſting to the community at large; and to you in particular, as the guardians of the peace and proſperity of this ſociety, and that ſo many of the cares and burdens of your office are alleviated, at the ſame time the benevolent wiſhes of your hearts are ſo largely gratified.</p>
            <p>I CONGRATULATE you my fathers and brethren of the church of Chriſt here, on the revolution of an aera ſo

intereſting to you, as the deſcendants of thoſe worthies the firſt ſettlers of this town, and the founders of this church; great were their trials—arduous their labours—and painful the ſufferings they cheerfully underwent, that they might tranſmit ſo rich an inheritance to us, and to generations yet unborn, the peaceable poſſeſſion of their lands, and the more important bleſſings of the beſt religion.</p>
            <p>WELL may gratitude warm every heart and fill every mouth with praiſe on the arrival of an aera ſo important to America, and ſo memorable to this town.</p>
            <p>LET us take occaſion, from the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our hearts, to bind our ſouls anew to the ſervice of GOD, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and bountiful benefactor—Let us endeavour that a ſenſe of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>OH! that a ſenſe of religion might dwell in every heart, and preſide over the rejoicings of this ſignal day.</p>
            <p>THERE may be decent expreſſions of publick gladneſs; ſuch an occaſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them—But let your joy be too ſacred to ſuffer profaneneſs upon your tongues, or ſenſuality to unman your hearts.</p>
            <p>MAY the ſmiles of Heaven, like this day's ſun, ſhed their richeſt bleſſings on this town—and the following century
