            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>To this letter the miniſter gave a verbal anſwer, that he would ſee us the day after the morrow (the 8th) at one o'clock. Accordingly at that hour, and day, we waited on the miniſter, at his houſe, where his office is held, when, being informed he was not at home, the ſecretary-general of the department told Major Rutledge, that the miniſter was obliged to wait on the directory, and requeſted we would ſuſpend our viſii 'till three o'clock. At which hour we called. The miniſter we found was then engaged with the Portugueſe miniſter, who retired in about ten minutes, when we were introduced, and produced the copy of our letters of credence, which the miniſter peruſed and kept. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, <q>that the directory had required him to make a report rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the ſituation of the United States with regard to France, which he was then about, and which would be finiſhed in a few days, when he would let us know what ſteps were to follow.</q> We aſked if cards of hoſpitality were in the mean time neceſſary? He ſaid they were, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034817_0005_0FFF8404727E8F38"/>that they ſhould be delivered to us; and he immediately rung for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary and directed him to make them out. The converſation was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by him in French, and by us in our own language.</p>
               <p>The next day cards of hoſpitality were ſent to us and our ſecretaries, in a ſtyle ſuitable to our official character.</p>
               <p>On Saturday the 14th, Major Mountflorence informed General Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that he had a converſation with Mr. Oſmond, the private and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential ſecretary of the miniſter of foreign affairs, who told him, that the directory were greatly exaſperated at ſome parts of the Preſidents ſpeech, at the opening of the laſt ſeſſion of congreſs, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an explanation of them from us. The particular parts were not mentioned. In another converſation, on the ſame day, the ſecretary informed the major, that the miniſter had told him it was probable we ſhould not have a public audience of the directory, 'till ſuch time as our negociation was finiſhed, that probably perſons might be appointed to treat with us, but they would report to him, and he would have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the negociation. The major did not conceal from Mr. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond his intention to communicate theſe converſations to us.</p>
               <p>In the morning of October the 18th, Mr. W... of the houſe of ... called on General Pinckney, and informed him, that a Mr. X. who was in Paris, and who the General had ſeen ..... was a gentleman of conſiderable credit and reputation ..... and that we might place great reliance on him.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the ſame day Mr. X. called on General Pinckney, and after having ſat ſome time ... whiſpered him, that he had a meſſage from M. Talleyrand to communicate, when he was at leiſure. General Pinckney immediately withdrew with him into another room; and when they were alone, Mr X. ſaid, that he was charged with a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in which he was a novice; that he had been acquainted with M. Talleyrand ..... and that he was ſure he had a great regard for [America] and its citizens; and was very deſirous, that a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be brought about with France; that to effectuate that end, he was ready, if it was thought proper, to ſuggeſt a plan, confidential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that M. Talleyrand expected would anſwer the purpoſe. General Pinckney ſaid he ſhould be glad to hear it. M. X. replied, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, and particularly two of the members of it, were exceedingly irritated at ſome paſſages of the Preſident's ſpeech, and deſired that they ſhould be ſoftened; and that this ſtep would be neceſſary previous to our reception: that beſides this, <hi>a ſum of money was required, for the pocket of the Directory and Miniſters, which would be at the diſpoſal of M. Talley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand:</hi> and that a loan would alſo be inſiſted on. M. X. ſaid, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to theſe meaſures, M. Talleyrand had no doubt that all our differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with France might be accommodated. On enquiry M. X. could not point out the particular paſſages of the ſpeech that had given offence, nor the quantum of the loan; but mentioned that the <hi>douceur,</hi> for the pocket, was twelve hundred thouſand livres, about fifty thouſand pounds ſterling. General Pinckney told him, his colleagues and himſelf, from the time of their arrival here, had been treated with great ſlight and diſreſpect; that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034817_0006_0FFF842B933148C8"/>they earneſtly wiſhed for peace and reconciliation with France; and had been entruſted by their country with very great powers-to obtain theſe ends, on honorable terms: that with regard to the propoſitions made, he could not even conſider of them before he had communicated them to his colleagues: that after he had done ſo, he ſhould hear from him. After a communication and conſulation had, it was agreed, that General Pinckney ſhould call on M. X. and requeſt him to make his propoſitions to us all; and for fear of miſtakes, or miſapprehenſion, that he ſhould be requeſted to reduce the heads into writing. Accordingly, on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of October the nineteenth, General Pinckney called on M. X. who conſented to ſee his colleagues in the evening, and to reduce his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to writing. He ſaid his communication was not immediately with M. Talleyrand, but through another gentleman, in whom M. Talley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand had great confidence: this proved afterwards to be M. Y.</p>
               <p>At ſix in the evening M. X. came and left with us the firſt ſet of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; which, tranſlated from the French are as follows: <q>A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who poſſeſſes the confidence of the directory, on what relates to the affairs of America, convinced of the mutual advantages which would reſult from the re-eſtabliſhment of the good underſtanding between the two nations, propoſes to employ all of his influence to obtain this object. He will affiſt the commiſſioners of the United States in all the demands which they may have to make from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of France, inaſmuch as they may not be contradictory to thoſe which he propoſes himſelf to make, and of which the principal will be communicated confidentially. It is deſired that in the official com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications there ſhould be given a ſoftening turn to a part of the Preſident's ſpeech to congreſs, which has cauſed much irritation. It is feared that in not ſatisfying certain individuals in this reſpect, they may give way to all their reſentment. The nomination of commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners will be conſented to on the ſame footing as they have been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the treaty with England, to decide on the reclamations which individuals may make on the government of France, or on French individuals. The payment which, agreeably to the deciſions of the commiſſioners, ſhall fall to the ſhare of the French government, are to be advanced by the American government itſelf. It is deſired that the funds which by this means ſhall enter again into the American trade ſhould be employed in new ſupplies for the French colonies. Engagements of this nature, on the part of individuals, reclaiming will always haſten, in all probability, the deciſions of the French commiſſioners: And perhaps it may be deſired that this clauſe ſhould make a part of the inſtructions which the government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States ſhould give to the commiſſioners they may chooſe. The French governmen deſires, beſides to obtain a loan from the United States; but ſo that that ſhould not give any jealouſy to the Engliſh government, nor hurt the neutrality of the United States. This loan ſhall be <hi>maſked</hi> by ſtipulating, that the government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States conſents to make the advances for the payment of the debts contracted by the agents of the French government with the citizens
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034817_0007_0FFF842D1A97CCE0"/>of the United States; and which are already acknowledged, and the payment ordered by the directory, but without having been yet ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuated.—There ſhould be delivered a note to the amount of theſe debts. Probably this note may be accompanied by oſtenſible pieces, which will guarantee to the agents, the reſponſibility of the United States, in caſe any umbrage ſhould cauſe an enquiry. There ſhall alſo be taken from this loan certain ſums for the purpoſe of making the cuſtomary diſtributions in diplomatic affairs.</q> The perſon of note mentioned in the minutes, who had the confidence of the directory, he ſaid, <hi>before as all,</hi> was M. Talleyrand. The amount of the loan he could not aſcertain preciſely, but underſtood it would be <hi>according to our ability to pay.</hi> The ſum which would be conſidered as proper, according to the diplomatic uſage, was about twelve hundred thouſand livres. He could not ſtate to us what parts of the preſident's ſpeech were excepted to, but ſaid he would enquire and inform us. He agreed to breakfaſt with Mr. Gerry the morning of the 21ſt, in order to make ſuch explanations as we had then requeſted, or ſhould think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to requeſt: But on the morning of the 20th M. X. called and ſaid, that M. Y. the confidential friend of M. Talleyrand, inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with us through M. X. would ſee us himſelf, and make the neceſſary explanations. We appointed to meet him the evening of the twentieth, at ſeven o'clock, in General Marſhall's room. At ſeven M. Y. and M. X. entered; and the firſt mentioned gentleman, being introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to us as the <hi>confidential friend</hi> of M. Talleyrand, immediately ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us the favorable impreſſions of that gentleman to our country, impreſſions which were made by the <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>civilities</hi> he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally received in America: That impreſſed by his ſollicitude to repay theſe kindneſſes, he was willing to aid us in the preſent negociation by his good offices with the Directory, who were, he ſaid, extremely irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated againſt the government of the United States, on account of ſome parts of the Preſident's ſpeech, and who had neither acknowledged not received us, and conſequently have not authorized M. Talleyrand to have any communication with us. The miniſter therefore could not ſee us himſelf, but had authorized his friend M. Y. to communicate to us certain propoſitions, and to receive our anſwers to them—and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe on his part, that if we would engage to conſider them as the baſis of the propoſed negociation, <hi>he would intercede with the Directory</hi> to acknowledge us, and give us a public audience. M. Y. ſtated to us explicitly, and repeatedly, that he was cloathed with no authority; that he was not a diplomatic character; that he was not ... ... he was only the friend of M. Talleyrand and truſted by him; that with regard to himſelf he had ..... ............. and that he wiſhed well to the United States. He then took out of his pocket a French tranſlation of the preſident's ſpeech, the parts of which objected to by the directory were marked, agreeably to our requeſt to M. X. and are contained in the exhibit A. Then he made us the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſet of propoſitions, which were dictated by him and written by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034817_0008_0FFF842EC69F4830"/>M. X. in our preſence, and delivered to us, and which, tranſlated from the French, are as follows <q>There is demanded a formal diſavowal, in writing, declaring that the ſpeech of the citizen, Preſident Barras, did not contain any thing offenſive to the government of the United States, nor any thing which deſerved the epithets contained in the whoſe paragraph: ſecondly, reparation is demanded for the article by which it ſhall be declared, that the decree of the Directory there mentioned, did not contain any thing contrary to the treaty of 1778, and had none of thoſe fatal conſequences that the paragraph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to it: Thirdly, it is demanded that there ſhould be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment in writing of the depredations exerciſed on our trade, by the Engliſh and French privateers: Fourthly, the government of France, faithful to the profeſſion of public faith which it has made not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in the internal affairs of foreign governments, with which it is at peace, would look upon this paragraph as an attack upon its loyalty, if this was intended by the Preſident. It demands, in conſequence, a formal declaration, that it is not the government of France, nor its agents, that this paragraph meant to deſignate: In conſideration of theſe reparations, the French Republic is diſpoſed to renew with the United States of America, a treaty which ſhall place them reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame ſtate that they were in 1778. By this new treaty, France ſhall be placed, with reſpect to the United States, exactly on the ſame footing as they ſtand with England, in virtue of the laſt treaty which has been concluded between them. <hi>A ſecret article of this new treaty would be a loan to be made by the United States to the French Republic;</hi> and once agreed upon the amount of the loan, it would be endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſult the convenience of the United States with reſpect to the beſt method of <hi>preventing its publicity.</hi> On reading the ſpeech M. Y. dilated very much upon the keenneſs of the reſentment it had produced, and expatiated largely on the ſatisfaction he ſaid was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary as a preliminary to negociation. <hi>But ſaid he, gentlemen, I will not diſguiſe from you, that, this ſatisfaction being made, the eſſential part of the treaty remains to be adjuſted:</hi> il faut de d'argent —il faut beaucoup d'argent: <hi>You muſt pay money, you muſt pay a great deal of money.</hi>
                  </q> He ſpoke much of the force, the honor, and the jealous republican pride of France; and repreſented to us ſtrongly the advantages which we ſhould derive from the neutrality, thus to be purchaſed. He ſaid that the receipt of the money might be ſo <hi>diſguiſea,</hi> as to prevent its being conſidered as a breach of neutrality by England; and thus ſave us from being embrolled with that power. Concerning the <hi>twelve hundred thouſand livres</hi> little was ſaid; that being completely underſtood on all ſides, to be required for the <hi>officers of government,</hi> and therefore needing no farther explanation.—Theſe propoſitions, he ſaid, being conſidered as the admitted baſis of the propoſed treaty. M. Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyrand truſted that, by his influence with the directory, he could prevail on the government to receive us. We aſked, whether we were to conſider it as certain that, without a previous ſtipalation to the effect required, we were not to be received. He anſwered, that M. Talleyrand himſelf was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034817_0009_0FFF8405F8E421F8"/>not authorized to ſpeak to us, the will of the Directory, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not authorize him. The converſation continued until half paſt nine, when they left us; having engaged to breakfaſt with Mr. Gerry the next morning.</p>
               <p>October 21ſt, M. X. came before nine o'clock: M. Y. did not come until ten—<hi>he had passed the morning with M. Talleyrand.</hi> After breakfaſt the ſubject was immediately reſumed. He repreſented to us that we were not yet acknowledged or received; that the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory were ſo exaſperated againſt the United States, <hi>as to have come to a determination</hi> to demand from us, previous to our reception, thoſe diſavowals, reparations and explanations, which were ſtated at large, laſt evening. He ſaid, that M. Talleyrand, and himſelf, were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the pain we muſt feel, in complying with this demand; but that the directory would not diſpenſe with it; that therefore we muſt conſider it as the indiſpenſible preliminary to obtain our reception; unleſs we could find the means to change their determination in this particular; that if we ſatisfied the Directory in theſe particulars, a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be written to us to demand the extent of our powers, and to know whether we were authorized to place them preciſely on the ſame footing with England;—whether, he ſaid, our full powers were really and ſubſtantially full powers; or, like thoſe of lord Malmeſbury, only illuſory powers; that, if to this demand our anſwer ſhould be affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then France would conſent that commiſſioners ſhould be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſcertain the claims of the United States, in like manner as under our treaty with England; <hi>but from their juriſdiction muſt be withdrawn thoſe which were condemned for want of a role d'equipage;</hi> that being a point on which Merlin, while miniſter of juſtice, had written a treatiſe, and on which the Directory were decided. There would however be no objection to our <hi>complaining</hi> of theſe captures in the courſe of the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and if we could convince Merlin by our reaſoning, the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would himſelf be ſatisfied with our ſo doing. We required an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of that part of the converſation, in which M. Y. had hinted at our finding means to avert the demand concerning the preſident's ſpeech. He anſwered, that he was not authorized to ſtate thoſe means, but that <hi>we muſt ſearch for them and propoſe them ourſelves.</hi> If however we aſked his opinion as a private individual, and would receive it as coming from him, he would ſuggeſt to us the means, which in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would ſucceed. On being aſked to ſuggeſt the means, he anſwered MONEY; that the Directory were jealous of its own honor, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the nation; that it inſiſted on receiving from us the ſame reſpect with which we had treated the king; that this honor muſt be maintained in the manner before required, unleſs we ſubſtituted in the place of thoſe reparations ſomething perhaps more valuable, that was, <hi>money.</hi>—He ſaid further, that if we deſired him to point out the ſum which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved would be ſatisfactory, he would do ſo. We requeſted him to proceed; and he ſaid, that there were <hi>thirty-two millions of florins</hi> of Dutch inſcriptions, worth ten ſhillings in the pound which might be aſſigned to us at 20 <abbr>
                     <hi>ſ.</hi>
                  </abbr> in the pound; and he proceeded to ſtate to us the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034817_0010_0FFF8407878E3440"/>certainty, that after a peace, the Dutch government would repay us the money; ſo that we ſhould ultimately looſe nothing; and the only ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the meaſure would be an advance from us to France of thirty-two millions, on the credit of the government of Holland. We aſked him whether the fifty thouſand pounds ſterling, as a <hi>douceur</hi> to the Directory, muſt be in addition to this ſum. He anſwered in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. We had no heſitation in ſaying that our powers were ample: that on the other points propoſed to us we would retire into another room, and return in a few minutes with our anſwer. We committed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to writing the anſwer we propoſed, in the following words: <q>Our powers, reſpecting a treaty, are ample: But the propoſition of a loan in the form of Dutch inſcriptions, or in any other form, is not within the limits of our inſtructions; upon this point therefore the government muſt be conſulted; one of the American miniſters will, for the purpoſe, forthwith embark for America: Provided the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory will ſuſpend all further captures on American veſſels, and will ſuſpend proceedings on thoſe already captured, as well where they have been already condemned, as where the deciſions have not yet been rendered; and that where ſales have been made, but the money not yet received by the captors, it ſhall not be paid until the preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary queſtions, propoſed to the miniſters of the United States, be diſcuſſed and decided;</q> which was read as a verbal anſwer; and we told them they might copy it, if they pleaſed. M. Y. refuſed to do ſo: His diſappointment was apparent; he ſaid we treated the money part of the propoſition as if it had proceeded from the Directory; whereas in fact it did not proceed even from the miniſter, but was only a ſuggeſtion from himſelf, as a ſubſtitute to be propoſed by us, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to avoid the painful acknowledgment that the Directory had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to demand of us. It was told him, that we underſtood that matter perfectly; that we knew the propoſition was in form to be ours: but that it came <hi>substantially from the minister.</hi> We aſked what had led to our preſent converſation? And General Pinckney then repeated the firſt communication from M. X. (to the whole of which that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman aſſented) and we obſerved that thoſe gentlemen had brought no teſtimonials of their ſpeaking any thing from authority; but that rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the fair characters they bore, <hi>we believed them when they ſaid they were from the miniſter, and had converſed with them in like manner, as if we were converſing with M. Talleyrand himſelf; and that we could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider any ſuggeſtion M. Y. had made, as not having been previouſly approved of:</hi> But yet if he did not chooſe to take a memorandum in writing of our anſwer, we had no wiſh that he ſhould do ſo; And further, if he choſe to give the anſwer to his propoſition, the form of a propoſition from ourſelves, we could only tell him, that we had no other propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make, relative to any advance of money on our part; that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica had ſuſtained deep and heavy loſſes, by French depredations on our commerce, and that France had alledged ſo [many] complaints againſt the United States, that on thoſe ſubjects we came fully prepared, and were not a little ſurpriſed to find France unwilling to hear us; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034817_0011_0FFF840A5AB9FAE0"/>demands upon us, which could never have been ſuſpected by our government, and which had the appearance of our being the aggreſſing party. M. Y. expreſſed himſelf vehemently on the reſentment of France; and complained, that inſtead of our propoſing ſome ſubſtitute for the reparations demanded of us, we were ſtipulating certain condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be performed by the Directory itſelf; that he could not take charge of ſuch propoſitions; and that the Directory would perſiſt in its demand of thoſe reparations which he at firſt ſtated. We anſwered, that we could not help it: It was for the Directory to determine what courſe its own honor and the intereſts of France required it to purſue: <hi>It was for us to guard the intereſts and honor of our country.</hi> M. Y. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we had taken no notice of the firſt propoſition, which was, to know whether we were ready to make the diſavowal, reparations, and explanations concerning the Preſident's ſpeech. We told him that we ſuppoſed it to be impoſſible, that either he, or the miniſter, could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that ſuch a propoſition could require an anſwer: That we did not underſtand it as being ſeriouſly expected; but merely as introductory to the ſubjects of real conſideration.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke of the reſpect which the Directory required, and repeated, that it would exact <hi>as much as was paid to the ancient Kings.</hi> We anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that america had demonſtrated to all the world, and eſpecially to France, a much greater reſpect for her preſent government than for her former monarchy; and that there was no evidence of this diſpoſition which ought to be required, that we were not ready to give. He ſaid, that we ſhould certainly not be received; and ſeemed to ſhudder at the conſequences. We told him, that America had made every poſſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to remain on friendly terms with France; that ſhe was ſtill making them: That if France would not hear us; but would make war on the United States; nothing remained for us, <hi>but to regret the unavoidable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceceſſity of defending ourſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubject or our powers was again mentioned; and we told him, that America was ſolicitous to have no more miſunderſtandings with any republic, but eſpecially with France; that ſhe wiſhed a permanent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and was ſenſible, that no treaty, could be permanent, which did not comport with the intereſts of the pacties; and therefore, that he might be aſſured, that our powers were ſuch as authorized us to place France <hi>on equal ground with England,</hi> in any reſpects in which an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might be ſuppoſed to exiſt at preſent between them, to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of France. The ſubject of the rôle d'équipage was alſo mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and we aſked what aſſurance we could have, if France inſiſted on the right of adding to the ſtipulations of our treaty, or of altering them by municipal regulations, that any future treaty, we could make, ſhould be obſerved. M. Y. ſaid that he did not aſſert the principle of changing treaties by municipal regulations; but that the Directory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered its regulation concerning the rôle d'équipage as comporting with the treaty. We obſerved to him, <hi>that none of our veſſels had what the French termed a rôle d'équipage,</hi> and that if we were to ſurrender all the property, which had been taken from our citizens, in caſes where their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034817_0012_0FFF8432275A3FD0"/>veſſels were not furniſhed with ſuch a rôle the government would be reſponſible to its citizens, for the property ſo ſurrendered; ſince it would be impoſſible to undertake to aſſert that there was any plauſibility in the allegation, that our treaty required a rôle d'équipage.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of diſavowals, &amp;c. concerning the Preſident's ſpeech was again mentioned; and it was obſerved, <hi>that the conſtitution of the United States, authorized and required our Preſident to communicate his ideas on the affairs of the nation; that, in obedience to this conſtitution, he had done ſo; that we had not power to confirm or invalidate any part of the Preſident's ſpeech:</hi> that ſuch an attempt could produce no other effect than to make us ridiculous to the government, and to the citizens at large of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States; and to produce, on the part of the Preſident, an immediate diſavowal and recal of us, as his agents: That independent of this, all America was acquainted with the facts ſtated by the Preſident; and our diſavowing them would not change the public ſentiment concerning them.</p>
               <p>We parted with mutual profeſſions of perſonal reſpect, and with full indications, on the part of M. Y. of his expectation, that we ſhould immediately receive the threatened letter.</p>
               <p>The nature of the above communication will evince the neceſſity of ſecrecy; and we have promiſed Meſſrs. X. and Y. that their <hi>names ſhall, in no event, be made public.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have the honour to be, with great reſpect and eſteem, your moſt obedient humble ſervants,</p>

                  <p>P. S. October 27th, 1797. The definitive articles of peace are ſigned between the French republic and the Emperor: The particulars you will find in the public prints. The Portugueſe miniſter is ordered to quit France, as the treaty with Portugal has not been yet ratified by the Queen. The treaty itſelf is declared by the Directory to be void. Since our arrival at Paris the tribunal of caſſation has rejected captain Scott's petition, complaining of the condemnation of his veſſel, by the civil tribunal for the want of a rôle d'équipage. Mr.—in behalf of the owners of the American veſſels, who have appealed in the laſt reſort to the tribunal of caſſation, informs, that notwithſtanding all the arguments—made uſe of—to put off the hearing of the Roſanna, as a diplomatic caſe, till the iſſue of our negociations is known, that caſe is ſet down for hearing, and will come on the 29th or 30th inſt. The ſame—alſo ſays, that it is obvious, that the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal have received inſtructions from the officers of government to haſten their deciſions, and that it was hardly worth while to—for all our petitions in caſſation would be rejected.

               <p n="1">I. With this conduct of the French government it will be proper to take into view the public audience, given to the late miniſter of the United States, on his taking leave of the Executive Directory. The ſpeech of the Preſident diſcloſes ſentiments more alarming than the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a miniſter becauſe more dangerous to our independence and union, and at the ſame time ſtudiouſly marked with indignities againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the United States, It evinces a diſpoſition to ſeparate the people of the United States from the government; to perſuade them, that they have different affections, principles and intereſts from thoſe of their fellow citizens, whom they, themſelves, have choſen to manage their common concerns; and thus to produce diviſions fatal to our peace. Such attempts ought to be repelled with a deciſſion, which ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince France, and the world, that we are not a degraded people, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated under a colonial ſenſe of fear, fitted to be the miſerable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of foreign influence, and regardleſs of national honor, character, and intereſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The diplomatic intercourſe between France and the United States, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at preſent ſuſpended, the government has no means of obtaining of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial information from that country; nevertheleſs there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Executive Directory paſſed a decree, on the 2d of March laſt, contravening in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778, injurious to our lawful commerce, and endangering the lives of our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. A copy of this decree will be laid before you.</p>
               <p n="3">III. While we are endeavouring to adjuſt our differences with France, by amicable negociation, the progreſs of the war in Europe, the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on our commerce, the perſonal injuries to our citizens, and the general complexion of affairs, render it my indiſpenſible duty to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your conſideration effectual meaſures of defence.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is impoſſible to conceal from ourſelves, or the world, what has been before obſerved, that endeavors have been employed to foſter and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a diviſion between the government and the people of the United States. To inveſtigate the cauſes which have encouraged this attempt is not neceſſary. But to repel, by decided and united councils, inſinuations ſo derogatory to the honor, and aggreſſions ſo dangerous to the conſtitution, union, and even the independence of the nation, is an indiſpenſable duty.</p>

               <p>About twelve we received another viſit from M. X. He immediately mentioned the great event announced in the papers, and then ſaid, that ſome propoſals from us had been expected on the ſubject on which we had before converſed; that the Directory were becoming impatient, and would take a decided courſe with regard to America, if we could not ſoften them. We anſwered, that on that ſubject we had already ſpoken explicitly, and had nothing further to add. He mentioned the change in the ſtate of things, which had been produced by the peace with the emperor, as warranting an expectation of a change in our ſyſtem; to which we only replied, that this event had been expected by us, and would not, in any degree affect our conduct. M. X. <hi>urged that the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory bad, ſince this peace, taken a higher and more decidea tone, with reſpect to us and all other neutral nations, than had been before taken; that it had been determined, that all nations ſhould aid them, or be conſidered and treated as their enemies.</hi> We anſwered, that ſuch an effect had already been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated by us as probable, and had not been overlooked when we gave to this propoſition our decided anſwer; and further, that we had no powers to negociate for a loan of money; that our government had not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated ſuch a circumſtance in any degree whatever; that if we ſhould ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate a loan, it would be a perfectly void thing, and would only deceive France and expoſe ourſelves. M. X. again expatiated on the power and violence of France: he urged the danger of our ſituation, and preſſed the policy of ſoftening them, and of thereby obtaining time. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent men, he ſaid, would, very probably, not continue long in power; and it would be very unfortunate, if thoſe, who might ſucceed, with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſitions towards us, ſhould find the two nations in actual war. We anſwered, that if war ſhould be made on us, by France, it would be ſo obviouſly forced on us, that on a change of men, peace might be made with as much facility as the preſent differences could be accommodated: we added, that all America deprecated a war with France; but that our preſent ſituation was more ruinous to us than a declared war could he; that at preſent our commerce was plundered unprotected; but that if war was declared, we ſhould ſeek the means of protection. M. X. ſaid, he hoped we ſhould not form a connection with Britain; and we anſwered, that we hoped ſo too; that we had all been engaged in our revolution war, and felt its injuries; that it had made the deepeſt impreſſion on us; but that if France ſhould attack us, we muſt ſeek the beſt means of ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034817_0016_0FFF840C05129968"/>M. X. again returned to the ſubject of money: ſaid he, <hi>gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you do not speak to the point; it is money:</hi> it is expected that you will offer money. We ſaid, that we had ſpoken to that point very expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly: we had given an anſwer. No, ſaid he, you have not; what is your anſwer? We replied; IT IS NO; NO; NOT A SIXPENCE. He again called our attention to the dangers which threatened our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and aſked, if it would not be prudent, though we might not make a loan to the nation, to intereſt an influential friend in our favor. He ſaid, <hi>we ought to conſider what men we had to treat with; that they diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the juſtice of our claims, and the reaſoning with which we might ſupport them; that they diſregarded their own colonies; and conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as perfectly invulnerable with reſpect to us; that we could only acquire an intereſt among them by a judicious application of money; and it was for us to conſider whether the ſituation of our country did not require that the means ſhould be reſorted to.</hi> We obſerved, that the conduct of the French government was ſuch, as to leave us much reaſon to fear, that ſhould we give the money, it would effect no good purpoſe, and would not produce a juſt mode of thinking with reſpect to us. Proof of this muſt firſt be given us. He ſaid, that when we employed a lawyer we gave him a fee, without knowing whether the cauſe would be gained or not; but it was neceſſary to have one, and we paid for his ſervices, whether thoſe ſervices were ſucceſsful or not: ſo in the preſent ſtate of things, the money muſt be advanced for the good offices the individuals were to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whatever might be the effect of thoſe good offices. We told him there was no parallel in the caſes; that a lawyer not being to render the judgment, could not command ſucceſs: he could only endeavor to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; and conſequently we could only pay him for his endeavors: but the Directory could decide on the iſſue of our negociation. It had only to order that no more American veſſels ſhould be ſeized, and to direct thoſe now in cuſtody to be reſtored, and there could be no oppoſition to the order. He ſaid, that all the members of the Directory were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive our money: that MERLIN, for inſtance, was paid from <hi>another quarter,</hi> and would touch no part of the douceur which was to come from us. We replied, that we had underſtood that Merlin was paid by the owners of the privateers; and he nodded an aſſent to the fact. He proceeded to preſs this ſubject with vaſt perſeverance. He told us that we paid money to obtain peace with the Algerines, and with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; <hi>and that it was doing no more to pay France for peace.</hi> To this it was anſwered, that when our government commenced a treaty with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Algiers, or the Indian tribes, it was underſtood that money was to form the baſis of the treaty, and was its eſſential article; that the whole nation knew it, and was prepared to expect it as a thing of courſe; but that in treating with France, our government had ſuppoſed that a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſuch as he ſpoke of, would, <hi>if made by us,</hi> give mortal offence. He aſked if our government did not know, that nothing was to be obtained here without money? We replied, that our government had not even ſuſpected ſuch a ſtate of things. He appeared ſurpriſed at it, and ſaid,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034817_0017_0FFF843C6AED4DB8"/>there was not an American, in Paris, who could not have given that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. We told him that the letters of our miniſter had indicated a very contrary temper in the government of France; and had repreſented it as acting entirely upon principle, and as feeling a very pure and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted affection for America. <hi>He looked ſomewhat ſurpriſed,</hi> and ſaid briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to General Pinckney: well ſir, you have been a long time in France, and in Holland; what do you think of it? General Pinckney anſwered, that he conſidered M. X. and M. Y. as men of truth, and of conſequence he could have but one opinion on the ſubject. He ſtated, that Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and other ſtates of Europe were obliged to buy a peace; and that it would be equally for our intereſt to do ſo. Once more he ſpoke of the danger of a breach with France, and of her power which nothing could reſiſt. We told him that it would be in vain for us to deny her power, or the ſolicitude we felt to avoid a conteſt with it; that no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eſtimated her power more highly than America, or wiſhed more to be on amicable terms with her; but that one object was ſtill dearer to us than the friendſhip of France, <hi>which was our national independence;</hi> that America had taken a neutral ſtation; ſhe had a right to take it; no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had a right to force us out of it; that to lend a ſum of money to a belligerent power, abounding in every thing requiſite for war, but money, was to relinquiſh our neutrality, and take part in the war; to lend this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney under the laſh and coercion of France, was to relinquiſh the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ourſelves, and to ſubmit to a foreign government, impoſed upon us by force; <hi>that we would make at leaſt one manly ſtruggle before we thus ſurrendered our national independence;</hi> that our caſe was different from that of one of the minor nations of Europe; they were unable to maintain their independence, and did not expect to do ſo: America was a great, and, ſo far as concerned her ſelf-defence, a powerful nation; ſhe was able to maintain her independence; and muſt deſerve to loſe it, if ſhe permitted it to be wreſted from her; that France and Britain had been at war for near fifty years of the laſt hundred, and might probably be at war for fifty years of the centuty to come; that America had no motives which could induce her to involve herſelf in thoſe wars; and that if ſhe now preſerved her neutrality, and her independence, it was moſt probable that ſhe would not in future be afraid, as ſhe had been for four years paſt; but if ſhe now ſurrendered her rights of ſelf government to France, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to be torn from her, ſhe could not expect to recover them, or to remain neutral in any future war. He ſaid that France had lent us money during our revolution war, and only required that we ſhould now exhibit the ſame friendſhip for her. We anſwered, that the caſes were very different; that America ſolicited a loan from France, and left her at liberty to grant or refuſe it; but that France <hi>demanded it from America.</hi> And left us no choice on the ſubject. We alſo told him there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference in the caſes; that the money was lent by France for great national and French objects; it was lent to maim a rival and an enemy whom ſhe hated; that the money, if lent by America, would not be for any American objects, but to enable France to extend ſtill further her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. The converſation continued for nearly two hours; and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034817_0018_0FFF84419C1D6340"/>and private advance of money was preſſed and repreſſed in a variety of forms. At length M. X. ſaid, that he did not blame us; that our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was certainly proper, if we could keep it: But he ſhewed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly his opinion to be that we could not keep it. He ſaid, that he would communicate, as nearly as he could, our converſation to the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to M. Y. to be given by him to the miniſter; we are not certain which. We then ſeperated. On the 22d of October, M. Z. a French gentleman of reſpectable character, informed Mr. Gerry, that M. Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyrand, miniſter of foreign relations, profeſſed to be well diſpoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the United States, had expected to have ſeen the American miniſters frequently in their private capacities; and to have conferred with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually on the objects of their miſſion; and had authorized M. Z. to make this communication to Mr. Gerry. The latter ſent for his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues; and a conferrence was held with M. Z. on the ſubject; in which General Pinckney and General Marſhall expreſſed their opinions, that not being acquainted with M. Talleyrand, they could not, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety call on him; but that according to the cuſtom of France he might expect this of Mr. Gerry, from a previous acquaintance in America. This Mr. Gerry reluctantly complied with on the 23d, and with M. Z. called on M. Talleyrand, who, not being then at his office, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 28th for the interview. After the firſt introduction, M. Talleyrand began the conferrence. He ſaid, that the Directory had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an arrete, which he offered for peruſal, in which they had demanded of the envoys an explanation of ſome parts, and a reparation for others, of the Preſident's ſpeech to Congreſs of the 16th of May laſt: he was ſenſible, he ſaid, that difficulties would exiſt on the part of the envoys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to this demand; but that by their offering money, he thought he could prevent the effect of the arrete. M. Z. at the requeſt of Mr. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, having ſtated that the envoys have no ſuch powers; M. Talleyrand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, they can, in ſuch caſe, take a power on themſelves; and propoſed that they ſhould make a loan. Mr. Gerry then addreſſed M. Talleyrand, diſtinctly, in Engliſh, which he ſaid he underſtood, and ſtated, that the uneaſineſs of the Directory, reſulting from the Preſident's ſpeech, was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unconnected with the objects of the miſſion; that M. Barras, in his ſpeech to Mr. Monroe, on his recall, had expreſſed himſelf in a manner diſpleaſing to the government and citizens of the United States; that the Preſident, as the envoys conceived, had made ſuch obſervations on M. Barras' ſpeech as were neceſſary to vindicate the honor of the United States; that this was not conſidered by our government as a ſubject of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between the two nations; that having no inſtructions reſpecting it, we could not make any explanations, or reparations, relating to it, and that M. Talleyrand, himſelf, was ſufficiently acquainted with the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States to be convinced of the truth of theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Mr. Gerry further ſtated, that the powers of the envoys, as they conceived, were adequate to the diſcuſſion and adjuſtment of all points of real difference between the two nations; that they could alter and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the treaty; or, if neceſſary, form a new one; that the United
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034817_0019_0FFF844420E4AF50"/>States were anxiouſly deſirous of removing all cauſes of complaint between themſelves and France, and of renewing their former friendſhip and intercourſe, on terms which ſhould be mutually honorable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the two nations; but not on any other terms; that as to a loan, we had no powers whatever to make one; that if we were to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, we ſhould deceive himſelf, and the Directory likewiſe, which as men of honor we could not do; but that we could ſend one of our number for inſtructions on this propoſition, if deemed expedient, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the other objects of the negociation could be diſcuſſed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted; that as he had expreſſed a deſire to confer with the envoys indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, it was the wiſh of Mr. Gerry that ſuch a conference ſhould take place, and their opinions thus be aſcertained, which he conceived, correſponded with his own in the particulars mentioned. M. Talleyrand, in anſwer, ſaid, he ſhould be glad to confer with the other envoys, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually; but that this matter, about <hi>the money,</hi> muſt be ſettled directly, <hi>without ſending to America;</hi> that he would not communicate the arrete for a week; and that if we could adjuſt the difficulty reſpecting the ſpeech, an application would, nevertheleſs, go to the United States for a loan. A courier arriving, at this moment, from Italy, and M. Talleyrand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing impatient to read the letters, Mr. Gerry took leave of him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. He followed to the door, and deſired M. Z. to repeat to Mr. Gerry what he, M. Tallyrand, had ſaid to him. Mr. Gerry then returned to his quarters with M. Z. took down the particulars of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, as before ſtated, ſent for Generals Pinckney and Marſhall, and read it to them in the preſence of M. Z. who confirmed it. Generals Pinckney and Marſhall then deſired M. Z. to inform M. Talleyrand, that they had nothing to add to this conferrence, and did not wiſh that the arrete might be delayed on their account.</p>

               <p>M. X. again called on us. He ſaid, M. Talleyrand was extremely anxious to be of ſervice to us, and had requeſted, that one more effort ſhould be made to induce us to enable him to be ſo. A great deal of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which had paſſed at our former interviews, was repeated. The power and the haughtineſs of France was again diſplayed to us. We were told, that the deſtruction of England was inevitable; and that the wealth and arts of that nation, would naturally paſs over to America, if that event ſhould find us in peace. To this obſervation, we replied, that France would probably forbid America to receive them, in like manner as ſhe had forbid Switzerland to permit the reſidence, in its country, of a Britiſh miniſter. We told him, alſo, that we were ſenſible of the value of peace, and therefore ſought it unremittingly, but that it was real peace we ſought for, and real peace only which could be deſirable.</p>
               <p>The ſum of his propoſition was, that if we would pay, by way of fees (that was his expreſſion) the ſum of money demanded for private uſe, the Directory would not receive us! but would permit us to remain in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, as we now were; and we ſhould be received by M. Talleyrand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til one of us could go to America, and conſult our government on the ſubject of the loan. Theſe were the circumſtances, he ſaid, under which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034817_0020_0FFF8436F8B72658"/>the miniſter of Portugal had treated. We aſked him if, in the mean time, the Directory would order the American property, not yet paſſed into the hands of the privateerſmen, to be reſtored? <hi>He said, explicitly, that they would not.</hi> We aſked him, whether they would ſuſpend further depredations on our commerce? <hi>He said they would not:</hi> but M. Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyrand obſerved, that on this ſubject we could not ſuſtain much addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al injury, becauſe the winter ſeaſon was approaching, when few addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional captures could be made. We told him, that France had taken violently, from America, more than <hi>fifteen millions of dollars,</hi> and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, in every reſpect, as enemies, in return for the friendſhip we had manifeſted for her; that we had come to endeavor to reſtore harmony to the two nations, and to obtain compenſation for the injuries our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had ſuſtained; and that in lieu of this compenſation, we were told, that if we would pay twelve hundred thouſand livres, we might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to remain in Paris; which would only give us the benefit of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plays and operas of Paris, for the winter, that we might have time to aſk from our country <hi>to exhaust her resources</hi> for France, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations would be continued. He again ſtated, that by this procedure we ſhould ſuſpend a war; and that, perhaps, in five or ſix months power might change hands.</p>
               <p>We told him, that what we wiſhed to ſee in France, was a temper ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely friendly to the United States, and really diſpoſed to do us juſtice; that if could perceive this, we might not ſo much regard a little money, ſuch as he ſtated to be uſual, although we ſhould hazard ourſelves by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; but that we ſaw only evidences of the moſt extreme hoſtility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us: war was made upon us ſo far as France could make it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things; and it was not even propoſed, <hi>that on receiving our money,</hi> this war ſhould ceaſe: We had no reaſon to believe, that a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit could reſult from it; and we deſired him to ſay, that <hi>we would not give a ſhilling,</hi> unleſs American property, unjuſtly captured, was previouſly reſtored, and further hoſtilities ſuſpended; and that unleſs this was done, we did not conceive that we could conſult our government concerning a loan; that if the Directory would receive us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence negociations, and any thing occurred, which rendered a conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the government neceſſary, one of us would return to America for that purpoſe. <hi>He said, that without this money, we ſhould be obliged to quit Paris,</hi> and that we ought to conſider the conſequences: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Americans would be confiſcated, and their veſſels, in port, embargoed. We told him, that unleſs there was a hope of a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe evils could not be prevented by us; and the little delay we might obtain would only encreaſe them; that our miſſion had induced many of our countrymen to truſt their veſſels into the ports of France, and that if we remained in Paris, that very circumſtance would increaſe the number; and conſequently the injury, which our countrymen would ſuſtain, if France could permit herſelf ſo to violate her own engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the laws of nations. He expreſſed a wiſh, <hi>that M. Y. ſhould see us once more.</hi> We told him, that a viſit from M. Y. as a private gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, would always be agreeable to us: but if he came only with the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034817_0021_0FFF8445C8522080"/>expectation that we ſhould ſtipulate advances of money, without previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly eſtabliſhing a ſolid and permanent reconciliation, he might ſave himſelf the trouble of the application, becauſe it was a ſubject we had conſidered maturely, and on which we were immoveable. He parted with us, ſaying, if that was the caſe, it would not be worth while for M. Y. to come. In the evening, while Gen. Pinckney and Gen. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall were abſent, M. Y. and M. X. called, and were invited by Mr. Gerry to breakfaſt with us the next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> 30th.</p>
               <p>Immediately after breakfaſt, the ſubject was reſumed. M. Y. ſpoke without interruption for near an hour. He ſaid, that he was deſiours of making a laſt effort to ſerve us, by propoſing ſomething which might accommodate the differences between the two nations; that what he was now about to mention, had not, by any means, the approbation of the Directory; nor could M. Talleyrand undertake further than to make from us the propoſition to the Directory, and uſe his influence for its ſucceſs; that laſt week, M. Talleyrand could not have ventured to have offered ſuch propoſitions; but that his ſituation had been very material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed by the peace with the Emperor: by that peace he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in an high degree, the confidence of the Directory, and now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed great influence with that body; that he was alſo cloſely connected with Buonaparte, and the generals of the army, in Italy; and was to be confidered as firmly fixed in his poſt, at leaſt for five or ſix months: That under theſe circumſtances, he could undertake to offer, in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, propoſitions, which, before this increaſe of influence, he could not have hazarded. M. Y. then called our attention to our own ſituation, and to the force France was capable of bringing to bear upon us. He ſaid, that we were the beſt judges of our capacity to reſiſt, ſo far as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on our own reſources, and ought not to deceive ourſelves on ſo intereſting a ſubject. <hi>The fate of Venice was one which might befal the United States.</hi> But he proceeded to obſerve, it was probable, we might rely on forming a league with England. If we had ſuch a reliance it would fail us. The ſituation of England was ſuch, as to compel Pitt to make peace on the terms of France. A variety of cauſes were in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which made ſuch an effect abſolutely certain. To ſay nothing of the oppoſition in England to the miniſter, and to the war; an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which the fears of the nation would increaſe; to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a war againſt England, which was preparing in the north; an army of one hundred and fifty thouſand men, under the command of Buonaparte, ſpread upon the coaſt of France, and aided by all the vaſt reſources of his genius, would moſt probably be enabled to invade Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; in which event their government would be overturned; but ſhould this invaſion not be abſolutely effected, yet the alarm it would ſpread through the nation, the enormous expence it muſt produce, would infallibly ruin them, if it was to be continued; and would drive them to ſave themſelves by a peace: That independent of this, France poſſeſſed means which would infallibly deſtroy their bank and their
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034817_0022_0FFF844B9D067F08"/>whole paper ſyſtem. He ſaid, he knew very well it was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that Buonaparte would leave Italy, and the army which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered under him, and which adored him: He aſſured [us that] nothing could be more unfounded than the conjecture; that Buonaparte had for more than ten days left Italy for Raſtadt, to preſide over the congreſs, which was formed for adjuſting the affairs of the empire. He ſaid, that Pitt himſelf was ſo confident of the abſolute neceſſity of peace, that after the naval victory over the Dutch, he had ſignified his readineſs to treat on the ſame terms he had offered before that action: We could not then rely on the aſſiſtance of England. <hi>What, he aſked, would be our ſituation, if peace ſhould be made with England before our difference with France would be accommodated?</hi> But, he continued, if even England ſhould be able to continue the war, and America ſhould unite with her, it would not be in our power to injure France. We might, indeed, wound her ally; but if we did, it would be ſo much the worſe for us. After having ſtated the dangers attending us, if we ſhould engage in the war, he proceeded to the advantages we might derive from a neutral ſituation: And inſiſted, at large, on the wealth which would naturally flow into our country from the deſtruction of England. He next proceeded to detail the propoſitions which are in ſubſtance in the paper annexed, marked (A.) except, that he inſiſted, that we ſhould engage to uſe our influence with our government for the loan. He ſtated, expreſſly, that the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were to be conſidered as made by us; that M. Talleyrand would not be reſponſible for the ſucceſs of any one of them; he would only undertake to uſe his influence with the Directory in ſupport of them. The propoſition, he ſaid, concerning a <hi>suspension of hostilities</hi> on the part of France, was one which proceeded entirely from himſelf; M. Talley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand had not been conſulted upon it; and he could not undertake to ſay that that gentleman would conſent even to lay it before the Directory. The propoſition for an advance to the government of France, of as much money as was due from it to our citizens on contract, and as might be determined to be due for veſſels improperly captured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, was, he ſaid, indiſpenſible: unleſs we made that, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to make any other; for the others would not be received. He expatiated on the vaſt advantages we ſhould derive from delay; it was, he ſaid, abſolutely to gain our cauſe. He returned to the danger of our ſituation, and the policy of making with France any accommodation which France would aſſent to. <hi>Perhaps, said he, you believe, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning and exposing to your countrymen the unreasonableness of the demands of this government, you will unite them in their resitance to those demands: You are mistaken: You ought to know that the diplomatic skill of France, and the means she possesses in your country, are sufficient to enable her,</hi> WITH THE FRENCH PARTY; IN AMERICA, <hi>to throw the blame, which will attend the rupture of the negociations! on the Federalists, as you term your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but on the British party, as France terms you: and you may assure yourselves this will be done.</hi> He concluded with declarations of being perfectly diſintereſted; and declared, that his only motives for ſpeaking thus freely, were his friendſhip for M. Talleyrand, and his wife to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034817_0023_0FFF844D348052A8"/>the intereſts and peace of the United States. We told him, that the freedom with which he had ſpoken, and which was agreeable to us, would induce us to ſpeak freely alſo; and for once to accompany our view of the preſent ſtate of things, with a retroſpect of the paſt: <hi>that America was the only nation upon earth, which felt, and had exhibited a real friendſhip for the Republic of France:</hi> that among the empires round her, which were compelled to bend beneath her power, and to obey her commands, there was not one which had voluntarily acknowledged her government, or manifeſted for it, ſpontaneouſly, any mark of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: America, alone, had ſtepped forward, and given the moſt une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal proofs of a pure and ſincere friendſhip, at a time when almoſt the whole European world, when Auſtria, Germany, Pruſſia, Ruſſia, Spain, Sardinia, Holland, and Britain, were leagued againſt France: when her ſituation was, in truth, hazardous, and it was dangerous to hold even friendly intercourſe with her, America alone ſtood forward, and openly, and boldly avowed her enthuſiaſm in favor of the Republic, and her deep and ſincere intereſt in its fate.—From that time to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the government and people of the United States have uniformly manifeſted a ſincere and ardent friendſhip for France, and have, as they conceive, in no ſingle inſtance, given to this Republic juſt cauſe of umbrage: <hi>if they have done so they wiſh it to be pointed out to them,</hi> After the determination of France to break off all regular intercourſe with them, they have ſent three envoys extraordinary, to endeavor to make ſuch explanations, as might produce reconciliation: theſe envoys are prepared to inveſtigate, and wiſh to inveſtigate any meaſures which may have given offence; and are perſuaded that they can entirely juſtify the conduct of their government. To this diſtant, unoffending, friendly republic, what is the conduct and the language of France? <hi>Wherever our property can be found, ſhe seizes and takes it from us; unprovoked ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to treat us as enemies, and our making no reſiſtance produces no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of hostility against us; ſhe abuses and insults our government, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to weaken it in the estimation of the people, recals her own minister, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to receive ours, and when extraordinary means are taken to make such explanations, as may do away misunderstandings, and such alterations in the existing relations of the two countries, as may be mutually satisfactory, and may tend to produce harmony, the envoys who bear these powers are not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they are not permitted to utter the amicable wiſhes of their country; but in the haughty stile of</hi> a MASTER, <hi>they are told, that unless they will pay a sum, to which their resources scarcely extend, that they may expect the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of France, and like Venice be erased from the list of nations; that France will annihilate the only free republic upon earth, and the only nation in the universe, which has voluntarily manifested for her a cordial and real friendſhip!</hi> What impreſſion muſt this make on the mind of America, if without provocation France was determined to make war upon us, unleſs we purchaſed peace? We could not eaſily believe, that even our <hi>money</hi> would ſave us; our <hi>independence</hi> would never ceaſe to give offence, and would always furniſh a pretext for <hi>freſh demands.</hi> On the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of neutrality, it was unneceſſary to ſay any thing: all the efforts of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034817_0024_0FFF840E4E0E1560"/>our government were exerted to maintain it; and we would never wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly part with it. With reſpect to a political connexion with Britain, we told him, that America had never contemplated it. Whether the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he repreſented that government to be in, was, or was not, real, we ſhould not undertake to decide: Britain, we believed, had much reaſon to wiſh for peace; and France had much reaſon to wiſh for peace alſo: if peace already exiſted, it would not change the courſe America would purſue. M. Y. manifeſted the moſt exceſſive impatience: he interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and ſaid, this eloquent diſſertation might be true: <hi>America might have manifested, and he believed had manifested, great friendſhip for France, and had just complaints against her; but he did not come to listen to those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints</hi> The miniſter would, on our requeſt, make for us certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to the Directory: he had ſtated them to us: and all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he wiſhed was, yes or no: did we, or did we not, ſolicit the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to make the propoſitions for us? We told him, that without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further into the diſcuſſion, we choſe to remark one or two things: they were, that the exiſting treaties gave to France certain advantages, which were very eſſential; that eſpecially the American coaſt afforded a protection, near two thouſand miles in extent, to the prizes made by France on her enemies, and refuſed that protection to the prizes taken from her: that ſhe might be aſſured, that in caſe of war, theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages would be loſt forever. We alſo told him, we were convinced, that France miſcalculated on the parties in America: <hi>that the extreme injuſtice offered to our country, would unite every man against her.</hi> M. X. informed us, that M. Talleyrand would not conſent even to lay this propoſition before the Directory, without previouſly receiving the <hi>fifty thousand pounds,</hi> or the greater part of it. M. Y. left, in writing, his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and e wreturned the anſwer annexed, and marked (B.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> 1ſt.</p>
               <p>It was, at length, agreed, that we would hold no more indirect inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> 3d.</p>
               <p>M. X. called on us, and told General Pinckney and General Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall (Mr. Gerry not being within) that M. Y. wiſhed once more to ſee us. We anſwered, that we ſhould at any time, be glad to ſee M. Y. as a private gentleman: But that if his object was only to repeat his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for money, it was perfectly unneceſſary to do ſo; becauſe on that ſubject it was impoſſible for us to change the anſwer we had already given. We told him further, that we conſidered it as degrading our country to carry on further ſuch an indirect intercourſe, as we had for ſome time ſubmitted to, and had determined to receive no propoſition, unleſs the perſons who bore them had acknowledged authority to treat with us. He ſaid that perhaps M. Y. might have written powers from the miniſter; and we replied, that if he had, we ſhould receive his communications with pleaſure. He ſpoke of a probable peace with England, and, having requeſted us to be at home in the afternoon, leſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:034817_0025_0FFF84477A8E4BA0"/>
About three o'clock he came, and after ſome converſation, in which we repeated in ſubſtance what is ſtated above, he ſhewed us a paper, which he ſaid, was a copy of a letter prepared for us, by M. Talleyrand, requeſting an explanation of part of the Preſident's ſpeech, and which he ſaid would he ſent, unleſs we came into the propoſitions which had been made us. We wiſhed to take a copy of it, which he declined permitting, ſaying, he was forbidden to allow it. We ſpoke of the letter coming to us as a meaſure we had no expectation of preventing; and he ſaid he could not underſtand that we wiſhed it delayed. To which we anſwered, that the delay of a few days, could not be deſired, unleſs a hope exiſted that the Directory might become more friendly to our country. <hi>He said, that intelligence had been received from the United States, that if Colonel Burr, and Mr. Madison, had conſtituted the mission, the differences between the two nations would have been accommodated before this time.</hi> He added, as a fact, he was not inſtructed to communicate, that M. Talleyrand was preparing a memorial to be ſent out to the United States, <hi>complaining of us, as being unfriendly to as accommodation with France.</hi> We replied to this intelligence from the United States, that the Miniſter's correſpondence, in America, took a good deal on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they undertook to ſay how the Directory would have received Colonel Burr and Mr. Madiſon; and that with reſpect to the memorial of M. Talleyrand, it would not be eaſy for him to convince our countrymen, that the ſtatements, we ſhould make, were untrue; if, however, we were confident that our conduct would be condemned, M. Talleyrand might be aſſured, that the fear of cenſure <hi>would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to deserve it:</hi> But that we ſhould act in a manner which our own judgments and conſciencies would approve of, and we truſted, we ſhould be ſupported by the great body of candid and honeſt men. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation we again ſtated, that America had taken a neutral poſition; that ſhe had faithfully ſought to preſerve it; that a loan of money, to one of the belligerent powers, was directly to take part in the war; and that to take part in the war, againſt her own judgment and will, under the coercion of France, <hi>was to ſurrender our independence.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. The American Envoys ſhall remain here for ſix months, in the ſame manner and upon the ſame footing, with regard to etiquette, as did M. d'Aranjo, the envoy of Portugal.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There ſhall be named a commiſſion of five members, agreeably to a form to be eſtabliſhed, for the purpoſe of deciding upon the reclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Americans, relative to the prizes made on them by the French privateers.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The American envoys will engage, that their government ſhall pay
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034817_0026_0FFF8450F7739268"/>the indemnifications, or the amount of the ſums already decreed, to the American creditors of the French republic, and thoſe which ſhall be adjudged to the claimants, by the commiſſioners. This payment ſhall be made under the name of an advance to the French republic, who ſhall repay it in a time and manner to be agreed upon.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. One of the American envoys ſhall return to America, to demand of his government the neceſſary powers to purchaſe, for caſh, the thirty-two millions of Dutch reſcriptions, belonging to the French republic, in caſe the envoys ſhould conclude a treaty, which ſhall be approved by the two nations.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In the interval, the definitive treaty ſhall proceed for the termination of all differences exiſting between the French republic and the United States, ſo as that the treaty may be concluded immediately on the return of the deputy.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The queſtion of the rôle d'équipage ſhall remain ſuſpended until the return of the deputy, and the commiſſion ſhall not pronounce upon any reclamation where this point ſhall be in queſtion</p>

                  <hi>EXHIBIT B.</hi> [Received with the Envoys' Letter, No. <hi>II,</hi> dated <hi>8th</hi> November, <hi>1797.</hi>]</head>
               <p>The envoys extraordinary and miniſters plenipotentiary of the United States, cannot avoid obſerving the very unuſual ſituation in which they are placed, by the manner in which they are alone permitted to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications on the objects of their miſſion: They are called upon to pledge their country, to a very great amount, to anſwer demands which appear to them as extraordinary, as they were unexpected, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to diſcuſs the reaſon, the juſtice, or the policy on which thoſe demands are founded, and not only without aſſurances that the rights of the United States, will in future be reſpected; but without a document to prove that thoſe to whom they are required to open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without reſerve, and at whoſe inſtance they are called on to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſo much, are empowered, even by the miniſter, to hold any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with them: Yet ſuch is the anxious and real ſolicitude of the envoys, to ſeize any occaſion which may afford a hope, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, of coming to thoſe explanations, which they ſo much wiſh to make
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034817_0027_0FFF845678A217B8"/>with this republic, that they paſs over the uncommon and informal modes which have been adopted, and will only conſider the propoſitions themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The miniſters of the United States, will permit no perſonal conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to influence their negociations with the French republic. Altho' they expected that the extraordinary means adopted by their government to reconcile itſelf to that of France, would have been received with ſome degree of attention, yet they are too ſolicitous to enter upon the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and intereſting duty of their miſſion, to permit themſelves to be reſtrained by forms, or etiquette.</p>
               <p n="2">II. On this article, it is believed, there can be no diſagreement.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This article, as explained, would oblige the United States to advance, not to their own citizens, but to the government of France, ſums equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the depredations made by the corſairs of the Republic, on the American commerce, and to the contracts made with their citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, by France; and this advance, inſtead of benefiting the citizens of the United States, would leave them preciſely, what they now are, the creditors of the French republic: The more extenſive the depredations, and the more conſiderable the contracts uncomplied with, the more would the government of France receive from the United States. Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of theſe objections, the miniſters of the United States cannot engage to aſſume, in any form, the debts due from France to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens: they have no ſuch power.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If the negociations be opened, and the propoſitions for a loan, or any other propoſitions, exceeding the powers of the miniſters, be made, the government of the United States will be conſulted thereon with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This, or any propoſition having for its object the claims of the two nations on each other, or an accommodation of differences, will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with ardour by the miniſters of the United States.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>On the 11th inſtant we tranſmitted the following official letter to the miniſter of foreign affairs:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>CITIZEN MINISTER,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>"The underſigned Envoys Extraordinary, and Miniſters Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary of the United States of America to the French Republic, had the honor of announcing to you, officially, on the ſixth of October, their arrival at Paris, and of preſenting to you, on the 8th, a copy of their letters of credence. Your declaration, at that time, that a report on A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican affairs, was then preparing, and would, in a few days, be laid before the Directory, whoſe deciſion thereon ſhould, without delay, be made known, has hitherto impoſed ſilence on them. For this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication they have waited with that anxious ſolicitude, which ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting an event could not fail to excite, and with that reſpect which is due to the government of France. They have not yet received it, and ſo much time has been permitted to elapſe, ſo critical is the ſituation of many of their countrymen, and ſo embarraſſing is that of the underſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both as it reſpects themſelves and the government they repreſent, that they can no longer diſpenſe with the duty of ſoliciting your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their miſſion.</p>
                     <p>"The United States, Citizen Miniſter, at an epoch, which evinced their ſincerity, have given inconteſtible proofs of their ardent friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, of their affection for the French Republic: theſe were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, not of her unparalleled proweſs and power, but of <hi>their confidence in her juſtice and magnanimity;</hi> and in ſuch high eſtimation was the <hi>recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of her friendſhip held by them, as to have been a primary object of national concern. The preſervation of it was dear to them, the loſs of it a ſubject of unfeigned regret, and the recovery of it, by every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which ſhall conſiſt with the rights of an independent nation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages their conſtant attention. The government of the United States, we are authorized to declare, has examined, with the moſt ſcrupulous juſtice, its conduct towards its former friend. It has been led to this by a ſincere deſire to remove, of itſelf, every juſt cauſe of complaint; conceiving that, with the moſt upright intentions, ſuch cauſe may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably exiſt; and although the ſtricteſt ſearch has produced no ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, although the government is conſcious, that it has uniformly ſought to preſerve, with fidelity, its engagements to France, yet far
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034817_0029_0FFF845FE8C67DE8"/>from wiſhing to exerciſe the privilege of judging for itſelf, on its own courſe of reaſoning, and the lights in its own poſſeſſion, <hi>it invites fair and candid discuſſion; it solicits a reconſideration of the paſt; it is persuaded, its intentions, its views, and its actions muſt have been misrepresented and misunderſtood;</hi> it is convinced, that the eſſential intereſts of both nations will be promoted by reconciliation and peace, and it cheriſhes the hope of meeting with ſimilar diſpoſitions on the part of the Directory.</p>
                     <p>"Guided by theſe ſentiments, the Preſident of the United States has given it in charge to the underſigned, to ſtate to the Executive Directory, the deep regret which he feels at the loſs, or ſuſpenſion, of the harmony and friendly intercourſe, which ſubſiſted between the two republics, and his ſincere wiſh to reſtore them; to diſcuſs candidly the complaints of France, and to offer frankly thoſe of the United States; <hi>and he has authorized a review of exiſting treaties, and such alterations thereof, as ſhall conſiſt with the mutual intereſt and satisfaction of the contracting parties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"This taſk, the underſigned are anxious to commence; and truly happy will they be, if their exertions can, in any degree, contribute to reſtore that friendſhip, that mutual interchange of good offices, which it is alike their wiſh, and their duty to effect between the citizens of the two republics.</p>
                     <p>"The underſigned pray you, Citizen Miniſter, to preſent this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to the Executive Directory, and to receive the aſſurances of their moſt perfect conſideration.</p>

We have not, however, hitherto received any official inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation relative to this buſineſs: we are not yet received; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of our veſſels, for the want of a role d'equipage is unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly continued. <hi>Frequent and urgent attempts have been made to inveigle us again into negociation with persons not officially authorized, of which the obtaining of</hi> MONEY <hi>is the baſis;</hi> but we have perſiſted in declining to have any further communication, relative to diplomatic buſineſs, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that deſcription; and we mean to adhere to this determination.

                  <hi>EXHIBIT A.</hi> [Enclosed in the Envoys' Letter, No. <hi>4.</hi>]</head>
               <p>On the 14th of December, M. X. called on me, in order, as he ſaid, to gain ſome information, relative to ſome lands in ... purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ..... for whom .... Soon afterwards Gen. Marſhall came in, and then Mr. Gerry's carriage drove into the yard. Here's Mr. Gerry, ſaid General Marſhall. I am glad of it ſaid M. X. for I wiſhed to meet all of you, gentlemen, to inform you that M. Y. had another meſſage to you from M. Talleyrand. I immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my ſurpriſe at it, as M. Talleyrand, M. Y. and he, all knew our determination to have no farther communication on the ſubject of our miſſion, with perſons not officially authorized. He replied, <hi>that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination was made ſix weeks ago; it was presumed that we had changed our opinion.</hi> I ſaid that I had not; and I did not believe my colleagues had. At that moment Mr. Gerry entered the room, and I privately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the object of M. X.'s viſit. General Marſhall, Mr. Gerry, and myſelf, then withdrew into another room; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed to adhere to our former reſolution. M. X. was then called in: when I acquainted him, in a few words, with our determination; <hi>and Mr. Gerry expatiated, more at large, on the propriety of our acting in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034817_0031_0FFF845367259F28"/>this manner, and on the very unprecedented way in which we had been treated, ſince our arrival.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the twentieth of December, a lady, who is well acquainted with M. Talleyrand, expreſſed to me her concern, that we were ſtill in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled a ſituation: but, adds ſhe, why will not you lend us money? If you would make us a loan, all matters would be adjuſted; and, ſhe added, when you were contending for your revolution, we lent you money. I mentioned the very great difference there was between the ſituation of the two countries, at that period, and the preſent; and the very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent circumſtances under which the loan was made us, and the loan that was now <hi>demanded</hi> from us. She replied, we do not <hi>make a demand;</hi> we think it more delicate that <hi>the offer ſhould come from you:</hi> but M. Talleyrand has mentioned to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> (who and ſurely not in his confidence) the neceſſity of your making a loan: And I know that he has mentioned it to two or three others; and that you have been informed of it: and I will aſſure you, that if you remain here ſix months longer you would not advance a ſingle ſtop further in your negociations, without a loan. If that is the caſe, I replied, we may as well go away now. Why, that poſſibly, ſaid ſhe, might lead to a rupture, which you had better avoid: <hi>for we know we have a very conſiderable party in America who are ſtrongly in our intereſt.</hi>—There is no occaſion to enter into a further detail of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. I have only noted this part of it, as expreſſive of what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (as far as it relates to the loan and party in America, in their favor) to be the ſentiments of the French government with regard to us.</p>

               <head type="sub">Extract from General Marſhall's Journal.</head>
               <p>December 17th, 1797. I ſtepped into Mr. Gerry's appartment, where I ſaw M. Y. He expreſſed his regret at having been diſabled to dine with us at M. de Beaumarchais, by an inveterate tooth ache. He then aſked me whether I had ſeen M. Beaumarchais lately? I told him, not ſince he dined with us; and that he had left us, much indiſpoſed. He then obſerved, that he had not known, until lately, that I was the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for that gentleman in his cauſe againſt the ſtate of Virginia; and that M. de Beaumarchais, in conſequence of that circumſtance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſentiments of a very high regard for me, I replied, that M. de Beaumarchais' cauſe was of great magnitude, very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain iſſue.—and conſequently that a portion of the intereſt be felt in it would, very naturally, be transferred to his advocate. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſaid (low and apart) that M. de Beaumarchais had conſented, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his claim could be eſtabliſhed, to ſacrifice fifty thouſand pounds ſterling of it, as the private gratification which had been required of us: ſo that the gratification might be made without any actual loſs to the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034817_0032_0FFF8412CCA814F0"/>American government. I anſwered, that a gratification, on any terms, or in any form, was a ſubject which we approached with much fear and difficulty, as we were not authorized by our government to make one; nor had it been expected that one would be neceſſary; that I could not undertake to ſay whether my colleagues would conſent to it, in any ſtate of things; but I could undertake to ſay, no one of us would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, unleſs it was preceded, or accompanied, by a full and entire recognition of the claims of our citizens, and a ſatisfactory arrangement on the objects of our miſſion. He ſaid, it was in the expectation of that event only that he mentioned it. We parted: and I ſtated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to General Pinckney, who was diſinclined to any ſtipulation of the ſort, and conſidered it as a renewal of the old reprobated ſyſtem of indirect, unauthoriſed negociation.</p>
               <p>Having been originally the counſel of M. de Beaumarchais, I had determined, and ſo I informed General Pinckney, that I would not, by my voice, eſtabliſh any agreement in his favour; but that I would poſitively oppoſe any admiſſion of the claim of any French citizen, if not accompanied with the admiſſion of the claims of the American citizens of property, captured and condemned for want of a role d'equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. My reaſon for conceiving that this ought to be ſtipulated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly, was a conviction, that if it was referred to commiſſioners, it would be committing, abſolutely to chance, as complete a right as any individuals ever poſſeſſed. General Pinckney was againſt admitting the claim at any rate.</p>
               <p>After my return, Mr. Gerry came into my room, and told me, that M. Y. had called on him, to accompany him on a viſit to M. Talleyrand; that he propoſed ſeeing M. Talleyrand, and returning the civility of the dinner; and endeavouring to bring about ſome intercourſe between him and us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> 18. General Pinckney, and Mr. Gerry, met in my room; and Mr. Gerry detailed to us the converſations mentioned in our public letter. The propoſition relative to the claim of M. de Beaumarchais is entirely different from my underſtanding of it, in the very brief ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made to me by M. Y. We reſolved, that we would rigidly adhere to the rule we had adopted, to enter into no negociation with perſons not formally authorized to treat with us.—We came alſo to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to prepare a letter to the Miniſter of Foreign Relations, ſlating the object of our miſſion, and diſcuſſing the ſubjects of difference between the two nations, in like manner as if we had been actually received; and to cloſe the letter, with requeſting the government to open the negociation with us, or grant to us our paſſports.</p>

                  <hi>December</hi> 13. <hi>Mr. Gerry accidentally calling on General Pinckney, found M X. and was ſoon informed, that his object was to obtain another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view between the miniſters and M. Y. on the affairs of their miſſion. General
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034817_0033_0FFF84617166FCE8"/>Marſhall happening alſo to be there, we retired into another room, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately agreed to adhere to our former determination, not to have any more informal communications. M. X. having been called in, General Pinckney briefly communicated our determination: and Mr. Gerry obſerved, that he was much hurt by this propoſition; that the Miniſters had already proceeded farther, in this mode of communication, than perhaps they could juſtify; that they had refuſed ſix weeks ago, to renew it; and that ſome regard ought to be paid to their feelings, which had been ſufficiently mortified; that the propoſition was diſreſpectful to the Envoys, as it betrayed a belief that they had loſt the ſenſe of their dignity, and were indeed incompetent to their effice; that had there been but one Envoy extraordinary, be ought to have had an audience in a few days; and that for three, to remain between two and three months in this ſituation, was too humiliating, too debaſing for any nation to ſubmit to it; that for his own part, had he been ſent to any other nation in Europe, with two other Envoys, he would not have conſented to have remained in ſuch a ſtate ten days; that knowing the great deſire of the government and nation of the United States to be at peace with France, he had, with his colleagues, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this indignity, at the riſque of the ſevere cenſure of the former.—Having alſo enquired of M. X. at what time M. Talleyrand could be ſeen, the former ſaid he would enquire of M. Y. who on the</hi> 16th <hi>in the evening, ſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Y. has the honour to preſent his reſpects to Mr. Gerry, and to inform him, that he will have the honour to wait on him to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, to go together to the Miniſter of Foreign Relations, he is with reſpect," &amp;c. On the morning of the</hi> 17th, <hi>M. Y. came in, while Mr. Gerry was at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, not having received an anſwer to his note: and Mr. Marſhall coming in, M. Y. took him aſide and conferred with him a conſiderable time; after which the former, and the reſt of the family, left the room, and M. Y. and Mr. Gerry being together, Mr. Gerry told him, that his object in ſeeing M. Talleyrand was to return a civility, by requeſting him to fix a day for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Mr. G. who intended to invite his colleagues; by this interview to promote, if poſſible, a better underſtanding between the Miniſter and the American Envoys; and Mr G. alſo propoſed to confer with the miniſter on the diſagreeable ſituation the Envoys were in, and to ſtate to him ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which appeared to be founded, reſpecting a propoſition before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, for ſending off all Americans in a ſhort period; but Mr. Gerry ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he could not hear a word on the ſubject of the miſſion, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries to a negociation; as the Envoys had determined, unanimouſly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any informal communications on the ſubject. M. Y. in anſwer, ſaid, that Mr. Marſhall had juſt heard him on a ſubject of this kind; &amp; that we might conſider it as he did, merely as a converſation between ourselves. He then ſtated, that two meaſures which M. Talleyrand propoſed being adopted, a reſtoration of friendſhip between the republics would follow immediately; the one was a gratuity of fifty thouſand pounds ſterling, the other a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of thirty two millions of Dutch reſcriptions; that as to the firſt, M. de Beaumarchais had recovered, in a cauſe, depending in Virginia, between that ſtate and himſelf, one hundred and forty five thouſand pounds ſtening; that there was an appeal from the judgment; that he would ſign an act to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034817_0034_0FFF84166C35F288"/>relinquiſh forty five thouſand pounds, if the whole ſhould be finally recoverea, leaving only one hundred thouſand pounds for himſelf; that the</hi> £ 45,000 <hi>might accrue to the United States, who would, in that caſe, loſe but a ſmall part of the fifty thouſand pounds; that the purchaſe of ſixteen millions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions would amount to but one million three hundred thirty three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand [pounds] ſix ſhillings and eight pence, ſterling, which, with an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of five per cent. would be certainly paid by the gavernment of Holland to the United States, and leave them without any loſs; that more than half the ſum may now he hired in Holland, on the credit of the reſcriptions, and an eaſy arrangement be made for payment by ſhort inſtaiments, which might be obtained alſo by a loan; that it was worthy the attention of the Envoys to conſider, whether by ſo ſmall a ſacrifice they would eſtabliſh a peace with France, or whether they would riſk the conſequences; that if nothing could be done by the Enveys, arrangements would be made forthwith to ravage the coaſts of the United States, by frigates from St. Domingo; that ſmall ſtates, which had offended France, were ſuffering by it; that Hamburgh, and other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that quarter, would within a month, or two, have their governments changed; that Switzerland would undergo the ſame operation; and that Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal would probably be in a worſe predicament; that the expedition againſt England would be certainly purſued; and that the preſent period was the moſt favourable, if we wiſhed to adopt any meaſure for a pacification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Gerry, in anſwer, ſaid, that if the French were diſpoſed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue with vengeance the United States, they might perhaps ravage their coaſts, and injure them in this way, but they never could ſubdue them, the meaſure he thought utterly impracticable, even if attempted by France and her allies. To which M. Y. aſſented. Mr. Gerry obſerved, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the ravages alluded to, would undoubtedly cloſely connect the United States and Great-Britain, and prevent the former from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the friendſhip which they have ever had for France; that as to the propoſitions, he ſhould expreſs no opinion on them; that his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and that of his colleagues, was extremely difficult; that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory were excluſively prejudiced againſt the government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, and conſidered them as the friends of Great Britain; that if the envoys could have an opportunity of being heard, they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſuch impreſſions, and ſhow that the government were the friends of France, as much as of Great-Britain; but that the envoys were now in the moſt painful ſituation; that they were treated, in the eyes of all Europe, and of the American government and nation, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt contempt, and were ſubmitting to indignities which they could not reconcile to their feelings, or juſtify to their conſtituents.</p>
               <p>M. Y. ſaid, that the obſervations were juſt: but that the American en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys had not experienced worſe treatment than other miniſters, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as bad; that the envoy of Portugal was again ordered to depart; and that but little ceremony was obſerved to the envoys in general. M. Y. and Mr. Gerry, then took a ride to M. Talleyrand's bureau, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them politely: and after being ſeated, Mr. Gerry obſerved to M. Talleyrand, in Engliſh, ſlowly, that M. Y. had ſtated to him that morning ſome propoſitions, as coming from M. Talleyrand, reſpecting
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034817_0035_0FFF5D906427CC60"/>which Mr. Gerry could give no opinion: that his object, at this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view was, to requeſt of him information, whether he would fix a time for taking a dinner with Mr. Gerry, at which he propoſed to invite his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues; that he wiſhed for more frequent interviews of ſome kind or other between himſelf, &amp; the envoys; conceiving that many imaginary difficulties, which obſtructed the negociation, would vaniſh by this means; and that thoſe which were real would be ſurmounted; that conceiving the delicate part which the miniſter of France had to act; at this time, he did not wiſh M. Talleyrand to accept the invitation if it would ſubject him to inconveniences; that he wiſhed to ſpeak on another ſubject; and it was painful to him to acknowledge, that the precarious ſituation of the envoys was ſuch, as to render it impoſſible for them to take meaſures for decent arrangements; that a ſhort time ſince, he had ſuppoſed meaſures were taking a favourable turn; but that lately he had received, from various quarters, information of a report made by the miniſter of the interior, and under the conſideration of the Directory, <hi>for ſending all Americans from Paris in twenty-four hours;</hi> that he could not be reſponſible for the truth of the information; but it appeared to him, as well from the various quarters from which it came, as from the intelligence of the perſon who gave it, to be highly probable; that if this was the caſe, it was unneceſſary for the Directory, as he conceived, to paſs any arrete, as it reſpected the envoys, for that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Paris whenever it was hinted, as the wiſh of the Directory; that for his own part he ſhould feel more at eaſe, until we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to reſide in a city of ſome other nation, than that of France; and to return to Paris, on notice that the Directory were diſpoſed to open the negociation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Talleyrand appeared to be very uneaſy at this declaration;</hi> but avoided ſaying a word on it. <hi>He ſaid, that the information M. Y. had given me was juſt, and might always be relied on;</hi> but that he would reduce to writing his propoſitions; which he accordingly did; and after he had ſhewn them to Mr. Gerry, <hi>he burnt the paper.</hi> The ſubſtance was as follows.—[<hi>See No.</hi> 1, <hi>below.</hi>]</p>
               <p>He then ſaid, that he accepted of the invitation; that he would dine with him the decade after the preſent, in which he was engaged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gerry did not repeat all that he had ſaid to M. Y. having no doubt he would communicate the whole to M. Talleyrand. And, after expreſſing a friendſhip for the French republic, and a warm deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the former attachment of the two republics, which M. Talleyrand warmly reciprocated, Mr. Gerry bid M. Talley and adieu; leaving him with M. Y.</p>
               <p>(No. 1.)</p>
               <p>That the envoys ſhould come forward generally, and ſay:</p>
               <p>"France has been ſerviceable to the United States, and now they wiſh to be ſerviceable to France: <hi>underſtanding that the French republic has ſixteen million of Dutch reſcriptions to ſell, the United States will purchaſe them at par, and will give her further aſſiſtance, when in their power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"The firſt arrangement being made, the French government will
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034817_0036_0FFF8462FA59E978"/>take meaſures for reimburſing the equitable demands of America, ariſing from prizes, and to give free navigation to their ſhips in future."</p>

               </opener>
               <p>On this day, the fifteenth of Nivoſe, and at the very hour at which the Executive Directory addreſſes this meſſage to you, the municipal
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034817_0037_0FFF846491DB8498"/>adminiſtrators, the juſtices of the peace, the commiſſaries of the Directory, and the ſuperintendance of the cuſtoms, are proceeding in all the chief places of the departments, in all the ports, and in all the principal communes of the republic, to ſeize the Engliſh merchandize now in France, or introduced into its territory, in contravention of the law of the tenth Brumaire, fifth year (Oct. 31ſt, 1796.)</p>
               <p>Such is the firſt act by which, now that peace is given to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, the war declared long ſince againſt England, is about to aſſume the real character which becomes it. The French will not ſuffer a power, which ſeeks to found its proſperity upon the misfortune of other nations, to raiſe its commerce upon the ruin of that of other ſtates, and which, aſpiring to the dominion of the ſeas, wiſhes to introduce, every where, the articles of its own manufacture, and to receive nothing from foreign induſtry—any longer to enjoy the fruit of its guilty ſpeculations:</p>
               <p>The Engliſh government has kept in pay, during the war, the coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced forces, with the produce of its manufactures. It has violated all the principles of the law of nations, in order to ſhackle the relations of neutral powers; it has cauſed to be ſeized the proviſions, corn, and commodities, which it ſuppoſed to be deſtined for France; it has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared contraband every thing which it thought could be uſeful to the republic; it deſired to ſtarve it. All the citizens call for vengeance.</p>
               <p>When it had to fear the capture of veſſels ſailing under its flag, it corrupted foreign captains to induce them to take on board their veſſels Engliſh merchandize, and thus to introduce it by ſtratagem, by fraud or otherwiſe, into other ſtates, and eſpecially into the French Republic.</p>
               <p>The neutral powers ſhould have perceived, that, by this conduct, their merchants took part in the war, and that they lent aſſiſtance to one of the Belligerent powers.</p>
               <p>We ſerve a party, as well when we procure for it the means of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting its forces, as when we unite ourſelves to thoſe which it has. The neutral powers ſhould have perceived, that, England, by ſtopping the veſſels of other powers, laden in their reſpective ports, and deſtined for France, by permitting articles coming from her own manufactories alone to circulate, aimed at an excluſive commerce, and that it would be neceſſary to ſeck reparation for ſuch an attempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ordinance of the marine, and the regulation of</hi> 1704, <hi>have declared lawful prize, the vessels, and their cargoes, in which is found merchandize belonging to enemies. These provisions should be extended.</hi> The intereſt of Europe requires it.</p>
               <p>The Directory thinks it urgent, and neceſſary, to paſs a law, declaring that the character of veſſels, relative to their quality of neutral or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſhall be determined by their cargo, and the cargo ſhall be no longer covered by the flag: in conſequence, that every American veſſel found at ſea, having on board Engliſh proviſions and merchandize, as her cargo, in whole, or in part, ſhall be declared lawful prize, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the proprietor of theſe proviſions or merchandize; which ſhall be reputed contraband, for this cauſe alone, that they come from England or her poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:034817_0038_0FFF846A4F7F7010"/>
It would be uſeful to declare, at the ſame time, that except in the caſe of diſtreſs, the ports of the republic ſhall be ſhut to all foreign veſſels, which, in the courſe of their voyage, ſhall have entered thoſe of England.</p>
               <p>The Executive Directory requeſts you, citizens repreſentatives, to adopt theſe meaſures. No neutral or allied power can miſtake their object, nor complain of them, unleſs it be already abandoned to England. The infallible effect of the meaſure is to enhance the value of the produce of their own ſoil and induſtry, to increaſe the proſperity of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, to repel every thing that comes from England, and eſſentially to influence the concluſion of the war.</p>
               <p>Such are the motives which induce the Executive Directory to invite you, citizens repreſentatives, to take the object of this meſſage into the moſt prompt conſideration.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IT is known to you, that the people of the United States of America, entertained a warm and ſincere affection for the people of France, ever ſince their arms were united in the war with Great Britain, which ended
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:034817_0039_0FFF83FF39BCB748"/>in the full and formal acknowledgement of the Independence of theſe ſtates. It is known to you, that this affection was ardent, when the French determined to reform their government, and eſtabliſh it on the baſis of liberty; that liberty in which the people of the United States were born, and which, in the concluſion of the war, above mentioned, was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and firmly ſecured. It is known to you, that this affection roſe to enthuſiaſm, when the war was kindled between France and the powers of Europe, which were combined againſt her, for the avowed purpoſe of reſtoring the monarchy; and every where vows were heard for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the French arms. Yet, during this period, France expreſſed no wiſh that the United States ſhould depart from their neutrality. And while no duty required us to enter into the war, and our beſt intereſts ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us to remain at peace, the government determined to take a neutral ſtation: which being taken, the duties of an impartial neutrality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came indiſpenſably binding. Hence the government early proclaimed to our citizens the nature of thoſe duties, and the conſequences of their violation.</p>
               <p>The miniſter of France, Mr. Genet, who arrived about this time, by his public declaration, confirmed the idea, that France did not deſire us to quit the ground we had taken. His meaſures, however, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to deſtroy our neutrality and to draw us into the war.</p>
               <p>The principles of the proclamation of neutrality, founded on the law of nations, which is the law of the land, were afterwards recognized by the National Legiſlature, and the obſervance of them enforced by ſpecific penalties, in the act of Congreſs, paſſed the fifth of June, 1794. By theſe principles, and laws, the acts of the executive, and the deciſions of the courts of the United States were regulated.</p>
               <p>A government thus fair and upright in its principles, and juſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial in its conduct, might have confidently hoped to be ſecure againſt formal official cenſure: but the United States have not been ſo fortunate. The acts of their government, in its various branches, though pure in principle, and impartial in operation, and conformable to their indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible rights of ſovereignty, have been aſſigned as the cauſe of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and injurious meaſures of the French Republic. For proofs of the former, all the acts of the government may be vouched, while the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo freely uttered by the French miniſters, the refuſal to hear the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the United States, ſpecially charged to enter on amicable diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, on all the topics of complaint, the decrees of the Executive Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and of their agents, the depredations on our commerce, and the violences againſt the perſons of our citizens, are evidences of the latter. Theſe injuries, and depredations, will conſtitute an important ſubject of your diſcuſſions with the government of the French Republic; and for all theſe wrongs you will ſeek redreſs.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to the depredations on our commerce, the principal objects will be, to agree on an equitable mode of examining and deciding the claims of our citizens, and the manner and periods of making them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. As to the firſt, the ſeventh article of the Britiſh, and the twenty-firſt of the Spaniſh treaty, preſent approved precedents to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034817_0040_0FFF846BD8100CA8"/>with France. The propoſed mode of adjuſting thoſe claims, by commiſſioners appointed on each ſide, is ſo perfectly fair, we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it will be refuſed. But when the claims are adjuſted, if pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſpecie, cannot be obtained, it may be found neceſſary to agree, in behalf of our citizens, that they ſhall accept public ſecurities, payable with intereſt, at ſuch periods as the ſtate of the French finances ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der practicable. Theſe periods you will endeavor, as far as poſſible, to ſhorten.</p>
               <p>Not only the recent depredations, under colour of the decrees of the Directory, of the ſecond of July, 1796, and the ſecond of March, 1797, or under the decrees of their agents, or the illegal ſentences of their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, but all prior ones, not already ſatisfactorily adjuſted, ſhould be put in this equitable train of ſettlement. To cancel many, or all of the laſt mentioned claims, might be the effect of the decree of the Executive Directory, of the ſecond of March laſt, reviving the decree of the 9th of May, 1793; but this being an <hi>ex-post facto</hi> regulation, as well as a violation of the treaty between the United States and France, cannot be obligatory on the former. Indeed the greater part, probably nearly all the captures and confiſcations in queſtion, have been committed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect violation of that treaty, or of the law of nations. But the injuries ariſing from the capture of enemies property, in veſſels of the United States, may not be very extenſive; and if for ſuch captured property, the French government will, agreeably to the law of nations, pay the freight and reaſonable demurrage, we ſhall not, on this account, any farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. But of ſhip timber, and naval ſtores, taken and confiſcated by the French, they ought to pay the full value; becauſe our citizens continued their traffic, in thoſe articles, under the faith of the treaty with France. On theſe two points we ought to expect that the French government will not refuſe to do us juſtice: and the more, becauſe it has not, at any period of the war, expreſſed its deſire that the commercial treaty ſhould, in theſe reſpects, be altered.</p>
               <p>Beſides the claims of our citizens for depredations on their property, there are many ariſing from expreſs contracts made with the French government, or its agents, or founded on the ſeizure of their property, in French ports. Other claims have ariſen from the long detention of a multitude of our veſſels in the ports of France. The wrong hereby done to our citizens was acknowledged by the French government, and in ſome, perhaps in moſt of the caſes, ſmall payments towards indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications have been made: the reſidue ſtill remains to be claimed.</p>
               <p>All theſe juſt demands of our citizens will merit your attention. The beſt poſſible means of compenſation muſt be attempted. Theſe will depend on what you ſhall diſcover to be practicable in relation to the French finances. But an exception muſt be made in reſpect to debts due to our citizens by the contract of the French government and its agents, if they are comprehended in any ſtipulation; and an option reſerved to them, jointly or individually, either to accept the means of payment
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:034817_0041_0FFF846D606C1450"/>which you ſhall ſtipulate or reſort to the French government, directly for the ſufilment of its contracts.</p>
               <p>Although the reparation for loſſes ſuſtained by the citizens of the United States, in conſequence of irregular, or illegal captures, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations, or forcible ſeizures, or detentions, is of very high importance, and is to be preſſed with the greateſt earneſtneſs, yet it is not to be inſiſted on as an indiſpenſable condition of the propoſed treaty. You are not, however, to renounce theſe claims of our citizens, nor to ſtipulate that they be aſſumed by the United States as a loan to the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to the alterations of the commercial treaty with France, in the two caſes which have been principal ſubjects of complaint on her part, viz. enemies property in neutral ſhips, and the articles contraband of war; although France can have no right to claim the annulling of ſtipulations at the moment when by both parties they were originally intended to operate; yet if the French government preſs for alterations, the Preſident has no difficulty in ſubſtituting the principles of the law of nations, as ſtated in the 17th and 18th articles of our commercial treaty with Great Britain, to thoſe of the 23d and 24th articles of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaty with France: and in reſpect to proviſions, and other articles, not uſually deemed contraband, you are to agree only on a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary compromiſe, like that in the 18th article of the Britiſh treaty, and of the ſame duration. If however, in order to ſatisfy France <hi>now ſhe is at war,</hi> we change the two important articles before mentioned, then the 14th article of the French treaty, which ſubjects the property of the neutral nation found on board enemies ſhips to capture and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, muſt of courſe be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>We have witneſſed ſo many erroneous conſtructions of the treaty with France, even in its plaineſt parts, it will be neceſſary to examine every article critically, for the purpoſe of preventing, as far as human wiſdom can prevent, all future miſinterpretations. The kind of documents, neceſſary for the protection of the neutral veſſels, ſhould be enumerated and minutely deſcribed; the caſes in which a ſea-letter ſhould be required may be ſpecified; the want of a ſea-letter ſhould not, of itſelf, be a cauſe of confiſcation, where other reaſonable proof of property is produced; and where ſuch proof is furniſhed, the want of a ſea-letter ſhould go no further than to ſave the captor from damages for detaining and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the neutral veſſel. The proportion of the veſſel's crew, which may be foreigners, ſhould be agreed on. Perhaps it will be expedient to introduce divers other regulations conformably to the marine laws of France. Whenever theſe are to operate on the commerce of the United States, our ſafety requires, that as far as poſſible, they be fixed by treaty. And it will be deſirable to ſtipulate againſt any <hi>ex poſt facto laws,</hi> or regulation, under any pretence whatever.</p>
               <p>Great Britain has often claimed a right, and practiſed upon it, to prohibit neutral nations carrying on a commerce with her enemies which had not been allowed in time of peace. On this head, it will be deſirable
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034817_0042_0FFF8454EFCCFBF8"/>to come to an explicit underſtanding with France; and, if poſſible, to obviate the claim by an expreſs ſtipulation.</p>
               <p>Such extenſive depredations have been committed on the commerce of neutrals, and eſpecially of the United States, by the citizens of France, under pretence that her enemies (particularly Great-Britain) have done the ſame things, it will be deſirable to have it explicitly ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that the conduct of an enemy towards the neutral power ſhall not authorize or excuſe the other belligerent power in any departure from the law of nations, or the ſtipulations of the treaty: Eſpecially that the veſſels of the neutral nation ſhall never be captured or detained, or their property confiſcated or injured, becauſe bound to or from an enemy's port, except the caſe of a blockaded port, the entering into which may be prevented according to the known rule of the law of nations. And it may be expedient to define a blockaded place, or port, to be one actually inveſted by land or naval forces, or both, and that no <hi>declaration</hi> of a blockade ſhall have any effect without ſuch actual inveſtment. And no commercial right whatever ſhould be abandoned which is ſecured to neutral powers by the European law of nations.</p>
               <p>The foregoing articles being thoſe which the French government has made the oſtenſible grounds of its principal compalints, they have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been firſt brought into view. But the propoſed alterations, and arrangements, ſuggeſt the propriety of reviſing all our treaties with France. In ſuch reviſion, the firſt object that will attract your attention is the reciprocal guaranty in the eleventh article of the treaty of alliance. This guaranty we are perfectly willing to renounce. The guaranty by France of the liberty, ſovereignty, and independence of the United States, will add nothing to our ſecurity, while, on the contrary, our guaranty of the poſſeſſions of France in America, will perpetually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to the riſque and expenſe of war, or to diſputes and queſtions concerning our national faith.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Genet was ſent as the miniſter of the French Republic to the United States, its ſituation was embarraſſed, and the ſucceſs of its meaſures problematical. In ſuch circumſtances it was natural that France ſhould turn her eye to the mutual guaranty: And accordingly it was required in Mr. Genet's inſtructions, to be "an eſſential clauſe in the new treaty," which he was to propoſe: And on the ground "that it nearly concerned the peace and proſperity of the French nation, that a people, whoſe reſources increaſe beyond all calculation, and whom nature had placed ſo near their rich colonies, ſhould become intereſted, by their own engagements, in the preſervation of thoſe iſlands." But at this time, France, powerful by her victories, and ſecure in her triumphs, may leſs regard the reciprocal guaranty with the United States, and be willing to relinquiſh it. As a ſubſtitute for the reciprocal guaranty may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a mutual renunciation of the ſame territories and poſſeſſions, that were ſubjects of the guaranty and renunciation in the ſixth and eleventh articles of the treaty of alliance. Such a renunciation, on our part, would obviate the reaſon aſſigned in the inſtruction to Mr. Genet before cited,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:034817_0043_0FFF846EE78BC780"/>
                  <hi>of future danger from the rapidly growing power of the United States.</hi> But if France inſiſts on the mutual guaranty, it will be neceſſary to aim at ſome modification of it.</p>
               <p>The exiſting engagement is of that kind, which, by writers on the law of nations, is called a general guaranty; of courſe the <hi>caſus foederis</hi> can never occur except in a <hi>defenſive war.</hi> The nature of this obligation is underſtood to be, that when a war <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly defenſive</hi> exiſts, the engaging nation is bound to furniſh an <hi>effectual</hi> and adequate <hi>defence</hi> in co-operation with the power attacked: whence it follows that the nation <hi>may</hi> be required, in ſome circumſtances to bring forward its whole force. The nature and extent of the ſuccours demandable, not being aſcertained, engagements of this kind are dangerous on account of their uncertainty: there is always hazard of doing too much, or too little, and of courſe of being involved in involuntary rupture.</p>
               <p>Specific ſuccours have the advantage of certainty, and are leſs liable to occaſion war. On the other hand, a general guaranty allows a latitude for the exerciſe of judgement and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>On the part of the United States, inſtead of troops or ſhips of war, it will be convenient to ſtipulate for a moderate ſum of money; or quantity of proviſions, at the option of France; the proviſions to be delivered at our own ports, in any future <hi>defenſive</hi> wars. The ſum of money, or its value in proviſions, ought not to exceed two hundred thouſand dollars a year, during any ſuch wars. The reciprocal ſtipulations, on the part of France, may be to furniſh annually the like ſum of money, or any equivalent in military ſtores and cloathing for troops, at the option of the United States to be delivered in the ports of France.</p>
               <p>Particular caution, however, muſt be uſed in diſcuſſing this ſubject, not to admit any claims on the ground of the guaranty in relation to the exiſting war; as we do not allow that the <hi>cases foederis</hi> applies to it. And if the war ſhould continue after your arrival in France, and the queſtion of the guaranty ſhould not be mentioned on her part, you may yourſelves be ſilent on the ſubject, if you deem it moſt prudent.</p>
               <p>It will be proper here to notice ſuch articles of the treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and France as have been dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently conſtrued by the two governments, or which it may be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to amend or explain.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 2. The aſſent of the United States, in their treaty with Great Britain, to the doctrine of the law of nations, reſpecting enemies proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in neutral ſhips and ſhip timber, and naval ſtores, and in ſome caſes proviſions, as contraband of war; the French government has choſen to conſider as a voluntary <hi>grant of favours,</hi> in reſpect to commerce and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to Great Britain, and that conſequently the ſame favours have become common to France. This conſtruction is ſo foreign from our ideas of the meaning and deſign of this article, it ſhews the neceſſity of reviewing all the articles, and however clear they may appear, of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to obviate future miſconſtructions by declaratory explanations or a change of terms.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 5. France has repeatedly contended, that the impoſition of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:034817_0044_0FFF847211DCD488"/>fifty per cent. per ton, on French veſſels arriving in the United States, is contrary to the fifth article of the treaty. The arguments in ſupport of this pretenſion are unknown; but it is preſumed to be unfounded. The reciprocal right of laying "duties or impoſts of what nature ſoever," equal to thoſe impoſed on the moſt favored nations, and without any other reſtrictions, ſeems to be clearly ſettled by the third and fourth articles. The fifth article appears to have been intended merely to define or qualify the rights of American veſſels in France. It is however deſirable that the queſtion be underſtood, and all doubt concerning it removed. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of a principle of diſcrimination between the veſſels of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent foreign nations, and in derogation of the powers of Congreſs, to raiſe revenue by uniform duties on any objects whatever, cannot be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded. The naturalization of French veſſels will of courſe be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as inadmiſſible.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 8. The ſtipulation of doing us good offices, to ſecure peace to the United States with the Barbary powers, has never yet procured us any advantage. If therefore the French government lays any ſtreſs on this ſtipulation, as authorizing a claim for ſome other engagement from us in favor of France, it may be abandoned; and eſpecially if its abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation can be applied as a ſet off againſt ſome exiſting French claim.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 14. If the alterations, already propoſed, are made in the 23d and 24th articles, then this 14th article, as before obſerved, muſt be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 17. The conſtruction put on this article by the government of the United States, is conceived to be reaſonable and juſt, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be inſiſted on. The tribunals of the reſpective countries will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be juſtified in taking cognizance of all captures made within their reſpective juriſdictions; or by illegal privateers; and thoſe of one country will be deemed illegal, which are fitted out in the country of the other remaining neutral: ſeeing to permit ſuch arming would violate the neutral duties of the latter.</p>
               <p>It will be expedient, to fix explicitly, the reception to be given <hi>to public ſhips of war</hi> of all nations. The French miniſters have demanded, that the public ſhips of the enemies of France, which at any time, and in any part of the world, had made prize of a French veſſel, ſhould be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ports of the United States; although they brought in no prize with them. In oppoſition to this demand, we have contended, that they were to be excluded only when they came in with French prizes. And the kind of aſylum to be afforded in all other circumſtances, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Mr. Jefferſon's letter to Mr. Hammond, dated the 9th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1793, in the following words: "Thus then, the <hi>public ſhips of war</hi> of both nations (Engliſh and French) enjoy a perfect equality in our ports; 1ſt, in caſes of urgent neceſſity; 2d in caſes of comfort or convenience; and 3d, in the time they chooſe to continue." And ſuch ſhelter and accommodation are due to the public ſhips of all nations on the principal of hoſpitality among friendly nations.</p>
               <p>It will alſo be expedient, explicitly to declare, that the right of aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:034817_0045_0FFF84786934A908"/>ſtipulated for the armed veſſels of France, and their prizes, gives no right to make ſale of thoſe prizes.</p>
               <p>But when prize ſhips are ſo diſabled, as to be incapable of putting to ſea again, until refitted, and when they are utterly diſabled; ſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is neceſſary relative to their cargoes. Both caſes occured laſt year. The government permitted, though with heſitation and caution, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes to be unloaded, one of the veſſels to be repaired, and part of the prize goods ſold, to pay for the repairs, and the cargo of the veſſel that was found unfit ever to go to ſea again, was allowed to be exported as <hi>prize goods,</hi> even in neutral bottoms. The doubts, on theſe occaſions, aroſe from the 24th article of the Britiſh treaty, forbidding the ſale of the prizes of privateers, or the exchanging of the ſame in any manner whatever. But as French prizes were entitled to an aſylum in our ports, it was conceived to be a reaſonable conſtruction of it, to allow of ſuch proceedings as thoſe above mentioned, to prevent the total loſs of veſſels and cargoes. The 25th article of the Britiſh treaty demands attention; as it is therein ſtipulated, that no future treaty ſhall be made, that ſhall be inconſiſtent with that of the 24th article. Another doubt aroſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Britiſh treaty did not, in good faith, require the prohibition of the ſale of prizes made by the <hi>National ſhips</hi> of France, as well as of thoſe made by her privateers; eſpecially ſeeing our treaty with France gave her no right to ſell any prizes whatever: but upon the whole it was conceived that the United States having before allowed the ſale of ſuch prizes, and the prohibition in the 24th article of the treaty being diſtinctly pointed againſt the ſale of the prizes of <hi>privateers,</hi> it was thought proper to permit the former practice to continue, until the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive ſhould make, and publiſh, a prohibition of the ſale of prizes, or that Congreſs ſhould paſs a prohibitory law.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 22. If in new modelling the treaty with France, the total prohibition of the ſale of prizes in the ports of the party remaining neutral, ſhould not be agreed on, at leaſt the right of each power to make, at its pleaſure, ſuch prohibition, whether they are prizes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſhips or privateers, ſhould be acknowledged, for the reaſon more than once ſuggeſted—to prevent a repetition of claims upon unfounded conſtructions; ſuch as under the preſent article, that a <hi>prohibition</hi> to an <hi>enemy</hi> of either party, is a <hi>grant</hi> to the the <hi>other</hi> of the thing forbidden.</p>
               <p>ARTICLES 23 and 24. Theſe have been already conſidered, and the alterations propoſed have been mentioned.</p>
               <p>There have been ſo many unjuſt cauſes and pretences aſſigned for cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing and confiſcating American veſſels, it may perhaps be impoſſible to guard againſt a repetition of them in any treaty which can be deviſed. To ſtate the cauſes and pretences that have been already advanced by the government of France, its agents and tribunals, as the grounds of the capture and condemnation of American veſſels and cargoes, would doubtleſs give pain to any man of an ingenious mind, who ſhould be employed, on the part of France, to negotiate another treaty, or a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the treaties which exiſt. It is not deſired, therefore, to go farther into detail on theſe matters, than ſhall be neceſſary to guard, by
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034817_0046_0FFF8479F8D88938"/>explicit ſtipulations, againſt future miſconſtructions, and the miſchiefs they will naturally produce.</p>
               <p>Under pretence, that certain ports were ſurrendered to the Engliſh, by the treachery of the French and Dutch inhabitants, Victor Hughes and Lebas, the ſpecial agents of the Executive Directory, at Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe, have declared that all neutral veſſels, bound to or from ſuch ports, ſhall be good prize.</p>
               <p>Under the pretence that the Britiſh were taking all neutral veſſels bound to or from French ports, the French agents, at St. Domingo (Santhonax and others) decreed that all <hi>American</hi> veſſels, bound to or from Engliſh ports, ſhould be captured; and they have ſince declared ſuch captured veſſels to be good prize. The French conſuls, in Spain, have on the ſame ground condemned a number of American veſſels, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they were deſtined to, or coming from an Engliſh port.</p>
               <p>Under the pretence, that the ſea-letters, or paſſports, preſcribed by the commercial treaty, for the mutual advantage of the merchants and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of the two nations, to ſave their veſſels from detention and other vexations, when met with at ſea, by preſenting ſo clear a proof of their property, are an indiſpenſable document to be found on board the French confiſcate American veſſels deſtitute of them, even when they acknowledge the property to be American.</p>
               <p>Becauſe horſes and their military furniture, when deſtined to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's port, are by the 24th article of the commercial treaty declared contraband, and as ſuch, by themſelves, only liable to confiſcation, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghes and Lebas decreed all <hi>neutral veſſels</hi> having horſes, or any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband goods on board, ſhould be good prize; and they accordingly condemned veſſels and cargoes.</p>
               <p>The ancient ordinances of the French monarchs required a variety of papers to be on board of neutral veſſels, the want of any one of which is made a cauſe of condemnation; although the 25th article of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaty mentions, what certificates ſhall accompany the merchant veſſels and cargoes of each party, and which, by every reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ought to give them protection.</p>
               <p>It will therefore be adviſable to guard againſt abuſes by deſcending to particulars: to deſcribe the ſhips papers which ſhall be required, and to declare, that the want of any other ſhall not be a cauſe for confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: To fix the mode of manning veſſels, as to the officers, and to the proportion of the crews who ſhall be citizens; endeavouring to provide, with reſpect to American veſſels, that more than one third may be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. This proviſion will be important to the Southern States, which have but few native ſeamen.</p>
               <p>The marine ordinances of France, will ſhew what regulations have been required to be obſerved by allied, as well as neutral powers in general, to aſcertain and ſecure the property of neutrals. Some of theſe regulations may be highly proper to be adopted; while others may be inconvenient and burthenſome. Your aim will be to render the documents and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities as few, and as ſimple, as will conſiſt with a fair and regular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:034817_0047_0FFF847B9C7EE430"/>
ARTICLES 25 and 27. Theſe two articles ſhould be rendered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to each other. The 27th ſays, that after the exhibition of the <hi>paſsport,</hi> the veſſel ſhall be allowed to paſs without moleſtation or ſearch, without giving her chace, or forcing her to quit her intended courſe. The 25th requires that beſides the <hi>paſsport,</hi> veſſels ſhall be furniſhed with certain certificates which of courſe muſt alſo be exhibited. It will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to add, that if in the face of ſuch evidence, the armed veſſel will carry the other into port, and the papers are found conformable to treaty, the captors ſhall be condemned in all the charges, damages, and intereſts thereof, which they ſhall have cauſed. A proviſion of this nature is made in the eleventh article of our treaty with the United Netherlands.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 28. The prohibited goods here mentioned have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to contraband; but merely to ſuch as <hi>by the laws of the country, are forbidden to be exported.</hi> Yet in the caſe of exporting horſes from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, which no law prohibited; in the winter of 1796, this article was applied by the French miniſter to <hi>horſes,</hi> which, by the French treaty, are contraband of war. And a letter from the Miniſter to Victor Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghes and Lebas, informing them that the American government refuſed to prevent ſuch export of horſes by the Britiſh, is made one ground for their decree above mentioned.</p>
               <p>ARTICLE 30. The veſſels of the United States ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ports of France, in the ſame manner as the veſſels of France are admitted into the ports of the United States. But ſuch a ſtipulation ought not to authorize the admiſſion of veſſels of either party into the ports of the other, into which the admiſſion of all foreign veſſels ſhall be forbidden by the laws of France, and of the United States reſpectively. With this reſtriction, the principles of the 14th article of the treaty with Great Britain afford a liberal and unexceptionable precedent. A reſtriction like that here referred to, will be found in the firſt paragraph of the third article of the Britiſh treaty.</p>
               <p>The commerce to the French colonies in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, will doubtleſs be more or leſs reſtricted, according to the uſage of other European nations. Yet on account of the diſarranged condition of the French navigation, probably a larger latitude of trade with their colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies will be readily permitted for a term of years: and perhaps the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantages, then reſulting, will be found ſo great as to induce after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a prolongation of that term; to which the courſe or habit of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs may contribute.</p>
               <p>While between the United States and France, there ſhall ſubſiſt a perfect reciprocity in reſpect to commerce, we muſt endeavour to extend our trade to her colonies to as many articles as poſſible. Of theſe the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant are proviſions of all kinds, as beef, pork, flour, butter, cheeſe, fiſh, grain, pulſe, live ſtock, and every other article ſerving for food, which is the produce of the country, horſes, mules, timber, plants, and wood of all kinds, cabinet ware and other manufactures of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States: and to obtain, in return, all the articles of the produce of thoſe colonies, without exception; at leaſt to the value of the cargoes carried to thoſe colonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:034817_0048_0FFF84181210CD38"/>
There have been different conſtructions of the Conſular Convention. The French have contended for the execution of their conſular deciſions by the marſhal or other officer of the United States; and their miniſter of juſtice, has formerly ſtated in a report to the miniſter of foreign affairs, that the judicial ſentences of the American conſuls in France will be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by certain officers of juſtice in that country. The legal opinion of the law officers of the United States, which the government has adopted, oppoſes ſuch a conſtruction. The French have alſo contended, that deſerters from French veſſels ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the judicial officers of the United States, upon other evidence than the original ſhipping paper, or <hi>rôle d'équipage:</hi> Whereas the diſtrict judges have inſiſted that the Conſular Convention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the original role to be produced. This claim was lately revived by the conſul-general of the French republic. The correſpondence on this occaſion will be joined to the other documents which accompany theſe inſtructions.</p>
               <p>The United States cannot conſent to the erecting of foreign tribunals within their juriſdiction. We conſider the judicial authority of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, as deſcribed in the Conſular Convention, to be voluntary, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſary, in the country where they reſide: And that their deciſions, if not obeyed by the parties reſpectively, muſt be enforced by the laws of their proper country; and ſuch a proviſion you will ſee has been made in France, where a penalty of 1400 livres is impoſed on the citizen who refuſes obedience to a conſular deciſion in a foreign ſtate.</p>
               <p>The Conſular Convention will expire in about four years; and if any great difficulties ariſe in ſettling the terms of a new one, that which exiſts muſt take its courſe: But if the French government ſhould be ſilent on the ſubject of the Conſular Convention, ſilence may be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our part.</p>
               <p>The ports of the United States being frequented by the veſſels of different belligerent powers, it became neceſſary to regulate the times of their ſailing. The Preſident, therefore, adopted what was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be the received rule in Europe; and ordered, that after the ſailing of a veſſel of one of the belligerent powers, twenty-four hours ſhould elapſe, before an armed veſſel of an enemy of the former ſhould ſet ſail. This rule has not been duly reſpected by the armed veſſels of France and Great Britain.</p>
               <p>As the tranquillity of the United States requires, that no hoſtile movements be commenced within their juriſdiction; and the intereſts of commerce demand an entire freedom to the departure of veſſels from their ports, it may be expedient expreſſly to recognize the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned rule.</p>
               <p>It will alſo be expedient to agree on the extent of territorial juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on the ſea coaſt, and in what ſituations bays and ſounds may be ſaid to be land-locked, and within the juriſdiction of the ſovereign of the adjacent country.</p>
               <p>On the ſuppoſition that a treaty will be negotiated to alter and amend
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034817_0049_0FFF847D643034B8"/>the treaties which now exiſt between France and the United States, the following leading principles, to govern the negociation, are ſubjoined.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Conſcious integrity authoriſes the government to inſiſt, that no blame or cenſure be directly, or indirectly, computed to the United States. But on the other hand, however exceptionable in the view of our own government, and in the eyes of an impartial world, may have been the conduct of France, yet ſhe may be unwilling to acknowledge any aggreſſions, and we do not wiſh to wound her feelings, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite reſentment. It will therefore be beſt to adopt on this point the principle of the Britiſh treaty, and <q>terminate our differences in ſuch manner, as without referring to the merits of our reſpective com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and pretenſions, may be the beſt calculated to produce mutual ſatisfaction and good underſtanding.</q>

                  <item>2. That no aid be ſtipulated in favour of France during the preſent war.</item>
                  <item>3. That no engagement be made inconſiſtent with the obligations of any prior treaty.</item>
                  <item>4. That no reſtraint on our lawful commerce, with any other nation, be admitted.</item>
                  <item>5. That no ſtipulation be made, under colour of which, tribunals can be eſtabliſhed within our juriſdiction, or perſonal privileges claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by French citizens, incompatible with the complete ſovereignty and independence of the United States, in matters of policy, commerce and government.</item>

               <p>It will be expedient to limit the duration of the treaty to a term of from ten to twenty years. Such changes in the circumſtances of the two parties are likely to happen within either of thoſe periods, as to give one, or both, good reaſon to deſire a change in the conditions of the treaty. From this limitation may be excepted ſuch articles as are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory of a ſtate of peace, or as are intended to regulate the conduct of the two nations at the commencement of, or during a ſtate of war, or which are founded in morality and juſtice, and are in their nature of perpetual obligation. Of this kind may be conſidered the tenth article of the treaty with Great Britain; which therefore may be very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introduced into the treaty with France.</p>
               <p>Finally, the great object of the government being to do juſtice to France and her citizens, if in any thing we have injured them; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain juſtice for the multiplied injuries they have committed againſt us: And to preſerve peace, your ſtyle and manner of proceeding will be ſuch as ſhall moſt directly tend to ſecure theſe objects. There may be ſuch a change of men and meaſures, in France, as will authorize, perhaps render politic, the uſe of ſtrong language, in deſcribing the treatment we have received. On the other hand, the French government may be determined to fruſtrate the negotiation, and throw the odium on this country; in which caſe, any thing like warmth and harſhneſs would be made the pretext. If things remain in their preſent ſituation, the ſtyle of repreſentation will unite, as much as poſſible, calm dignity with ſimplicity, force of ſentiment with mildneſs of language, and be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
