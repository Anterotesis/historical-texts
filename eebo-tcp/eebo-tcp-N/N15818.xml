            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Beloved Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>REASON taught the old Romans, the injuſtice of condemning any man before he had his accuſers face to face, with licence to anſwer for himſelf; and revelation ſaith to Chriſtians, <hi>In the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall every word be eſtabliſhed.</hi> 2. COR. xiii. 1. And upon perſonal offences, our Lord requires us to give each brother two opportunities to ſpeak for himſelf, before he is arraigned before the church; and then ſays, <hi>If he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen Man and a Publican.</hi> And he aſſures us that none have a right to be in his church, who are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as <hi>little children.</hi> MAT. xviii. 3, 15, 18. And what holineſs would ſoon prevail in his church, if his laws were obeyed therein! <hi>Lordſhip</hi> is of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and by them hath the <hi>Holy City,</hi> been long troden under foot. MARK x. 15, 42. REV. xi. 2. The church hath been labouring, like a traveling woman, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from Antichriſtian Tyranny; and this labour hath now come to a point among our churches, as the following facts will ſhew.</p>
            <p>THE Warren aſſociation was formed as a friendly conference, without claiming any juriſdiction over the churches. In September, 1772, they elected me their Agent, to uſe my beſt endeavours, by the advice of their committee, to obtain the eſtabliſhment of equal
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020213_0003_0FAE4874A0040798"/>religious liberty in this country: And for that end we publiſhed theſe five reaſons, in 1773, againſt comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer with the certificate laws of the ruling party in New-England, 1ſt. Becauſe it implies an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that civil rulers have a right to ſet one religiouſ ſect above another, which they have not. 2d. Becauſe they are not our repreſentatives in religious affairs, and therefore have no right to impoſe religious taxes. 3d. Becauſe their doing it emboldens the ruling party, to aſſume God's prerogative, ſo as to judge the hearts of all who put not into their mouths. 4th. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the church is preſented as a chaſte virgin to Chriſt; and the placeing of her truſt and love upon any others for temporal ſupport, is <hi>playing the harlot,</hi> and ſo the way to deſtroy all religion. HOSEA ii. 5. 5th. Becauſe this practice tends to promote envy, hypocriſy, and confuſion, and ſo to the ruin of civil ſociety,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>My Hiſtory,</hi> vol. 2. p. 278.</note> But Mr. Ebenezer Hinds diſliked our drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that practice; and he was ſo much offended with the language of our memorial againſt it, to our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in 1775, that he did not attend our aſſociation again in ſeven years. He wrote to them in 1779, to reprove them for continuing me as their Agent: To which they returned a reſpectful anſwer. He wrote again in like manner, in 1780, when they made him no reply. In September 1781, Moſes Thomas went to the aſſociation with a complaint againſt elder Hunt's church, becauſe they had excommunicated him the winter before. This the aſſociation took ſo much notice of, as to publiſh a Note in their Minutes, that they claimed no juriſdiction in points of diſcipline; but recommended it to neighbouring churches, that if they were properly applied to, they would afford ſuch aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as was in their power. Thus matters lay for above eight months, and then three churches were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, for aſſiſtance in council upon his caſe, on June
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020213_0004_0FAE4876025B60D8"/>11, 1782; the time when I was obliged, by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in ſaid Minutes, to be in the county of Albany.</p>
            <p>OUR church ſent deacon Alden, and two more delegates to that council; and elder Hunt's church choſe a committee to attend upon them, and to give them what light they could in the affair: Each of the committee were nominated, and then were choſen by the church, by lifting up of hands; until elder Hunt was nominated and ſeconded, without any objection, and he concluded it ſufficient, without putting his own choice to a formal vote. Yet becauſe that formality was omitted, elder Hinds was ſo earneſt to prevent his having liberty to ſpeak before the council, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him of injuring the truth, for ſaying he was one of that committee. However, two thirds of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil obtained ſatisfaction that ſaid excommunication was juſt. But Hinds was ſo uneaſy about it, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a long paper of accuſations againſt Hunt to your church; and Alden brought another to ours; but I refuſed to read it to our church. In September 1782, elder Hinds went again to our aſſociation, to whom another complaint was carried from Moſes Thomas, but the moderator did not think proper to read it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. Hinds continued ſo uneaſy with Hunt, as to write a letter to the aſſociation againſt him, in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1783; but it was not read to them. After which I procured a meeting at Ebenezer Nelſon's; on January 13, 1784, when Hunt gave Hinds ſuch ſatisfaction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the points that he complained of, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ſeemed to be ſettled betwixt them; until in the evening Hinds again brought up his accuſation againſt Hunt, of his injuring the truth, in ſaying he was of that committee. Upon which I aroſe, and ſaid, <q>I ſolemnly warn you againſt going on in this way, you will ruin yourſelf.</q> In March following, he came to my houſe, and told me, he would not take the warning at my hands. On April 26, I wrote to him, and reminded him of the divine rules in MAT. xviii. 4.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020213_0005_0FAE487669949B88"/>LUKE xxii. 26, and then ſaid, <q>It appeared to my conſcience, that you indulged a ſeverity towards brother Hunt, that you would not receive as right towards you, from any man in the world.</q> To this he wrote an anſwer on May 1, wherein, after trying to juſtify his ſeverity, he ſaid, <q>Pray my good friend; don't let that or any other man ſeparate us, as MARK did greater and better men than we.</q> To this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied on May 31, and ſaid, "I am very certain that our chief danger does not lie in that place. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly here, You have from time to time laid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints before me againſt your brethren, for which you have broken fellowſhip with them, and, in the caſe in hand, with an elder, ſo as to refuſe to hear him preach, without ever allowing me a hearing thereof in a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel way." This he denied, and wrote to our church for a hearing upon it; and they granted it, on Auguſt 11, 1784. But then he refuſed to ſtate or ſupport any charge againſt me, and inſiſted upon my proving the truth of what I had writen, nine miles from my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. This appeared ſo unreaſonable, that our church diſmiſſed the caſe, to be ſettled betwixt ourſelves, and Hinds went off; upon which deacon Alden aroſe, and railed at our church, at a high rate, and his holding with Hinds in that line of conduct hath moved him to forſake our meeting for above three years paſt.</p>
            <p>Elder Hinds made three attempts more to croud that caſe into our church, without letting me know what it was that he denied in my letter; but not being able to do it, he was forced to grant me a hearing in your church, April 29, 1785; when he owned that he had from time to time informed me of actions that he was offended with in his brethren, and who were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured therefor; but he ſaid my words meant that he had done it before they were cenſured, and that his doing it was the cauſe of their cenſure; a meaning which I never thought of till that day. On May 4, 1785, I wrote a plain ſtate of theſe facts to your church, and then ſaid, "the main ſupport of Antichriſt, from his firſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020213_0006_0FAE4877226CA710"/>riſe to this day, has been by teachers accounting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much greater than the churches, as to unite all their influence againſt diſſenters from their judgments, and then calling in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ular arm to ſupport them, and to enforce all their meaſures." And I informed you, that as elder Hinds had openly broken fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with me, you muſt not expect that I ſhould join with him again, until he explicitly renounced thoſe evils. This he hath never done; but in general terms he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he held them, before our mutual council of Nov. 16, 178<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and then denied the truth of facts, in four particulars, without giving a fair opportunity for ſupporting them by evidence, by which means the council ſaid in their reſult, that the crimes I had charged him with were not ſufficiently proved to them. At the ſame time they fully juſtified the reſult of the council of March 15, 1785, in their condemning your cenſure upon brother Samuel Nelſon and others, becauſe they did not allow that Hinds's confeſſion was equal to the offences that he was judged to be guilty of by your mutual council of Sept. 28, 1784. On May 24. 1786, I wrote to elder Hinds, and ſtated plainly the four points wherein he denied the truth, before the council of Nov. 16, 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5, without giving fair opportunity to prove them, and deſired that theſe things might be ſettled in a goſpel way. This he hath not anſwered; but he hath ſince been guilty of the followlng evils.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He publiſhed a pamphlet laſt ſummer, called <hi>A Hiſtory of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> wherein are ſundry things, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our former ſeparation from the ruling ſect in New-England, which are directly contrary to fact.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In your church meeting October 8, 1784 he declared that he was ſorry he had reported ſo many that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, and promiſed not to do ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> pamphlet he hath violated that promiſe to a high degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020213_0007_0FAE4877FB221B78"/>
Thirdly, Though he readily went to the council cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by an excommunicated man, June 11, 1782, and tried to debar elder Hunt from the privilege of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himſelf, after which he brought and read accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt him to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in his abſence; yet Hinds hath now accuſed me of being worſe than the heathen, only becauſe I went to the council of June 15, 1784, called by ſeven of your aggrieved brethren, and heard ſome complaints againſt Hinds in his abſence, and then adjourned to give him opportunity for anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering thereto. p. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In ſaid pamphlet he hath plainly manifeſted the ſame temper that he had, when he refuſed to come to the council of March 15, 1785, at their earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, to give them what light he could in caſes that were to be laid before them; and now he hath accuſed them with <hi>lying,</hi> without ſo much as ſubſcribing his name to the accuſation. p. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Though our church requeſted a free confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with yours upon the affairs between us, on the 11th. inſtant, to give and receive light as God ſhould direct, and received a promiſe of that privilege; yet when we came to the meeting, and I attempted to give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I could not retract thoſe former charges that I had laid againſt elder Hinds, he, and a party with him, poſitively refuſed to grant me that liberty; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeal to all your conſciences, whether he ought not to be excluded from your communion until he offers goſpel ſatisfaction for the foregoing offences to others, as well as to your injured brother.</p>
