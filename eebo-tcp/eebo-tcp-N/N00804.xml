            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epiſtle Dedicatory, To the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>N. England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT can incur no juſt Cenſure that we addreſs our ſelves to the Churches of Chriſt here in the following Sheets, inaſmuch as they are but a Reply to a Book lately dedicated unto them. Nor does our zeal, (we hope) for Truth, the Honour of God, &amp; the Safety, Peace &amp; Flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing of theſe Churches come ſhort of what our Reverend Author may be inſpired with in his performance We make the ſame glorious Pretence with him to maintain &amp; defend the Order of the Goſpel, altho' we cannot allow what is ſuggeſted in the Title page. That every Principle ſo ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contended for in that Treatiſe, is either profeſſed or practiſed by the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>New-England.</hi> One part, at leaſt, therefore of his Book the Reverend Author ought to have publiſhed in his own Name, and not have obtruded it on the Churches here, whoſe Practiſe never gave grounds to ſuſpect them leavened with ſo groſs thoughts, as particularly his Doctrine of the Ordination of Miniſters is.</p>
            <p>We will not gueſs at the Authors ſecret aim, or whom in particular he raiſes his Batteries againſt We'd cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably hope he has no private Intereſt to bribe him in this Affair; and we hope for a like favourable and candid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this Reply. Indeed the Name prefix't to that faulty Treatiſe, may be preſumed, with a multitude of prejudiced People, to weigh down all the Reaſons and
<pb facs="unknown:000967_0004_0FAE3981ACD72428"/>
Arguments which can poſſibly be brought for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. And we have no ſuch advantage to boaſt of; yet are happy in this, that we are not over-awed by any Name, and the Truth we know is greater, and more venerable than all things.</p>
            <p>Its well known how liberal ſome men are of the odious brand of <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> for every one who cannot digeſt the late publiſhed Orders: but, without arrogance, we aſſume, as more due, the Title of <hi>Proficients,</hi> and doubt not to make it out, that our diſſent from many of them is ſo far from a going back from any Goſpel T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is a groundleſs Calumny which is ſuggeſted, <hi>That a latitude beyond what our Author contends for, is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But wherein do they conſiſt? not in the Brethrens challenging any part of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not in impoſing upon others any thing which Chriſt has not impoſed! which is but a debarring Chriſtians of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges they have a right to. But they conſiſt (as we conceive) in ſuch things as theſe. That our Conſciences be not impoſed on by Men or their Traditions, Chriſt being the alone Lord of the Conſcience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. That Believers are through Chriſt, freed from the guilt and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin, from the curſe of the Law, and from the ſting and terror of Death. That we have the liberties of Gods Houſe and Ordinances, &amp; therein communion with God. That we may have the benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for this, we bewail it, and look upon it as a Reproach to the Land, and would therefore countenance no ſuch Principles or Practices as have any tendency to ſuch Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>Again, ſome have made this the great Deſign, to be freed from the Impoſitions of Men in the Worſhip of God, wherewith they were ſometimes burthened; and as they fought freedom for themſelves, we cannot ſuppoſe they deſign'd to impoſe upon others In this we are riſen up to make good their grounds.</p>

namely, to ſequeſter themſelves into a quiet corner of the World, where they might enjoy Chriſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt Inſtitutions, and leave them uncorrupted to Poſterity; and the gain-ſaying or counter working this, is, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, to caſt diſhonour upon them, or call them fools.</p>
            <p>This Charge falls heavy on thoſe who are for impoſing their will on others We crave no more but to enjoy the Inſtitutions of Chriſt unmix't And it appears very ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 8. the Reverend Author is pleaſed to number up ſeven or eight erronious Doctrines, as he apprehends them to be; &amp; the conſequence from all is this, that if we eſpouſe theſe Principles, we give away the whole <hi>Congregational Cauſe</hi> at once. Whence we perceive now the profeſſed cauſe which the Author engages in; tho' we hope it is not the Name or the Party, but the Truths they defend. We ſhall have occaſion to examine theſe Principles hereafter; it may ſuffice here to ſay, they are <hi>craftily</hi> &amp; <hi>unfairly worded,</hi> &amp; in the Dreſs they are here clad, we do not eſpouſe them; yet according to their moſt fair &amp; genuine conſtruction there is a great deal of Truth in moſt of them.

            <p>But what will the Reader think if we ſhould make an Apology after all for the Reverend Author, and aſſure him he means no more, than that Miniſters ought not to admit known Infidels or Prophane; for, for his part, he pretends not to know mens hearts.

            <p>We ſhall not here examine the force of the Authors arguments, whether they unreſiſtably conclude, or not; and whether the conſequence is good from the tryal of the Apoſtles, the Porters at the Temple, or the 12 Angels at the Gates of the Myſtical <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the tryal of Church Members.

Church to a mans Body, and ſhows the diſtinct offices and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the reſpective Members, as the Eye and Ear, the Hand and Foot.

God has ſet ſome in his Church, firſt, <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſecondarily, <hi>Prophets,</hi> thirdly, <hi>Teachers</hi>— and in the cloſe of the 14. chap. he adds, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi> The reſult of all is this.</p>

            <p>The Context ſuppoſes an Offender, and the wronged party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt him; and here are three ſteps the diſſatisfied Perſon is directed to take, in order to heal the wound given, 1.) To tell the Offender his fault in private. 2) To tell him before 2 or 3 wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and if the end be not obtained; 3.) To tell it to the Church. Suppoſe now a Perſon acting according to this Rule (as we could give inſtances if need were) when the firſt ſtep did not gain his Brother, nor the ſecond anſwer the end, at laſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied Perſon carried the caſe to the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and now he reckoned he had told it to the Church.

Here the Rule was attended, the Church told, the offendor healed, the wronged Perſon ſatisfied, and the matter iſſued, when the Brotherhood all this while knew nothing of it. It is evident from the next verſe, that by the Church muſt be meant thoſe who had Power to bind and looſe, which Power Chriſt had given to the Apoſtles. Moreover let the ſenſe be that the Offence is to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But if Scripture will not prove the Power of the Brethren, poſſibly ſome venerable Maxim may do the feat. <hi>Quod tangit omnes deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely it is no divine Oracle, it neither came from Heaven, nor is it according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men upon Earth. If a maſter of a family take in a ſojou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nor or a ſervant; all are concerned, but their vote is not asked. If a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain liſt a Souldier, all the Company is concerned, but it is done by his Authority, without asking their leave. And pray carry this m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m to the Colledge, and ſee if the Preſident and Fellows will ſtand by it in their admiſſions. If it be objected, that even in all theſe caſes if there be any ſufficient reaſons preſented by thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, a prudent Ruler will yield to it; we eaſily grant it, and therefore its not unfit that men be propoſed to the Congregation, if there be any thing to object againſt their lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another argument for the Brethrens Power in admiſſion, is, leſt the whole Power ſhould ſometimes reſide in the hands of a ſingle Miniſter, and that this is unreaſonable we have a Speech quoted from the <hi>Preſbiterian Miniſters</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> But it is ſtrangely perverted from their true meanning, as appears not only from the whole ſeries and ſcope of the Book, but alſo from what is expreſſed in the page quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (<hi>p.</hi> 71.) where they ſay,
<q>That the Power cannot be placed in the whole Church collectively taken.</q>
The Scripture makes an exact diſtinction between Rulers and ruled. They only plead that there ſhould be more Rulers in a Church then one; or that, when there are more, then the Power belongs to the whole meaning, the ruli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g Elders as well as the Teaching. And what is that to the Power of the Brethren? One officer has Power in plain caſes to act in the Kings name.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Saviour did frequently ſend forth his Diſciples two and two. But yet <hi>Phillip</hi> was ſent alone to baptize the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But we altogether deny a Church Covenant in the following ſenſe,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000967_0022_0FAE39CE1BC920F0"/>
and ſay, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has no where appointed in his Word, that there ſhould be a Covenant enter'd into by ſome Perſons of a Chriſtian Society, excluſive of the reſt, whereby they being in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant one with another, ſhould thereby call themſelves a Church of Chriſt, making the Ordinances of Chriſt, or any of them to depend on this Covenant, ſo that thoſe who ſcruple it, or refuſe to joyn i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it, ſhall on that account, not enjoy them. And that thoſe who are thus covenanted, or the major part of them, have power to make or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make Officers, to admit or reject Church Members, to mannage Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to order the affairs of Chriſts Houſe in his Name, as if they had warrant and commiſſion from him ſo to do. Of ſuch a Church Covenant neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor Chriſt himſelf, the Prophets nor the Apoſtles have ſpoke any thing. None of the Scriptures, Arguments or Quotations of our Reverend Author prove any thing of it. We will take leave therefore to call it Mans Covenant, and not Gods, for it has not Gods Seal affixed to it; &amp; though good, wiſe or learned men may endeavour to obtrude it, and pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad, its harmleſs, edifying, or for the Intereſt of Religion, yet according to the afore-quoted Rule of the reverend Mr. <hi>Willard,</hi> we are to reject it, and ſhall do ſo, till it comes with a divine Stamp.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly this may be called a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſrepreſentation.</hi> You will ſay, Who owns it, or will plead for it in this Dreſs? <hi>We Anſwer,</hi> by querying, Whether there be not ſeveral that own and plead for the things contained in it? We wiſh there were a leſs Number. But to evince it, let us take it into the ſeveral parts. Are there none that plead for a ſeperate Covenant, which ſome (and generally the leſſer part) muſt enter into? and if it be good, and for good ends, why muſt ſo many be excluded? If it be to reform Manners, if to maintain the Miniſtry and Worſhip of God, if to lay ſtricter Bonds of Duty, if to bring men more effectually to ſubmit to Diſcipline, why then are not the whole brought in? for the whole Congregation are oblig'd to theſe Duties, and why muſt the Covenant be ſeperate?</p>
            <p>Again, do not ſome plead, it is requiſit, in order to a Perſons par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Lords Supper? But did our Lord Jeſus Chriſt require any ſuch thing when he firſt inſtituted that holy Sacrament? Did the Apoſtles when they adminiſtred it? Was it the term of Communion in the primitive Church? or where is the Scripture that comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000967_0023_0FAE39CF192F9DD8"/>
it? and why ſhould Gods holy Ordinances be annexed to Mans Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Again, do not ſome plead, that thoſe who thus covenant, have the Power to make and unmake Officers? The Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will not ſcape here, whoſe Opinion in this matter we ſhall ſee herea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter. And, <hi>finally,</hi> do not ſome pretend, That theſe are the Perſons commiſſioned by Chriſt, for the admitting and rejecting of Church Members? This the Reverend Author defends with all his Might, under the third Queſtion, tho', as we ſhowed, he could find no Proof. And ſo much for the Church Covenant, which is a ſtranger to the Scripture, and has no foundation in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Q. 6. <hi>Is publick Reading of the Scriptures, without explication or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation there-with, part of the Work incumbent on a Minister of the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author does not mean, (as we ſuppoſe,) if there be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or exhortation throughout the whole time of exerciſe. If he doth, he fights with the air, for we know no Sect of Men but have ſome explication, tho' many among us neglect reading. We therefore take his ſenſe to be this, If no explication follow immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately without the interpoſition of Prayer, or any other part of divine Worſhip. For we conceive that the ordinary preaching the Word may very properly be call'd <hi>expoſition, explication</hi> &amp; <hi>exhortation,</hi> and that in every Sermon there is a competent portion of Scripture for one time explicated and applyed. Nor can we imagine, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author means that every clauſe a Miniſter reads in publick ſhould be in a formal manner explicated: Methinks it ſhould ſatisfie, if after one or more Chapters read, ſome ſelect clauſe, verſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But as for the Brethren, We need not go to them, to make a ſecond Speech, now to ask leave to with-draw, and to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to every impertinent Talker who thinks the man Married to him, and that his bed is broke into, or that there's no juſt reaſon for a divorce.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſome people are forever diſſatisfied; neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of Habitation, liking the others Miniſtry, profiting under it, or diſlike of ſome Cuſtoms and Practices which he would willingly be rid of the light of, can ſatisfy. And what muſt the grieved perſon do further in this caſe? Why, truly he has done his duty, and may hear and communicate, where God and his own ſober Conſcience directs him.
