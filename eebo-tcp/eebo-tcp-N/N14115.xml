         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE PEOPLE AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.</head>
            <p>THE following publication is intended to convey a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations to my fellow citizens, on a new <hi>Society or Inſtitution</hi> lately eſtabliſhed throughout the continent, compoſed of the Major-Generals, Brigadiers, and other Officers of our army. It is inſtituted by the name of "THE SOCIETY OF THE CIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINNATI;" and it has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to conſiderable ſtrength and matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity already. For beſides the Grand or <hi>General Society</hi> of this order, a ſubordinate or <hi>State Society</hi> is eſtabliſhed in each ſtate, and theſe again ſubdivided "into ſuch diſtricts as ſhall be directed by the State So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. The General Society is to be held on the firſt Monday in May annually, ſo long as they ſhall deem neceſſary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at leaſt once in every three years. The ſtate Societies are to meet the fourth of July annually, or oftner, if they ſhall find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient."</p>
            <p>Major-General Baron Steuben is appointed <hi>Grand Maſter of the Order,</hi> under the more humble title of <hi>Preſident;</hi> and each State Society as well as the Grand one has alſo its Preſident, Vice-Preſident, Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Treaſurer and Vice Treaſurer. Annual communications of the States with each other, by circular letters are enjoined: "And the General Meeting of the Society, ſhall conſiſt of its officers, and a repreſentation from each ſtate in number not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding five: whoſe expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ces ſhall be borne by the reſpective State Societies." So that here are delegates to be ſent to form a general convention or congreſs of the order. They have alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a badge of honour, or what they call "an Order by which its members ſhall be known and diſtinguiſhed. It is a medal of gold in the figure of an eagle, with an inſcription on the face and reverſe, alluding to the time of eſtabliſhing the order, and to their having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed the republic. And this badge of diſtinction, is to be ſuſpended by a deep blue ribbon two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>es wide, edged with white, deſcriptive of the Union between America and France." and to be worn by each member, as the French and Britiſh nobility wear their ſtars and ribbons, the inſignia of their peerage. They have already conferred the honour and freedom of their Order on his excellency the French Ambaſſador, his excellency the Sieur Gerard, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> miniſter plenipotentiary, the count d'Eſtaing, count de Graſſe, count de Barras, the chevalier de Touches, count Rochambeau, and the generals and colonels of his army. And it is reported that ſeveral crowned heads and princes in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, are to dignify it by becoming honorary members of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for political reaſons no doubt, winks at it; and no one ſtate, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> body of men in any one of them, have given it the leaſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The diſcretion of the commander in chief, which I take to be his diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic, is ſignal on this occaſion; for he has appeared quite neutral in this buſineſs, if we except his becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017863_0003_0FA373B821B574A0"/>an honorary member of it. I believe the officers do not declare themſelves to each other; and that on this occaſion, there is too much truth in the remark of an able philoſopher, "that there is no man who lets his neareſt friend ſee the bottom of his heart."</p>
            <p>The more I reflect on this inſtitution, and the political conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it will involve, the more am I filled with aſtoniſhment, that ſelf created as it is, and coming upon us in ſo bold and queſtionable an appearance, ſo deeply planned, and cloſely executed, yet that it ſhould have been ſo little attended to, that it is not even the ſubject of private converſation. Could I for a moment view this Order with indifference, it would be impoſſible not to ſmile, to behold the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace of America, in their town committees and town meetings, ſo keenly bent on petty miſchiefs, in full chaſe and cry after a few inſignifican tories, and running on regardleſs of an eſtabliſhment, which ere long muſt ſtrip the poſterity of the middling and lower claſſes of every influence or authority, and leave them nothing but inſignificance, contempt, and the wretched privilege of murmuring when it is too late. So thoughtleſs are the multitude!</p>
            <p>My deſign at preſent is to ſhew, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> What this Order or Society ſeems to be; in the next place, To demonſtrate what it really is, and will turn out to be; and laſtly, To prove there is an abſolute neceſſity of extirpating it altogether.</p>
            <p>From the outſide appearance of their <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> or inſtrument of writing which combines this Order, and which has been ſent thro' the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The quotations I have made are the words of the General <hi>Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation:</hi> ſo that it ſeems to be the offspring of patriotiſm, friendſhip, and humanity. And that many of the officers who have not cloſely viewed the ſubject, favour it from thoſe principles, I have no doubt. But as ſeveral of them are equal in knowledge and abilities to any men in America, it is hardly poſſible but that ſome of them muſt ſee into the nature and conſequences of the inſtitution. For, to come to the ſecond part of my argument, it is in reality, and will turn out to be, <hi>an hereditary peerage;</hi> a nobility to them and their <hi>male
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017863_0004_0FA373B88680EAC0"/>iſſue,</hi> and in default thereof, to the <hi>collateral branches:</hi> what the lawyers would call—A title of peerage of Cincinnati to them and their heirs male, remainder to their heirs general.</p>
            <p>The ſixth article of our confederation ſays, "Nor ſhall the United States in Congreſs aſſembled, nor any of them grant any title of nobility." But the order of Cincinnati uſurp a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>obrlity without gift or grant, in defiance of Congreſs and the ſtates, as I ſhall ſhew preſently. And though the order cannot, at preſent be ſanctified by legal authority, yet t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> makes nothing againſt the conſequences which will enſue. Though the Order is ſelf-created, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of a general law of the Union; yet if the courage of the officers does not fail them: if they but keep up with firmneſs and perſeverance againſt oppoſition, for this will be but trifling, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking are the people; if they have but patience, ſubtilty, and addreſs to cloke their deſign under a pious name of raiſing a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fund; ſo as to make it go down only for a few years; even of they are obliged from policy to lay aſide the <hi>badge and blue ribbon:</hi> My life for it, they will have leiſure to laugh at, and maſter their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents. And the next generation will drink as deep of noble blood, and a hereditary peerage be as firmly ſettled in each potent family, and rive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted in our government, as any order of nobility is in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>narchies of Europe. This Order is planted in a fiery, hot ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thirſt for power; and its branches will end in tyranny. The Cincinnati will ſoon be corrupted, and the ſpirit of the people depreſſed; for in leſs than a century it will occaſion ſuch an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the condition of our inhabitants, that the country will be compoſed only of two ranks of men; the patricians or nobles, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>abble. This is the natural reſult of an eſtabliſhment, whoſe departure is ſo ſudden from our open profeſſions of republicaniſm, that it muſt give a thinking mind moſt melancholy forebodings. This creating of a nobility, and breaking through our conſtitution, juſt as we were ſetting out in the world, is making that liberty which the Almighty has given us, a means for feeding our pride; and turning the bleſſings of Providence into a curſe upon us.</p>
            <p>Had this order been created by Congreſs or our own legiſlature, even in violation of the confederation and of our laws, I ſhould not think it a matter of ſuch moment dukes, earls, or peers of the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnati, ſanctified by an act of Aſſembly or of Congreſs, would be underſtood by all of us. Their pretenſions and excluſive privileges, the mode of their trial for life and death, &amp;c. aſcertained. But the ſelf-created Cincinnati, like a proud imperious man, would ſet no bounds to its claims. Jealous that it held not any thing on its own ambitious terms, as they had cut and carved titles for themſelves and their poſterity, they would be ſtill graſping for every thing, and riſing from one uſurpation to another, as they ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>Let us examine the oſtenſible reaſons for inſtituting the Cincin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati. Firſt, "to perpetuate the remembrance of the revolution." But will not the hiſtorian more effectually tranſmit to poſterity, the memory of the revolution, and the illuſtrious actions atchieved in bringing it about? And as to "preſerving inviolate the exalted rights of human nature; theſe rights will in my opinion be much better preſerved inviolate by having no <hi>diſtinct order</hi> of patricians or nobility among us: which, however thought neceſſary to ſupport the throne of a prince, or form a barrier between him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is a bane and a curſe to a republic; for unleſs you deſtroy the one, you cannot have the other.</p>
            <p>Again. They will "attend inceſſantly to preſerve inviolate the exalted rights of human nature." Are there then, moſt illuſtrious
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017863_0005_0FA373B947B73458"/>Cincinnati, two ſorts of rights belonging to human nature? Is there one kind, ſubordinate, and on a level with the humble condition of Plebeians? and others <hi>more exalted,</hi> which the citizens are incapable of preſerving inviolate, without the <hi>inceſſant watching</hi> of a dignified or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of patricians? They muſt mean this or nothing. The people of America, it ſeems, are not fit to be truſted with their own <hi>national honor,</hi> or their own affairs, unleſs the Order takes the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and direction of them. Can contradiction be more ſtrong and glaring? In one moment they in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtitute an order, and raiſe a <hi>diſtinction,</hi> which looks down, as from an high mountain, on all beneath them: They have laid in ruins that fine, plain, level ſtate of civil equality, over which the ſight of the beholder paſſed with pleaſure: which God laid out for our uſe and happineſs, and which our Laws and the nature of a Republican government promiſed us: They have violated all; yet in the ſame breath, by way of a maſk thrown over their doings, they ſpread before us the fine words laſt quoted. But the diſguiſe is too thin: for in the name of Heaven, can any man in his ſenſes believe that the remaining rights of the people which are yet left untouched, will not be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and violated, by men, who diſdaining the condition of private citizens, as below them, left it, and mounted up to the elevated and excluſive dignity of hereditary title?</p>
            <p>But ſay they, "an order of nobility will give ſtrength, duration, and reverence to our government." Has not the war of America, I ſay, convinced mankind that ſociety in the moſt trying conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and fierceſt dangers, can do better without them? When we firſt ſet out we had ſcarcely a diſtinction among us: for the body of our people was chiefly compoſed of Yeomanry. But though they had no titles nor badges, they ſoon produced excellent officers, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and ſtateſmen: and every corner of America, at this moment, abounds with men, as well militia as continentals, as capable of command in cavalry or infantry, as any regular officers Europe can boaſt of. This military virtue of our citizens: their ſenſe of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and contempt of danger; the gallant efforts they made; was not this, I ſay, the offspring of the equality and independent temper of men, who fought for themſelves, and not for maſters; and whoſe ſpirit was not trammeled or broken down by the oppreſſion of an inſolent nobility? This was that warm animating pride which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to look up to any human creature as a ſuperior, which raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us armies, and fought campaigns without pay or covering: efforts ſo glorious, as never were, nor can poſſibly be made by any nation where a nobility have got a conſiderable footing.</p>
            <p>But if this order prevails in our country, the generous gallant virtues of the preſent day will ſoon be extinguiſhed, never to appear again. What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The other pretext is, "to promote and cheriſh between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſtates, Union and National Honour." But I have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to tell Baron Steuben, that though an order of peerage may

And it is equally probable that they would produce in ſome future generation of American plebeians, ſuch an admiration and idolatry, that would in the fervor of its operation, as in Rome of old, enable ſome leading man of the Order to ſet up a tyranny. Some ſycophant poet would not be wanting to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the talents which God gave him, for the vile purpoſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Ariſing ſolely from the ignominious <hi>diſtinction</hi> between the Commons, and the Patricians, as an hereditary order: who from the expulſion of the Tarquins, to the time of the Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, about 300 years, produced ſuch perpetual diſcord and tumults in that republic, that nothing but its good fortune and military virtue preſerved it ſo long from deſtruction. At laſt when the people became corrupted, their diſſentions ſwelled to open rupture, or civil war. Sylla heading the nobility, and Marius the commons, The latter being compleatly vanquiſhed, the conqueror, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual dictator, ſet up a tyranny; and exerciſed confiſcation, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and every other ſpecies of cruelty which marks a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly people. Still civil diſcord admitted of no ceſſation; for in a ſhort time afterwards, the fire broke out with multiplied fury,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017863_0007_0FA373BAC84DDAC0"/>under Caeſar, the leader of the commons, and Pompey, at the head of the nobility. The event is well known; Caeſar triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over his adverſary, and over the liberty of his fellow citizens; and the whole ended in a cruel deſpotiſm. And thus ſo many wars carried on—ſo many illuſtrious actions performed by that gallant people, only to gratify the ambition of an order, ſimilar to the Cincinnati, but in its origin by no means ſo reſpectable, as I ſhall preſently ſhew; and finally to become the ſlaves of barbarous maſters, the Roman Emperors.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ew plain notorious facts, to prove, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this nobility is not the way to promote and cheriſh <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Natural Honour.</hi> Out of it will ariſe <hi>diſcord</hi> and not <hi>union.</hi> And that the people ſhould, without ſo much as ſaying a word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter, behold this poiſonous <hi>exotic</hi> plant taking root throughout the land. That they ſhould commit ſuch a vile abuſe of their liberty as to allow it, is a reproach upon human nature; and would, in the eyes of poſterity, be a national diſhonour to us. I have often thought that the revolution in America would reduce it to a certainty, whether mankind was deſtined by nature for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or flavery, for a republican government never before has had, what we call fair play, in any part of the globe. But the Order of Cincinnati would give a fatal wound to civil liberty thro' the world, and prove that all that Plato, Sidney, Locke and others have bequeathed to poſterity on the ſubject of political happineſs, though appearing well on paper, yet was no more than ideal pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a ſine magination. Our example too would ſerve to ſtrengthen tyranny in Europe, by evincing that a people brought up under a monarchy, and accuſtomed to be governed by others, are too degenerate to govern themſelves in a ſtate of liberty and that after all we have done, we ſtill keep a hankering after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, titles and trumpery we have been uſed to under the royal government, where the people are ſo bewitched, that abilities, virtue or wealth itſelf, are not ſuch objects of reverence as a ſtar or ribbon.</p>
            <p>The following clauſe of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> I think an extraordinary one. <q>The officers of the American army having generally been taken from the citizens of America, poſſeſs high veneration for the character o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at illuſtrious Roman, Lucius Quintus Cineinnatus; and being reſolved to follow his example, by returning to their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizenſhip, they think they may with propriety denominate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſociety of the Cincinnati.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then as they were taken from the citizens, why in the name of God not be contented "to return to citizenſhip," without uſurping an hereditary order? or with what "propriety can they denominate" themſelves from Cincinnatus, with an ambition ſo renk, as to aim at nothing leſs, than <hi>Otrum cum dignitate, "retirement and a peerage?"</hi> Did that virtuous Roman, having ſubdued the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his country, and returned home to tend his vineyard and plant his cabbages, did he confer an hereditary order of peerage on himſelf and his fellow ſoldiers? I anſwer, No; it was more than he dared to do. For a leſs crime, that republic, in the days of its liberty, put to death, baniſhed or diſgraced ſome of her citizens, as illuſtrious and renowned as any we have, without exception.</p>
            <p>The Romans had learned from ſad experience, a leſſon which ſeems to be brought home to ourſelves in the example before me; that military commanders acquiring fame, and accuſtomed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the obedience of armies, are generally in their hearts ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craties, and enemies to the popular equality of a republic. That
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017863_0008_0FA373BB877BF078"/>becoming illuſtrious by their ſervices, they are ever ready, under plauſable appearances of <hi>juſtice and merit,</hi> to aſſume uſurpations of of the moſt pernicious tendency. The people firſt adore them with a ſtupid veneration, which ſwells their pride; enables them to form factions; procure followers; create diſtinctions; aggrandize their families; ſplit the ſtate into diviſions, and like Caeſar, Cromwell, and others, under the ſmoke they had created, raiſe themſelves to deſpotiſm. This is the reaſon that in wiſe republics, ſuch citizens were ſo often and ſo juſtly put out of the way; baniſhed their country; or excluded from dignities or influence. And their fame and eclat was thought an ample reward to conſole them under it. It is probable therefore that it was as much through fear, as repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican virtue, that Cincinnatus and his officers were reſtrained from inſtituting a new order; for I do not ſuppoſe they were either bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worſe than our own. Only that republic had wiſe laws t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> bridle the ambition and controul the factions of potent citizens, and we have as yet no ſuch laws.</p>
            <p>I know it will be denied, that the Order is, what I do holdly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it to be, an <hi>hereditary peerage.</hi> Some of its members aſſume the cloak of political modeſty, and under it talk, that they are no more dangerous than a city corporation of "ſhop-keepers, taylors, or other mechanics; or like the Free Maſons and other clubs who wear badges or medals." Here we ſee how ambition can aſſume all ſhapes and colours; and humble itſelf to the very duſt to accompliſh its purpoſe! This moment take upon them the ſuperintendence of empire, the <hi>honour, union and happineſs of nations,</hi> and the <hi>exalted rights of human nature;</hi> and the very next, proſtrate themſelves to the level of men, with whom to be compared on any other occaſion, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would deem an inſult. I ſay, that a body of military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of ſociety under an inſtitution founded on the illuſtrious actions of ſo ſingular a revolution as that of America: inveſted with the excluſive privilege of wearing a badge of their order, honourable to themſelves, as it is ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the people; elevated above others, and in parity among themſelves: Theſe, I ſay, are peers of the realm, <hi>pares regni,</hi> and nothing more or leſs. And that this order being entailed on the <hi>male iſſue,</hi> and in default thereof, on the <hi>collateral line,</hi> makes it <hi>heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi> And whether it be inſtituted by the legiſlature, who alone have the legal power to do it, or be uſurped by the officers, it makes no difference in its conſequences. For as I obſerved before, in one generation the order of Cincinnati will be eſtabliſhed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably. The rank, number and influence of the members; the remembrance of their glorious actions, ſtill heightened by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of mankind to the marvellous: all this, I ſay, will raiſe the order to grandeur, antiquity, veneration and arbitrary power; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions which will become here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017863_0009_0FA373BC45DC59D8"/>And admitting the preſent members would not abuſe it; is any one certain, that their children will make no ill uſe of it? The officers can tranſmit to their poſterity, their fortunes, their reputation, and the peerage of Cincinnati: but can they leave to them, as a legacy, that virtue which lately led them to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the hardſhips of a perilous war? Or when the preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is off the ſtage, will the ſons of our ſelf-created patricians, who will not experience the adverſity their fathers bore in defending their liberties; will they, finding themſelves raiſed above their neighbours, agree to deſcend, and live on a footing of equality with them? Or will they not rather, relying on the rank and power of an ariſtocratic nobility, diſdaining private men, nor ſtanding in fear of public laws engroſs the offices, powers and influence of the republic, which ſhould belong to the body of the people? Or in caſe any ambitions leader, or a few, ſhould threaten the liberties of the commons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Congreſs on a future day, inveſted with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, a fleet and army, attempt a point of conſequence: will they not ſupport the one or the other, as it will be moſt likely to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their order? In ſuch a diſpute their weight would turn the ſcale; for the number of the peers of the order, reckoning honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry members (which their good policy would lead them to chooſe out of the firſt rate men) cannot be far ſhort of ten thouſand; and as they will be the principal men in America, to ſuppoſe that each can, by his influence, procure two or three followers, who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to his intereſt and ſervice, is a reaſonable calculation. Here is a body of 20 or 30,000 men immediately; and every generation will be adding to the number.</p>
            <p>Had our officers leſs merit and claim to the applauſe of their countrymen at home, and to ſame abroad, I ſhould not be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at this bold uſurpation of theirs. For a claſs of men of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth, could never have influence to render an inſtitution of this nature detrimental to the freedom of their country. It would rather meet with ridicule, and dwindle into nothing. But it muſt be remembered, that a ſeries of hardy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gallant, ſplendid actions, through a fierce and deſperate conflict; their toils and ſufferings: and their patience under them; and above all, the glorious ſucceſs which crowned the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have rendered the officers of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army, the moſt renowned band of men, that this day walk on the face of the globe. And was it as well acquainted as I am, with the temper of goodneſs and humanity which runs thro' the whole of them, they would be as much beloved as they are admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Their bravery the world knows: But as it is not foreign to my ſubject, I ſhall give an example of their good ſenſe and philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, on a very eminent occaſion. It will be a conſiderable aid to me, while I try to give an idea of their general character.</p>
            <p>The ſouthern army was encamped near Jackſonborough, and covered our aſſembly in 1782, while it was driving down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation buſineſs; which has made ſo much noiſe, and out of which daily multiply ſo many unforeſeen miſchiefs. And it may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of remarking, that from the commander down to the rugged, ragged centinel, the army in general held that act in deteſtation. The officers mixed with the members of both houſes during the ſeſſion, and oppoſed the meaſure with cool, gentleman-like reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which I believe was one cauſe, that the liſt of the proſcribed was no larger than it is.

            <p>If we trace nobility up to the head in Venice and other parts of Europe, we ſhall find it in every nation ſmall and contemptible but that the very creating a <hi>public diſtinct order,</hi> uniformly terminated in every country, in ſervitude to the people.

            <p>But although the force of thoſe remarks is well known to men of ſenſe of the army, yet they cannot be contented with the reputation which their ſervices have ſecured to them, unleſs they appropriate an hereditary peerage. <hi>Except their pay,</hi> I cannot ſee any thing they want to ſatisfy them, unleſs that their eclat being ſo univerſal, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity has, like a miſtreſs after poſſeſſion, loſt her charms in their eyes; they conſider her too common, and ſeek ſome other beauty out of the ordinary way. Are not their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens already as far below many of them, as the earth is below the Heavens? Or can the glory of a human creature go higher, than it has carried ſome of them? Is it not enough that

            <p>This revolution (and I cannot call it by any other name) was effected <hi>by law,</hi> in the famous Jackſonborough aſſembly—whereby the great body of the people was debarred from the right of vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

The more we look into the Jackſonborough buſineſs, the more do the political misfortunes of it croud upon our view; like a conflagration in a city, to the ravages it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made, it is, according to the direction of the winds, hourly adding more, that were never foreſeen nor thought of. And it may be truly ſaid to have turned its fury againſt the incendiaries who help to light it; for moſt of them were flaunch republicans, and paſſionatly fond of liberty. But from their wanton, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant abuſe of their power as legiſtato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>To apply the force of this remark here, I muſt obſerve, that in the Jackſon borough proceedings, our firſt-rate men were the leaders and drivers, till the buſineſs was gone through. For the others with hearts fully bent on it, had not heads to contrive a miſchief of ſuch magnitude. But after it was over, the gentry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, diſcovered more inclination to undo what was paſt, and were touched more with compaſſion than the other, for the miſeries they had created. I believe this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> more owing to the effects of education, which humaniſes the mind, than to policy, in the ways of which they are not as yet ſufficiently hackneyed, however the thing itſelf has gained them conſiderable weight, while the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy is ſunk in ruin. For the generality begin to look up to the few, as alone poſſeſſing the prudence and policy of a civilized peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alone worthy of holding the reins of the republic; while the democratic part of our Aſſembly are eyed, as unfeeling and inconſiderate, and making no ſcruple to abuſe their power; even to the trampling on the laws and rights of their fellow citizens, for the glorious-exploit of hunting down a Tory. In ſhort, the public opinion and power of the government, is on the ſide of the ariſtocracy; at the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Theſe remarks may appear trivial to ſome of my readers: but they are worthy, in my opinion, the attention of the philoſopher and hiſtorian. They ſerve to ſhew, that the freedom of a country may be overturned by cauſes imperceptible to the multitude: and that when popular aſſemblies are carried away by violent paſſions, and ſtrike at perſons inſtead of things, they are then cloſely work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the aggrandiſement of others; and while they avenge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty injuries on petty enemies, only lay a ſnare for that liberty which ſhould be held moſt dear to them and their poſterity.</p>
            <p>To bear ſome thoughtleſs people boaſt of our democracy, when it does not exiſt, is pleaſant: for our government, I have ſhewn, is an ariſtrocracy; and will be in a few years as fierce and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as that of Poland or Venice, if the Order of Cincinnati be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take root and ſpread in it, for it will compleat what the Jackſonborough policy has left undone.

            <p>I have proved I hope to the reader's ſatisfaction, that the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnati creates two diſtinct orders amongſt us. 1ſt. A race of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Nobles; founded on the military, together with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful families, and firſt rate, leading men in the ſtate, whoſe view it will ever be, <hi>to rule:</hi> and 2d. The people or plebeians, whoſe only view is not to be oppreſſed: but whoſe certain fate it will be to ſuffer oppreſſion under the inſtitution: I have ſhewed that it is a deep laid contrivance to beget, and perpetuate family grandeur in an ariſtocratic Nobility, to terminate at laſt in monarchical tyranny. And I ſhall now paſs on to point out the conſtitutional means of oppoſing it.</p>
            <p>I feel ſenſibly that the few remarks I have to make, are too bold and deciſive to meet the approbation of ſome men. But if there be among my readers one, who merits the name of a republican, I have the confidence to believe his opinion will go along with mine.</p>
            <p>To cruſh this Order, then, without embroi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> any political combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of military commanders, is, in a republican government, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hazardous, and highly cenſurable. But that inſtituting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive honours and privileges of an Hereditary Order, is a daring uſurpation on the ſovereignty of the republic: a dangerous inſult to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>t, and moſt renowned republics of which hiſtory furniſhes any account, and the opinion of the ableſt political writers, will ſupport me in a doctrine, which I ſhould diſcuſs on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, if I were certain that our citizens, for whoſe information I am writing, were good ſtuff for republicans.</p>
            <p>With regard to myſelf, I will be candid to own, that although I am morally certain the inſtitution will entail upon us the evils I have mentioned: yet I have not the moſt diſtant idea, that it will come to a diſſolution. The firſt claſs, or leading gentry in the ſtate, and who will always hold the government, will find their intereſt in ſupporting a diſtinction that will gratify their ambition, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them far above their fellow citizens. The middling order of our gentry, and ſubſtantial land holders, may ſee its tendency, but they can take no ſtep to oppoſe it; having little to do with the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017863_0015_0FA373C0C8DAA5B8"/>government. And the lower claſs, with the city populace, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reaſon on it, till they feel the ſmart, and then they will have neither the power nor capacity for a reformation. Beſides, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety will have more adherents from another quarter than they are aware of. The ſeeds of internal diviſion, and a variety of humours are thick ſown in this country. The legiſlature bearing hard on many families, and individuals: public and private partiality and injuſtice: malecontents biaſſed in favour of monarchy: all this will raiſe a party, who out of hatred to the government of the people, will range themſelves under the banners of any man of faction, to promote its intereſt, and be avenged.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I know too well, to entertain the vain hope of any individual ſucceeding in oppoſition. But although I foreſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, yet I think it a point of duty to give this public teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my diſlike to the Order. I truſt its members will pardon me, if I ſhall ever hold it ignominious, that thoſe gallant citizens, who with as much valour and perſeverance, though not with the ſame ecla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall tranſcribe the firſt role, and conclude with a few remarks. It runs thus:</p>
            <p>"The State Society accedes to the propoſitions and rules tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Maj. Gen Moultrie, by Maj<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen. Heath and Steuben, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, on the 20th May and—day of June laſt with this reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that if the ſaid propoſitions or rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſhould by any conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be held obligatory on the ſociety, to interfere in any ſhape what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, with the civil polity, of this or any of the United States, or the United States in general, this ſociety will not deem themſelves bound thereby: They prizing too highly the civil liberties of their country, and their own rights as citizens, to conſent that a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſociety, ſhould in any ſenſe dictate to civil authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
            <p>Here is a candid fair acknowledgment, that no ſmall danger was to be apprehended to lurk under the inſtitution of a military ſociety. They diſclaim, it is true, all ſiniſter views in themſelves, and ſo may the Grand Order, although they let the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t out of the bag too ſoon, make us the ſame fine promiſes in ſome future reſolution. Their prizing too highly the liberties of their country, and their own rights as citizens, is all the ſecurity we have againſt them.</p>
            <p>But I would aſk men of knowledge among them, if there be one example in the world of an ambitious man or powerful faction, who
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017863_0016_0FA373C188E16830"/>to bring about their deſigns, did not pretend to be public bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; warm advocates for the public; and wonderfully careful of the civil liberties of their country? Is not this the ſureſt way of undermining? When Cromwell and his Major Generals, thoſe ſcourges of monarchy, and champions for popular government, when they were executing their fine ſchemes, did they tell the world they intended to uſurp the ſovereignty, though this was their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign? Or did not they amuſe even their own party, with preaching and canting about religion and liberty? Were their uſurpations the leſs ſo, becauſe they fought well, ſerved their country, and made fair promiſes?</p>
            <p>The ſecond rule of the State Order, tells us, <q>the principal end of the Society, is to maintain their indigent officers and their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and to maintain and educate their indigent children.</q> For my own part, I entertain not an idea of ſuch degeneracy in the ſtate, as to ſuppoſe it will not make a decent proviſion for them. But for the purpoſe of a charitable uſe, to entail a nobility on the Cincin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati, which will entail bondage on the people, is charity with a witneſs! It is like that ſort of benevolence that would introduce the plague, in order to get rid of a quartan ague.</p>
