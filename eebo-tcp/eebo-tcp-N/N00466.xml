            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the reason of the reviving of these old matters is to insinuate into People that I having once been mistaken, so as to favour such bad Spirits as <hi>John Lynam</hi> and the rest, I might also be mistaken in my Friend <hi>G. Keith.</hi> To which I say, That it was not suddainly that I joyned with G. K. but after diligent search and enquiry into the matter, and earnest Supplication to the Lord, that he would guide me aright, I was drawn forth to joyn with <hi>G. K.</hi> in his Christian Testimony, and witness Peace and Satisfaction from the Lord therein. And not withstanding the 28 Judges say, that <hi>G. K. is fallen from the High Places of</hi> Israel, <hi>as a man slain in his High Places, and become Treacherous to the Spouse of his Youth, &amp; as a man without the fear of God before his Eyes; G. K.</hi> is a living man, and it
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000589_0003_0FA95B0515EC7128"/>
is the Glory of God, Prosperity of Truth, and Salvation of Souls that he travails for; and these things are Slanders and Lyes writ on purpose, by prejudiced men against him, to slay him in his Reputation, and lessen Peoples Love to him and his Powerful Gospel Ministry, and to hide their own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Error &amp; Unbelief in those Fundamental Principles of Christian Doctrine, which are the Foundation Cause of the present Difference and Seperation.</p>
            <p>The other Paper, which they also recommend to Friends, (signed by <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Understanding that</hi> Thomas Budd <hi>is one with</hi> George Keith, <hi>owning his Principles, which for some Years past he by his own mouth declared &amp; cautioned several to beware of saying, there were dangerous Doctrines that would break forth among us before long by</hi> George Keith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer;</hi> I do freely acknowledge that I am one with G.

K.</hi> remains for them to tell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; if they had known of any dangerous Doctrines among us, it had been more Christian in them to have writ to us and told wherein we were in an Error, than to have sent Papers privately abroad, insinuating as if there were dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines broken forth among us; by which it appears, they are either ignorant of the Doctrines &amp; Principles we own, or unbelievers therein, and for their better Information, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to their perusal the Sheet called, <hi>An Account of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christian Faith of some of the faithful People called</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>in</hi> Pennsilvania, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein I hope will be found no dangerous Doctrines.

And the Act of their Monthly Meeting may witness what dangerous Doctrines they hold, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That the Light is sufficient to Salvation without any thing else, <abbr>

               </abbr> without the <hi>Man Christ Jesus,</hi> and without the Faith of his <hi>Death, Resurrection, Assention</hi> and <hi>Mediation,</hi> which is that something else we hold to be necessary to make a man a true Christian, as well as to believe in the Light within.</p>
