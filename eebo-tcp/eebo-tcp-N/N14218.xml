            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>THOUGH the world is but little concerned to know, in what ſituation the author of any performance that is offered to its peruſal may be, yet I believe it is generally ſolicitous to learn ſome circumſtances relating to him: for my own part, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways experienced this deſire in myſelf; and read the advertiſement at the beginning, and the poſtſcript at the end of a book, if they contain any information of that ſort, with a kind of melancholy inquietude about the fate of him, in whoſe company, as it were, I have paſſed ſome harmleſs hours, and whoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been unboſomed to me with the openneſs of a friend.</p>
                  <p>The life of him who has had an opportunity of preſenting to the eye of the public the following tale, though ſufficiently chequered with viciſſitude, has been ſpent in a ſtate of obſcurity, the recital of which could but little excite admiration, or gratify curioſity: the manner of his procuring the ſtory contained in the following ſheets, is all he thinks himſelf entitled to relate.</p>
                  <p>After ſome wanderings at that time of life which is moſt ſubject to wandering, I had found an opportunity of reviſiting the ſcenes of my earlier attachments, and returned to my native ſpot with that tender emotion, which the heart that can be moved at all, will naturally feel on approaching it. The remembrance of my infant days, like the fancied vibration of pleaſant ſounds in the ear, was ſtill alive in my mind; and I flew to find out the marks by which even inanimate things were to be known, as the friends of my youth, not forgotten, though long unſeen, nor leſſened, in my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, from the pride of refinement, of the compariſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <p>In the ſhade of an ancient tree, that centered a circle of elms, at the end of the village where I was born, I found my old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Jack Ryland: he was gathering moſs with one hand, while the other held a flannel-bag, containing earth-worms, to be uſed as bait in angling. On ſeeing me, Ryland dropped his moſs on the ground, and ran with all the warmth of friendſhip to embrace me. "My dear Tom, ſaid he, how happy I am to ſee you! you have travelled no doubt a woundy long way ſince we parted.— You find me in the old way here.—I believe they have but a ſorry notion of ſport in Italy.—While I think on't, look on this me now; I'll be hang'd if the ſharpeſt-ey'd trout in the river can know it from the natural. It was but yeſterday now—You remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the croſs-tree pool, juſt below the parſonage—there I hook'd him, play'd him half an hour by the clock, and landed him at laſt as far down as the church-way ford. As for his ſize—Lord! how unlucky it is that I have not my landing-net here; for now I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that I mark'd his length on the outſide of the pole; but you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:018007_0003_0FA4548808C289D8"/>Let not my reader be impatient at my friend Ryland's harangue. I give it him, becauſe I would have characters develop themſelves. To throw, however, ſome farther light upon Ryland's:</p>
                  <p>He was firſt-couſin to a gentleman who poſſeſſed a conſiderable eſtate in our county, born to no fortune, and not much formed by nature for acquiring one; he found pretty early that he ſhould never be rich, but that he might poſſibly be happy; and happineſs to him was obtained without effort, becauſe it was drawn from ſources which it required little exertion to ſupply: trifles were the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of his deſire, and their attainment the goal of his felicity. A certain neatneſs at all thoſe little arts in which the ſoul has no ſhare, an immoderate love of ſport, and a ſtill more immoderate love of reciting its progreſs, with the addition of one faculty, which has ſome ſmall connexion with letters, to wit, a remarkable memory for puzzles and enigmas, made up his character; and he enjoyed a privilege uncommon to the happy, that no one envied the means by which he attained what every one purſues.</p>
                  <p>I interrupted his narrative by ſome enquiries about my former acquaintance in the village; for Ryland was the recorder of the place, and could have told the names, families, relations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-marriages of the pariſh, with much more accuracy than the regiſter.</p>
                  <p>"Alackaday! ſaid Jack, there have been many changes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ſince you left this: here has died the old gauger Wilſon, as good a cricket-player as ever handled a bat; Rooke, at the Salutation, is gone too; and his wife has left the pariſh and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in London, where I'm told ſhe keeps a gin-ſhop in ſome ſtreet they call Southwark; and the poor parſon, whom you were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with, the worthy old Anneſly!"—He looked piteouſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the church-yard, and a tear trickled down his cheek — "I underſtand you, ſaid I, the good man is dead!"—"Ah! there is more than you think about his death, anſwered Jack; he died of a broken heart!" I could make no reply but by an ejaculation, and Ryland accompanied it with another tear; for, though he commonly looked but on the ſurface of things, yet Ryland had a heart to feel.</p>
                  <p>"In the middle of you clump of alders, ſaid he, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a ſmall houſe, that was once farmer Higgins's; it is now occupied by a gentlewoman of the name of Wiſtanly, who was formerly a ſort of ſervant-companion to ſir Thomas Sindall's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the widow of ſir William; her miſtreſs, who died ſome years ago, left her an annuity, and that houſe for life, where ſhe has lived ever ſince. I am told that ſhe knows more of Anneſly's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs than any other body; but ſhe is ſo ſilent and ſhy, that I could never, get a word from her on the ſubject: ſhe is reckon'd a wonderful ſcholar by the folks of the village; and you, who are a man of reading, might perhaps be a greate favorite with her; if you chuſe it, I ſhall introduce you to her immediately." I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his offer, and we went to her houſe together.</p>
                  <p>We found her ſitting in a little parlour, ſitted up in a ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018007_0004_0FA4548998587BA0"/>
ſuperior to what might have been expected from the appearance of the houſe, with ſome ſhelves, on which I obſerved ſeveral of the moſt claſſical Engliſh and French authors. She roſe to receive us with ſomething in her manner greatly above her ſeeming rank; Jack introduced me as an acquaintance of her deceaſed friend, Mr. Anneſly.</p>
                  <p>"Then, Sir, ſaid ſhe, you knew a man who had few fellows!" lifting her eyes gently upwards. The tender ſolemnity of her look anſwered the very movement which the remembrance had awaked in my ſoul, and I made no other reply than by a tear. She ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take it in good part, and we met on that ground, like old friends, who had much to aſk, and much to be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>When we were going away, ſhe begged to have a moment's converſation with me alone; Ryland left us together.</p>
                  <p>"If I am not deceived, Sir, ſaid ſhe, in the opinion I have formed of you, your feelings are very different from thoſe of Mr. Ryland, and indeed of moſt of my neighbours in the village; you ſeem to have had a peculiar intereſt in the fate of that worthieſt of men, Mr. Anneſly. The hiſtory of that life of purity which he led, of that calamity by which it was ſhortened, might not be an unpleaſing, though a melancholy recital to you; but in this box which ſtands on the table by me, is contained a ſeries of letters and papers, which, if you will take the trouble of reading them, will ſave me the taſk of recounting his ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>"You will find many paſſages which do not indeed relate to it; but, as they are often the entertainment of my leiſure hours, I have marked the moſt intereſting parts on the margin. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit, Sir, though its general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mportance be ſmall, my affection for my departed friend makes me conſider as a compliment, and I commit it to you, as to one in whoſe favor I have conceived a prepoſſeſſion from that very cauſe."</p>
                  <p>Thoſe letters and papers were the baſis of what I now offer to the public: had it been my intention <hi>to make a Book,</hi> I might have publiſhed them entire; and I am perſuaded, notwithſtanding Mrs. Wiſtanly's remark, that no part of them would have been found more foreign to the general drift of theſe volumes, than many that have got admittance into ſimilar collections: but I have choſen rather to throw them into the form of a narrative, and contented myſelf with tranſcribing ſuch reflexions as naturally ariſe from the events, and ſuch ſentiments as the ſituations alone appear to have excited.</p>
                  <p>There are indeed many ſupplementory facts, which could not have been found in this collection of Mrs. Wiſtanly's; theſe I was at ſome pains to procure through other channels: how I was enabled to procure them the reader may conceive, if his patience can hold out to the end of the ſtory; to account for that now, would delay its commencement, and anticipate its concluſion, for both which effects this introductory chapter may have already been ſubject to reprehenſion.</p>

There is a degree of ſentiment, which, in the boſom of a man deſtined to the drudgery of the world, is the ſource of endleſs diſguſt: of this young Anneſly was unluckily poſſeſſed; and as he foreſaw, or thought he foreſaw, that it would not only endanger his ſucceſs, but take from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of proſperity, ſuppoſing it attained, he declined follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that road which his father had ſmoothed for his progreſs, and at the riſk of thoſe temporal advantages which the old gentleman's diſpleaſure, on this occaſion, might deny him, entered into the ſervice of the church, and retired to the country on one of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt endowments ſhe has to beſtow.</p>
                     <p>That feeling which prevents the acquiſition of wealth, is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſupport of poverty; the contentment of the poor, I had almoſt ſaid their pride, buoys up the ſpirit againſt the depreſſion of adverſity, and gives to our very wants the appearance of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly looked on happineſs as confined to the ſphere of ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered life. The pomp of greatneſs, the pleaſures of the affluent, he conſidered as only productive of turbulence, diſquiet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe; and thanked heaven for having placed him in his own lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhed, which, in his opinion, was the reſidence of pure and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing felicity.</p>
                     <p>With this view of things his father's ideas did by no means coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide: his anger againſt his ſon continued till his death; and when
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018007_0007_0FA4548CEE4F3598"/>
that event happened, with the prepoſterous revenge of many a parent, he conſigned him to miſery, as he thought, becauſe he would not be unhappy in that way which he had inſiſted on his following, and cut him off from the inheritance of his birth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had choſen a profeſſion which kept him in poverty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                     <p>Though Anneſly could ſupport the fear of poverty, he could not eaſily bear the thought of a dying father's diſpleaſure. On receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence of his being in a dangerous ſituation, he haſted to London, with the purpoſe of wringing from him his forgiveneſs for the only offence with which his ſon had ever been chargeable; but he arrived too late: his father had breathed his laſt on the evening of the day preceding that on which he reached the metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, and his houſe was already in the poſſeſſion of a nephew, to whom his ſon underſtood he had left every ſhilling of his fortune. This man had been bred a haberdaſher, at the expreſs deſire of old Anneſly, and had all that patient dulneſs which qualifies for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rich, which, therefore, in the eyes of his uncle, was the moſt eſtimable of all qualities.</p>
                     <p>He had ſeldom ſeen Richard Anneſly before, for indeed this laſt was not very ſolicitous of his acquaintance; he recollected his face however, and deſiring him to ſit down, informed him particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the ſettlement which his relentleſs father had made. "It was unlucky, ſaid the haberdaſher, that you ſhould have made choice of ſuch a profeſſion; but a parſon, of all trades in the world, he could never endure.</p>
                     <p>"It is poſſible you may be low in caſh at this time: if you want a ſmall matter to buy mournings or ſo, I ſhall not ſcruple to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance you the needful; and I wiſh you would take them of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Bullock, the woollen-draper, who is as honeſt a man as any of the trade, and would not impoſe on a child." Anneſly's eyes had been hitherto fixed on the ground; nor was there wanting a tear in each for his unnatural father: he turned them on this couſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with as contemptuous a look as his nature allowed them to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and walked out of the houſe without uttering a word.</p>
                     <p>He was now thrown upon the world with the ſentence of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual poverty for his inheritance. He found himſelf in the middle of a crouded ſtreet in London, ſurrounded by the buzzing ſons of induſtry, and ſhrunk back at the ſenſe of his own inſignificance. In the faces of thoſe he met, he ſaw no acknowledgment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, and felt himſelf, like Cain after his brother's murder, an unſheltered, unfriended outcaſt. He looked back to his father's door; but his ſpirit was too mild for reproach — a tear dropped from his eye as he looked!</p>
                     <p>There was in London one perſon, whoſe gentle nature he knew would feel for his misfortunes; yet to that one, of all others, his pride forbade him to reſort.</p>
                     <p>Harriet Wilkins was the daughter of a neighbour of his father's, who had for ſome time given up buſineſs, and lived on the intereſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018007_0008_0FA4548DF5D28C98"/>
of 4000<hi>l.</hi> which he had ſaved in the courſe of it. From this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, his acquaintance, old Anneſly, entertained no very high opinion of his underſtanding; and did not cultivate much friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with a man whom he conſidered as a drone in the hive of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: but in this opinion, as in many others, his ſon had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to differ from him; he uſed frequently to ſteal into Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins's houſe of an evening, to enjoy the converſation of one who had paſſed through life with obſervation, and had known the labour of buſineſs without that contraction of ſoul which it often occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Harriet was commonly of the party, liſtening with Anneſly to her father's diſcourſe, and with Anneſly offering her remarks on it. She was not handſome enough to attract notice; but her look was of that complacent ſort which gains on the beholder, and pleaſes from the acknowledgment that it is beneath admiration.</p>
                     <p>Nor was her mind ill ſuited to this "Index of the ſoul." Without that brilliancy which excites the general applauſe, it poſſeſſed thoſe inferior ſweetneſſes which acquire the general eſteem; ſincere, benevolent, inoffenſive, and unaſſuming. Nobody talked of the ſayings of Miſs Wilkins; but every one heard her with pleaſure, and her ſmile was the ſignal of univerſal complacency.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly found himſelf inſenſibly attached to her by a chain, which had been impoſed without art, and ſuffered without conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. During his acquaintance with Harriet, he had come to that period of life, when men are moſt apt to be impreſſed with appearances; in fact, he had looked on many a beauty with a rapture which he thought ſincere till it was interrupted by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion that ſhe was not Harriet Wilkins; there was a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definable attraction which linked him every day cloſer to her, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tleſſneſs of manner had the effect (which I preſume, from their practice, few young ladies believe it to have) of ſecuring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſhe had gained.</p>
                     <p>From the wealth which old Anneſly was known to poſſeſs, his ſon was, doubtleſs, in the phraſe of the world, a very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous match for Miſs Wilkins; but when her father diſcovered the young man to be ſerious in his attachment to her, he frequently took occaſion to ſuggeſt, how unequal the ſmall fortune he could leave his daughter, was to the expectations of the ſon of a man worth 30,000<hi>l.</hi> and with a frankneſs peculiar to himſelf, gave the father to underſtand, that his ſon's viſits were rather more frequent than was conſiſtent with that track of prudence which the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would probably mark out for him. The father, however, took little notice of this intelligence; the truth was, that, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by himſelf, he gave very little credit to it; becauſe it came from one, who, according to his conception of things, ſhould, of all others, have concealed it from his knowlege.</p>
                     <p>But though his ſon had the moſt ſincere attachment to Miſs Wilkins, his preſent circumſtances rendered it, in the language of prudence, impoſſible for them to marry. They contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018007_0009_0FA4548E8E6A98F8"/>
therefore with the aſſurance of each other's conſtancy, and waited for ſome favourable change of condition which might allow them to be happy.</p>
                     <p>The firſt idea which ſtruck Anneſly's mind on the diſappointment he ſuffered from his father's ſettlement, was the effect it would have on his ſituation with regard to Harriet. There is perhaps nothing more bitter in the lot of poverty, than the diſtance to which it throws a man from the woman he loves; that pride I have before taken notice of, which in every other circumſtance tends to his ſupport, ſerves but to wound him the deeper in this. That feeling now turned Anneſly's feet from his Harriet's door; yet it was now that his Harriet ſeemed the more worthy of his love, in proportion is his circumſtances rendered it hopeleſs. A train of ſoft reflexions at length baniſhed this rugged gueſt from his heart — "'Tis but taking a laſt farewell!" ſaid he to himſelf, and trod back the ſteps which he had made.</p>
                     <p>He entered the room where Harriet was ſitting by her father, with a ſort of diffidence of his reception that he was not able to hide; but Wilkins welcomed him in ſuch a manner, as ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated the reſtraint under which the thoughts of his poverty had laid him. "This viſit, my dear Anneſly, ſaid he, flatters me, becauſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſhows you leaning on my friendſhip. I am not ignorant of your preſent ſituation, and I know the effect which prudent men will ſay it ſhould have on myſelf; that I differ from them, may be the conſequence of ſpleen, perhaps rather than generoſity: for I have been at war with the world from a boy. Come hither, Harriet; this is Richard Anneſly: his father, it is true, has left him 30,000<hi>l.</hi> poorer than it was once expected he would: but he is Richard Anneſly ſtill! you will therefore look upon him as you did before. I am not ſtoic enough to deny, that riches afford num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs comforts and conveniencies which are denied to the poor; but that riches are not eſſential to happineſs I know, becauſe I have never yet found myſelf unhappy;—nor ſhall I now ſleep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound from the conſciouſneſs of having added to the preſſure of affliction, or wounded merit afreſh, becauſe fortune had already wounded it."</p>
                     <p>Liberal minds will delight in extending the empire of virtue; for my own part, I am happy to believe, that it is poſſible for an attorney to be honeſt, and a tradeſman to think like Wilkins.</p>

                     <p>WILKINS having thus overlooked the want of fortune in his young friend, the lovers found but little hindrance to the completion of their wiſhes: Harriet became the wife of a poor

man, who returned the obligation he owed to her and her father's generoſity, by a tenderneſs and affection rarely found in wedlock, becauſe there are few minds from whom in reaſon they can be expected.</p>
                     <p>His father-in-law, to whom indeed the ſacrifice was but trifling, could not reſiſt the joint requeſt of his daughter and her huſband, to leave the town and make one of their family in the country. In ſomewhat leſs than a year he was the grand-father of a boy, and nearly at the ſame diſtance of time after, of a girl, both of whom in his opinion, were cherubs; but even the goſſips around them owned they had never ſeen more promiſing children. The felicity of their little circle was now perhaps as perfect as the lot of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty admits; nor would it have been eaſy to have found a group, whoſe minds were better formed to deſerve or attain it. Health, innocence, and good-humour were of their houſehold; and many an honeſt neighbour, who never troubled himſelf to account for it, talked of the goodneſs of Anneſly's ale, and the chearfulneſs of his fire-ſide. I have been often admitted of the party, though I was too young for a companion to the ſeniors, and too old for a play-fellow to the children; but no age, and often indeed no condition, excluded from a participation of their happineſs; and I have ſeen little Billy, before he could ſpeak to be well underſtood, lead in a long bearded beggar, to ſing his ſong in its turn, and be rewarded with a cup of that excellent liquor I mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Their felicity was too perfect to be laſting.—Such is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial opinion of mankind: the days of joy, however, are not more winged in their courſe than the days of ſorrow; but we count not the moments of their duration with ſo ſcrupulous an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs.</p>
                     <p>Three years after the birth of her firſt daughter, Mrs. Anneſly was delivered of another; but the birth of the laſt was fatal to her mother, who did not many days ſurvive it. Anneſly's grief on this occaſion was immoderate; nor could all the endeavours of his father-in-law, whoſe mind was able to preſerve more compoſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prevail upon him, for ſome days, to remember the common offices of life, or leave the room in which his Harriet had expired. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins's grief, however, though of a more ſilent ſort, was not leſs deep in its effects; and when the turbulence of the other's ſorrow had yielded to the ſoothings of time, the old man retained all that render regret, ſo due to the death of a child, an only child, whoſe filial duty had led him down the ſlope of life without ſuffering him to perceive the deſcent.</p>
                     <p>The infant ſhe had left behind her was now doubly endeared to its father and him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from being conſidered as the laſt memorial of its dying mother; but of this melancholy kind of comfort they were alſo deprived in a few months by the ſmall-pox. Wilkins ſeemed by this ſecond blow to be looſened from the little hold he had ſtruggled to keep of the world, and his reſignation was now built upon the hopes, not of overcoming his affliction, but of eſcaping from its preſſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:018007_0011_0FA45490AC9D6AD0"/>The ſerenity which ſuch an idea confers, poſſeſſes of all others the greateſt dignity, becauſe it poſſeſſes of all others the beſt-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured confidence, leaning on a baſis that is fixed above the rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſublunary things. An old man, who has lived in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of virtue, looking back, without a bluſh, on the tenor of his paſt days, and pointing to that better ſtate, where alone he can be perfectly rewarded, is a figure the moſt venerable that can well be imagined: ſuch did Wilkins now exhibit.</p>
                     <p>"My ſon, ſaid he to Anneſly, I feel that I ſhall not be with you long; yet I leave not the world with that peeviſh diſguſt, which is ſometimes miſtaken for the courage that overcomes the dread of death: I lay down my being, with gratitude, for having ſo long poſſeſſed it, without having diſgraced it, by any great violation of the laws of him, by whom it was beſtowed. There is ſomething we cannot help feeling, on the fall of thoſe hopes we had been vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diligent to rear; I had looked forward to ſome happy days, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt a race of my Harriet's and yours; but to the good, there can be no reaſonable regret from the diſappointment of ſuch expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, becauſe the futurity, they truſt in after death, muſt far exceed any enjoyment which a longer life here could have afforded. It is otherwiſe with the proſpect of duty to be done; theſe two little ones, I leave to your tenderneſs and care; you will value life, as it gives you an opportunity of forming them to virtue — Lay me beſide my Harriet!"</p>
                     <p>The old man's prediction was but too well verified; he did not long ſurvive this pathetic declaration. His ſon-in-law was now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, alone and unaſſiſted, to the cares of the world, increaſed by the charge of his boy and girl; but the mind will ſupport much, when called into exertion by the neceſſity of things. His ſorrow yielded by degrees to the thoughts of that active duty he owed his children; in time his fire-ſide was again cheared by their ſports around it; and though he ſometimes looked upon them with a tear, at the recollection of the paſt, yet would he as often wipe it from his eye, in ſilent gratitude to heaven, for the enjoyment of the preſent, and the anticipation of the future.</p>

                     <p>HIS ſon had a warmth of temper, which the father often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with mingled pleaſure and regret; with pleaſure, from conſidering the generoſity and nobleneſs of ſentiment it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke; with regret, from a foreboding of the many inconveniences to which its youthful poſſeſſor might naturally be expoſed.</p>

                        </gap> moments would be checked by the recital of the diſtreſs of a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creature, and ſhe would often weep all night from ſome tale which her maid had told of fictitious diſaſter. Her brother felt the repreſentation of worth ill-treated, or virtue oppreſſed, with indignation againſt the oppreſſor, and wiſhed to be a man, that he might, like Jack the Giant-killer, gird on his ſword of ſharpneſs, and revenge the wrongs of the ſufferer; while his ſiſter preſſed his hand in hers, and trembled for the danger to which ſhe imagined him expoſed; nay, ſhe has been afterwards heard to cry out in her ſteep in a hurried voice, "You ſhall not go, my Billy, papa and I will die if you do."</p>
                     <p>A trifling incident, of which I find an account in one of their father's letters, will diſcriminate their characters better than a train of the moſt laboured expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>At the bottom of his garden ran a little rivulet, which was there dammed up to furniſh water for a mill below. On the bank was a linnet's neſt, which Harriet had diſcovered in her rambles, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten viſited with uncommon anxiety for the callow brood it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. One day her brother and ſhe were at play on the green at a little diſtance, attended by a ſervant of their father's, when a favorite terrier of Billy's happened to wander amongſt the buſhes where this neſt was ſheltered: Harriet, afraid of the conſequences, begged the ſervant to run, and prevent his doing miſchief to the birds.</p>
                     <p>Juſt as the fellow came up, the dog had lighted on the buſh, and ſurpriſed the dam, but was prevented from doing her much harm by the ſervant, who laid hold of him by the neck, and ſnatched his prey out of his mouth: the dog, reſenting this rough uſage, bit the man's finger till it bled, who, in return, beſtowed a hearty drubbing upon him, without regarding the entreaties or the threats of his little maſter. Billy enraged at the ſufferings of his favorite, reſolved to wreak his vengeance where it was in his power, and running up to the neſt, threw it down, with all its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fledged inhabitants, to the ground. "Cruel Billy!" cried his ſiſter, while the tears ran down her cheeks. He turned ſullenly from her, and walked up to the houſe, while ſhe, with the man's aſſiſtance, gathered up the little flutterers, and having faſtened the neſt as well as ſhe could, replaced them ſafely within it.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe ſaw her brother again, he pouted, and would not ſpeak to her; ſhe endeavoured to regain his favour by kindneſs, but he refuſed her careſſes; ſhe ſought out the dog, who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on her; linnet't account, and ſtroaking him on the head, fed him with ſome cold meat, from her own hand: when her brother ſaw it, he called him away. She looked after Billy till he was gone, and then burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>Next day they were down at the rivulet again. Still was Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet endeavouring to be reconciled, and ſtill was her brother averſe to a reconciliation: he ſat biting his thumb, and looking angrily to the ſpot where his favorite had been puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:018007_0013_0FA45495E25C7688"/>At that inſtant the linnet, in whoſe cauſe the quarrel had begun, was bringing out her younglings to their firſt imperfect flight, and two of them, unfortunately taking a wrong direction, fell ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle of the pool Billy ſtarted from the ground, and, without conſidering the depth, ruſhed into the water, where he was over head and ears the ſecond ſtep that he made. His ſiſter's ſcreams alarmed the ſervant, who ran to his aſſiſtance; but before he got to the place, the boy had reached a ſhallower part of the pool, and, though ſtaggering from his firſt plunge, had ſaved both the linnets, which he held carefully above the water, and landed ſafely on the oppoſite bank. He returned to his ſiſter by a ford be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and, preſenting her the birds, flung his arms round her neck, and, blubbering, aſked her, if ſhe would now forgive his unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Such were the minds which Anneſly's tuition was to form. To repreſs the warmth of temerity, without extinguiſhing the generous principles from which it aroſe, and to give firmneſs to ſenſibility where it bordered on weakneſ, without fearing its feelings where they led to virtue, was the taſk he had marked out for his induſtry to accompliſh.</p>
                     <p>He owned that his plan was frequently interrupted on both ſides by the tenderneſs of paternal affection; but he accuſtomed himſelf to remember, that, for his children he was accountable to God and their country. Nor was the ſituation I have deſcribed without difficulties, from the delicacy of preventing inclinations in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, which were laudable in degree; "but here alſo, ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly, it is to be remembered, that no evil is ſo pernicious as that which grows in the ſoil from which good ſhould have ſprung."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. A very brief account of their education.</head>
                     <p>ANNESLY was not only the ſuperintendant of his children's manners, but their maſter in the ſeveral branches of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Reading, writing, arithmetic, the elements of mathematics and geography, with a competent knowlege of the French and Italian languages, they learned together; and while Billy was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with his father in reading Latin and Greek, his ſiſter receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtruction in the female accompliſhments, from a better ſort of ſervant, whom Anneſly kept for that purpoſe, whoſe ſtation had once been ſuperior to ſervitude, and whom he ſtill treated more as a companion than a domeſtic.</p>
                     <p>This inſtructreſs indeed ſhe loſt when about ten years old; but the want was more than ſupplied by the aſſiſtance of another, to wit, Mrs. Wiſtanly; who devoted many of her leiſure hours to the daughter of Anneſly, whom ſhe had then got aquainted with,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018007_0014_0FA45495F87A5BD8"/>
and whom reciprocal worth had attached to her with the ſincereſt friendſhip and regard. The dancing-maſter of a neighbouring town paid them a weekly viſit for their inſtruction in the ſcience he profeſſed; at which time alſo were held their family-concerts, where Anneſly, who was eſteemed in his youth a firſt-rate player on the violin, uſed to preſide.</p>
                     <p>Billy was an excellent ſecond; Mrs. Wiſtanly or her pupil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for the harpſicord, and the dancing-maſter played baſe as well as he could. He was not a very capital performer, but he was always very willing; and found as much pleaſure in his own performance as the beſt of them. Jack Ryland too would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times join in a catch, though indeed he had but two, <hi>Chriſt-church bells,</hi> and <hi>Jack, thou'rt a toper</hi>: and Anneſly alledged that he was often out in the laſt, but Jack would never allow it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, there were certain evenings appropriated to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the mind. "It is not enough, ſaid Anneſly, to put weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into thoſe hands which never have been taught the uſe of them; the reading we recommend to youth will ſtore their minds with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, if they attend to it properly; but to go a little farther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt accuſtom them to apply it, we muſt teach them the art of comparing the ideas with which it has furniſhed them."</p>
                     <p>In this view it was the practice, at thoſe ſtated times I have mentioned, for Billy, or his ſiſter, to read a ſelect paſſage of ſome claſſical author, on whoſe relations, they delivered opinions, or on whoſe ſentiments they offered a comment. Never was ſeen more ſatisfaction on a countenance, than uſed to enlighten their father's, at the delivery of thoſe obſervations, which his little philoſophers were accuſtomed to make: indeed, there could ſcarcely, even to a ſtranger, be a more pleaſing exhibition; their very errors were delightful, becauſe they were the errors of benevolence, generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and virtue.</p>
                     <p>As puniſhments are neceſſary in all ſocieties, Anneſly was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to invent ſome for the regulation of his: they conſiſted only of certain modifications of diſgrace. One of them I ſhall mention, becauſe it was exactly oppoſite to the practice of moſt of our ſchools, while there, offences are puniſhed by doubling the taſk of the ſcholar: with Anneſly, the getting of a leſſon or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an exerciſe was a privilege, of which a forfeiture was incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by miſbehaviour; to teach his children, that he offered them inſtructions as a favor, inſtead of preſſing it as a hardſhip.</p>
                     <p>Billy had a ſmall part of his father's garden allotted him for his peculiar property, in which he wrought himſelf, being furniſhed with no other aſſiſtance from the gardener than directions how to manage it, and parcels of the ſeeds which they enabled him to ſow. When he had brought theſe to maturity, his father purchaſed the produce; Billy, with part of the purchaſe-money, was to lay in the ſtores neceſſary for his future induſtry, and the overplus he had the liberty of beſtowing on charitable uſes in the village.</p>

                        <hi>It was chiefly in this manner of inſtilling ſentiments, (as in the caſe of the charitable eſtabliſhment I have mentioned) by leading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to the practice of virtue, rather than by downright precept, that Anneſly proceeded with his children; for it was his maxim, that the heart muſt feel, as well as the judgment be convinced, before the principles we mean to teach can be of habitual ſervice; and that the mind will always be more ſtrongly impreſſed with ideas which it is led to form of itſelf, than with thoſe which it paſſively receives from another. When, at any time, he delivered inſtructions, they were always<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> clothed in the garb rather of advices from a friend, than lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from a father; and were liſtened to with the warmth of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as well as the humility of veneration.

                        <hi>Beſides all this, his children had the general advantage of a father's example: they ſaw the virtues he inculcated attended by all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in himſelf, which he had promiſed them as their reward: piety in him was recompenſed by peace of mind, benevolence by ſelf-ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and integrity by the bleſſings of a good conſcience.</hi>

                     <p>YOU are now leaving us, my ſon, ſaid Anneſly, to make your entrance into the world: for, though from the pale of a college, the buſtle of ambition, the plodding of buſineſs, and the tinſel of gaiety, are ſuppoſed to be excluded; yet as it is the place where the perſons that are to perform in thoſe ſeveral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters often put on the dreſſes of each, there will not be wanting, even there, thoſe qualities that diſtinguiſh in all. I will not ſhock your imagination with the picture which ſome men, retired from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, have drawn of the world; nor warn you againſt enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, into which, I ſhould equally affront your underſtanding and your feelings, did I ſuppoſe you capable of falling.</p>
                     <p>Neither would I arm you with that ſuſpicious caution, which young men are ſometimes adviſed to put on: they who always ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect will often be miſtaken, and never be happy. Yet there is a wide diſtinction between the confidence which becomes a man, and the ſimplicity that diſgraces a fool: he who never truſts is a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſoul, who ſtarves himſelf, and by whom no other is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched; but he who gives every one his confidence, and every one his praiſe, ſquanders the fund that ſhould ſerve for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of integrity, and the reward of excellence.</p>
                     <p>In the circles of the world your notice may be frequently attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by objects glaring, not uſeful; and your attachment won to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018007_0017_0FA45498344CD6F8"/>
characters, whoſe ſurfaces are ſhowy, without intrinſic value: in ſuch circumſtances be careful not always to impute knowlege to the appearance of acuteneſs, or give credit to opinions according to the confidence with which they are urged. In the more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant articles of belief or conviction, let not the flow of ridicule be miſtaken for the force of argument.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is ſo eaſy as to excite a laugh, at that time of life, when ſeriouſneſs is held to be an incapacity of enjoying it; and no wit ſo futile, or ſo dangerous, as that which is drawn from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted attitudes of what is in itſelf momentous. There are in moſt ſocieties a ſet of ſelf-important young men, who borrow conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from ſingularity, and take precedency in wiſdom from the unfeeling uſe of the ludicrous; this is at beſt a ſhallow quality; in objects of eternal moment, it is poiſonous to ſociety. I will not now, nor could you then, ſtand forth armed at all points to repel the attacks which they may make on the great principles of your belief; but let one ſuggeſtion ſuffice, excluſive of all internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or extrinſic proof of revelation.</p>
                     <p>He that would undermine thoſe foundations upon which the fabric of our future hope is reared, ſeeks to beat down that column, which ſupports the feebleneſs of humanity:—let him but think a moment, and his heart will arreſt the cruelty of his purpoſe;— would he pluck its little treaſure from the boſom of poverty? would he wreſt its crutch from the hand of age, and remove from the eye of affliction the only ſolace of its woe? The way we tread is rugged at beſt; we tread it, however, lighter by the proſpect of that better country to which we truſt it will lead; tell us not that it will end in the gulph of eternal diſſolution, or break off in ſome wild, which fancy may fill up as ſhe pleaſes, but reaſon is unable to delineate; quench not that beam, which, amidſt the night of this evil world, has cheared the deſpondency of ill-requited worth, and illumined the darkneſs of ſuffering virtue.</p>
                     <p>The two great movements of the ſoul, which the molder of our frames has placed in them for the incitement of virtue and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of vice, are the deſire of honour, and the fear of ſhame: but the perverſion of theſe qualities, which the refinement of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is peculiarly unhappy in making, has drawn their influence from the ſtandard of morality, to the banners of its oppoſite; into the firſt ſtep on which a young man ventures, in thoſe paths which the cautions of wiſdom have warned him to avoid, he is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puſhed by the fear of that ridicule which he has ſeen levelled at ſimplicity, and the deſire of that applauſe which the ſpirit of the profligate has enabled him to acquire.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſure is in truth ſubſervient to virtue. When the firſt is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued without thoſe reſtraints which the laſt would impoſe, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement we make on them leſſens the enjoyment we mean to attain; and nature is thus wiſe in our conſtruction, that, when we would be bleſſed beyond the pale of reaſon, we are bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly. It is not by the roar of riot, or the ſhout of the bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanal,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018007_0018_0FA45498EB4E9410"/>
that we are to meaſure the degree of pleaſure which he feels; the groſſneſs of the ſenſe he gratifies is equally inſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the enjoyment, as it is deaf to the voice of reaſon; and, obdurated by the repetition of debauch, is incapable of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which the finer ſenſations produce, which thrills in the boſom of delicacy and virtue.</p>
                     <p>Libertines have ſaid, my Harriet, that the ſmiles of your ſex at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them: and that the pride of conqueſt, where conqueſt is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, overcomes the fear of diſgrace and defeat. I hope there is leſs truth in this remark than is generally imagined; let it be my Harriet's belief that it cannot be true for the honour of her ſex: let it be her care that, for her own honour, it may be falſe as to her.</p>
                     <p>Look on thoſe men, my child, even in their gayeſt and moſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring garb, as creatures dangerous to the peace, and deſtructive of the welfare of ſociety; look on them as you would on a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſerpent, whoſe miſchief we may not forget while we admire the beauties of its ſkin. I marvel indeed how the pride of the fair can allow them to ſhow a partiality to him, who regards them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings merely ſubſervient to his pleaſure, in whoſe opinion they have loſt all that dignity which excites reverence, and that excellence which creates eſteem.</p>
                     <p>Be accuſtomed, my love, to think reſpectfully of yourſelf; it is the error of the gay world to place your ſex in a ſtation ſomewhat unworthy of a reaſonable creature; and the individuals of ours who addreſs themſelves to you, think it a neceſſary ingredient in their diſcourſe, that it ſhould want every ſolid property with which ſenſe and underſtanding would inveſt it. The character of a female pedant is undoubtedly diſguſting; but it is much leſs common than that of a trifling or an ignorant woman: the intercourſe of the ſex is, in this reſpect, advantageous, that each has a deſire to pleaſe, mingled with a certain deference for the other; let not this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be loſt on one ſide, by its being ſuppoſed, that, to pleaſe yours, we muſt ſpeak ſomething, in which faſhion has ſanctified folly, and eaſe lent her garb to inſignifiance.</p>
                     <p>In general it ſhould never be forgotten, that, though life has its venial triflles, yet they ceaſe to be innocent when they encroach upon its important concerns; the mind that is often employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout little things, will be rendered unfit for any ſerious exertion; and, though temporary relaxations may recruit its ſtrength, habitual vacancy will deſtroy it.</p>

                     <p>AS the mind may be weakened by the purſuit of trivial matters, ſo its ſtrength may be miſled in deeper inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                     <p>It is a capital error in the purſuit of knowlege, to ſuppoſe that we are never to believe what we cannot account for. There is no reaſon why we ſhould not attempt to underſtand every thing; but to own in ſome inſtances our limited knowlege, is a piece of modeſty in which lies the trueſt wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Let it be our care that our effort in its tendency is <hi>uſeful,</hi> and our effort need not be repreſſed; for he that attempts the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, will often atchieve the extremely difficult; but the pride of knowlege often labours to gain what if gained would be uſeleſs, and waſtes exertion upon objects that have been left unattained from their futility. Men poſſeſſed of this deſire, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find, my ſon, in that ſeat of ſcience whither you are going: but remember, that what claims our wonder, does not always me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit our regard; and in knowlege and philoſophy be careful to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh, that the purpoſe of reſearch ſhould ever be fixed on mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſimple what is abſtruſe, not abſtruſe what is ſimple; and that difficulty in acquiſition will no more ſanctify its inexpediency, than the art of tumblers, who have learned to ſtand on their heads, will prove that to be the proper poſture for man.</p>
                     <p>There is a pedantry in being maſter of paradoxes contrary to the common opinions of mankind, which is equally diſguſting to the illiterate and the learned. The peaſant who enjoys the beauty of the tulip, is equally delighted with the philoſopher, though he knows not the powers of the rays from which its colours are derived; and the boy who ſtrikes a ball with his racket, is as certain whither it will be driven by the blow, as if he were perfectly verſant in the diſpute about matter and motion.</p>
                     <p>Vanity of our knowlege is generally found in the firſt ſtages of its acquirement, becauſe we are then looking back to that rank we have left, of ſuch as know nothing at all. Greater advances cure us of this, by pointing our view to thoſe above us; and when we reach the ſummit, we begin to diſcover, that human know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is ſo imperfect, as not to warrant any vanity upon it. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular arts beware of that affectation of ſpeaking technically, by which ignorance is often diſguiſed, and knowlege diſgraced. They who are really ſkilful in the principles of ſcience, will acquire the veneration only of ſhallow minds by talking ſcientifically; for, to ſimplify expreſſion, is always the effect of the deepeſt knowlege,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018007_0020_0FA4549DB2195CF8"/>
and the cleareſt diſcernment. On the other hand, there may be many who poſſeſs taſte, though they have not attained ſkill; who, if they will be contented with the expreſſion of their own feelings, without labouring to keep up the borrowed phraſe of erudition, will have their opinions reſpected by all whoſe ſuffrages are worthy of being gained. The muſic, the painting, the poetry of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is the property of every one who has a heart to be moved; and though there may be particular modes of excellence which national or temporary faſhions create, yet that ſtandard will ever remain which alone is common to all.</p>
                     <p>The oſtentation of learning is indeed always diſguſting in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of ſociety; for even the benefit of inſtruction received cannot allay the conſciouſneſs of inferiority, and remarkable parts more frequently attract admiration than procure eſteem. To bring forth knowlege agreeably, as well as uſefully, is perhaps very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for thoſe, who have attained it in the ſecluded walks of ſtudy and ſpeculation, and is an art ſeldom found but in men who have likewiſe acquired ſome knowlege of the world.</p>
                     <p>I would however diſtinguiſh between that knowlege of the world that fits us for intercourſe with the better part of mankind, and that which we gain by aſſociating with the worſt.</p>
                     <p>But there is a certain learned ruſt which men as well as metals acquire; it is, ſimply ſpeaking, a blemiſh in both; the ſocial feelings grow callous from diſuſe, and we loſe that ſpring of little affections, which ſweeten the cup of life as we drink it.</p>
                     <p>Even the ceremonial of the world, ſhallow as it may appear, is not without its uſe; it may indeed take from the warmth of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but it covers the coldneſs of indifference; and if it has repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the genuine overflowings of kindneſs, it has ſmothered the turbulence of paſſion and animoſity.</p>
                     <p>Politeneſs taught as an art is ridiculous; as the expreſſion of liberal ſentiment and courteous manners, it is truly valuable. There is a politeneſs of the heart which is confined to no rank, and dependent upon no education: the deſire of obliging, which a man poſſeſſed of this quality will univerſally ſhow, ſeldom fails of pleaſing, though his ſtile may differ from that of modern refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I knew a man in London, of the gentleſt manners, and of the moſt winning deportment; whoſe eye was ever brightened with the ſmiles of good humour, and whoſe voice was mellowed with the tones of complacency; — and this man was bred a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith!</p>
                     <p>The falſehood of politeneſs is often pleaded for, as unavoidable in the commerce of mankind; yet I would have it as little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged as poſſible. There is a frankneſs without ruſticity, an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of manner, prompted by good-humour, but guided by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, which ſome are happy enough to poſſeſs, that engages every worthy man, and gives not offence even to thoſe, whoſe good opinion, though of little eſtimation, it is the buſineſs of prudence not wantonly to loſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018007_0021_0FA4549F94AA1D88"/>The circles of the gay, my children would ſmile to hear me talk of qualities which my retired manner of life has allowed me ſo little opportunity of obſerving; but true good breeding is not confined within thoſe bounds to which their pedantry (if I may uſe the expreſſion) would reſtrict it: true good-breeding is the ſiſter of philanthropy, with feelings perhaps not ſo ſerious or tender, but equally inſpired by a fineneſs of ſoul, and open to the impreſſions of ſocial affection.</p>
                     <p>As politeneſs is the rule of the world's manners, ſo has it erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Honour</hi> the ſtandard of its morality; but its dictates too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently depart from wiſdom with reſpect to ourſelves, from juſtice and humanity with reſpect to others. Genuine honour is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the offspring of both; but there has ariſen a counterfeit, who, as he is more boaſtful and ſhowy, has more attracted the notice of gaiety and grandeur. Generoſity and courage are the virtues he boaſts of poſſeſſing; but his generoſity is a fool, and his courage a murderer.</p>
                     <p>The punctilio's indeed on which he depends, for his own peace, and the peace of ſociety, are ſo ridiculous in the eye of reaſon, that it is not a little ſurpriſing, how ſo many millions of reaſonable beings ſhould have ſanctified them with their mutual conſent and acquieſcence; that they ſhould have agreed to ſurround the ſeats of friendſhip, and the table of feſtivity, with ſo many thorns of inquietude, and ſnares of deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>You will probably hear, my ſon, very frequent applauſe beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on men of nice and jealous honour, who ſuffer not the ſmalleſt affront to paſs unqueſtioned or unrevenged; but do not imagine that the character which is moſt ſacredly guarded, is always the moſt unſullied in reality, nor allow yourſelf to envy a reputation for that ſort of valour which ſupports it. Think how uneaſily that man muſt paſs his time, who ſits, like a ſpider in the midſt of his feeling web, ready to catch the minuteſt occaſion for quarrel and reſentment.</p>
                     <p>There is often more real puſillanimity in the mind that ſtarts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to oppoſition where none is neceſſary, than in him who overlooks the wanderings of ſome unguarded act or expreſſion, as not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence enough to challenge indignation or revenge. I am aware, that the young and high-ſpirited will ſay, that men can only judge of actions, and that they will hold as cowardice, the blindneſs I would recommend to affront or provocation; but there is a ſteady coolneſs and poſſeſſion of one's ſelf, which this principle will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beſtow, equally remote from the weakneſs of fear, and the diſcompoſure of anger, which gives to its poſſeſſor a ſtation that ſeldom ſails of commanding reſpect, even from the ferocious vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſanguinary <hi>Honour.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>IT was thus the good man inſtructed his children. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! the enemy came in the night and ſowed tares!</p>
                     <p>Such an enemy had the harmleſs family of which Anneſly was the head. It is ever to be regretted, that miſchief is ſeldom ſo weak but that worth may be ſlung by it; in the preſent inſtance, however, it was ſupported by talents miſapplied and ingenuity perverted.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas Sindall enjoyed an eſtate of 5000 l. a year in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly's pariſh. His father left him, when but a child, poſſeſſed of an eſtate to the amount we have juſt mentioned, and of a very large ſum of money beſides, which his economy had ſaved him from its produce. His mother, though a very good woman, was a very bad parent; ſhe loved her ſon, as too many mothers do, with that inſtinctive affection which nature has beſtowed on the loweſt rank of creatures.</p>
                     <p>She loved him as her ſon, though he inherited none of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and becauſe ſhe happened to have no other child, ſhe reared this in ſuch a manner, as was moſt likely to prevent the comfort he might have afforded herſelf, and the uſefulneſs of which he might have been to ſociety. In ſhort, he did what he liked, at firſt becauſe his ſpirit ſhould not be confined too early, and afterwards he did what he liked, becauſe it was paſt being confined at all.</p>
                     <p>But his temper was not altogether of that fiery kind, which ſome young men, ſo circumſtanced, and ſo educated, are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of. There was a degree of prudence which grew up with him from a boy, that tempered the ſallies of paſſion to make its object more ſure in the acquiſition.</p>
                     <p>When at ſchool, he was always the conductor of miſchief, though he did not often participate in its execution; and his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to his maſter was ſuch, that he was a favourite without any

abilities at a ſcholar, and acquired a character for regularity, while his aſſociates were daily flogged for tranſgreſſions, which he had guided in their progreſs, and enjoyed the fruits of in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion. There ſometimes aroſe ſuſpicions of the reality; but even thoſe who diſcovered them mingled a certain degree of praiſe with their cenſure, and propheſied, that he would be <hi>A Man of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As he advanced in life, he faſhioned his behaviour to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent humours of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood; he hunted with the fox-hunters through the day, and drank with them in the evening. With theſe he diverted himſelf at the expence of the ſober prigs, as he termed them, that looked after the improvement of their eſtates when it was fair, and read a book within doors when it rained; and to-morrow he talked on farming with this latter claſs, and ridiculed the hunting phraſes, and boiſterous mirth of his yeſterday's companions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They were very well pleaſed to laugh at one another, while he laughed in his ſleeve at both. This was ſometimes diſcovered, and people were going to be angry—but ſomebody ſaid in excuſe that Sindall was</hi> A Man of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>While the Oxford terms laſted, (to which place he had gone in the courſe of modern education) there were frequent reports in the country of the diſſipated life he led; it was even ſaid that he had diſappeared from college for ſix weeks together, during which time he was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having taken a trip to London with another man's wife; this was only mentioned in a whiſper; it was loudly denied; people doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at firſt, and ſhortly forgot it. Some little extravagances they ſaid he might have been guilty of. It was impoſſible for a man of two and twenty to ſeclude himſelf altogether from company; and you could not look for the temperance a hermit in a young baronet of</hi> 5000 <hi>l. a year. It is indiſpenſable for ſuch a man to come forth into life a little; with</hi> 5000 <hi>l. a year, one muſt be</hi> A Man of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His firſt tutor, whoſe learning was as extenſive, as his manners were pure, left him in diſguſt; ſober people wondered at this; but he was ſoon provided with another with whom he had got acquainted at Oxford: one whom every body declared to be much fitter for the tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of young Sindall, being like his pupil,</hi> A Man of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But though his extravagance in ſquandering money, under the tuition of this gentleman, was frequently complained of, yet it was found that he was not altogether thoughtleſs of its acquiſition. Upon the ſale of an eſtate in his neighbourhood, it was diſcovered that a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous mortgage, which had ſtood in the name of another, had been really tranſacted for the benefit of young Sindall. His prudent friends plumed themſelves upon this intelligence; and according to their uſe of the phraſe, began to hope, that, after ſowing his wild <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. The Footing on which he ſtood with Anneſly and his Family.</head>
                     <p>THOUGH ſuch a man as we have deſcribed might be reckoned a valuable acquaintance by many, he was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reckoned by Anneſly; he had heard enough (though he had heard but part) of his character, to conſider him as a dangerous neighbour; but it was impoſſible to avoid ſometimes ſeeing him, from whoſe father he had got the living which he now occupied. There is no tax ſo heavy on a little man, as an acquaintance with a great one. Anneſly had found this in the life-time of Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Sindall. He was one of thoſe whom the general voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces to be a good ſort of man, under which denomination I never look for much ſenſe, or much delicacy.</p>
                     <p>In fact the baronet poſſeſſed but little of either; he lived hoſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably for his own ſake, as well as that of his gueſts, becauſe he liked a good dinner and a bottle of wine after it; and in one part of hoſpitality he excelled, which was, the faculty of making every body drunk that had not uncommon fortitude to withſtand his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks. Anneſly's cloth protected him from this laſt inconvenience; but it often drew from Sir William a ſet of jeſts, which his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had enabled him to retain, and had paſſed through the heirs of his family, like their eſtate, down from the days of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of facetious memory, Charles the Second.</p>
                     <p>Though to a man of Anneſly's delicacy all this could not but be highly diſagreeable, yet gratitude made him Sir William's gueſt often enough to ſhow that he had not forgot that attention which his paſt favours demanded; and Sir William recollected them from another motive, to wit, that they gave a ſanction to thoſe liberties he ſometimes uſed with him who had received them.</p>
                     <p>This might have been held ſufficient to have cancelled the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; but Anneſly was not wont to be directed by the eaſieſt rules of virtue; the impreſſion ſtill remained, and it even deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſon after the death of the father.</p>
                     <p>Sindall therefore was a frequent gueſt at his houſe; and, though it might have been imagined, that the diſſipated mind of a young man of his fortune would have found but little delight in Anneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's humble ſhed, yet he ſeemed to enjoy its ſimplicity with the higheſt reliſh; he poſſeſſed indeed that pliancy of diſpoſition that could wonderfully accommodate himſelf to the humour of every one around him; and he ſo managed matters in his viſits to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly, that this laſt began to imagine the reports he had heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, to be either entirely falſe, or at leaſt aggravated much beyond truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:018007_0025_0FA456D49C5B3760"/>From what motive ſoever Sindall began theſe viſits, he ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a very ſtrong inducement to continue them. Harriet An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly was now arrived at the ſize, if not the age of womanhood; and poſſeſſed an uncommon degree of beauty and elegance of form. In her face joined to the moſt perfect ſymmetry of features was a melting expreſſion, ſuited to that ſenſibility of ſoul we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned her to be endowed with.</p>
                     <p>In her perſon, rather above the common ſize, ſhe exhibited a degree of eaſe and gracefulneſs which nature alone had given, and art was not allowed to diminiſh. Upon ſuch a woman Sindall could not look with indifference; and according to his principles of libertiniſm, he had marked her as a prey, which his ſituation gave him opportunities of purſuing, and which one day he could not fail to poſſeſs.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of his acquaintance he began to diſcover, that the ſoftneſs of her ſoul was diſtant from ſimplicity, and that much art would be neceſſary to overcome a virtue, which the hand of a parent had carefully fortified. He aſſumed therefore the ſemblance of thoſe tender feelings, which were moſt likely to gain the eſteem of the daughter, while he talked with that appearance of candour and principle, which he thought neceſſary to procure him the confidence of the father.</p>
                     <p>He would frequently confeſs, with a ſigh, that his youth had been ſometimes unwarily drawn into error; then graſp Anneſly's hand, and looking earneſtly in his face, beg him to ſtrengthen by his counſel the good reſolutions which he thanked heaven he had been enabled to make. Upon the whole, he continued to gain ſuch a degree of eſtimation with the family, that the young folks ſpoke of his ſeeming good qualities with pleaſure, and their father mentioned his ſuppoſed foibles with regret.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. Young Anneſly goes to Oxford — The Friendſhip of Sindall — Its Conſequences.</head>
                     <p>UPON its being determined that young Anneſly ſhould go to Oxford, Sir Thomas ſhewed him remarkable kindneſs and attention. He conducted him thither in his own carriage; and as his kinſman, to whoſe charge he was committed, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accidentally to be for ſome time unable to aſſign him an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his houſe, Sindall quitted his own lodging to accommodate him.</p>
                     <p>To a young man newly launched into life, removed from the only ſociety he had ever known, to another compoſed of ſtangers, ſuch aſſiduity of notice could not be but highly pleaſing; and in his letters to his father he did not fail to ſet forth, in the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018007_0026_0FA456D52B877690"/>
manner, the obligations he had to ſir Thomas. His father, whom years had taught wiſdom, but whoſe warmth of gratitude they had not diminiſhed, felt the favour as acutely as his ſon; nor did the foreſight of meaner ſouls ariſe in his breaſt to abate its acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The hopes which he had formed of his Billy were not diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He very ſoon diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the univerſity for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and genius; and in the correſpondence of his kinſman were recited daily inſtances of the notice which his parts attracted. But his praiſe was cold in compariſon with Sindall's; he wrote to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly of his young friend's acquirement and abilities, in a ſtrain of enthuſiaſtic encomium; and ſeemed to ſpeak the language of his own enjoyment, at the applauſe of others which he repeated. It was on this ſide that Anneſly's ſoul was acceſſible, for on this ſide lay that pride which is the weakneſs of all. On this ſide did Sindall overcome it.</p>
                     <p>From thoſe very qualities alſo which he applauded in the ſon, he derived the temptation with which he meant to ſeduce him; for ſuch was the plan of exquiſite miſchief he had formed; beſides the common deſire of depravity to make proſelytes from innocence, he conſidered the virtue of the brother as that ſtructure on the ruin of which he was to accompliſh the conqueſt of the ſiſter's. He introduced him therefore into the company of ſome of the moſt artful of his own aſſociates, who loudly echoed the praiſes he laviſhed on his friend, and ſhewed, or pretended to ſhew, that value for his acquaintance, which was the ſtrongeſt recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own.</p>
                     <p>The diffidence which Anneſly's youth and inexperience had at firſt laid upon his mind, they removed by the encouragement which their approbation of his opinions beſtowed; and he found himſelf indebted to them both for an eaſe of delivering his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the reputation which their ſuffrages conferred upon them.</p>
                     <p>For all this, however, they expected a return; and Anneſly had not fortitude to deny it— an indulgence for ſome trivial irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities which they now and then permitted to appear in their converſation. At firſt their new acquaintance took no notice of them at all; he found that he could not approve, and it would have hurt him to condemn.</p>
                     <p>By degrees he began to allow them his laugh, though his ſoul was little at eaſe under the gaiety which his features aſſumed — once or twice when the majority againſt him appeared to be ſmall, he ventured to argue, though with a caution of giving offence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of the ſentiments he heard.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe occaſions Sindall artfully joined him in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but they were always overcome. He had to deal with men who were ſkilled, by a mere act of the memory, in all the ſophiſms which voluptuaries have framed to juſtify the unbounded purſuit of pleaſure; and thoſe who had not learning to argue, had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018007_0027_0FA456D6CE6E7928"/>
to laugh. Yet Anneſly's conviction was not changed; but the edge of his abhorrence to vice was blunted; and though his virtue kept her poſt, ſhe found herſelf galled in maintaining it.</p>
                     <p>It was not till ſome time after, that they ventured to ſolicit his participation of their pleaſures; and it was not till after many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations that his innocence was overcome. But the progreſs of their victories was rapid after his firſt defeat. And he ſhortly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſtation of experienced vice, and began to aſſume a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority from the undauntedneſs with which he practiſed it.</p>
                     <p>But it was neceſſary, the while, to deceive that relation under whoſe inſpection his father had placed him; in truth it was no very hard matter to deceive him. He was a man of that abſtracted diſpoſition, that it ſeldom converſant with any thing around it. Simplicity of manners was, in him, the effect of an apathy in his conſtitution (encreaſed by conſtant ſtudy) that was proof againſt all violence of paſſion or deſire; and he thought, if he thought of the matter at all, that all men were like himſelf, whoſe indolence could never be overcome by the pleaſure of purſuit, or the joys of attainment.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, Mr. Lumley, that tutor of Sindall's whom we have formerly mentioned, was a man the beſt calculated in the world for lulling his ſuſpicions aſleep, if his nature had ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to ariſe. This man, whoſe parts were of that pliable kind that eaſily acquire a ſuperficial knowlege of every thing, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the talent of hypocriſy as deeply as the deſire of pleaſure; and while in reality he was the moſt profligate of men, he had that command of paſſion, which never ſuffered it to intrude where he could wiſh it concealed; he preſerved in the opinion of Mr. Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the gravity of a ſtudious and contemplative character which was ſo congenial to his own: and he would often riſe from a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical diſcuſſion with the old gentleman, leaving him in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the depth of his reading, and the acuteneſs of his parts, to join the debauch of Sindall and his diſſolute companions.</p>
                     <p>By his aſſiſtance therefore Anneſly's diſſipation was effectually ſcreened from the notice of his kinſman; Jephſon was even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on by falſe ſuggeſtions to write to the country continued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums on his ſobriety and application to ſtudy; and the father, who was happy in believing him, enquired no farther.</p>

                     <p>SINDALL having brought the mind of his proſelyte to that conformity of ſentiment to which he had thus laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, ventured to diſcover to him the paſſion he had conceived
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018007_0028_0FA456D820821CF0"/>
for his ſiſter. The occaſion, however, on which he diſcovered it, was ſuch a one as he imagined gave him ſome title to be liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly had an allowance ſettled on him by his father, rather in truth above what his circumſtances might warrant with propriety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as the feelings of the good man's heart were, in every virtuous purpoſe, ſomewhat beyond the limitations of his fortune, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined rather to pinch himſelf, than to ſtop any channel through which advantage might flow to his ſon; and meant his education and his manners to be in every reſpect liberal and accompliſhed. But this allowance ill ſufficed to gratify the extravagance which his late connexion had taught him; he began very ſoon to know a want which he had never hitherto experienced: at firſt this not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limited his pleaſures, but began to check the deſire of them, and in ſome meaſure ſerved to awaken that ſenſe of contrition, which their rotation had before overcome.</p>
                     <p>But Sindall took care that he ſhould not be thus left to reflexion; and as ſoon as he gueſſed the cauſe, prevented its continuance by an immediate ſupply, offered, and indeed urged, with all the open warmth of diſintereſted friendſhip. From being accuſtomed to receive, Anneſly at laſt overcame the ſhame of aſking, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied repeatedly for ſums, under the denomination of loans, for the payment of which he could only draw upon contingency. His neceſſities were the more frequent, as, amongſt other arts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which he had lately acquired, that of gaming had not been omitted.</p>
                     <p>Having one night loſt a ſum, conſiderably above what he was able to pay, to a member of their ſociety with whom he was in no degree of intimacy, he gave him his note payable the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for this was the regulated limitation of their credit) though he knew that to morrow would find him as poor as to-night. On theſe particular occaſions, when his hours would have been ſo highly irregular, that they could not eſcape the cenſure of Mr. Jephſon, or his family, he uſed to pretend, that, for the ſake of diſentangling ſome point of ſtudy with Sindall and his tutor, he had paſſed the night with them at their lodgings, and what ſmall portion of it was allowed for ſleep he did actually ſpend there. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this loſs therefore, he accompanied Sindall home, and could not, it may well be ſuppoſed, conceal from him the ſhagreen it occaſioned. His friend as uſual advanced him money for diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the debt.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly, who never had bad occaſion to borrow ſo much from him before, expreſſed his ſorrow at the neceſſity which his honour laid him under, of accepting ſo large a ſum. Poh! anſwered Sindall, 'tis but a trifle, and what a man muſt now and then loſe to be thought genteelly of. "Yes, if his fortune can afford i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That ſuch ſhould be the lot of my friend, I can regret — thanks to my better ſtars, I can more than regret it. What is the value of this droſs (holding a handful of gold) but to make the ſituation of merit level with its deſervings! Yet, believe me, there are wants which riches cannot remove, deſires which ſometimes they cannot ſatisfy; even at this moment, your ſeeming-happy Sindall, in whoſe lap fortune has poured her bleſſings, has his cares, my Anneſly has his inquietudes, which need the hand of friendſhip to comfort and to ſooth."</p>
                     <p>Anneſly, with all the warmth of his nature, inſiſted on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking his uneaſineſs, that if he could not alleviate, he might at leaſt condole with his diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Sindall embraced him; "I know your friendſhip, ſaid he, and I will put it to the proof. You have a ſiſter, the lovely, the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Harriet; ſhe has robb'd me of that peace which the ſmile of fortune cannot reſtore, as her frown has been unable to take away! did you know the burnings of this boſom! but I ſpeak unthinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what perhaps my delicacy ſhould not have whiſpered, even in the ear of friendſhip. Pardon me—the ardor of a love like mine may be forgiven ſome extravagance."</p>
                     <p>Anneſly's eyes ſufficiently teſtified his inward ſatisfaction at this diſcovery, but he recollected the dignity which his ſituation requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and replied calmly, "that he pretended no guidance of his ſiſter's inclinations; that his own gratitude for ſir Thomas's fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours he had ever loudly declared; and that he knew his ſiſter felt enough on his account, to make the introduction of her brother's friend a more than uſually favourable one."</p>
                     <p>"But my ſituation, returned Sindall, is extremely particular; you have heard my opinions on the ſcore of love often declared; and truſt me, they are the genuine ſentiments of my heart. The trammels of form, which the unfeeling cuſtom of the world has thrown upon the freedom of mutual affection, are inſupportable to that fineneſs of ſoul, to which reſtraint and happineſs are terms of oppoſition. Let my miſtreſs be my miſtreſs ſtill, with all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of a wife, without a wife's indifference or a wife's diſquiet. —My fortune the property of her and her friends, but that liberty alone reſerved, which is the ſtrongeſt bond of the affection ſhe ſhould wiſh to poſſeſs from me."—</p>
                     <p>He looked ſtedfaſtly in Anneſly's face, which by this time began to aſſume every mark of reſentment and indignation. He eyed him aſcant with an affected ſmile: — "You ſmile, ſir," ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018007_0030_0FA456D8F787BE78"/>
whoſe breath was ſtifled by the ſwelling of his heart — Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall laugh'd aloud: "I am a wretched hypocrite, ſaid he, and could contain myſelf no longer." "So you were but in jeſt, it ſeems," replied the other, ſettling his features into a dry compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>"My dear Anneſly, returned he, had you but ſeen the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this trial of mine gave you; it would have made a picture worthy of the gallery of Florence. I wanted to have a perfect idea of ſurprize, indignation, ſtruggling friendſhip, and ſwelling hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and I think I ſucceeded. — But I keep you from your reſt — Good night—and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> walked out of the room."</p>
                     <p>Anneſly had felt too much to be able to reſign himſelf ſpeedily to reſt; he could not but think this joke of his friend rather a ſerious one; yet he had ſeen him ſometimes carry this ſpecies of wit to a very extraordinary length; but the indelicacy of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance was not to be eaſily accounted for — he doubted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, was angry, and pacified by turns; the remembrance of his favours aroſe; they aroſe at firſt in a form that added to the malignity of the offence; then the ſeries in which they had been beſtowed, ſeem'd to plead on the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, when worn by the fighting of contrary emotions, he look'd forward to the conſequences of a rupture with Sindall; the pleaſures of that ſociety of which he was the leader, the habitual tie which it had got on Anneſly's ſoul, prevail'd; for he had by this time loſt that ſatisfaction which was wont to flow from himſelf. He ſhut his mind againſt the ſuggeſtions of any further ſuſpicion, and, with that winking cowardice, which many miſtake for reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, was reſolved to truſt him for his friend, whom it would have hurt him to conſider as an enemy.</p>
                     <p>Sindall, on the other hand, diſcovered that the youth was not ſo entirely at his diſpoſal as he had imagined him; and that though he was proſelyte enough to be wicked, he muſt be led a little farther to be uſeful.</p>

                     <p>TO continue that train of diſſipation, in which their pupil had been initiated, was the buſineſs of Sindall and his aſſociates. Though they contrived, as we have before mentioned, to eſcape the immediate notice of Mr. Jephſon, yet the eyes of others could not be ſo eaſily blinded; the behaviour of Anneſly began to be

talk'd of for its irregularity, and the more ſo, for the change which it had undergone from that ſimplicity of manners which he had brought with him to Oxford. And ſome one, whether from regard to him, or what other motive I know not, informed his kinſman of what every one but his kinſman ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>Upon this information he gave the young man a lecture in the uſual terms of admonition; but an effort was always painful to him, even where the office was more agreeable than that of reproof. He had recourſe therefore to the aſſiſtance of his fellow-philoſopher Mr. Lumley, whom he informed of the accounts he had received of Anneſy's imprudence, and entreated to take the proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, from his influence with the young gentleman, to make him ſenſible of the impropriety of his paſt conduct, and to prevent its continuance for the future.</p>
                     <p>Lumley expreſſed his ſurprize at this intelligence, with unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel'd command of features; regretted the too prevailing diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth, affected to doubt the truth of the accuſation, but promiſed at the ſame time, to make the proper enquiries into the fact, and take the moſt prudent method of preventing a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſo dangerous, as that of drawing from the road of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one whom he believed to be poſſeſſed of ſo many good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as Mr. Anneſly.</p>
                     <p>Whether Mr. Lumley employed his talents towards his reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or degeneracy, it is certain that Anneſly's conduct betrayed many marks of the latter; at laſt, in an hour of intoxication, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in a quarrel with one of his companions, it produced conſequences ſo notorious, that the proctor could not fail to take notice of it; and that officer of the univerſity having interpoſed his authority, in a manner which the humour of Anneſly, inflammable as it then was, could not brook, he broke forth into ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances ſo perſonally offenſive, that when the matter came to be canvaſſed, nothing ſhort of expulſion was talk'd of as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the offence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was then that Mr. Jephſon firſt informed his father of thoſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities which his ſon had been guilty of. His father indeed, from the diſcontinuance of that gentleman's correſpondence much beyond the uſual time, had begun to make ſome unfavorable conjectures; but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for this neglect from many different cauſes; and when once his ingenuity had taken that ſide of the argument, it quickly found means to convince him that his kinſman's ſilence could not be imputed to any fault of his ſon.</hi>

That young gentleman, after touching, in the tendereſt manner, on the pain which a father muſt feel from the errors of his children, adminiſtered the only comfort that was left to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, by repreſenting, that young Anneſly's fault had been exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated much beyond the truth, and that it was entirely owing to the effects of a warm temper, accidentally inflamed with liquor, and provoked by ſome degree of inſolence in the officer to whom the outrage had been offer'd; he particularly regretted that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſpoſition towards ſobriety, had prevented himſelf from being preſent at that meeting, in which caſe, he ſaid, he was pretty cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this unlucky affair had never happened; that, as it was, the only thing left for his friendſhip to do, was to amend what it had not lain within his power to prevent; and he begg'd, as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the old gentleman's regard, that he might honour him ſo far as to commit to him the care of ſetting matters to rights with regard to the character of his ſon, which he hoped to be ſoon able effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to reſtore.</p>
                     <p>The earlieſt conſolation which a man receives after any calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is hallowed for ever in his regard, as a benighted traveller careſſes the dog whoſe barking firſt announced him to be near the habitations of men.</p>
                     <p>It was ſo with Anneſly; his unſuſpecting heart overflowed with gratitude towards this friend of his ſon, and he now grew laviſh of his confidence towards him, in proportion as he recollected hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once (in his preſent opinion unjuſtly) denied it.</p>

                     <p>SIR Thomas did accordingly deliver this letter of Anneſly's to his ſon; and as the penitence which the young man then felt for his recent offence, made the aſſumption of a character of ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proper, he accompanied this paternal remonſtrance with advices of his own, dictated alike by friendſhip and prudence.</p>
                     <p>They were at this time, indeed, but little neceſſary; in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval between the paroxyſms of pleaſure and diſſipation, the genuine feelings of his nature had time to ariſe; and, awakened as they now were by the letters of his father and ſiſter, their voice was irreſiſtible: he kiſs'd the ſignature of their names a thouſand times, and, weeping on Sindall's neck, imprecated the wrath of heaven on his own head, that could thus heap affliction on the age of the beſt of parents.</p>

                     <p>His father received it, not without thoſe pangs, which the thought of ſeparation from a ſon, on whom the peace of his ſoul reſted, muſt cauſe; but he examined it with that impartiality which his wiſdom ſuggeſted in every thing that concerned his children: "My own ſatisfaction, he would often ſay, has for its object only the few years of a waning life; the ſituation of my children, my hopes would extend to the importance of a much longer period."</p>
                     <p>He held the balance therefore in an even hand; the arguments of Sindall had much of the ſpecious, as his inducement to uſe them had much of the friendly. The young gentleman, whom Billy was to accompany, had connexions of ſuch weight in the ſtate, that the faireſt proſpects ſeemed to open from their patronage; nor could the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>There were not however wanting ſome conſiderations of reaſon to ſide with a parent's tears againſt the journey: but Sindall had anſwers for them all; and at laſt he wrung from him his ſlow leave, on condition that William ſhould return home, for a ſingle day, to bid the laſt farewell to his father and his Harriet.</p>
                     <p>Mean time the puniſhment of Anneſly's late offence in the univerſity was mitigated by the intereſt of Sindall, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Mr. Jephſon. Expulſion, which had before been inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, was changed into a ſentence of leſs indignity, to wit, that of being publickly reprimanded by the head of the college to which he belonged; after ſubmitting to which, he ſet out, accompanied by ſir Thomas, to bid adieu to his father's houſe, preparatory to his going abroad.</p>

The tear which he offered to it was the ſacrifice of his heart; wrung by the recollection of the paſt, and ſwelling with the purpoſe of the future.</p>
                     <p>When the morning of his departure arrived, he ſtole ſoftly into his father's chamber, meaning to take leave of him without being ſeen by his ſiſter, whoſe tenderneſs of ſoul could not eaſily bear the pangs of a ſolemn farewell.</p>
                     <p>He found his father on his knees. — The good man, riſing with that ſerene dignity of aſpect which thoſe ſacred duties ever conferred on him, turned to his ſon: "You go, my boy, ſaid he, to a diſtant land, far from the guidance and protection of your earthly parent; I was recommending you to the care of him who is at all times preſent with you: though I am not ſuperſtitious, yet, I confeſs, I feel ſomething about me as if I ſhould never ſee you more; if theſe are my laſt words, let them be treaſur'd in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance—Live as becomes a man, and a chriſtian; live as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him who is to live for ever!"</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke, his daughter entered the room. "Ah! my Billy, ſaid ſhe, could you have been ſo cruel as to go without ſeeing your Harriet? it would have broken my heart! oh! I have much to ſay and many farewells to take; yet now methinks I can ſay nothing, and ſcarce dare bid you farewell!" — "My children, interrupted her father, in this cabinet is a preſent I have always intended for each of you; and this, which is perhaps the laſt time we ſhall meet together, I think the fitteſt to beſtow them. Here, my Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, is a miniature of that angel your mother; imitate her virtues, and be happy.—Here, my Billy, is its counterpart, a picture of your father; whatever he is, heaven knows his affection to you; let that endear the memorial, and recommend that conduct to his ſon which will make his father's grey hairs go down to the grave in peace!" Tears were the only anſwer that either could give. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly embraced his ſon and bleſs'd him.</p>
                     <p>Harriet blubber'd on his neck! Twice he offered to go, and twice the agony of his ſiſter pulled him back; at laſt ſhe flung her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the arms of her father, who beckoning to ſir Thomas Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, juſt then arrived to carry off his companion, that young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who was himſelf not a little affected with the ſcene, took his friend by the hand, and led him to the carriage that waited them.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. He reaches London, where he remains longer than was expected. The effects of his ſtay there.</head>
                     <p>IN a few days Anneſly and his friend the baronet arrived in the metropolis. His father had been informed, that the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom he was to accompany in his travels was to meet him in that city, where they propoſed to remain only a week or two; for the purpoſe of ſeeing any thing curious in town, and of ſetttling ſome points of accommodation on their rout through the countries they meant to viſit: an intelligence he confeſſed very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to him, becauſe he knew the temptations to which a young man is expoſed by a life of idleneſs in London.</p>
                     <p>But, in truth, the intention of ſir Thomas Sindall never was, that his preſent pupil (if we may ſo call him) ſhould travel any farther. The young gentleman, for whoſe companion he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to engage Anneſly, was indeed to ſet out very ſoon after on the tour of Europe; but he had already been provided with a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling governor, who was to meet him upon his arrival at Calais (for the air of England agreed ſo ill with this gentleman's conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that he never croſs'd the channel) and who had made the ſame journey, ſeveral times before, with ſome Engliſh young men of great fortunes, whom he had the honour of returning to their native country, with the ſame ſovereign contempt for it that he himſelf entertained.</p>
                     <p>The purpoſe of Sindall was merely to remove the ſon to a ſtill greater diſtance from his father, and to a ſcene where his own plan, of entire converſion, ſhould meet with every aid, which the ſociety of the idle and the profligate could give it.</p>
                     <p>For ſome time, however, he found the diſpoſition of Anneſly averſe to his deſigns. The figure of his father venerable in virtue, of his ſiſter lovely in innocence, were imprinted on his mind; and the variety of public places of entertainment, to which ſir Thomas conducted him, could not immediately efface the impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>But as their novelty at firſt delighted, their frequency at laſt ſubdued him; his mind began to accuſtom itſelf to the hurry of thoughtleſs amuſement, and to feel a painful vacancy, when the buſtle of the ſcene was at any time changed for ſolitude. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained warmth and energy of his temper, yielded up his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the company of fools, and his reſolutions of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſociety of the diſſolute, becauſe it caught the fervor of the preſent moment, before reaſon could pauſe on the diſpoſal of the next; and, by the induſtry of Sindall, he found, every day, a ſet of friends, among whom the moſt engaging were always the moſt licentious, and joined to every thing which the good deteſt, every thing which the unthinking admire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:018007_0038_0FA45DBF5CBC9140"/>I have often indeed been tempted to imagine, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unfortunate, if not blameable, in that harſhneſs and auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which virtue too often aſſumes; and have ſeen, with regret, ſome excellent men, the authority of whoſe underſtanding, and the attraction of whoſe wit, might have retained many a deſerter under the banners of goodneſs, loſe all that power of ſervice, by the unbending diſtance which they kept from the little pleaſantries and ſweetneſſes of life.</p>
                     <p>This conduct may be ſafe, but there is ſomething ungenerous and cowardly in it; to keep their forces, like an over-cautious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, in faſtneſſeſs, and fortified towns, while they ſuffer the enemy to waſte and ravage the champaign. Praiſe is indeed due to him, who can any way preſerve his integrity; but ſurely the heart that can retain it, even while it opens to all the warmth of ſocial feeling, will be an offering more acceptable in the eye of heaven.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly was diſtant from any counſel or example, that might counterbalance the contagious influence of the diſſolute ſociety, with which his time was now engroſs'd; but his ſeduction was not complete, till the better principles, which his ſoul ſtill retained, were made acceſſary to its accompliſhment.</p>
                     <p>Sindall procured a woman infamous enough for his purpoſe, the caſt miſtreſs of one of his former companions, whom he tutored to invent a plauſible ſtory of diſtreſs and miſfortune, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, in a manner ſeemingly accidental, to have communicated to Anneſly. His native compaſſion, and his native warmth, were intereſted in her ſufferings and her wrongs; and he applauded himſelf for the protection which he afforded her, while ſhe was the abandoned inſtrument of his undoing.</p>
                     <p>After having retained, for ſome time, the purity of her guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and protector, in an hour of intoxication he ventured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her on a looſer footing; and ſhe had afterwards the addreſs to make him believe, that the weakneſs of her gratitude had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, what to any other her virtue would have refuſed; and during the criminal intercourſe in which he lived with her, ſhe continued to maintain a character of affection and tenderneſs, which might excuſe the guilt of her own conduct, and account for the infatuation of his.</p>
                     <p>In this fatal connexion every remembrance of that weeping home which he had ſo lately left, with the reſolutions of penitence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, was eraſed from his mind; or, if at times it intruded, it came not that gentle gueſt, at whoſe approach his boſom uſed to be thrilled with reverence and love, but approached in the form of ſome ungracious monitor, whoſe buſineſs was to baniſh pleaſure and awaken remorſe; and, therefore, the next amuſement, folly, or vice, was called in to his aid to baniſh and expel it. As it was ſometimes neceſſary to write to his father, he fell upon an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, even to ſave himſelf the pain of thinking ſo long as that purpoſe required, on a ſubject now grown ſo irkſome to him, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018007_0039_0FA45DC04AD70A28"/>
employed that woman, in whoſe toils he was thus ſhamefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, to read the letters he received, and dictate ſuch anſwers as her cunning could ſuggeſt, to miſlead the judgment of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting parent.</p>
                     <p>All this while Sindall artfully kept ſo much aloof, as to preſerve, even with the ſon, ſomething of that character which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with the father; he was often abſent from parties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable irregularity, and ſometimes ventured a gentle cenſure on his friend for having been led into them. But while he ſeemed to check their continuance under this cloak of prudence, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged it in the report he made of the voice of others; for while the ſcale of character, for temperance, ſobriety, and morals, ſinks on one ſide, there is a balance of fame in the mouths of part of the world riſing on the other—Anneſly could bear to be told of his ſpirit, his generoſity, and his honour.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIV. He feels the diſtreſſes of poverty. He is put on a method of relieving them. An account of its ſucceſs.</head>
                     <p>THE manner of life which Anneſly now purſued without reſtraint. was neceſſarily productive of ſuch expence as he could very ill afford. But the craft of his female aſſociate was not much at a loſs for pretences, to make frequent demands on the generoſsity of his father. The ſame excuſes which ſerved to account for his ſtay in London, in ſome meaſure apologized for the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſums he drew for; if it was neceſſary for him to remain there, expence, if not unavoidable, was at leaſt difficult to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and for the cauſes of his ſtay in that city he had only to repeat the accounts, which he daily received from Sindall, of various acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which obliged his young friend to poſtpone his intended tour.</p>
                     <p>Though in the country there was little opportunity of knowing the town-irregularities of Anneſly, yet there were not wanting ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it among ſome, of which it is likely his father might have heard enough to alarm him, had he not been at this time in ſuch a ſtate of health as prevented him from much ſociety with his neighbours; a ſlow agueiſh diſorder, which followed thoſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms his daughter's letter to her brother had deſcribed, having confined him to his chamber almoſt conſtantly from the time of his ſon's departure.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly had ſtill ſome bluſhes left, and when he had puſh'd his father's indulgence, in the article of ſupply, as far as ſhame would allow him, he look'd round for ſome other ſource whence preſent relief might be drawn, without daring to conſider how the arrearages of the future ſhould be cancelled. Sindall for ſome

time anſwered his exigences without reluctance; but at laſt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, as he ſaid with regret, that he could not from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances afford him, at that immediate juncture, any further aſſiſtance than a ſmall ſum, which he then put into Anneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's bands, and which the very next day was ſquandered by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality of his miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>The next morning he roſe without knowing how the wants of the day were to be provided for, and ſtrolling out into one of his accuſtomed walks, gave himſelf up to all the pangs, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpect of the paſt, and the idea of the preſent, ſuggeſted. But he felt not that contrition which reſults from ingenuous ſorrow for our offences; his ſoul was ruled by that gloomy demon, who looks only to the anguiſh of their puniſhment, and accuſes the hand of providence, for calamity which himſelf has occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation he was met by one of his new-acquired friends, who was walking off the oppreſſion of laſt night's riot. The mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy of his countenance was ſo eaſily obſervable, that it could not eſcape the notice of his companion, who rallied him on the ſeriouſneſs of his aſpect, in the cant-phraſe of thoſe brutes of our ſpecies, who are profeſſed enemies to the faculty of thinking. Though Anneſly's pride for a while kept him ſilent, it was at laſt overcome by the other's importunity, and he confeſſed the deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his circumſtances to be the cauſe of his preſent depreſſion. His companion, whoſe purſe, as himſelf informed Anneſly, had been fluſhed by the ſucceſs of the preceding night, animated by the liberality which attends ſudden good fortune, freely offered him the uſe of twenty pieces till better times ſhould enable him to repay them.</p>
                     <p>"But, ſaid he gayly, it is a ſhame for a fellow of your parts to want money, when fortune has provided ſo many rich fools for the harveſt of the wiſe and the induſtrious. If you'll allow me to be your conductor this evening, I will ſhow you where, by the traffic of your wits, in a very ſhort time you may convert theſe twenty guineas into fifty."</p>
                     <p>"At play," replied Anneſly coolly. "Ay at play, returned the other, and fair play too: 'tis the only profeſſion left for a man of ſpirit and honour to purſue: to cheat as a merchant, to quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a lawyer, or to cant as a churchman, is confined to fellows who have no fire in their compoſition. Give me but a bold ſet, and a fair throw for it, and then for the life of a lord, or the death of a gentleman."</p>
                     <p>"I have had but little experience in the profeſſion, ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly, and ſhould but throw away your money." "Never fear, replied the other; do but mark me, and I will enſure you; I will ſhow you our men; pigeons, more pigeons, by Jupiter."</p>
                     <p>It was not for a man in Anneſly's ſituation to balk the promiſe of ſuch a golden opportunity; they dined together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018007_0041_0FA45DC3C9BFB658"/>
repaired to a gaming-houſe, where Anneſly's companion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced him, as a friend of his, juſt arrived from the country, to ſeveral young gentlemen who ſeemed to be waiting his arrival. — "I promiſed you your revenge, ſaid he, my dears, and you ſhall have it; ſome of my friend's Lady-day rents too have accompanied him to London; if you win, you ſhall wear them. To buſineſs, to buſineſs."</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of their play, Anneſly, though but moderately ſkilled in the game, diſcovered that the company, to whom he had been introduced, were in reality ſuch bubbles as his companion had repreſented them; after being heated by ſome ſmall ſucceſs in the beginning, they began to bet extravagantly againſt every calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chances; and in an hour or two, his aſſociate and he had ſtripped them of a very conſiderable ſum, of which his own ſhare, though much the ſmaller, was upwards of threeſcore guineas. When they left the houſe, he offered his conductor the ſum he had lent him, with a profuſion of thanks both for the uſe and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it. "No, my boy, ſaid he, not now; your note is ſufficient: I will rather call for it, when I am at a pinch; you ſee now the road to wealth and independence; you will meet me here to-morrow." He promiſed to meet him accordingly.</p>
                     <p>They had been but a few minutes in the room this ſecond night, when a gentleman entered, whom the company ſaluted with the appellation of ſquire: the greater part of them ſeemed to be charmed with his preſence; but the countenance of Anneſly's companion fell at his approach; "damn him, ſaid he, in a whiſper to Anneſly, he's a knowing one."</p>
                     <p>In ſome degree indeed he deſerved the title: for he had attained, from pretty long experience, aſſiſted by natural quickneſs of parts, a conſiderable knowlege in the ſcience; and in ſtrokes of genius, at games where genius was required, was excelled by few. But after all, he was far from being ſucceſsful in the profeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intended him for ſomething better; and as he ſpoiled a wit, an orator, and perhaps a poet, by turning gambler; ſo he often ſpoiled a gambler by the ambition, which was not yet entirely quenched, of ſhining occaſionally in all thoſe characters. And as a companion, he was too pleaſing, and too well pleas'd, to keep that cool indifference, which is the characteriſtic of him, who ſhould be always poſſeſs'd of himſelf, and conſider every other man only as the ſpunge from whom he is to ſqueeze advantage.</p>
                     <p>To the preſent party, however, he was unqueſtionably ſuperior; and of courſe in a ſhort time began to levy large contributions, not only on the more inexperienced, whom Anneſly and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor had mark'd for their own booty, but likewiſe on theſe two gentlemen themſelves, whoſe winnings of the formes evening, were now faſt diminiſhing before the ſuperior ſkill of this new antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>But, in the midſt of his ſucceſs, he was interrupted by the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of another gentleman, who ſeem'd alſo to be a well-known
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018007_0042_0FA45DC4CF377648"/>
character in this temple of fortune, being ſaluted by the familiar name of Black-beard. This man poſſeſſed an unmoved equality both of temper and aſpect; and though in reality he was of no very ſuperior abilities, yet had acquired the reputation both of depth and acuteneſs, from being always accuſtomed to think on his own intereſt, and purſuing with the moſt ſedulous attention every object which led to it, unſeduced by one ſingle ſpark of thoſe feelings which the world terms Weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>In the article of gaming, which he had early pitch'd on as the means of advancement, he had availed himſelf of that induſtry, and ſaturnine complexion, to acquire the moſt conſumate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of its principles, which indeed he had attained to a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable degree of perfection.</p>
                     <p>Oppoſed to this man, even the ſkill of the hitherto-ſucceſsful ſquire was unavailing; and conſequently he not only ſtripp'd that gentleman of the gains he had made, but gleaned whatever he had left in the purſes of the inferior members of the party, amongſt whom Anneſly and his aſſociates were reduced to their laſt guinea.</p>
                     <p>This they agreed to ſpend together at a tavern in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, where they curſed fortune, their ſpoiler, and themſelves, in all the bitterneſs of rage and diſappointment. Anneſly did not ſeek to account for their loſſes otherwiſe than in the real way, to wit, from the ſuperior ſkill of their adverſary; but his companion, who often boaſted of his own, threw out ſome inſinuations of foul play and connivance.</p>
                     <p>"If I thought that," — ſaid Anneſly, laying his hand on his ſword, while his cheeks burnt with indignation.—"Poh! replied the other, 'tis in vain to be angry; here's damnation to him in a bumper."</p>
                     <p>The other did not fail his pledge; and by a liberal application to the bottle, they ſo far overcame their loſſes, that Anneſly reel'd home, ſinging a catch, forgetful of the paſt, and regardleſs of to-morrow.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH the arrival of to-morrow might be overlook'd, it could not be prevented. It roſe on Anneſly one of the moſt wretched of mankind. Poverty, embittered by diſgrace, was now approaching him, who knew of no friend to ward off the blow, and had no conſolation in himſelf by which it might be lightened: if any thing could add to his preſent diſtreſs, it was encreaſed by the abſence of Sindall, who was then in the country,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018007_0043_0FA45DC52DF32348"/>
and the upbraidings of his female companion, who now exclaimed againſt the folly which herſelf had cauſed, and the extravagance herſelf had participated.</p>
                     <p>About mid-day, his laſt night's fellow-ſufferer paid him a viſit; their mutual ſhagreen at meeting, from the recollection of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which it produced, was evident in their countenances; but it was not a little encreaſed, when the other told Anneſly he came to put him in mind of the ſum he had advanced him two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for which he had now very particular occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly anſwered, that he had frankly told him the ſtate of his finances at the time of the loan, and accepted it on no condition of ſpeedy payment; that he had, that ſame evening, offered to repay him when it was in his power, and that he could not but think the demand ungentlemanlike, at a time when he muſt know his utter inability to comply with it.</p>
                     <p>"Ungentlemanlike! ſaid the other; I don't underſtand what you mean ſir, by ſuch a phraſe; will you pay me my money or not?" —"I cannot."—"Then, ſir, you muſt expect me to employ ſome gentleman for the recovery of it, who will ſpeak to you, perhaps, in a more ungentlemanlike ſtile than I do." And, ſo ſaying, he flung out of the room.</p>
                     <p>"Infamous wretch!" exclaimed Anneſly, and walk'd about with a hurried ſtep, gnawing his lip, and mattering curſes on him, and on himſelf.—There was another gentleman wanted to ſee him below ſtairs.—'Twas a mercer who came to demand pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome fineries his lady, as he termed her, had purchaſed; he was, with difficulty, diſmiſſed. — In a quarter of an hour there was another call—'Twas a dun of a taylor for cloaths to himſelf— he would take no excuſe—"Come, ſaid Anneſly, with a look of deſperation, to-morrow morning, and I will pay you."—</p>
                     <p>But how?—he ſtared wildly on the ground, then knocked his head againſt the wall, and acted all the extravagances of a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, At laſt, with a more ſettled horror in his eye, he put on his ſword, and without knowing whether he ſhould go, ſallied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtreet,</p>
                     <p>He happened to meet in his way ſome of thoſe boon companions, with whom his nights of jollity had been ſpent; but their terms of ſalutation were ſo cold and forbidding, as obviouſly to ſhow that the account of his circumſtances had already reached them; and, with them, he who had every thing to aſk, and nothing to beſtow, could poſſeſs no quality attractive of regard.</p>
                     <p>After ſauntering from ſtreet to ſtreet, and from ſquare to ſquare, he found himſelf towards the cloſe of the day within a few paces of that very gaming houſe where he had been ſo unfortunate the evening before. A ſort of malicious curioſity, and ſome hope of he knew not what, tempted him to re-enter it. He found much the ſame company he had ſeen the preceding night, with the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, of his former aſſociate, and one or two of the younger members of their party whom the ſame cauſe prevented from attending.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018007_0044_0FA45DC5EC02D498"/>Strolling into another room, he found an inferior ſet of game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whoſe ſtakes were lower, though their vociferation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more loud. In the far corner ſat a man, who preſerved a compoſure of countenance, undiſturbed by the clamour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that ſurrounded him. After a little obſervation, Anneſly diſcovered that he was a money-lender, who advanced certain ſums at a very exorbitant premium to the perſons engaged in the play. Some of thoſe he ſaw, who could offer no other ſecurity ſatisfying to this uſurer, procure a few guineas from him, on pawning a watch, a ring, or ſome other appendage of former finery. Of ſuch he had before diveſted himſelf for urgent demands, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuperfluous about him but his ſword, which he had kept the lateſt, and which he now depoſited in the hands of the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the corner, who furniſhed him with a couple of pieces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that with them he might once more try his fortune at the table.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſs exceeded his expectation; it was ſo rapid, that in leſs than an hour he had encreaſed his two guineas to forty, with which he determined to retire contented; but when he would have redeemed his ſword, he was informed that the keeper of it had juſt gone into the other room, where, as he entered to demand it, he unfortunately overheard the ſame gentleman who had gained his money the former night, offering a bet, to the amount of the ſum Anneſly then poſſeſſed, on a caſt where he imagined the chance to be much againſt it. Stimulated with the deſire of doubling his gain, and the ſudden provocation, as it were, of the offer, he accepted it; and, in one moment, loſt all the fruits of his former good-fortune.—The tranſport of his paſſion could not expreſs itſelf in words; but taking up one of the dice, with the ſeeming coolneſs of exquiſite anguiſh, he fairly bit it in two, and caſting a look of frenzy on his ſword, which he was now unable to ranſom, he ruſh'd out of the houſe, uncover'd as he was, his hat hanging on a peg in the other apartment.</p>
                     <p>The agitation of his mind was ſuch as denied all attention to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things; and, inſtead of taking the direct road to his lodgings, he wandered off the ſtreet into an obſcure alley, where he had not advanced far, till he was accoſted by a fellow, who, in a very peremptory tone, deſired him to deliver his money, or he would inſtantly blow out his brains, preſenting a piſtol at leſs than half a yard's diſtance.—"I can give you nothing, ſaid Anneſly, becauſe I have nothing to give."—"Damn you, return'd the other, do you think I'll be fobb'd off ſo; your money, and be damn'd to you, or I'll ſend you to hell in a twinkling"—advancing his piſtol, at the ſame time, within a hand's breadth of his face. Anneſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at that inſtant, ſtruck up the muzzle with his arm, and laying hold of the barrel, by a ſudden wrench, forced the weapon out of the hands of the villain, who, not chuſing to riſk any farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, made the beſt of his way down the alley, and left Anneſly maſter of his arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:018007_0045_0FA45DC6AA6C2738"/>He ſtood for a moment entranc'd in thought.—"Whoever thou art, ſaid he, I thank thee; by heaven, thou inſtructeſt and arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt me; this may provide for to-morrow, or make its proviſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary." He now returned with a hurried pace to the mouth of the alley, where in the ſhade of a jutting wall he could mark unperceived the objects on the ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>He had ſtood there but a few ſeconds, and began already to waver in his purpoſe, when he ſaw come out of the gaming-houſe, which he had left, the very man who had plundered him of his all. The richneſs of the prize, with immediate revenge, awakened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his mind; and the ſuſpicion of foul play, which his companion had hinted the night before, gave them a ſanction of ſomething like juſtice: he waited till the chair, in which the gameſter was conveyed, came oppoſite to the place where he ſtood; then covering his face with one hand, and aſſuming a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>one different from his natural, he pulled out his piſtol, and commanded the leading chairman to ſtop.</p>
                     <p>This effected, he went up to the chair, and the gentleman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in having let down one of the glaſſes to know the reaſon of its ſtop, the ſtopper clapp'd the piſtol to his breaſt, and threatened him with inſtant death, if he did not deliver his money. The other, after ſome little heſitation, during which Anneſly repeated his threats, with the moſt horrible oaths, drew a purſe of gold from his pocket, which Anneſly ſnatcht out of his hand, and running down the alley, made his eſcape at the other end; and, after turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through ſeveral ſtreets, in different directions, ſo as to elude purſuit, arrived ſafely at home with the booty he had taken.</p>
                     <p>Meantime the gameſter returned to the houſe he had juſt quitted, with the account of his diſaſter. The whole fraternity, who could make no allowance for a robber of this ſort, were alarmed at the accident; every one was buſied in enquiry, and a thouſand queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were aſked about his appearance, his behaviour, and the rout he had taken.</p>
                     <p>The chairmen, who had been ſomewhat more poſſeſſed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at the time of the robbery, than their maſter, had remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the circumſtance of the robber's wanting his hat: this was no ſooner mentioned, than a buz ran through the company, that the young gentleman, who had gone off a little while before, had been obſerved to be uncovered when he left the houſe; and upon ſearch made, his hat was actually found with his name mark'd on the inſide.</p>
                     <p>This was a ground of ſuſpicion too ſtrong to be overlooked: meſſengers were diſpatched in queſt of the friend who had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him there the preceding night; upon his being found and acquainting them of Anneſly's lodgings, proper warrants were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for a ſearch.</p>
                     <p>When that unfortunate young man arrived at home, he was met <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the ſtairs by the lady we have formerly mentioned; who, in
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018007_0046_0FA45DC798DE8BF0"/>
terms of bitter reproach, interrupted with tears, inveighed againſt the cruelty of his neglect, in thus leaving her to pine alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even the common comforts of a miſerable life. Her cenſure indeed was the more violent, as there was little reaſon for its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; for ſhe had that moment diſmiſſed at a back-door, a gallant who was more attentive than Anneſly.</p>
                     <p>He, who could very well allow the grounds of her complaint, only pleaded neceſſity for his excuſe; he could but mutter this apology in imperfect words, for the perturbation of his mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deprived him of the powers of ſpeech. Upon her taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this, with much ſeeming concern for his health, he beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her into a chamber, and daſhing the purſe on the floor, pointed to it with a look of horror, as an anſwer to her upbraidings.</p>
                     <p>"What have you done for this?" ſaid ſhe, taking it up: He threw himſelf into a chair, without anſwering a word.</p>
                     <p>At that moment the officers of juſtice, who had loſt no time in proſecuting their information, entered the houſe; and ſome of them, accompanied by an attorney, employed by the gentleman who had been robbed, walked ſoftly up ſtairs to the room where Anneſly was, and burſting into it before he could prepare for any defence, laid hold of him in rather a violent manner; which the lawyer obſerving, deſired them to uſe the gentleman civilly, till he ſhould aſk him a few queſtions. "I will anſwer none, ſaid Anneſly; do your duty." "Then, ſir, replied the other, you muſt attend us to thoſe who can queſtion you with better authority; and I muſt make bold to ſecure this lady, till ſhe anſwer ſome queſtions alſo."</p>
                     <p>The lady ſaved him the trouble; for being now pretty well ſatisfied, that her heroe was at the end of his career, ſhe thought it moſt prudent to break off a connexion where nothing was to be gained, and make a merit of contributing her endeavours to bring the offender to juſtice. She called, therefore, this leader of the party into another room, and being informed by him that the young gentleman was ſuſpected of having committed a robbery ſcarce an hour before, ſhe pulled out the purſe which ſhe had juſt received from him, and aſked the lawyer, If it was that which had been taken from his client?</p>
                     <p>"Ay, that it is, I'll be ſworn, ſaid he; and here (pouring out its contents) is the ring he mentioned at the bottom."— "But, ſaid ſhe, pauſing a little, it will prove the thing as well without the guineas."</p>
                     <p>"I proteſt, returned the lawyer, thou art a girl of excellent invention — Hum — here are fourſcore; one half of them might have been ſpent—or dropt out by the way, or—any thing may be ſuppoſed; and ſo we ſhall have twenty a piece.— Some folks to be ſure would take more, but I love conſcience in thoſe matters."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="unknown:018007_0047_0FA45DCA8773B318"/>Having finiſhed this tranſaction, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The ſeveral circumſtances I have related being ſworn to, Anneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was committed to Newgate, and the gameſter bound over to proſecute him at the next ſeſſions, which were not then very diſtant.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVI. The miſeries of him whoſe puniſhment is inflicted by conſcience.</head>
                     <p>THOUGH Anneſly muſt have ſuffered much during the agitation of theſe proceedings, yet that was little to what he felt, when left to reflexion, in the ſolitude of his new abode. Let the virtuous remember, amidſt their afflictions, that though the heart of the good man may bleed even to death, it will never feel a torment equal to the rendings of remorſe.</p>
                     <p>For ſome time, the whirling of his brain gave him no leiſure to exerciſe any faculty that could be termed thinking; when that ſort of delirium ſubſided, it left him only to make room for more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, though leſs turbulent anguiſh.</p>
                     <p>After he had viſited every corner of reſource, and found them all dark and comfortleſs, he ſtarted at laſt from that poſture of deſpair in which he ſat, and turning the glare of his eye intently upwards:</p>
                     <p>"Take back, ſaid he, thou Power that gaveſt me being! take back that life which thou didſt breathe into me for the beſt of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, but which I have profaned by actions equally miſchievous to thy government, and ignominious to myſelf. The paſſions which thou didſt implant in me, that reaſon which ſhould balance them, is unable to withſtand: from one only I receive uſeful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; the ſhame that could not prevent, now puniſhes my crimes. Her voice for once I will obey; and leave a ſtate, in which, if I remain, I continue a blot to nature, and an enemy to man."</p>
                     <p>He drew a penknife, now his only weapon, from its ſheath— he bared his boſom for the horrid deed—when the picture of his father, which the good man had beſtowed on him at parting, and he had worn ever ſince in his boſom, ſtruck his eye—(it was drawn in the mildneſs of holy meditation, with the hands olded together,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018007_0050_0FA45DCD8F476468"/>
and the eyes lifted to heaven) "Merciful God!" ſaid Anneſly —he would have uttered a prayer; but his ſoul was wound up to a pitch that could but one way be let down — he flung himſelf on the ground, and burſt into an agony of tears.</p>
                     <p>The door of his apartment opening, diſcovered the jailor, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſir Thomas Sindall — "My friend in this place!" ſaid he, to Anneſly,—who covered his face with his hands, and replied only by a groan.</p>
                     <p>Sindall made ſigns for the keeper of the priſon to leave them;— "Come, ſaid he, my dear Anneſly, be not ſo entirely overcome; I flatter myſelf, you know my friendſhip too well, to ſuppoſe that it will deſert you even here. I may, perhaps, have opportunities of comforting you in many ways; at leaſt I ſhall feel and pity your diſtreſses."—"Leave me, anſwered the other, leave me; I deſerve no pity, and methinks there is a pride in refuſing it."— "You muſt not ſay ſo; my love has much to plead for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor are you without excuſe even to the world." "Oh Sindall, ſaid here I am without excuſe to myſelf! when I look back to that peace of mind, to that happineſs I have ſquandered! — I will not curſe, but — Oh! Fool, fool, fool!" — "I would not, ſaid ſir Thomas encreaſe that anguiſh which you feel, were I not obliged to mention the name of your father.</p>
                     <p>"My father! cried Anneſly; O hide me from my father!— "Alas! replied Sindall, he muſt hear of your diſaſter from other hands; and it were cruel not to acquaint him of it in a way that ſhould wound him the leaſt."—Anneſly gazed with a look of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trancement on his picture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Great God! ſaid he, for what haſt thou reſerved me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sindall, do what thou wilt—think not of ſuch a wretch as I am; but mitigate if thou canſt, the ſorrows of a father, the purity of whoſe boſom muſt bleed for the vices of mine." "Fear not, returned ſir Thomas; I hope all will be better than you imagine It grows late, and I muſt leave you now; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me to be more compoſed for the future. I will ſee you again early to morrow; nor will I let a moment eſcape, that can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to your ſervice."—"I muſt think, ſaid Anneſly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt feel; but I will often remember your friendſhip, and my gratitude ſhall be ſome little, merit left in me to look upon without bluſhing."</p>
                     <p>Sindall bade him farewell, and retired; and at that inſtant he was leſs a villain than he uſed to be. The ſtate of horror to which he ſaw this young man reduced, was beyond the limits of his ſcheme; and he began to look upon the victim of his deſigns, with that pity which depravity can feel, and that remorſe which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overcome.</p>

                     <p>THAT letter to old Anneſly, which Sindall had undertaken to write, he found a more difficult taſk than at firſt he imagined. The ſolicitude of his friendſhip might have been eaſily expreſſed on more common occaſions, and hypocriſy to him was uſually no unpleaſing garb; but at this criſis of Anneſly's fate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there were feelings he could not ſuppreſs; and he bluſhed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, amidſt the proteſtations of concern and regard, with which this account of his misfortune (as he termed it) was accompanied. Palliated, as it was, with all the art of ſir Thomas, it may be eaſily conceived what effect it muſt have on the mind of a father; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time labouring under the preſſure of diſeaſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a ſick bed, whoſe intervals of thought were now to be pointed to the miſery, the diſgrace, perhaps the diſgraceful death, of a darling child. His Harriet, after the firſt ſhock which the dreadful tidings had given her, ſat by him, ſtifling the terrors of her gentle ſoul, and ſpeaking comfort when her tears would let her.</p>
                     <p>His grief was aggravated, from the conſideration of being at preſent unable to attend a ſon, whoſe calamities, though of his own procuring, called ſo loudly for ſupport and aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>"Unworthy as your brother is, my Harriet, ſaid he, he is my ſon and your brother ſtill; and muſt he languiſh amid the horrors of a priſon, without a parent or a ſiſter to leſſen them? The prayers which I can put up from this ſick bed are all the aid I can miniſter to him; but your preſence might ſooth his anguiſh, and alleviate his ſufferings; with regard to this life, perhaps—Do not weep, my love—But you might lead him to a reconciliation with that Being whoſe ſentence governs eternity! Would it frighten my Harriet to viſit a dungeon?"</p>
                     <p>"Could I leave my deareſt father, ſaid ſhe, no place could frighten me where my poor Billy is.—" "Then you ſhall go, my child, and I ſhall be the better for thinking that you are with him: tell him, though he has wrong my heart, it has not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him. That he ſhould have forgotten me, is little; let him but now remember, that there is another father, whoſe pardon is more momentous."</p>
                     <p>Harriet having therefore entruſted her father to the friendſhip of Mrs. Wiſtanly, ſet out, accompanied by a niece of that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman's, who had been on a viſit to her aunt, for the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, where ſhe arrived a few days before that which was appointed for the trial of her unhappy brother.</p>
                     <p>Though it was late in the evening when they reached London, yet Harriet's impatience would not ſuffer her to ſleep till ſhe had
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018007_0052_0FA45DCEE8990D18"/>
ſeen the poor priſoner; and, notwithſtanding the remonſtrances of her companion, to whom her aunt had recommended the tendereſt concern about her young friend, ſhe called a hackney-coach im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, to convey her to the place in which Anneſly was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; and her fellow traveller, when her diſſuaſions to going had failed, very obligingly offered to accompany her.</p>
                     <p>They were conducted, by the turnkey, through a gloomy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to the wretched apartment which Anneſly occupied: they found him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ing at a little table on which he leaned, with his hands covering his face.</p>
                     <p>When they entered, he did not change his poſture; but on the turnkey's ſpeaking for his ſiſter was unable to ſpeak, he ſtarted up, and exhibited a countenance pale and haggard, his eyes blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, and his hair diſhevelled. On diſcovering his ſiſter, a bluſh croſſed his cheek, and the horror of his aſpect was loſt in ſomething milder and more piteous — "Oh! my Billy!" ſhe cried, and ſprung forward to embrace him: "This is too much, ſaid he; leave, and forget a wretch unworthy the name of thy brother." "Would my Billy kill me quite? this frightful place has almoſt killed me already! Alas! Billy, my deareſt father!" — "Oh! Harriet, that name, that name! ſpeak not of my father!" "Ah! ſaid ſhe, if you knew his goodneſs; he ſent me to comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my brother; he ſent me from himſelf, ſtretched on a ſick bed, where his Harriet ſhould have tended him."—</p>
                     <p>"Oh! curſed, curſed!" — "Nay, do not curſe, my Billy, he ſends you none; his prayers, his bleſſings riſe for you to heaven; his forgiveneſs he bade me convey you, and tell you to ſeek that of the father of all goodneſs!"—</p>
                     <p>His ſiſter's hands were claſped in his; he lifted both together: "If thou canſt hear me, ſaid he,—I dare not pray for myſelf; but ſpare a father whom my crimes have made miſerable; let me abide the wrath I have deſerved, but weigh not down his age for my offences; puniſh it not with the remembrance of me!" He fell on his ſiſter's neck, and they mingled their tears; nor could the young lady who attended Harriet, or the jailor himſelf, forbear accompanying them; this laſt, however, recovered himſelf rather ſooner than the other, and reminded them that it was late, and that he muſt lock up for the night.—"Good night then, my Harriet," ſaid Anneſly. "And muſt we ſeparate? anſwered his ſiſter; could I not ſit and ſupport that diſtracted head, and cloſe thoſe haggard eyes?"</p>
                     <p>"Let me entreat you, returned her brother, to leave me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe yourſelf after the fatigues of your journey, and the perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your mind. I feel myſelf comforted and refreſhed by the ſight of my Harriet: I will try to ſleep myſelf, which I have not done theſe four gloomy nights, unleſs, perhaps for a few moments when the torture of my dreams made waking a deliverance. Good night, my deareſt Harriet." She could not ſay, good night; but ſhe wept it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. His ſiſter pays him another viſit. A deſcription of what paſſed in the priſon.</head>
                     <p>IT was late before Harriet could think even of going to bed, and later before her mind could be quieted enough to allow her any ſleep. But nature was at laſt worn out; and the fatigue of her journey, together with the conflict of her ſoul in the viſit ſhe had juſt made, had ſo exhauſted her, that it was towards noon next day before ſhe awaked. After having chid herſelf for her neglect, ſhe hurried away to her much-loved brother, whom ſhe found attended by that baronet, to whoſe good offices I have had ſo frequent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhow him indebted in the courſe of my ſtory.</p>
                     <p>At ſight of him, her cheek was fluſhed with the mingled glow of ſhame for her brother, and gratitude towards his benefactor. He advanced to ſalute her; when, with the tears ſtarting into her eyes, ſhe fell on her knees before him, and poured forth a prayer of bleſſings on his head. There could not perhaps be a figure more lovely, or more ſtriking, than that which ſhe then exhibited. The luſtre of her eyes, heightened by thoſe tears with which the overflowing of her heart ſupplied them; the glow of her complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, animated with the ſuffuſion of tenderneſs and gratitude: theſe, joined to the eaſy negligence of her dark brown locks, that waved in ringlets on her panting boſom, made altogether ſuch an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage as beauty is a word too weak for.</p>
                     <p>So forcibly indeed was Sindall ſtruck with it, that ſome little time paſt before he thought of lifting her from the ground; he looked his very ſoul at every glance; but it was a ſoul unworthy of the object on which he gazed, brutal, unfeeling and inhuman; he conſidered her, at that moment, as already within the reach of his machinations, and feaſted the groſſneſs of his fancy with the anticipation of her undoing.</p>
                     <p>And here let me pauſe a little, to conſider that account of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which the votaries of voluptuouſneſs have frequently ſtated. I allow for all the delight which Sindall could experience for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or hope to experience in the future. I conſider it abſtracted from its conſequences, and I will venture to affirm, that there is a truer, a more exquiſite voluptuary than he.—</p>
                     <p>Had virtue been now looking on the figure of beauty, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, I have attempted to draw. —I ſee the purpoſe of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence beaming in his eye! — Its throb is ſwelling in his heart! — He claſps her to his boſom; — he kiſſes the falling drops from her cheek;—he weeps with her; —and the luxury of his tears;—baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles deſcription.</p>
                     <p>But whatever were ſir Thomas's ſenſations at the ſight of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, they were interrupted by the jailor, who now entered the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018007_0054_0FA45DD31DF3CD08"/>
room, and informed him that a gentleman without was earneſt to ſpeak with him. "Who can it be?" ſaid ſir Thomas, ſomewhat peeviſhly. —'If I am not miſtaken, replied the jailor, it is a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the name of Camplin, a lawyer, whom I have ſeen here with ſome of the priſoners before.'—</p>
                     <p>"This is he of whom I talked to you, my dear Anneſly, ſaid the baronet; let me introduce him to you." — 'I have taken my reſolution, returned Anneſly, and ſhall have no need of lawyers for my defence'—"It muſt not be," rejoined the other; and going out of the room, he preſently returned with Mr. Camplin. All this while Harriet's looks betrayed the ſtrongeſt ſymptoms of terror and perplexity; and when the ſtranger appeared, ſhe drew nearer and nearer to her brother, with an involuntary ſort of motion, till ſhe had twined his arm into hers, and placed herſelf between him and Camplin. This laſt obſerved her fears; for indeed ſhe bent her eyes moſt fixedly upon him, and making her a bow. "Be not afraid, miſs, ſaid he, here are none but friends; I learn, ſir, that your day is now very near, and that it is time to be thinking of the buſineſs of it." "Good heavens! cried Harriet, what day?" "Make yourſelf eaſy, madam, continued Camplin, being the firſt trip, I hope he may fall ſoft for this time; I believe no body doubts my abilities: I have ſaved many a brave man from the gallows, whoſe caſe was more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate than I take this young gentleman's to be."—</p>
                     <p>The colour, which had been varying on her cheek during this ſpeech, now left it for a dead pale; and turning her languid eyes upon her brother, ſhe fell motionleſs into his arms. He ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to a chair that ſtood near him, and darting an indignant look at the lawyer, begged of the jailor to procure her ſome imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Sindall, who was kneeling on the other ſide of her, ordered Camplin, who was advancing to make offer of his ſervices too, to be gone, and ſend them the firſt ſurgeon he could find. A ſurgeon indeed had been already procured, who officiated in the priſon, for the beſt of all reaſons, becauſe he was not at liberty to leave it. The jailor now made his appearance, with a bottle of wine in one hand, and ſome water in the other; followed by a tall, meagre, ragged figure, who ſtriding up to Harriet, applied a ſmall vial of volatile ſalt to her noſe, and chaſing her temples, ſoon brought her to ſenſe and life again.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly preſſing her to his boſom, begged her to recollect her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and forget her fears. "Pardon this weakneſs, my dear Billy, ſaid ſhe, I will try to overcome it; is that horrid man gone? who is this gentleman?" "I have the honour to be a doctor of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, madam, ſaid he, clapping at the ſame time his greaſy fingers to her pulſe. Here is a fulneſs that calls for venefection."</p>
                     <p>So without loſs of time he pulled out a caſe of lancets covered with ruſt, and ſpotted with the blood of former patients. Oh! for heaven's ſake, no bleeding, cried Harriet, indeed there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it." "How, no occaſion! exclaimed the other; I have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018007_0055_0FA45DD485E892C0"/>
heard indeed ſome ignorants condemn phlebotomy in ſuch caſes; but it is my practice, and I am very well able to defend it.—It will be allowed that in plethoric habits"—'Spare your demonſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, interrupted Anneſly, and think of your patient.' "You ſhall not blood me, ſaid ſhe; you ſhall not indeed, ſir!" "Nay, madam, ſaid he, as you pleaſe; you are to know that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf is no part of my profeſſion; it is only "propter neceſſitatem," for want of chirurgical practitioners, that I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times condeſcend to it in this place." Sir Thomas gave him a hint to leave them, and at the ſame time ſlipped a guinea into his hand. He immediately retired, looking at the unuſual appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the gold with ſo much tranſport, that he might poſſibly have as much occaſion for bleeding at that moment, as the patient for whom he had juſt preſcribed it.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly, aſſiſted by his friend, uſed every poſſible argument to comfort and ſupport his ſiſter. His concern for her had indeed baniſhed for a while the conſideration of his own ſtate; and when he came to think of that ſolemn day, on which the trial for his life was appointed, his concern was more intereſted for its effect on his Harriet, than for that it ſhould have on himſelf.</p>
                     <p>After they had paſſed great part of the day together, ſir Thomas obſerved, that Miſs Anneſly's preſent lodgings (in the houſe of her fellow-traveller's father) were ſo diſtant, as to occaſion much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to her in her viſits to her brother; and very kindly made offer of endeavouring to procure her others but a few ſtreets off, under the roof of a gentlewoman, he ſaid, an officer's widow of his acquaintance, who, if ſhe had any apartment unoccupied at the time, he knew would be as attentive to Miſs Anneſly as if ſhe were a daughter of her own.</p>
                     <p>This propoſal was readily accepted, and ſir Thomas having gone upon the enquiry, returned in the evening with an account of his having ſucceeded in procuring the lodgings; that he had taken the liberty to call and fetch Miſs Anneſly's baggage from thoſe ſhe had formerly occupied, and that every thing was ready at Mrs. Eldridge's (that was the widow's name) for her reception. After ſupper he conducted her thither accordingly. As he was going out, Anneſly whiſpered him to return for a few minutes after he had ſet down his ſiſter, as he had ſomething particular to communicate to him. When he came back, "You have heard, I fancy, ſir Thomas, ſaid he, that the next day but one is the day of my trial. As to myſelf, I wait it with reſignation, and ſhall not give any trouble to my country by a falſe defence; but I tremble for my ſiſter's knowing it. Could we not contrive ſome method of keeping her in ignorance of its appointment till it be over, and then prepare her for the event without ſubjecting her to the tortures of anxiety and ſuſpence?" Sindall agreed in the propriety of the latter part of his ſcheme, and they reſolved to keep his ſiſter that day at home, on pretence of a meeting in the priſon between the lawyers
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018007_0056_0FA45DD4E85499A8"/>
of Anneſly, and thoſe of his proſecutor. But he warmly inſiſted, that Anneſly ſhould accept the ſervices of Camplin towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the cauſe on his part. "Endeavour not to perſuade me, my friend, ſaid Anneſly; for I now reſt ſatisfied with my determination. I thank heaven which has enabled me to rely on its goodneſs, and meet my fate with the full poſſeſſion of myſelf. I will not diſdain the mercy which my country may think I merit; but I will not entangle myſelf in chicane and inſincerity to avoid her juſtice."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX. The fate of Anneſly determined.—Sindall's friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the gratitude of Harriet.</head>
                     <p>NOthing remarkable happened till that day when the fate of Anneſly was to be determined by the laws of his country. The project formed by Sindall and himſelf, for keeping his ſiſter ignorant of its importance, ſucceeded to their wiſh; ſhe ſpent it at home, comforting herſelf with the hope, that the meeting ſhe underſtood to be held on it, might turn out advantageouſly for her brother, and ſooth'd by the kindneſs of her landlady, who had indeed fully anſwered ſir Thomas's expectations in the attention ſhe had ſhown her.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile her unfortunate brother was brought to the bar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for the robbery committed on the gameſter. When he was aſked, in the cuſtomary manner to plead, he ſtood up, and addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to the judge.</p>
                     <p>"I am now, my lord, ſaid he, in a ſituation of all others the moſt ſolemn. I ſtand in the preſence of God and my country, and I am called to confeſs or deny that crime for which I have incurred the judgment of both. If I have offended, my lord, I am not yet an obdurate offender; I fly not to the ſubterfuge of villany, though I have fallen from the dignity of innocence; and I will not ſcreen a life which my crimes have diſgraced, by a coward lie to prevent their detection. I plead guilty, my lord, and await the judgment of that law, which though I have violated, I have not forgotten to rever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>."</p>
                     <p>When he ended, a confuſed murmur ran through the court, and for ſome time ſtopt the judge in his reply. Silence obtained, that upright magiſtrate, worthy the tribunal of England, ſpoke to this effect:</p>
                     <p>"I am ſincerely ſorry, young gentleman, to ſee one of your figure at this bar, charged with a crime for which the public ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has been obliged to award an exemplary puniſhment. Much as I admire the heroiſm of your confeſſion, I will not ſuffer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to betaken of it to your prejudice; reflect on the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018007_0057_0FA45DD5A779AAC8"/>
of a plea of guilt, which takes from you all opportunity of a legal defence, and ſpeak again, as your own diſcretion, or your friends, may beſt adviſe you." "I humbly thank your lordſhip, ſaid Anneſly, for the candour and indulgence which you ſhow me; but I have ſpoken the truth, and will not allow myſelf to think of retracting it." "I am here, returned his lordſhip, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of juſtice, and I have nothing but juſtice to give; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of mercy is in other hands; it upon enquiry, the caſe is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as I wiſh it to be, my recommendation ſhall not be wanting to enforce an application there." Anneſly was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of the robbery, and the ſentence of the law paſſed upon him.</p>
                     <p>But the judge, before whom he was tried, was not unmindful of his promiſe; and having ſatisfied himſelf, that, though guilty in this inſtance, he was not habitually flagitious, he aſſiſted ſo warmly the applications which through the intereſt of Sindall (for Sindall was in this ſincere) were made in his behalf, that a pardon was obtained for him, on the condition of his ſuffering tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the term of fourteen years.</p>
                     <p>This alleviation of his puniſhment was procured, before his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſuffered to know that his trial had ever come on, or what had been its event. When his fate was by this means determined, Sindall undertook to inſtruct the lady in whoſe houſe he had placed her, that Miſs Anneſly ſhould be acquainted with the circumſtances of it in ſuch a manner, as might leaſt diſcompoſe that delicacy and tenderneſs of which her mind was ſo ſuſceptible.</p>
                     <p>The event anſwered his expectation; that good woman ſeemed poſſeſſed of as much addreſs as humanity; and Harriet, by the intervention of both, was led to the knowlege of her brother's ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with ſo much prudence, that ſhe bore it at firſt with reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and afterwards looked upon it with thankfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>After that acknowlegement to providence which ſhe had been early inſtructed never to forget, there was an inferior agent in this affair to whom her warmeſt gratitude was devoted. Beſides that herſelf had the higheſt opinion of Sindall's good offices, her obliging landlady had taken every opportunity, ſince their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance began, to trumpet forth his praiſes in the moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſtrain; and, on the preſent occaſion, her encomiums we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> loud in proportion as Harriet's happineſs was concerned in the event.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas therefore began to be conſidered by the young lady as the worthieſt of friends; his own language bore the ſtrongeſt expreſſions of friendſhip; of friendſhip and no more; but the widow would often inſinuate that he felt more than he expreſſed; and when Harriet's ſpirits could bear a little railery, her landlady did not want for jokes on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſuggeſtions of another have a greater effect than is often imagined; they are heard with an eaſe which does not alarm, and the mind habituates itſelf to take up ſuch a credit on their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018007_0058_0FA45DD667CA91B8"/>
truth as it would be ſorry to loſe, though it is not at the trouble of examining. Harriet did not ſeriouſly think of Sindall as of one that was her lover; but ſhe began to make ſuch arrangements as not to be ſurprized if he ſhould.</p>
                     <p>One morning when ſir Thomas had called, to conduct her on a viſit to her brother, Mrs. Eldridge rallied him at breakfaſt on his being ſtill a batchelor. "What is your opinion, Miſs Anneſly, ſaid ſhe; is it not a ſhame for one of ſir Thomas's fortune not to make ſome worthy woman happy in the participation of it?" Sindall ſubmitted to be judged by ſo fair an arbitreſs; he ſaid "the manners of the court-ladies, whoſe example had ſtretched unhappily too far, were ſuch, as made it a ſort of venture to be married;" he then pauſed for a moment, ſigh'd, and, fixing his eyes upon Harriet, drew ſuch a picture of the woman whom he would chuſe for a wiſe, that ſhe muſt have had ſome ſillier quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than mere modeſty about her, not to have made ſome gueſs at his meaning.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, though ſhe was as little wanting in delicacy as moſt women, ſhe began to feel a certain intereſt in the good opinion of Sindall, and to draw ſome concluſions from his deportment, which, for the ſake of my fair readers, I would have them remember, are better to be ſlowly underſtood than haſtily indulged.</p>

                     <p>The ſame letter informed his children, that though he was not well enough recovered to be able to travel, yet he was gaining ground on his diſtemper, and hoped, as the ſeaſon advanced, to get the better of it altogether.

                        </gap>t the fears of parting, and indulged themſelves in temporary happineſs.</p>
                     <p>It was during one of theſe, that Sindall obſerved to Harriet, how little ſhe poſſeſſed the curioſity her ſex was charged with, who had never once thought of ſeeing any thing in London that ſtrangers were moſt ſolicitous to ſee; and propoſed that very night to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to the playhouſe, where the royal family were to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at the repreſentation of a new comedy.</p>
                     <p>Harriet turned a melancholy look towards her brother, and made anſwer, that ſhe could not think of any amuſement that ſhould ſubject him to hours of ſolitude in a priſon.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, Anneſly was earneſt in preſſing her to accept ſir Thomas's invitation; he ſaid ſhe knew how often he choſe to be alone, at times when he could moſt command ſociety; and that he ſhould find an additional pleaſure in theirs, when they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, fraught with the intelligence of the play.</p>
                     <p>"But there is ſomething unbecoming in it, ſaid Harriet, in the eyes of others."</p>
                     <p>"That objection, replied Sindall, will be eaſily removed; we ſhall go accompanied by Mrs. Eldridge to the gallery, where even thoſe who have many acquaintances in town, are dreſſed ſo much in the incognito-way, as never to be diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Anneſly repeated his entreaties, Mrs. Eldridge ſeconded, Sindall enforced them; and all three urged ſo many arguments, that Harriet was at laſt overcome, and to the play they accordingly went.</p>
                     <p>Though this was the firſt entertainment of the ſort, at which Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet had ever been preſent, yet the thoughts of her abſent brother, in whoſe company all her former amuſements had been enjoyed, ſo much damped the pleaſure ſhe ſhould have felt from this, that as ſoon as the play was over, ſhe begged of her conductor to return, much againſt the deſire of Mrs. Eldridge, who entreated them to indulge her by ſtaying the farce. But Harriet ſeemed ſo uneaſy at the thoughts of a longer abſence from her brother, that the other's ſolicitations were at laſt overruled; and making ſhift to get through the croud, they left the houſe, and ſet out in a Hackney-coach on their return.</p>
                     <p>They had got the length of two or three ſtreets on their way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the coachman, who indeed had the appearance of being exceedingly drunk, drove them againſt a poſt, by which accident one of the wheels was broken to pieces, and the carriage itſelf immediately overturned, Sindall had, luckily, put down the glaſs on that ſide but a moment before, to look at ſomething, ſo that they eſcaped any miſchief which might have enſued from the breaking of it; and, except the ladies being extremely frightened, no bad conſequences followed. This diſaſter happened juſt at the door of a tavern; the miſtreſs of which ſeeing the diſcompoſure of the ladies, very politely begged them to ſtep into her own room till
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018007_0060_0FA45DDAC52ED3F8"/>
they could re-adjuſt themſelves, and procure another coach from a neighbouring ſtand, for which ſhe promiſed immediately to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch one of her ſervants.</p>
                     <p>All this while ſir Thomas was venting his wrath againſt the coachman, continuing to cane him moſt unmercifully, till ſtopt by the interceſſion of Harriet and Mrs. Eldridge, and prevailed upon to accompany them into the houſe at the obliging requeſt of its miſtreſs. He aſked pardon for giving way to his paſſion, which apprehenſion for their ſafety, he ſaid, had occaſioned, and taking Harriet's hand with a look of the utmoſt tenderneſs, enquired if ſhe felt no hurt from the fall; upon her anſwering, that except the fright, ſhe was perfectly well; "then all is well," ſaid he, preſſing her hand to his boſom, which roſe to meet it with a ſigh.</p>
                     <p>He then called for a bottle of Madeira, of which his companions drank each a glaſs; but upon his preſenting another, Mrs. Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge declared ſhe never taſted anything between meals, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet ſaid that her head was already affected by the glaſs ſhe had taken: this however he attributed to the effects of the overturn, for which another bumper was an infallible remedy; and, on Mrs. Eldridge's ſetting the example, though with the utmoſt reluctance, Harriet was prevailed upon to follow it.</p>
                     <p>She was ſeated on a ſettee at the upper end of the room, Sindall ſat on a chair by her, and Mrs. Eldridge, from choice, was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the room; it ſomehow happened that, in a few minutes, the laſt mentioned lady left her companions by themſelves</p>
                     <p>Sindall, whoſe eyes had not been idle before, caſt them now to the ground with a look of the moſt feeling diſcompoſure; and gently lifting them again, "I know not, ſaid he, moſt lovely of women, whether I ſhould venture to expreſs the ſenſations of my heart at this moment; that reſpect which ever attends a love ſo ſincere as mine, has hitherto kept me ſilent; but the late accident, in which all that I hold dear was endangered, has opened every ſluice of tenderneſs in my ſoul, and I were more or leſs than man, did I reſiſt the impulſe of declaring it."</p>
                     <p>"This is no place, ſir,"—ſaid Harriet, trembling and covered with bluſhes.—"Every place, cried Sindall, is ſacred to love, where my Harriet is." At the ſame time he threw himſelf on his knees before her, and imprinted a thouſand burning kiſſes on her hand.</p>
                     <p>"Let go my hand, ſir Thomas," ſhe cried, her voice faltering and her cheek overſpread with a ſtill higher glow: "Never, thou cruel one, ſaid he, (raiſing himſelf gently till he had gained a place on the ſettee by her ſide) never, till you liſten to the dictates of a paſſion too violent to be longer reſiſted."—</p>
                     <p>At that inſtant ſome buſtle was heard at the door, and preſently after a voice in a country-accent, vociferating "It is my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's own daughter, and I muſt ſee her immediately." — The door burſt open, and diſcovered Jack Ryland, Mrs. Eldridge fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, with a countenance not the moſt expreſſive of good humour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="unknown:018007_0061_0FA45DDC71FC0D10"/>"Ryland! exclaimed the baronet, what is the meaning of this?" advancing towards him with an air of fierceneſs and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which the other returned with a hearty ſhake by the hand, ſaying he was rejoiced to find Miſs Harriet in ſo good company. —"Dear Mr. Ryland, ſaid ſhe, a little confuſedly, I am happy to ſee you; but it is odd—I cannot conceive—tell us, as ſir Thomas was juſt now aſking, how you came to find us out here."</p>
                     <p>"Why, you muſt underſtand, Miſs, returned Jack, that I have got a little bit of a legacy left me by a relation here in London; as I was coming up on that buſineſs, I thought I could do no leſs than aſk your worthy father's commands for you and Mr. William. So we ſettled matters, that, as our times, I believe, will agree well enough, I ſhould have the pleaſure, if you are not otherwiſe engaged, of conducting you home again. I came to town only this day, and after having eat a mutton-chop at the inn where I lighted, and got myſelf into a little decent trim, I ſet out from a place they call Piccadilly, I think, aſking every body I met which was the ſhorteſt way to Newgate, where I underſtood your brother was to be found.</p>
                     <p>But I was like to make a marvellous long journey on't; for beſides that it is a huge long way, as I was told, I hardly met with one perſon that would give a mannerly anſwer to my queſtions; to be ſure they are the moſt humourſome people, here in London, that ever I ſaw in my life, when I aſked the road to Newgate, one told me, I was not likely to be long in finding it; another bade me ſteal a Silver Tankard and it would ſhow me; and a deal of ſuch out-of-the-way jokes.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, while I was looking round for ſome civil-like body to enquire of, who ſhould I ſee whip paſt me in a coach but yourſelf with that lady, as I take it; upon which I hollowed out to the coachman to ſtop, but he did not hear me, as I ſuppoſe, and drove on as hard as ever; I followed him cloſe at the heels for ſome time, till the ſtreet he turned into being much darker than where I ſaw you firſt, by reaſon there were none of your torches blazing there, I fell headlong into a rut in the middle of it, and loſt ſight of the carriage before I could recover myſelf: however, I ran down a right hand road, which I gueſſed you had taken, aſking any body I thought would give me an anſwer, if they had ſeen a coach with a handſome young woman in't, drawn by a pair of dark bays; but I was only laught at for my pains, till I fell in by chance with a ſimple country-man like myſelf, who informed me, that he had ſeen ſuch a one overturned juſt before this-here large houſe; and the door being open, I ſtept in without more ado, till I happened to hear this lady whiſpering ſomething to another about ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Sindall, when I gueſſed that you might be with him, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances will find one another out, you know; and ſo here I am, at your ſervice and ſir Thomas's."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018007_0062_0FA45DDE12C09920"/>This hiſtory afforded as little entertainment to its hearers as it may have done to the greateſt part of my readers; but it gave ſir Thomas and Harriet time enough to recover from that confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into which the appearance of Ryland had thrown both of them; though with this difference, that Harriet's was free from the guilt of Sindall's and did not even proceed from the leaſt ſuſpicion of any thing criminal in the intentions of that gentleman.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas pretended great ſatisfaction in having met with his acquaintance Mr. Ryland, and, having obtained another hackney-coach, they drove together to Newgate, where Jack received a much ſincerer welcome from Anneſly, and they paſſed the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the greateſt ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Not but that there moved ſomething unuſual in the boſom of Harriet, from the declaration of her lover, and in his, from the attempt which Providence had interpoſed to diſappoint; he conſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, however, with the reflexion, that he had not gone ſuch a length as to alarm her ſimplicity, and took from the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſt, by the hope of more ſucceſsful villainy.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>IT</hi> was not long before the time arrived in which Anneſly was to bid adieu to his native country for the term which the mercy of his ſovereign had allotted for his puniſhment. He behaved, at this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a determined ſort of coolneſs, not eaſily expected from one of his warmth of feelings, at a time of life when theſe are in their fulleſt vigour. His ſiſter, whole gentle heart began to droop under the thoughts of their ſeperation, he employed every argument to comfort. <hi>He</hi> bade her remember that it had been determined he ſhould be abſent for ſome years, before this neceſſity of his abſence had ariſen. "Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me on my travels, ſaid he, my Harriet but for a longer term, and the ſum of his calamity is exhauſted; if there are hardſhips await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, think how I ſhould otherwiſe expiate my follies and my crimes: the puniſhments of heaven, our father has often told us, are mercies to its children; mine, I hope, will have a double effect; to wipe away my former offences, and prevent my offending for the future."</p>
                     <p>He was actuated by the ſame ſteadineſs of ſpirit, in the diſpoſal of what money his father's credit enabled him to command. He called in an exact account of his debts, thoſe to Sindall not excepted, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them in full, much againſt the inclination of ſir Thomas, who inſiſted, as much as in decency he could, on cancelling every obligation of that ſort to himſelf. But Anneſly was poſitive in his reſolution; and after having cleared theſe incumbrances, he embarked with only a few ſhillings in his pocket, ſaying, that he would never pinch his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's age, to mitigate the puniſhment which his ſon had more than deſerved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:018007_0063_0FA45DDEAD0D2C30"/>There was another account to ſettle, which he found a more difficult taſk. The parting with his ſiſter, he knew not how to accompliſh, without ſuch a pang as her tender frame could very ill ſupport. At length he reſolved to take at leaſt from its ſolemnity, if he could not alleviate its anguiſh. Having ſat, therefore, with Harriet till paſt midnight, on the eve of his departure, which he employed in renewing his arguments of conſolation, and earneſtly recommending to her to keep up thoſe ſpirits which ſhould ſupport her father and herſelf, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a deſire to ſleep, appointed an hour for breakfaſting with her in the morning; and ſo ſoon as he could prevail on her to leave him, he went on board the boat, which waited to carry him, and ſome unfortunate companions of his voyage to the ſhip deſtined to tranſport them.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas accompanied him a little way down the river, till, at the earneſt deſire of his friend, he was carried aſhore in a ſculler, which they happened to meet on their way When they parted, Anneſly wrung his hand, and dropping a tear on it, which hitherto he had never allowed himſelf to ſhed, "To my faithful Sindall, ſaid he, I leave a truſt more precious to this boſom than every other earthly good.</p>
                     <p>Be the friend of my father, as you have been that of his undeſerving ſon, and protect my Harriet's youth, who has loſt that protection a brother ſhould have afforded her. If the prayers of a wretched exile in a foreign land can be heard of heaven, the name of his friend ſhall riſe with thoſe of a parent and a ſiſter in his hourly benedictions; and if at any time you ſhall beſtow a thought upon him, remember the only comfort of which adverſity has not deprived him, the confidence of his Sindall's kindneſs to thoſe whom he has left weeping behind him."</p>
                     <p>Such was the charge which Anneſly gave and Sindall received; he received it with a tear; a tear, which the better part of his nature had yet reſerved from the ruins of principle, of juſtice, of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It fell involuntarily at the time, and he thought of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a bluſh—Such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Anneſly kept his eyes fixed on the lights of London, till the encreaſing diſtance deprived them of their object. Nor did his imagination fail him in the picture, after that help was taken from her. The form of the weeping Harriet, lovely in her grief, ſtill ſwam before his ſight; on the back ground ſtood a venerable figure, turning his eyes to heaven, while a tear that ſwelled in each dropped for the ſacrifice of his ſorrow, and a bending angel accepted it as incenſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus, by a ſeries of diſſipation, ſo eaſy in its progreſs, that, it if my tale were fiction, it would be thought too ſimple, was this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate young man loſs to himſelf, his friends, and his country.

                     <head>CHAP. XXII. Harriet is informed of her Brother's departure. She leaves London on her return home.</head>
                     <p>SINDALL took upon himſelf the charge of communicating the intelligence of Anneſly's departure to his ſiſter. She received it with an entrancement of ſorrow, which deprived her of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and when at laſt her tears found their way to utter it, "Is he gone! ſaid ſhe, and ſhall I never ſee him more? cruel Billy! Oh! ſir Thomas, I had a thouſand things to ſay! and has he left me without a ſingle adieu?"—'It was in kindneſs to you, Miſs Anneſly, anſwered the baronet, that he did ſo.'—"I believe you, ſaid ſhe, I know it was; and yet, methinks, he ſhould have bid me farewell—I could have ſtood it, indeed I could—I am not ſo weak as you think me; yet Heaven knows I have need of ſtrength"—and ſhe burſt into tears again.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas did not want for expreſſions of comfort or of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor did he fail, amidſt the aſſurances of his friendſhip, to ſuggeſt thoſe tenderer ſenſations which his boſom felt on account of Miſs Anneſly. She gave him a warmth of gratitude in return, which, though vice may ſometimes take advantage of it, virtue can never blame.</p>
                     <p>His proteſtations were interrupted by the arrival of Ryland, who had accidentally heard of Anneſly's embarkment. Jack had but few words to communicate his feelings by; but his eyes helped them out with an honeſt tear. "Your brother, I hear, is gone, Miſs Harriet, ſaid he; well, Heaven bleſs him wherever he goes!"</p>
                     <p>Harriet begg'd to know when it would ſuit his convenience to leave London, ſaying, that every day ſhe ſtayed there now, would reproach her abſence from her father. Jack made anſwer, that he could be ready to attend her at an hour's warning; for that his buſineſs in London was finiſhed, and as for pleaſure he could find none in it. It was agreed therefore, contrary to the zealous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſir Thomas and Mrs. Eldridge, that Harriet ſhould ſet off, accompanied by Mr. Ryland, the very next morning.</p>
                     <p>Their reſolution was accompliſhed, and they ſet out by the break of day. Sindall accompanied them on horſeback ſeveral ſtages, and they dined together about forty miles from London. Here having ſettled their rout according to a plan of ſir Thomas's who ſeemed to be perfectly verſant in the geography of the country, through which they were to paſs, he was prevailed on, by the earneſt entreaty of Harriet, to return to London, and leave her to perform the reſt of the journey under the protection of Mr. Ryland. On their leaving the inn at which they dined, there occurred an incident, of which, though the reader may have obſerved me not

apt to dwell on trifling circumſtances, I cannot help taking notice. While they were at dinner, they were frequently diſturbed by the boiſterous mirth of a company in the room immediately adjoining. This, one of the waiters informed them, proceeded from a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, he believed, was travelling from London down into the country, and, having no companion, had aſſociated with the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord over a bottle of claret, which according to the waiter's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, his honour had made ſo free with as to be in a merrier, or as that word may generally be tranſlated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>As Sindall was handing Harriet into the poſt-chaiſe, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a gentleman, whom they concluded to be the ſame whoſe voice they had ſo often heard at dinner, ſtanding in the paſſage that led to the door. When the lady paſſed him, he trod, either accidentally or on purpoſe, on the ſkirt of her gown behind; and as ſhe turned about to get rid of the ſtop, having now got ſight of her face, be exclaimed, with an oath, that ſhe was an angel; and, ſeizing the hand with which ſhe was diſengaging her gown, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to his lips in ſo rude a manner, that even his drunkenneſs could not excuſe it; at leaſt it could not to Sindall; who ſtepping between him and Miſs Anneſly, laid hold of his collar, and ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him violently, demanded how he dared to affront the lady; and inſiſted on his immediately aſking her pardon. "Dammee," ſaid he, hiccupping, "not on compulſion, dammee, for you nor any man, dammee."</p>
                     <p>The landlord and Mr: Ryland now interpoſed, and with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Harriet, pacified ſir Thomas, from the conſideration of the gentleman's being in a temporary ſtate of inſanity; Sindall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly let go his hold, and went on with Harriet to the chaiſe, while the other, re-adjuſting his neck cloth, ſwore that he would have another peep at the girl notwithſtanding.</p>
                     <p>When Harriet was ſeated in the chaiſe, Sindall took notice of the flutter into which this accident had thrown her; ſhe confeſſed that ſhe had been a good deal alarmed, leſt there ſhould have been a quarrel on her account, and begged ſir Thomas, if he had any regard for her eaſe of mind, to think no more of any vengeance againſt the other gentleman.</p>
                     <p>"Fear not, my adorable Harriet, whiſpered ſir Thomas; if I thought there were one kind remembrance of Sindall in that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly boſom"—the chaiſe drove on—ſhe bluſhed a reply to this unfiniſhed ſpeech, and bowed, ſmiling, to its author.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIII. Harriet proceeds on her journey with Ryland.— A very daring attack is made upon them. The conſequences.</head>
                     <p>NOTHING farther happened worthy of recording, till towards the cloſe of that journey which ſir Thomas's direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had marked out for their firſt day's progreſs. Ryland had before obſerved, that ſir Thomas's ſhort roads had turned out very ſorry ones; and when it began to be dark, Harriet's fears made her take notice, that they had got upon a large common, where, for a great way round, there was not a houſe to be ſeen. Nor was ſhe at all relieved by the information of the poſt-boy, who, upon being interrogated by Ryland as to the ſafety of the road, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "To be ſure, maſter, I've known ſome highwaymen frequent this common, and there ſtands a gibbet hard by, where two of them have hung theſe three years."</p>
                     <p>He had ſcarcely uttered this ſpeech, when the noiſe of horſemen was heard behind them, at which Miſs Anneſly's heart began to palpitate, nor was her companion's free from unuſual agitation. He aſked the poſt-boy, in a low voice, if he knew the riders who were coming up behind; the boy anſwered in the negative, but that he needed not be afraid, as he obſerved a carriage along with them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of the horſemen now paſſed the chaiſe in which Ryland and Harriet were, and at the diſtance of a few yards they croſſed the road, and made a halt on the other ſide of it. Harriet's fears were now too much alarmed to be quieted by the late aſſurance of the poſt-boy: ſhe was not, indeed, long ſuffered to remain in a ſtate of ſuſpence; one of thoſe objects of her terror called to the driver to ſtop, which the lad had no ſooner complied with, than he rode up to the ſide of the carriage where the lady was ſeated, and told her, in a tone rather peremptory than threatning, that ſhe muſt allow that gentleman (meaning Ryland) to accept of a ſeat in another carriage, which was juſt behind, and do him and his friends the honour of taking one of them for her companion. He received no anſwer to this demand, ſhe to whom it was made hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fainted into the arms of her terrified fellow-traveller.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate of inſenſibility, Ryland was forced, by the inhuman ruffian and his aſſociates, to leave her, and enter a chaiſe which now drew up to receive him; and one of the gang, whoſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance beſpoke ſomething of a higher rank than the reſt, ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by her, and was very aſſiduous in uſing proper means for her reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When that was effected, he begged her, in terms of great politeneſs, not to make herſelf in the leaſt uneaſy, for that no

                        </gap>y me? Where is Mr. Ryland?" 'If you mean the gentleman in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you were, madam, you may be aſſured, that nothing ill ſhall happen to him any more than to yourſelf.'—"Nothing ill, ſaid ſhe, merciful God! What do you intend to do with me?" 'I would not do you a miſchief for the world, anſwered he: and if you will be patient for a little time, you ſhall be ſatisfied that you are in danger of none.' All this while they forced the poſt-boy, to drive on full ſpeed; and there was light enough for Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet to diſcover, that the road they took had ſo little the appearance of a frequented one, that there was but a very ſmall chance of her meeting with any relief.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time after, however, when the moon ſhining out made it lighter, ſhe found they were obliged to ſlacken their pace, from being met, in a narrow part of the road, by ſome perſons on horſeback. The thoughts of relief recruited a little her exhauſted ſpirits; and having got down the front glaſs, ſhe called out as loud as ſhe was able, begging their aſſiſtance to reſcue a miſerable creature from ruffians. One who attended the carriage by way of guard, exclaimed that it was only a poor wretch out of her ſenſes, whom her friends were conveying to a place of ſecurity: but Harriet, notwithſtanding ſome endeavours of the man in the chaiſe to prevent her, cried out with greater vehemence than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, entreating them, for God's ſake, to pity and relieve her. By this time one, who had been formerly behind, came up, to the front of the party they had met, and overhearing this laſt ſpeech of Harriet's— "Good God! ſaid he, can it be Miſs Anneſly?" Upon this her companion in the carriage, jumped out with a piſtol in his hand, and preſently ſhe heard the report of fire-arms, at which the horſes taking fright, ran furiouſly acroſs the fields for a conſiderable way before their driver was able to ſtop them. He had ſcarcely accompliſhed that, when he was accoſted by a ſervant in livery, who bade him fear nothing, for that his maſter had obliged the villains to make off.—"Eternal bleſſings on him! cried Harriet, and to that providence whoſe inſtrument he is."—
'To have been of any ſervice to Miſs Anneſly, replied a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who now appeared leading his horſe, rewards itſelf.'—It was Sindall!—"Gracious powers! exclaimed the aſtoniſhed Harriet, can it be you, ſir Thomas!" 'Compoſe yourſelf, my dear Miſs Anneſly, ſaid he, leſt the ſurprize of your deliverance ſhould overpower your ſpirits.'—He had opened the door of the chaiſe, and Harriet, by a natural motion, made room for him to ſit by her.—He accordingly gave his horſe to a ſervant, and ſtepped into the chaiſe, directing the driver to ſtrike down a particular path, which would lead him to a ſmall inn, where he had ſometimes paſſed the night when a hunting.</p>
                     <p>When he pulled up the glaſs, "Tell me, tell me, ſir Thomas, ſaid Harriet, what guardian angel directed you ſo unexpectedly to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018007_0068_0FA45DE2AA84E340"/>
my relief?"—"That guardian angel, my faireſt, which I truſt will ever direct us to happineſs; my love, my impatient love, that could not bear the tedious days which my Harriet's preſence had ceaſed to brighten." — When ſhe would have expreſſed the warmth of her gratitude for his ſervices; "Speak not of them, ſaid he; I only riſked a life in thy defence, which, without thee, it is nothing to poſſeſs."</p>
                     <p>They now reached that inn to which Sindall had directed them; where, if they found a homely, yet it was a cordial reception. The landlady, who had the moſt obliging and attentive behaviour in the world, having heard of the accident which had befallen the lady, produced ſome waters which, ſhe ſaid, were highly cordial, and begged Miſs Anneſly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ake a large glaſs of them; informing her, that they were made after a receit of her grandmother's, who was one of the moſt notable doctreſſes in the country.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas, however, was not ſatisfied with this preſcription alone, but diſpatched one of his ſervants to fetch a neighbouring ſurgeon, as Miſs Anneſly's alarm, he ſaid, might have more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences than people, ignorant of ſuch things, could imagine.</p>
                     <p>For this ſurgeon, indeed, there ſeemed more employments than one; the ſleeve of ſir Thomas's ſhirt was diſcovered to be all over blood, owing, as he imagined, to the grazing of a piſtol-ball which had been fired at him. This himſelf treated very lightly, but it awakened the fears and tenderneſs of Harriet in the livelieſt manner.</p>
                     <p>The landlady now put a queſtion, which indeed might natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſuggeſted itſelf before; to wit, Whom they ſuſpected to be the inſtigators of this outrage? Sir Thomas anſwered, that, for his part, he could form no probable conjecture about the matter; and, turning to Miſs Anneſly, aſked her opinion on the ſubject; "Sure, ſaid he, it cannot have been that ruffian who was rude to you at the inn where we dined."</p>
                     <p>Harriet anſwered, that ſhe could very well ſuppoſe it might; adding, that though, in the confuſion, ſhe did not pretend to have taken very diſtinct notice of things, yet ſhe thought there was a perſon ſtanding at the door, near to that drunken gentleman, who had ſome reſemblance of the man that ſat by her in the chaiſe.</p>
                     <p>They were interrupted by the arrival of the ſurgeon, which, from the vigilance of the ſervant, happened in a much ſhorter time than could have been expected; and Harriet peremptorily inſiſted, that, before he took any charge of her, he ſhould examine and dreſs the wound on ſir Thomas's arm. To this, therefore, the baronet was obliged to conſent; and after having been ſome time with the operator in an adjoining chamber, they returned together, ſir Thomas's arm being ſlung in a piece of crape, and the ſurgeon declaring, highly to Miſs Anneſly's ſatisfaction, that with proper care there was no ſort of danger; though, he added, that if the ſhot had taken a direction but half an inch more to the left, it would
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018007_0069_0FA45DE3296B35E0"/>
have ſhattered the bone to pieces. This laſt declaration drove the blood again from Harriet's cheek, and contributed perhaps, more than any thing elſe, to that quickneſs and tremulation of pulſe which the ſurgeon, on applying his finger to her wriſt, pronounced to be the caſe.</p>
                     <p>He ordered his patient to be undreſt; which was accordingly done, the landlady accommodating her with a bed-gown of her own; and then, having mulled a little wine, he mixed in it ſome powders of his own compoſition, a ſecret, he ſaid, of the greateſt efficacy in re-adjuſting any diſorders in the nervous ſyſtem; of which draught he recommended a large tea cupful to be taken immediately.</p>
                     <p>Harriet objected ſtrongly againſt theſe powders, till the ſurgeon ſeemed to grow angry at her refuſal, and recapitulated, in a very rapid manner, the ſucceſs which their adminiſtration had in many great families who did him the honour of employing him. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, the gentleneſs of whoſe nature could offend no one living, overcame her reluctance, and ſwallowed the doſe that was offered her —</p>
                     <p>The indignation of my ſoul has with difficulty ſubmitted ſo long to this cool deſcription of a ſcene of the moſt exquiſite villainy. The genuineneſs of my tale needs not the aid of ſurpriſe, to intereſt the feelings of my readers. It is with horror I tell them, that the various incidents, which this and the preceding chapter contain, were but the prelude of a deſign formed by Sindall for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that innocence, which was the dowry of Anneſly's daughter.</p>
                     <p>He had contrived a rout the moſt proper for the ſucceſs of his machinations, which the ignorance of Ryland was prevailed on to follow: he had bribed a ſet of banditti to execute that ſham rape, which his ſeeming valour was to prevent; he had ſcratched his wriſt with a penknife, to make the appearance of being wounded in the cauſe; he had trained his victim to the houſe of a wretch whom he had before employed in purpoſes of ſimilar kind; he had dreſſed one of his own creatures to perſonate a ſurgeon, and that ſurgeon, by his directions, had adminiſtered certain powders, of which the damnable effects were to aſſiſt the execution of his villainy.</p>
                     <p>Beſet with toils like theſe, his helpleſs prey was, alas! too much in his power to have any chance of eſcape; and that guilty night completed the ruin of her, whom, but the day before, the friend of Sindall, in the anguiſh of his ſoul, had recommended to his care and protection.—</p>
                     <p>Let me cloſe this chapter on the monſtrous deed!—That ſuch things are, is a thought diſtreſsful to humanity —their detail can gratify no mind that deſerves to be gratified—They are related for the inſtruction of the innocent.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIV. The ſituation of Harriet, and the conduct of Sindall. They proceed homeward. Some incidents in their journey.</head>
                     <p>I Would deſcribe, if I could, the anguiſh which the recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſucceeding day brought on the mind of Harriet An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly.—But it is in ſuch paſſages that the expreſſion of the writer will do little juſtice even to his own feelings; much muſt therefore be left to thoſe of the reader.</p>
                     <p>The poinancy of her own diſtreſs was doubled by the idea of her father's; a father's, whoſe pride, whoſe comfort, but a few weeks ago ſhe had been, to whom ſhe was now to return deprived of that innocence which could never be reſtored. I ſhould rather ſay that honour; for guilt it could not be called, under the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances into which ſhe had been betrayed; but the world has little diſtinction to make; and the fall of her, whom the deepeſt villainy has circumvented, it brands with that common degree of infamy, which, in its juſtice, it always imputes to the ſide of the leſs criminal party.</p>
                     <p>Sindall's pity (for we will do him no injuſtice) might be touched; his paſſion was but little abated; and he employed the language of both to comfort the affliction he had cauſed. From the violence of what, by the perverſion of words, is termed love, he excuſed the guilt of his paſt conduct, and proteſted his readineſs to wipe it away by the future. He begged that Harriet would not ſuffer her delicacy to make her unhappy under the ſenſe of their connexion; he vowed that he conſidered her as his wife, and that, as ſoon as particular circumſtances would allow him, he would make her what the world called ſo, though the ſacredneſs of his attachment was above being encreaſed by any form whatever.</p>
                     <p>There was ſomething in the mind of Harriet which allowed her little eaſe under all theſe proteſtations of regard; but they took off the edge of her preſent affliction, and ſhe heard them, if not with a warmth of hope, at leaſt with an alleviation of deſpair.</p>
                     <p>They now ſet out on their return to the peaceful manſion of Anneſly How bliſsful, in any other circumſtances, had Harriet imagined the ſight of a father, whom ſhe now trembled to behold!</p>
                     <p>They had not proceeded many miles when they were met by Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land attended by a number of ruſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> perſuaſion, even when not deranged by the confuſion and fright of ſuch an adventure. His joy at finding Harriet ſafe in the protection of ſir Thomas, was equally turbulent with his former fears for her welfare. After rewarding his preſent aſſociates with the greateſt part of the money in his pocket, he proceeded, in a manner not the moſt diſtinct, to give an account of what befel himſelf, ſubſequent to that violence which had torn him from his companion.</p>
                     <p>The chaiſe, he ſaid, into which he was forced, drove, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral croſs roads, about three or four miles from the place where they were firſt attacked; it then ſtopping, his attendant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to get out, and, pointing to a farm-houſe which, by the light of the moon, was diſcernible at ſome diſtance, told him, that, if he went thither, he would find accommodation for the night, and might purſue his journey with ſafety in the morning.</p>
                     <p>He now demanded, in his turn, a recital from Harriet of her ſhare of their common calamity, which ſhe gave him in the few words the preſent ſtate of her ſpirits could afford. When ſhe had ended, Ryland fell on his knees in gratitude to ſir Thomas for her deliverance. Harriet turned on Sindall a look infinitely expreſſive, and it was followed by a ſtarting tear.</p>
                     <p>They now proceeded to the next ſtage on their way homeward, Sindall declaring, that, after what had happened, he would, on no account, leave Miſs Anneſly, till he had delivered her ſafe into the hands of her father. She heard this ſpeech with a ſigh ſo deep, that if Ryland had poſſeſſed much penetration, he would have made conjectures of ſomething uncommon on her mind; but he was guiltleſs of imputing to others, what his honeſty never experienced in himſelf. Sir Thomas obſerved it better, and gently chid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t by ſqueezing her hand in his.</p>
                     <p>At the inn where they firſt ſtopt, they met with a gentleman who made the addition of a fourth perſon to their party, being an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer who was going down to the ſame part of the country on recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orders, and happened to be a particular acquaintance of ſir Thomas Sindall: his name was Camplin.</p>
                     <p>He afforded to their ſociety an ingredient of which at preſent it ſeemed to ſtand pretty much in need; to wit, a proper ſhare of mirth and humour, for which nature ſeemed, by a profuſion of animal ſpirits, to have very well fitted him. She had not perhaps beſtowed on him much ſterling wit; but ſhe had given him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that counterfeit aſſurance, which frequently paſſes more current than the real. In this company, to which chance had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated him, he had an additional advantage from the preſence of Ryland, whom he very ſoon diſcovered to be of that order of men called Buts, thoſe eaſy cuſhions (to borrow a metaphor of Otway's) on whom the wits of the world repoſe and fatten.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, he had a fund of converſation ariſing from the adventures of a life which, according to his own account, he had
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018007_0073_0FA454A382F1DC48"/>
paſſed equally in the perils of war and the luxuries of peace; his memoirs affording repeated inſtances of his valour in dangers of the field, his addreſs in the ſociety of the great, and his gallantry in connexions with the fair.</p>
                     <p>But leſt the reader ſhould imagine, that the real portraiture of this gentleman was to be found in thoſe lineaments which he drew of himſelf, I will take the liberty candidly, though briefly, to communicate ſome particulars relating to his quality, his ſituation, and his character.</p>
                     <p>He was the ſon of a man who called himſelf an attorney, in a village adjoining to ſir Thomas Sindall's eſtate. His father, ſir William, with whom I made my readers a little acquainted in the beginning of my ſtory, had found this ſame lawyer uſeful in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome proceedings againſt his poor neighbours, which the delicacy of more eſtabliſhed practitioners in the law might poſſibly have boggled at; and he had grown into conſequence with the baronet, from that pliancy of diſpoſition which was ſo ſuited to his ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Not that ſir William was naturally cruel or oppreſſive; but he had an exalted idea of the conſequence which a great eſtate confers on its poſſeſſor, which was irritated beyond meaſure when any favorite ſcheme of his was oppoſed by a man of little fortune, however juſt or proper his reaſons for oppoſition might be; and, though a <hi>good ſort of man,</hi> as I have before obſerved, his vengeance was implacable.</p>
                     <p>Young Camplin, who was nearly of an age with maſter Tommy Sindall, was frequently at ſir William's in quality of a dependant companion to his ſon; and, before the baronet died, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him an enſign's commiſſion in a regiment, which ſome years after was ſtationed in one of our garriſons abroad, where Camplin, much againſt his inclination, was under a neceſſity of joining it, Here he happened to have an opportunity of obliging the chief in command by certain little offices, which, though not ſtrictly hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable in themſelves, are ſanctified by the favour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of many honourable men; and ſo much did they attach his commander to the enſign, that the latter was very ſoon promoted by his intereſt to the rank of a lieutenant, and not long after was enabled to make a very advantageous purchace of a company. With this patron alſo he returned to England, and was received at all times in a very familiar manner into his houſe; where he had the honour of carving good diſhes which he was ſometimes permitted to taſte, of laughing at jokes which he was ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to make, and carried an obſequious face into all companies, who were not treated with ſuch extraordinary reſpect as to preclude his approach.</p>
                     <p>About this time his father, whoſe buſineſs in the country had not encreaſed ſince the death of ſir William Sindall, had ſettled in London, where the reader will recollect the having met with him in a former chapter; but the captain, during his patron's reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018007_0074_0FA454A433CB8580"/>
there, lived too near St. James's to make many viſits to Gray's Inn; and after that gentleman left the town, he continued to move amidſt a circle of men of faſhion, with whom he contrived to live in a manner which has been often defined by the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, "nobody knows how."</p>
                     <p>Which ſort of life he had followed uninterruptedly, without ever joining his regiment, till he was now obliged, by the change of a colonel, to take ſome of the duty in his turn, and was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a recruiting, as I have taken due occaſion to relate.</p>
                     <p>In this company did Harriet return to her father. As the news of diſaſter is commonly ſpeedy in its courſe, the good man had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been confuſedly informed of the attack which had been made on his daughter. To him therefore this meeting was ſo joyful, as almoſt to blot from his remembrance the calamities which had lately befallen his family.</p>
                     <p>But far different were the ſenſations of Harriet: ſhe ſhrunk from the ſight of a parent, of whoſe purity ſhe now conceived her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy, and fell bluſhing on his neck, which ſhe bathed with a profuſion of tears. This he imagined to proceed from her ſenſibility of thoſe woes which her unhappy brother had ſuffered; and he forbore to take notice of her diſtreſs, any otherwiſe than by maintaining a degree of chearfulneſs himſelf, much above what the feelings of his heart could warrant.</p>
                     <p>He was attended, when her fellow-travellers accompanied Miſs Anneſly to his houſe, by a gentleman, whom he now introduced to her by the name of Rawlinſon, ſaying he was a very worthy friend of his, who had lately returned from abroad. Harriet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed recollected to have heard her father mention ſuch a one in their converſations before. Though a good deal younger than Anneſly, he had been a very intimate ſchool-fellow of his in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, from which place he was ſent to the Eaſt Indies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, as was common in thoſe days, with ſome thouſand pounds, and a good conſcience, to his native country.</p>
                     <p>A genuine plainneſs of manners, and a warm benevolence of heart, neither the refinements of life, nor the ſubtleties of traffic, had been able to weaken in Rawlinſon; and he ſet out, under the impreſſion of both, immediately after his arrival in England, to viſit a companion, whoſe virtues he remembered with veneration, and the value of whoſe friendſhip he had not forgotten. Anneſly received him with that welcome which his fire-ſide ever afforded to the worthy; and Harriet, through the dimneſs of her grief, ſmiled on the friend of her father.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXV. Something farther of Mr. Rawlinſon.</head>
                     <p>RAWLINSON found his reception ſo agreeable, that he lengthened his viſit much beyond the limits which he at firſt intended it; and the earneſt requeſt of Anneſly, to whom his friend's company was equally pleaſing, extended them ſtill a little farther.</p>
                     <p>During this period, he had daily opportunities of obſerving the amiable diſpoſitions of Harriet. He obſerved, indeed, a degree of melancholy about her, which ſeemed extraordinary in one of her age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he was ſatisfied to account for it, from the relation, which her father had given him, of the ſituation of his ſon, and that remarkable tenderneſs of which his daughter was ſuſceptible. When viewed in this light, it added to the good opinion which he already entertained of her.</p>
                     <p>His eſteem for Miſs Anneſly ſhowed itſelf by every mark of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which a regard for the other ſex unavoidably prompts in ours; and a young woman, or her father, who had no more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration in thoſe matters than is common to many, would not have heſitated to pronounce that Rawlinſon was already the lover of Harriet. But as neither ſhe nor her father had any wiſhes pointing that way, which had been one great index for diſcovery, they were void of any ſuſpicion of his intentions, till he declared them to Anneſly himſelf.</p>
                     <p>He did this with an openneſs and ſincerity conformable to the whole of his character. He told his friend that he had now made ſuch a fortune as enabled him to live independantly, and that he looked for a companion to participate it, whoſe good ſenſe would improve what were worthy, and whoſe good-nature would bear what were imperfect in him. He had diſcovered, he ſaid, ſo much of both in the mind of Miſs Anneſly, that there needed not the recommendation of being the daughter of his worthieſt friend to determine his choice; and that, though he was not old enough to be inſenſible to beauty, yet he was wiſe enough to conſider it as the leaſt of her good qualities. He added, that he made this application to her father, not to aſk a partial exertion of his intereſt in his favour, but only, as the common friend of both, to reveal his intentions to Miſs Harriet. "She has ſeen me, ſaid he, as I am; if not a romantic lover, I ſhall not be a different ſort of being, ſhould ſhe accept of me for a huſband; if ſhe does not, I promiſe you, I ſhall be far from being offended, and will always endeavour to retain her for my friend, whom I have no right to blame for not chuſing to be my wife."</p>
                     <p>Anneſly communicated this propoſal to his daughter, with a fairneſs, worthy of that with which it had been entruſted to him: "I come not, ſaid he, my Harriet, as a deſpot to command,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018007_0076_0FA454A7B69B10A0"/>
not as a father to perſuade, but merely as the friend of Mr. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon, to diſcloſe his ſentiments; that you ſhould judge for yourſelf, in a matter of the higheſt importance to you, is the voice of reaſon and of nature; I bluſh for thoſe parents who have thought otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>"I would not even, with a view to this particular caſe, obtrude my advice; in general you have heard my opinion before, that the violence which we have been accuſtomed to apply to love, is not always neceſſary towards happineſs in marriage; at the ſame time, that it is a treaſon of the higheſt kind in a woman to take him for her huſband, whom a decent affection has not placed in that ſituation, whence alone ſhe ſhould chuſe one. But my Harriet has not merely been taught ſentiments; I know ſhe has learned the art of forming them; and here ſhe ſhall be truſted entirely to her own."</p>
                     <p>The feelings of Harriet on this propoſal, and the manner in which her father communicated it, were of ſo tender a kind, that ſhe could not reſtrain her tears. There wanted, indeed, but little to induce her to confeſs all that had paſſed with Sindall, and throw herſelf on the clemency of her indulgent parent. Had ſhe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this ſincerity, which is the laſt virtue we ſhould ever part with, how happy had it been! But it required a degree of fortitude, as well as ſoftneſs, to make this diſcovery; beſides, that her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer had, with the tendereſt entreaties, and aſſurances of a ſpeedy reparation of her injuries, prevailed on her to give him ſomething like a promiſe of ſecrecy.</p>
                     <p>Her anſwer to this offer of Mr. Rawlinſon's, expreſſed her ſenſe of the obligation ſhe lay under to him, and to her father; ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed an eſteem for his character equal to its excellence, but that it amounted not to that tender regard which ſhe muſt feel for the man whom ſhe could think of making her huſband.</p>
                     <p>Rawlinſon received his friend's account of this determination without diſcompoſure. He ſaid he knew himſelf well enough to believe that Miſs Anneſly had made an honeſt and a proper decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and begged to have an interview with herſelf, to ſhow her that he conceived not the ſmalleſt reſentment at her refuſal, which, on the contrary, though it deſtroyed his hopes, had encreaſed his veneration for her.</p>
                     <p>"Regard me not, ſaid he to her when they met, with that aſpect of diſtance, as if you had offended or affronted me; let me not loſe that look of kindneſs which, as the friend of your father and yourſelf, I have formerly experienced. I confeſs there is one diſparity between us, which we elderly men are apt to forget, but which I take no offence at being put in mind of. It is more than probable that I ſhall never be married at all.</p>
                     <p>Since I am not a match for you Miſs Anneſly, I would endeavour to make you ſomewhat better, if it is poſſible, for another; do me the favour to accept of this paper, and let it ſpeak for me, that I would contribute to your happineſs, without the ſelfiſh conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

of its being made one with my own." So ſaying, he bowed and retired into an adjoining apartment, where his friend was ſeated. Harriet, upon opening the paper, found it to contain bank bills to the amount of a thouſand pounds.</p>
                     <p>Her ſurpriſe at this inſtance of generoſity held her, for a few moments, fixed to the ſpot; but ſhe no ſooner recollected herſelf, than ſhe followed Mr. Rawlinſon, and putting the paper, with its contents, into his hand: "Though I feel, ſir, ſaid ſhe, with the utmoſt gratitude, thoſe ſentiments of kindneſs and generoſity you have expreſſed towards me, you will excuſe me, I hope, from receiving this mark of them."—Rawlinſon's countenance betrayed ſome indications of diſpleaſure.—"You do wrong, ſaid he, young lady, and I will be judged by your father—This was a preſent, ſir, I intended for the worthieſt woman, the daughter of my worthieſt friend; ſhe is woman ſtill, I ſee, and her pride will, no more than her affections, ſubmit itſelf to my happineſs." Anneſly looked upon the bank-bills; "There is a delicacy, my beſt friend, ſaid he, in our ſituation; the poor muſt ever be cautious, and there is a certain degree of pride which is their ſafeſt virtue." —"Let me tell you, interrupted the other, this is not the pride of virtue.—It is that fantaſtic nicety which is a weakneſs in the ſoul, and the dignity of great minds is above it. Believe me, the churliſhneſs which cannot oblige, is little more ſelfiſh, though in a different mode, than the haughtineſs which will not be obliged."</p>
                     <p>"We are inſtructed, my child," ſaid Anneſly, delivering her the paper; "let us ſhow Mr. Rawlinſon, that we have not that narrowneſs of mind which he has cenſured; and that we will pay that laſt tribute to his worth which the receiving of a favour beſtows."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, ſir, ſaid Harriet, I little deſerve it; I am not, I am not what he thinks me.—I am not worthy of his regard." —And ſhe burſt into tears.—They knew not why ſhe wept; but their eyes ſhed each a ſympathetic drop, without aſking their reaſon's leave.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Rawlinſon ſpeedily ſet out for London, where his preſence was neceſſary towards diſpatching ſome buſineſs he had left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed, after his return to England.</p>
                     <p>He left his friend, and his friend's amiable daughter, with a tender regret; while they, who, in their humble walk of life, had few to whom that title would belong, felt his abſence with an equal emotion</p>
                     <p>He promiſed, however, at his departure, to make them another viſit with the return of the ſpring.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVI. Captain Camplin is again introduced.—The ſiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miſs Anneſly, with that gentleman's concern in her affairs.</head>
                     <p>HIS place was but ill ſupplied, at their winter's fire-ſide, by the occaſional viſits of Camplin, whom Sindall had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Anneſly's acquaintance. Yet, though his was a character on which Anneſly could not beſtow much of his eſteem, it had ſome good-humoured qualities, which did not fail to entertain and amuſe him.</p>
                     <p>But the captain ſeemed to be leſs agreeable in that quarter to which he principally pointed his attention, to wit, the opinion of Harriet, to whom he took frequent occaſion to make thoſe ſpeeches, which have juſt enough of folly in them to acquire the name of compliments, and ſometimes even ventured to turn them in ſo particular a manner, as if he wiſhed to have them underſtood to mean ſomewhat more.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of the unfortunate Harriet was ſuch as his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry could not divert, and his attachment could only diſguſt. As ſhe had loſt that peace of mind which inward ſatisfaction alone can beſtow, ſo ſhe felt the calamity doubled, by that obligation to ſecrecy ſhe was under, and the difficulty which her preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for ſhe was now with child) made ſuch a concealment be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with.</p>
                     <p>Often had ſhe determined to reveal, either to her father or to Mrs. Wiſtanly, who, of her own ſex, was her only friend, the ſtory of her diſhonour; but Sindall, by repeated ſolicitations when in the country, and a conſtant correſpondence when in town, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her to be ſilent for ſome little time, till he could ſmooth the way for beſtowing his hand on the only woman whom he had ever ſincerely loved.</p>
                     <p>One principal reaſon for his poſtponing their union, had always been the neceſſity for endeavouring to gain over the aſſent of his grandfather by the mother's ſide, from whom Sindall had great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; he had, from time to time, ſuggeſted this as difficult, and only to be attempted with caution, from the proud and touchy diſpoſition of the old gentleman: he now repreſented him as in a very declining ſtate of health, and that, probably, in a very ſhort time, his death would remove this obſtacle to the warmeſt wiſh of a heart, that was ever faithful to his Harriet. The flattering language of his letters could not arreſt the progreſs of that time, which muſt divulge the ſhame of her he had undone; but they ſoothed the tumults of a ſoul to whom his villainy was yet unknown and whoſe affections his appearance of worth, of friendſhip, and mooleneſs of mind, had but too much entangled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:018007_0079_0FA454ABF985A1B8"/>However imperfectly he had accounted for delaying a marriage, which he always profeſſed his intention to perform, the deluſion was kept up in the expectations of Harriet, till that period began to draw near, when it would be impoſſible any longer to conceal from the world the effects of their intimacy. Then, indeed, her uneaſineſs was not to be allayed by ſuch excuſes as Sindall had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore relied on her artleſs confidence to believe.</p>
                     <p>He wrote her, therefore, an anſwer to a letter full of the moſt earneſt as well as tender expoſtulations, informing her, of his having determined to run any riſk of inconvenience to himſelf, rather than ſuffer her to remain longer in a ſtate, ſuch as ſhe had (pathetically indeed) deſcribed. That he was to ſet out in a few days for the country, to make himſelf indiſſolubly hers; but that it was abſolutely neceſſary that ſhe ſhould allow him to conduct their marrige in a particular manner, which he would communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to her on his arrival; and begged, as ſhe valued his peace and her own, that the whole matter might ſtill remain inviolably ſecret as ſhe had hitherto kept it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In a few days after the receit of this letter, ſhe received a note from Camplin, importing his deſire to have an interview with her on ſome particular buſineſs, which related equally to her and to ſir Thomas Sindall. The time he appointed was early in the morning of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding day; and the place, a little walk which the villagers uſed to frequent in holiday-times, at the back of her father's garden. This was delivere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Myſterious as the contents of this note were, the mind of Harriet eaſily ſuggeſted to her, that Camplin had been, in ſome reſpect at leaſt, let into the confidence of ſir Thomas. She now felt the want of that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which innocence beſtows; ſhe bluſhed and trembled, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this little boy, becauſe he was Camplin's; and with a ſhaking hand, ſcrawled a note in anſwer to that he had brought her, to let his maſter know, that ſhe would meet him at the hour he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. — She met him accordingly.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He began with making many proteſtations of his regard, hath for Miſs Anneſly and the baronet, which had induced him, he ſaid, to dedicate himſelf to the ſervice of both in this affair, though it was a matter of ſuch delicacy as he would not otherwiſe have choſen to interfere in; and putting into her hand a letter from Sindall, told her, he had taken meaſures for carrying into excution the purpoſe it contained</hi>

                        <hi>It informed her that ſir Thomas was in the houſe of an old domeſtic at ſome miles diſtance, where he waited to be made hers. That he had for this ſecrecy many reaſons, with which he could not by ſuch a conveyance make her acquainted, but which her own prudence would probably ſuggeſt. He concluded with recommending her to the care and protection of Camplin, whoſe honour he warmly extolled.</hi>

"But my father, good heaven! to leave my father!" "Conſider, ſaid he, 'tis but for a little while: my boy ſhall carry a note to acquaint him that you are gone on a viſit, and will return in the evening."—"Return! Methinks I feel a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding that I ſhall never return."—He put a piece of paper and a pencil into her hand; the note was written, and diſpatched by the boy, to whom he beckoned at ſome diſtance where he had waited.— "Now, madam, ſaid he, let me conduct you."—Her knees knocked ſo againſt each other, that it was with difficulty ſhe could walk, even with the ſupport of his arm.</hi>

                        <hi>They reached the chaiſe; a ſervant who ſtood by it, opened the door to admit her; ſhe put her foot on the ſtep, then drew it back again. "Be not afraid, madam, ſaid Camplin, you go to be happy." She put her foot up again, and ſtood in that attitude a moment; ſhe caſt back a look to the little manſion of her father, whence the ſmoke was now rolling its volumes in the calm of a beautiful morning. A guſh of tenderneſs ſwelled her heart at the fight—She burſt into tears—But the criſis of her fate was come—and ſhe entered the carriage, which drove off at a furious rate, Camplin commanding the poſtilion to make as much ſpeed as was poſſible.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVII. The effects which the event contained in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapter had on Mr. Anneſly.</head>
                     <p>THE receit of that note which Harriet was perſuaded by Camplin to write to her father, (intimating that ſhe was gone upon a viſit to a family in the neighbourhood, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till the evening) though her time of going abroad was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unuſual, did not create any ſurpriſe in the mind of Anneſly; but it happened that Mrs. Wiſtanly, who called in the afternoon to enquire after her young friend, had juſt left the very houſe where her meſſage imported her viſit to be made.</p>
                     <p>This ſet her father on conjecturing, yet without much anxiety, and with no ſuſpicion: but his fears were redoubled when, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſat up till a very late hour, no tidings arrived of his daughter. He went to bed, however, though it could not afford him ſleep; at every bark of the village-dogs his heart bounded with the hopes of her return; but the morning roſe, and did not reſtore him his Harriet.</p>

                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:018007_0081_0FA454AEB1751648"/>His uneaſineſs had been obſerved by his ſervants, to whom he was too indulgent a maſter to have his intereſts conſidered by them with leſs warmth than their own. Abraham, therefore, who was coeval with his maſter, and had ſerved him ever ſince he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, had ſallied forth by day-break on ſearch of intelligence. He was met accidentally by a huntſman of ſir Thomas Sindall's, who informed him, that as he croſſed the lane at the back of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage the morning before, he ſaw Miſs Anneſly leaning on captain Camplin's arm, and walking with him towards a chaiſe and four, which ſtood at the end of it.</p>
                     <p>Abraham's cheeks grew pale at this intelligence; becauſe he had a ſort of inſtinctive terror for Camplin, who was in uſe to make his awkward ſimplicity a fund for many jeſts, and tricks of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, during his viſits to Anneſly. He haſtened home to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this diſcovery to his maſter, which he did with a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Yonder, ſaid Abraham, looking through the window, is the captain's little boy;" and he ran out of the room to bring him to an examination. The lad, upon being interrogated, confeſſed that his maſter had ſent him to hire a chaiſe, which was to be in waiting at the end of that lane I have formerly mentioned, at an early hour in the morning, and that he ſaw Miſs Anneſly go into it attended by the captain, who had not, any more than Miſs Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, been at home or heard of ſince that time.</p>
                     <p>This declaration deprived Anneſly of utterance; but it only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the warmth of Abraham's inquiſition, who now mingling threats with his queſtions, drew from the boy the ſecret, of his having privately delivered a letter, from his maſter to Miſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly, the very night preceding the day of their departure; and that a man of his acquaintance, who had ſtopt, about mid-day, at the alehouſe where he was quartered, told him, by way of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that he had met his maſter with a lady, whom he ſuppoſed, jeeringly, he was running away with, driving at a great rate on the road towards London.</p>
                     <p>Abraham made a ſign to the boy to leave the room. — "My poor dear young lady!" ſaid he, as he ſhut the door, and the tears guſhed from his eyes. His maſter's were turned upwards, to that Being to whom calamity ever directed them. — The maid-ſervant now entered the room, uttering ſome broken exclamations of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which a violent ſobbing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Oh, ſir! ſaid ſhe, ſtifling her tears, I have heard what the captain's boy has been telling; I fear it is but too true, and worſe than you imagine! God forgive me if I wrong Miſs Harriet;

but I ſuſpect—I have ſuſpected for ſome time—ſhe burſt into tears again!—that my young lady is with child."—Anneſly had ſtretched his fortitude to the utmoſt—this laſt blow overcame it, and he fell ſenſeleſs on the floor! Abraham threw himſelf down by him, tearing his white looks, and acting all the frantic extravagances of grief. But the maid was more uſeful to her maſter; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed him gently, and chafed his temples, he began to ſhow ſome ſigns of reviving; when Abraham recollected himſelf ſo far as to aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Their endeavours for his recovery were ſeconded by Mrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wiſtanly, who had made this early viſit to ſatisfy ſome doubts which ſhe, as well as Anneſly, had conceived, even from the information of the preceding day When he firſt regained the uſe of ſpeech, he complained of a violent ſhivering, for which this good lady, from the little ſkill ſhe poſſeſſed in phyſic, preſcribed ſome ſimple remedies, and at the ſame time diſpatched Abraham for an apothecary in the neighbourhood, who commonly attended the family.</p>
                     <p>Before this gentleman arrived, Anneſly had received ſo much temporary relief from Mrs. Wiſtanly's preſcriptions, as to be able to ſpeak with more eaſe, than the inceſſant quivering of his lips had before allowed him to do. "Alas! ſaid he, Mrs. Wiſtanly, have you heard of my Harriet?"—"I have, ſir, ſaid ſhe, with equal aſtoniſhment and ſorrow; yet let me entreat you not to abandon that hope which the preſent uncertainty may warrant. I cannot allow myſelf to think that things are ſo ill as your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have informed me."—"My foreboding heart, ſaid he, tells me they are; I remember many circumſtances now, which all meet to confirm my fears. Oh! Mrs. Wiſtanly, ſhe was my darling, the idol of my heart! perhaps too much ſo—the will of heaven be done!"—</p>
                     <p>The apothecary now arrived, who, upon examining into the ſtate of his patient, ordered ſome warm applications to remove that univerſal coldneſs he complained of, and left him, with a promiſe of returning in a few hours, when he had finiſhed ſome viſits, which he was under a neceſſity of making in the village.</p>
                     <p>When he returned, he found Mr. Anneſly altered for the worſe; the cold which the latter felt before, having given place to a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, He therefore told Mrs. Wiſtanly, at going away, that in the evening he would bring a phyſician, with whom he had an appointment at a gentleman's not very diſtant, to ſee Mr. Anneſly, as his ſituation appeared to him to be attended with ſome alarming circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>His fears of danger were juſtified by the event, When theſe gentlemen ſaw Mr. Anneſly in the evening, his fever was encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Next day, after a reſtleſs night, they found every bad ſymptom confirmed: they tried every method which medical ſkill could

                     <head>CHAP. XXVIII. The arrival of Mr. Rawlinſon. Anneſly's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him. That gentleman's account of his friend's illneſs, and its conſequences.</head>
                     <p>AT this melancholy period it happened that Mr. Rawlinſon arrived, in purſuance of that promiſe which Anneſly had obtained from him, at the time of his departure for London.</p>
                     <p>There needed not that warmth of heart we have formerly deſcribed in this gentleman, to feel the accumulated diſtreſs to which his worthy friend was reduced. Nor was his aſtoniſhment at the account which he received of Harriet's elopement leſs, than his pity for the ſufferings it had brought upon her father.</p>
                     <p>From the preſent ſituation of Anneſly's family, he did not chuſe to incommode them with any trouble of proviſion for him. He took up his quarters therefore at the only inn, a paltry one indeed, which the village afforded, and reſolved to remain there till he ſaw what iſſue his friend's preſent illneſs ſhould have, and endeavour to adminiſter ſome comfort, either to the laſt moments of his life, or to that affliction which his recovery could not remove.</p>
                     <p>In the evening of the day on which he arrived, Anneſly ſeemed to feel a ſort of relief from the violence of his diſeaſe. He ſpoke with a degree of coolneſs which he had never before been able to command; and after having talked ſome little time with his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, he told Abraham, who ſeldom quitted his bed ſide, that he thought he had ſeen Mr. Rawlinſon enter the room in the morning, though he was in a confuſed ſlumber at the time, and might have miſtaken a dream for the reality.</p>
                     <p>Upon Abraham's informing him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Mr. Rawlinſon had been there, that he had left the houſe but a moment before, and that he was to remain in the village for ſome time, he expreſſed the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſatisfaction at the intelligence; and having made Abraham fetch him a paper which lay in his bureau, ſealed up in a particular manner, he diſpatched him to the inn where his friend was, with a meſſage, importing an earneſt deſire to ſee him as ſoon as ſhould be convenient.</p>
                     <p>Rawlinſon had already returned to the houſe, and was by this time ſtealing up ſtairs, to watch at the bed-ſide of his friend, for which taſk Mrs. Wiſtanly's former unceaſing ſolicitude had now
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018007_0084_0FA454B31FA8C838"/>
rendered her unfit. He was met by Abraham with a gleam of joy on his countenance, from the happy change which he thought he obſerved in his maſter; and was conducted to the ſide of the bed by that faithful domeſtic, who placed him in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Anneſly ſtretched out his hands, and ſqueezed that of Rawlinſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> between them for ſome time without ſpeaking a word. "I bleſs God, ſaid he at laſt, that he has ſent me a comforter, at a moment when I ſo much need one. You muſt by this time have heard, my friend, of that lateſt and greateſt of my family-misfortunes, with which providence has afflicted me."—"You know, my dear ſir, anſwered Rawlinſon, that no one would more ſincerely feel for your ſorrows than I; but at preſent it is a ſubject too tender for you."—"Do not ſay ſo, replied his friend; it will eaſe my labouring heart to ſpeak of it to my Rawlinſon: but in the firſt place I have a little buſineſs which I will now diſpatch. Here is a deed making over all my effects to you, ſir, and at your death, to any one you ſhall name your executor in that truſt for my children—if I have any children remaining!—Into your hands I deliver it with a peculiar ſatisfaction, and I know there will not need the deſire of a dying friend to add to your zeal for their ſervice. — Why ſhould that word ſtartle you? death is to me a meſſenger of conſolation!" He pauſed!—Rawlinſon put up the paper in ſilence, for his heart was too full to allow him the uſe of words for an anſwer.</p>
                     <p>"When I loſt my ſon, continued Anneſly, I ſuffered in ſilence; and though it preyed on me in ſecret, I bore up againſt the weight of my ſorrow, that I might not weaken in myſelf that ſtay which heaven had provided for my Harriet. She was then my only remaining comfort, ſaved like ſome precious treaſure from the ſhipwreck of my family; and I fondly hoped that my age might go down ſmoothly to its reſt, amidſt the endearments of a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's care.—I have now lived to ſee the laſt reſting-place which my ſoul could find in this world, laid waſte and deſolate!—yet to that Being, whoſe goodneſs is infinite as his ways are inſcrutable, let me bend in reverence! I bleſs his name that he has not yet taken from me that truſt in him, which to loſe is the only irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable calamity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is now indeed that I feel its efficacy moſt, when every ray of human comfort is extinguiſhed. As for me— my deliverance is at hand; I feel ſomething here at my heart that tells me, I ſhall not have long to ſtrive with inſufferable affliction.</p>
                     <p>My poor deluded daughter—I commit to thee, Father of all! by whom the wanderings of thy unhappy children are ſeen with pity, and to whom their return cannot be too late to be accepted! If my friend ſhould live to ſee her look back with contrition towards that path from which ſhe has ſtrayed, I know his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will lead her ſteps to find it—Show her her father's grave! yet ſpare her for his ſake, who cannot then comfort or ſupport her!"</p>

                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:018007_0085_0FA455786ECDF2E8"/>The reſt of this narration I will give the reader in Mr. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon's own words, from a letter of his I have now lying before me, of which I will tranſcribe the latter part, beginning its recital at the cloſe of this pathetic addreſs of his friend.</p>
                     <p>As I had been told (ſays this gentleman) that he had not enjoyed one ſound ſleep ſince his daughter went away, I left him now to compoſe himſelf to reſt, deſiring his ſervant to call me inſtantly, if he obſerved any thing particular about his maſter. He whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me,
<q>that when he ſat up with him the night before, he could overhear him at times talk wildly, and mutter to himſelf like one ſpeaking in one's ſleep; that then he would ſtart, ſigh deeply, and ſeem again to recollect himſelf.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I went back to his maſter's bed-ſide, and begged him to endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to calm his mind ſo much as not to prevent that repoſe which he ſtood ſo greatly in need of. "I have prevailed on my phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, anſwered he, to give me an opiate for that purpoſe, and I think I now feel drowſy from its effects." I wiſhed him good night. —"Good night, ſaid he, —but give me your hand; it is perhaps the laſt time I ſhall ever claſp it!"</p>
                     <p>He lifted up his eyes to heaven, holding my hand in his, then turned away his face, and laid his head upon his pillow.—I could not lay mine to reſt: Alas! ſaid I, that ſuch ſhould be the portion of virtue like Anneſly's; yet to arraign the diſtribution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, had been to forget that leſſon which the beſt of men had juſt been teaching me;—but the doubtings, the darkneſs of feeble man, ſtill hung about my heart.</p>
                     <p>When I ſent in the morning, I was told that he was ſtill aſleep, but that his reſt was obſerved to be frequently diſturbed by groans and ſtartings, and that he breathed much thicker than he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He muttered ſomething in a very low voice.—"How does my friend?" ſaid I.—He ſuffered me to take his hand, but anſwered nothing. — After liſtening ſome time, I could hear the name of Harriet. "Do you want any thing, my dear ſir?" He moved his lips, but I heard not what he ſaid. — I repeated my queſtion; he look'd up piteouſly in my face, then turned his eye round as if he miſſed ſome object on which it meant to reſt. — He ſhivered, and caught hold of Abraham's hand, who ſtood at the ſide of the bed oppoſite me.—He looked round again, then uttered with a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and broken voice,

                     <head>CHAP. XXIX. What befel Harriet Anneſly on her leaving her father.</head>
                     <p>I AM not in a diſpoſition to ſtop in the midſt of this part of my recital, ſolicitous to embelliſh, or ſtudious to arrange it. My readers ſhall receive it ſimple, as becomes a tale of ſorrow, and I flatter myſelf, they are at this moment readier to feel than to judge it.</p>
                     <p>They have ſeen Harriet Anneſly, by the artifice of Sindall, and the agency of Camplin, tempted to leave the houſe of her father, in hopes of meeting the man who had betrayed her, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that only reparation for her injuries which it was now in his power to make.</p>
                     <p>But ſir Thomas never entertained the moſt diſtant thought of that marriage, with the hopes of which he had deluded her. Yet, though he was not ſubject to the internal principles of honour or morality, he was man of the world enough to know their value in the eſtimation of others. The virtues of Anneſly had ſo much endeared him to every one within their reach, that this outrage of Sindall's againſt him, under the diſguiſe of ſacred friendſhip and regard, would have given the intereſt and character of ſir Thomas ſuch a blow, as he could not eaſily have recovered, nor conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently born. It is not therefore to be wondered at, that he wiſhed for ſome expedient to conceal it from the eyes of the public.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe he had formed a ſcheme, which all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege he had of the delicacy of Harriet's affection for him, did not prevent his thinking practicable; (for the female who once falls from innocence, is held to be ſunk into perpetual debaſement) and that was, to provide a huſband for her in the perſon of another. And for that huſband he pitched on Camplin, with whoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was too well acquainted, to doubt the bringing him over to any baſeneſs which danger did not attend, and a liberal reward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="40" facs="unknown:018007_0087_0FA45579EC0512D0"/>Camplin, who at this time was in great want of money, and had always an appetite for thoſe pleaſures which money alone can purchaſe, agreed to his propoſals; they ſettled the dowry of his future wife, and the ſcheme which he undertook to procure her. Part of its execution I have already related; I proceed to relate the reſt.</p>
                     <p>When they had been driven with all the fury which Camplin had enjoined the poſtilions, for about eight or nine miles, they ſtopt at an inn, where they changed horſes. Harriet expreſſed her ſurpriſe at their not having already reached the place where ſir Thomas waited them; on which Camplin told her, that it was not a great way off, but that the roads were very bad, and that he obſerved the horſes to be exceedingly jaded.</p>
                     <p>After having proceeded ſome miles farther, on a road ſtill more wild and leſs frequented, ſhe repeated her wonder at the length of the way; on which Camplin, entreating her pardon for being concerned in any how deceiving her, confeſſed that ſir Thomas was at a place much farther from her father's than he had made her believe; which deceit he had begged of him (Camplin) to practiſe, that ſhe might not be alarmed at the diſtance, which was neceſſary, he ſaid, for that plan of ſecrecy ſir Thomas had formed for his marriage. Her fears were ſufficiently rouſed at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but it was now too late to retreat, however terrible it might be to go on.</p>
                     <p>Some time after they ſtopt to breakfaſt, and changed horſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Camplin informing her, that it was the laſt time they ſhould have occaſion to do ſo. Accordingly, in little more than an hour, during which the ſpeed of their progreſs was nowiſe abated, they halted at the door of a houſe, which Harriet, upon coming out of the chaiſe, immediately recollected to be that fatal one to which Sindall had before conveyed her. She felt, on entering it, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of horror which the remembrance of that guilty night ſhe had before paſſed under its roof, could not fail to ſuggeſt, and it was with difficulty ſhe dragged her trembling ſteps to a room above ſtairs, whither the landlady, with a profuſion of civility, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her.</p>
                     <p>Where is ſir Thomas Sindall? ſaid ſhe, looking about with terror on the well-remembered objects around her. Camplin, ſhutting the door of the chamber, told her, with a look of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tenderneſs and reſpect, that ſir Thomas was not then in the houſe, but had deſired him to deliver her a letter, which he now put into her hands for her peruſal. It contained what follows:
<floatingText type="letter">

                              <p>It is with inexpreſſible anguiſh I inform my ever-deareſt Harriet, of my inability to perform engagements, of which I acknowlege the ſolemnity, and which neceſſity alone has power to cancel. The cruelty of my grandfather is deaf to all the remonſtrances of my love; and having accidentally diſcovered my attachment for you, he inſiſts upon my immediately ſetting out on my travels; a command, which in my preſent ſituation, I find myſelf obliged to comply with. I feel,

with the moſt poinant ſorrow and remorſe, for that condition to which our ill fated love has reduced the lovelieſt of her ſex. I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour, if poſſible, to conceal the ſhame which the world ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily affixes to it. With this view I have laid aſide all ſelfiſh conſiderations ſo much, as to yield to the ſuit of Mr. Camplin that hand, which I had once the happineſs of expecting for myſelf.

                     <p>Camplin was about to offer his commentary upon this letter; but Harriet, whoſe ſpirits had juſt ſupported her to the end of it, lay now lifeleſs at his feet. After ſeveral ſucceſſive faintings, from which Camplin, the landlady, and other aſſiſtants, with difficulty recovered her, a ſhower of tears came at laſt to her relief, and ſhe became able to articulate ſome ſhort exclamations of horror and deſpair! Camplin threw himſelf on his knees before her. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the moſt ſincere and diſintereſted paſſion; and that, if ſhe would bleſs him with the poſſeſſion of ſo many amiable qualities as ſhe poſſeſſed, the uniform endeavour of his life ſhould be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote her happineſs. — "I think not of thee," ſhe exclaimed; "Oh! Sindall! perſidious, cruel, deliberate villain!" Camplin again interrupted her, with proteſtations of his own affection and regard.</p>
                     <p>"Away! ſaid ſhe, and let me hear no more! Or, if thou wouldſt ſhow thy friendſhip, carry me to that father from whom thou didſt ſteal me.—You will not—but if I can live ſo long, I will crawl to his feet, and expire before him." She was running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the door; Camplin gently ſtopt her.</p>
                     <p>"My deareſt Miſs Anneſly, ſaid he, recollect yourſelf but a moment; let me conjure you to think of your own welfare, and of that father's whom you ſo juſtly love. For theſe alone could ſir Thomas Sindall have thought of the expedient which he propoſes. If you will now become the wife of your adoring Camplin, the time of the celebration of our marriage need not be told to the world: under the ſanction of that holy tie, every circumſtance of detraction will be overlooked, and that life may be made long and happy, which your unthinking raſhneſs would cut off from your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and your father."—</p>
                     <p>Harriet had liſtened little to this ſpeech; but the ſwelling of her anger had ſubſided; ſhe threw herſelf into a chair, and burſt again into tears. Camplin drew nearer, and preſſed her hand in his; ſhe drew it haſtily from him: "If you have any pity, ſhe
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018007_0089_0FA4557BCE9B74C8"/>
cried, I entreat you for heaven's ſake to leave me." He bowed reſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>lly and retired, deſiring the landlady to attend Miſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly, and endeavour to afford her ſome aſſiſtance and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>She had, indeed, more occaſion for her aſſiſtance than he was than aware of; the violent agitation of her ſpirits having had ſuch an effect on her, that, though ſhe wanted a month of her time, ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with the pains of child-birth; and they were but juſt able to procure a woman who acted as a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife in the neighbourhood, when ſhe was delivered of a girl. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted as her ſoul was, this new object drew forth its inſtinctive tenderneſs; ſhe mingled tears with her kiſſes on its cheeks, and forgot the ſhame attending its birth, in the natural meltings of a mother.</p>
                     <p>For about a week after her delivery ſhe recovered tolerably well, and indeed thoſe about her ſpared no pains or attention to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards her recovery; but, at the end of that period, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident threw her into the moſt dangerous ſituation. She was lying in a ſlumber, with a nurſe watching her, when a ſervant of ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Sindall's, whom his maſter had employed very actively in the progreſs of his deſigns on Miſs Anneſly, entered the room with a look of the utmoſt conſternation and horror; the nurſe beckoned to him to make no noiſe, ſignifying, by her geſtures, that the lady was aſleep; but the opening of the door had already awakened her, and ſhe lay liſtening, when he told the cauſe of his emotion. It was the intelligence which he had juſt accidentally received of Mr. Anneſly's death. The effect of this ſhock on his unfortunate daughter may be eaſily imagined; every fatal ſymptom, which ſudden terror or ſurpriſe cauſes in women at ſuch a ſeaſon of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was the conſequence, and next morning a delirium ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
                     <p>She was not, however, without intervals of reaſon; though theſe were but intervals of anguiſh much more exquiſite. Yet ſhe would ſometimes expreſs a ſort of calmneſs and ſubmiſſion to the will of heaven, though it was always attended with the hopes of a ſpeedy relief from the calamities of her exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>In one of theſe hours of recollection, ſhe was aſked by her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, whoſe pity was now moved at her condition, if ſhe choſe to have any friend ſent for, who might tend to alleviate her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; upon which ſhe had command enough of herſelf, to dictate a letter to Mrs. Wiſtanly, reciting briefly the miſeries ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and aſking, with great diffidence however of obtaining, if ſhe could pardon her offences ſo far, as to come and receive the parting breath of her once innocent and much loved Harriet. This letter was accordingly diſpatched; and ſhe ſeemed to feel a relief from having accompliſhed it: but her reaſon had held out beyond its uſual limits of exertion; and immediately after, ſhe relapſed into her former unconnectedneſs.</p>
                     <p>Soon after the birth of her daughter, Camplin, according to his inſtructions, had propoſed ſending it away, under the charge of a
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018007_0090_0FA4557F45CB3B08"/>
nurſe whom the landlady had procured, to a ſmall hamlet, where ſhe reſided, at a little diſtance. But this the mother oppoſed with ſuch earneſtneſs, that the purpoſe had been delayed till now, when it was given up to the care of this woman, accompanied with a conſiderable ſum of money to provide every neceſſary for its uſe, in the moſt ample and ſumptuous manner.</p>
                     <p>When Mrs. Wiſtanly received the letter we have mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ſhe was not long in doubt as to complying with its requeſt. Her heart bled for the diſtreſſes of that once amiable friend, whom virtue might now blame, but goodneſs could not forſake. She ſet out therefore immediately in a chaiſe, which Camplin had provided for her, and reached the houſe, to which it conveyed her on the morning of the following day, her impatience not ſuffering her to conſider either the danger or inconvenience of travelling all night. — From her recital, I took down the account contained in the following chapter.</p>

                     <p>"WHEN I entered the houſe, and had got upon the ſtairs leading to the room in which Harriet lay, I heard a voice enchantingly ſweet, but low, and ſometimes broken, ſinging ſnatches of ſongs, varying from the ſad to the gay, and from the gay to the ſad: it was ſhe herſelf ſitting up in her bed, fingering her pillow as if it had been a harpſicord. It is not eaſy to conceive the horror I felt on ſeeing her in ſuch a ſituation! She ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious of my approach, though her eye was turned towards me as I entered; only that ſhe ſtopt in the midſt of a quick and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly movement ſhe had begun, and looking wiſtfully upon me, breathed ſuch a note of ſorrow, and dwelt on it with a cadence ſo mournful, that my heart loſt all the firmneſs I had reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and I flung my arms round her neck, which I waſhed with my burſting tears!—</p>
                     <p>The traces which her brain could now only recollect, were ſuch as did not admit of any object long; I had paſſed over it in the moment of my entrance, and it now wandered from the idea; ſhe paid no regard to my careſſes, but puſhed me gently from her, gazing ſtedfaſtly in an oppoſite direction towards the door of the apartment.</p>
                     <p>A ſervant entered with ſome medicine he had been ſent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; ſhe put it by when I offered it to her, and kept looking earneſtly upon him; ſhe ceaſed her ſinging too, and ſeemed to articulate certain imperfect ſounds. For ſome time I could not make them out into words, but at laſt ſhe ſpoke more diſtinctly, and with a firmer tone.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:018007_0091_0FA4557FED98AB20"/>
                        <q>You ſaved my life once, ſir, and I could then thank you, becauſe I wiſhed to preſerve it;—but now— no matter, he is happier than I would have him.— I would have nurſed the poor old man till he had ſeen ſome better days! bleſs his white beard!—look there! I have heard how they grow in the grave! —poor old man!—</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>You weep, my dear ſir; but had you heard her ſpeak theſe words! I can but coldly repeat them.</p>
                     <p>All that day ſhe continued in a ſtate of delirium and inſenſibility to every object around her; towards evening ſhe ſeemed exhauſted with fatigue, and the toſſing of her hands which her frenzy had cauſed, grew languid as of one breathleſs and worn out; about midnight ſhe dropt aſleep.</p>
                     <p>I ſat with her during the night, and when ſhe waked in the morning, ſhe gave ſigns of having recovered her ſenſes by recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting me, and calling me by my name. At firſt indeed her queſtions were irregular and wild; but in a ſhort time ſhe grew ſo diſtinct, as to thank me for having complied with the requeſt of her letter;
<q>'tis an office of unmerited kindneſs, which, ſaid ſhe, (and I could obſerve her let fall a tear) will be the laſt your unwearied friendſhip for me will have to beſtow.</q>
I anſwered, that I hoped not.
<q>Ah! Mrs. Wiſtanly, ſhe replied, can you hope ſo? you are not my friend, if you do.</q>
I wiſhed to avoid a ſubject which her mind was little able to bear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made no other return than by kiſſing her hand, which ſhe had ſtretched out to me as ſhe ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>At that moment we heard ſome unuſual ſtir below ſtairs, and, as the floor was thin and ill ſaid, the word <hi>child</hi> was very diſtinctly audible from every tongue. Upon this ſhe ſtarted up in her bed, and with a look piteous and wild beyond deſcription, exclaimed "Oh! my God! what of my child?"—She had ſcarcely uttered the words, when the landlady entered the room, and ſhowed ſufficiently by her countenance that ſhe had ſome dreadful tale to tell.</p>
                     <p>By ſigns I begged her to be ſilent.—
<q>What is become of my infant?</q>
cried Harriet.—
<q>No ill, madam, (anſwered the woman, faltering) is come to it, I hope.</q>
—
<q>Speak, ſaid ſhe, I charge you, for I will know the worſt: ſpeak, as you would give peace to my departing ſoul!</q>
ſpringing out of bed, and graſping the woman's hands with all her force.—It was not eaſy to reſiſt ſo ſolemn a charge.—
<q>Alas! ſaid the landlady, I fear ſhe is drowned; for the nurſe's cloak and the child's wrapper have been found in ſome ooze which the river had carried down below the ford.</q>
—She let go the woman's hands, and wringing her own together, threw up her eyes to heaven till their ſight was loſt in the ſockets.—We were ſupporting her, each of us holding one of her arms. —She fell on her knees between us, and dropping her hands for a moment, then raiſing them again, uttered with a voice that ſounded hollow as if ſunk within her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018007_0092_0FA45581CDB99490"/>
                        <q>Power omnipotent! who wilt not lay on thy creature cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity beyond their ſtrength to bear! if thou haſt not yet puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me enough, continue to pour out the phials of thy wrath upon me, and enable me to ſupport what thou inflicteſt! But if my faults are expiated, ſuffer me to reſt in peace, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly blot out the offences which thy judgments have puniſhed here!</q>
—She continued in the ſame poſture for a few moments; then leaning on us as if ſhe meant to riſe, bent her head forward; and drawing her breath ſtrongly, expired in our arms."</p>
                     <p>Such was the concluſion of Mrs. Wiſtanly's tale of woe!</p>
                     <p>Spirits of gentleneſs and peace! who look, with ſuch pity as angels feel, on the diſtreſſes of mortality! often have ye ſeen me labouring under the afflictions which providence had laid upon me.—Ye have ſeen me in a ſtrange land, without friend, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comforter, poor, ſick, and naked; ye have ſeen me ſhivering over the laſt faggot which my laſt farthing had purchaſed, moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cruſt that ſupported nature with the tears which her miſeries ſhed on it! yet have ye ſeen me look inward with a ſmile, and overcome them.—If ſuch ſhall ever be my lot again, ſo let me alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate its ſorrows; let me creep to my bed of ſtraw in peace, after bleſſing God that I am a Man of the World.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION, TO THE THIRD VOLUME, OF THE MAN OF THE WORLD.</head>
                  <p>I WAS born to a life of wandering, yet my heart was ever at home! though the country that gave me birth gave me but few friends, and of thoſe few the greateſt part were early loſt, yet the remembrance of her was preſent with me in every clime to which my fate conducted me; and the idea of thoſe, whoſe aſhes repoſed in that humble ſpot, where they had often been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of my infant ſports, hallowed it in my imagination with a ſort of ſacred enthuſiaſm.</p>
                  <p>I had not been many weeks an inhabitant of my native village, after that viſit to the lady mentioned in the firſt volume, which procured me the information I have there laid before my readers, till I found myſelf once more obliged to quit it for a foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. My parting with Mrs. Witſtanly was more ſolemn and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than common ſouls will eaſily imagine it could have been, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an acquaintance accidental in its beginning, and ſhort in its duration; but there was ſomething tender and melancholy in the cauſe of it, which gave an impreſſion to our thoughts of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, more ſympathetic perhaps than what a ſeries of mutual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations could have effected.</p>
                  <p>Before we parted, I could not help aſking the reaſon of her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy with regard to the ſtory of Anneſly and his daughter. In anſwer to this ſhe informed me, that beſides the danger to which ſhe expoſed herſelf by ſetting up in oppoſition to a man, in the midſt of whoſe dependants ſhe propoſed ending her days, ſhe was doubtful if her ſtory would be of any ſervice to the memory of her friend: That Camplin (as ſhe ſuppoſed by the direction of ſir Thomas Sindall, who was at that time abroad) had univerſally given out, that Miſs Anneſly's elopement was with an intention to be married to him; on which footing, though a falſe one, the character of that young lady ſtood no worſe, than if the truth were
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018007_0094_0FA45583B84F8318"/>
divulged to thoſe, moſt of whom wanted diſcernment, as well as candor, to make the diſtinctions which ſhould enable them to do it juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Several years elapſed before I returned to that place, whence, it is probable, I ſhall migrate no more. My friend Mrs. Wiſtanly was one of the perſons after whom I firſt enquired on my arrival. I found her ſubject to the common debility, but not to any of the acuter diſtreſſes of age; with the ſame powers of reaſon, and the ſame complacency of temper, I had ſeen her before enjoy. "Theſe ſaid ſhe, are the effects of temperance without auſterity, and eaſe without indolence; I have nothing now to do but to live without the ſolicitude of life, and to die without the fear of dying."</p>
                  <p>At one of our firſt interviews, I found her accompanied by a young lady, who, beſides a great ſhare of what is univerſally allowed the name of beauty, had ſomething in her appearance which calls forth the eſteem of its beholders, without their pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to account for it. It has ſometimes deceived me, yet I am reſolved to truſt it to the laſt hour of my life; at that time I gave it unlimited confidence, and I had ſpoken the young lady's eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium before I had looked five minutes in her face.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wiſtanly repeated it to me after ſhe was gone. "That is one of my children, ſaid ſhe, for I adopt the children of virtue; and ſhe calls me her mother, becauſe I am old and ſhe can cheriſh me."—"I could have ſworn to her goodneſs, I replied, without any information beſides what her countenance afforded me." — "'Tis a lovely one, ſaid ſhe, and her mind is not flattered in its portrait: though ſhe is a member of a family with with whom I have not much intercouſe, yet ſhe is a frequent viſiter at my little dwelling; her name is Sindall."—"Sindall!" I exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, ſaid Mrs. Wiſtanly, but ſhe is not therefore the leſs amiable. Sir Thomas returned from abroad ſoon after you left this place; but for ſeveral years he did not reſide here, having made a purchaſe of another eſtate in a neighbouring county, and buſied himſelf, during that time, in ſuperintending the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
                  <p>When he returned hither, he brought this young lady, then a child, along with him, who, it ſeems, was left to his care by her father, a friend of ſir Thomas's, who died abroad; and ſhe has lived with his aunt, who keeps houſe for him, ever ſince that period.</p>
                  <p>The mention of ſir Thomas Sindall, naturally recalled to my mind the fate of the worthy, but unfortunate, Anneſly. Mrs. Wiſtanly told me, ſhe had often been anxious in her enquiries about his ſon William, the only remaining branch or her friend's family; but that neither ſhe, nor Mr. Rawlinſon, with whom ſhe had correſponded on the ſubject, had been able to procure any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of him; whence they concluded, that he had died in the plantation to which he was tranſported in purſuance of his miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ſentence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:018007_0095_0FA4558470168430"/>She farther informed me, "that Sindall had ſhown ſome marks of contrition at the tragical iſſue of the ſcheme he had carried on againſt the daughter's innocence and the father's peace; and to make ſome ſmall atonement to the dead for the injuries he had done to the living, had cauſed a monument to be erected over their graves, in the village church-yard, with an inſcription, ſetting forth the piety of Anneſly, and the virtues and beauty of Harriet. But whatever he might have felt at the time, continued ſhe, I fear the impreſſion was not laſting."</p>
                  <p>From the following chapters, containing ſome farther particulars of that gentleman's life, which my reſidence in his neighbourhood, and my acquaintance with ſome of the perſons immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them, gave me an opportunity of learning, my readers will judge if Mrs. Wiſtanly's concluſion was a juſt one.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. Some account of the perſons of whom ſir Thomas Sindall's family conſiſted.</head>
                     <p>THE baronet's family conſiſted, at this time, of his aunt, and the young lady mentioned in the Introduction, together with a couſin of his, of the name of Bolton, who was conſidered as preſumptive heir of the Sindall-eſtate, and whoſe education had been ſuperintended by ſir Thomas.</p>
                     <p>This young gentleman had lately returned from the univerſity, to which his kinſman had ſent him. The expectations of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance were, as is uſually the caſe, ſanguine in his favour; and, what is ſomething leſs uſual, they were not diſappointed. Beſide the ſtock of learning which his ſtudies had acquired him, he poſſeſſed an elegance of manner, and a winning ſoftneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, which a college-life does not often beſtow, but proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, from a cauſe the leaſt variable of any, a diſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctively benevolent, and an exquiſite ſenſibility of heart.</p>
                     <p>With all his virtues, however, he was a dependant on ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Sindall; and their exerciſe could only be indulged ſo far as his couſin gave them leave. Bolton's father who had married a daughter of the Sindall-family, had a conſiderable patrimony left him by a parent, who had acquired it in the ſure and common courſe of mercantile application.</p>
                     <p>With this, and the dowry he received with his wife, he might have lived up to the limits of his utmoſt wiſh, if he had confined his wiſhes to what are commonly conſidered the bleſſings of life; but, though he was not extravagant to ſpend, he was ruined by an avidity to gain.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, he was of that order of men, who are known by the name of projectors; and waſted the means of preſent enjoyment, in the purſuit of luxury to come. To himſelf indeed the loſs was but ſmall; while his ſubſtance was moldering away by degrees, its
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018007_0098_0FA45586ABFFFA20"/>
value was annihilated in his expectations of the future; and he died amidſt the horrors of a priſon, ſmiling at the proſpect of ideal wealth, and viſionary grandeur.</p>
                     <p>But with his family it was otherwiſe: his wife, who had often vainly endeavoured to prevent, by her advice, the deſtructive ſchemes of her huſband, at laſt tamely yielded to her fate, and died ſoon after him of a broken heart, leaving an only ſon, the Bolton who is now introduced into my ſtory.</p>
                     <p>The diſtreſſes of his father had been always ridiculed by ſir Thomas Sindall, as proceeding from a degree of whim and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which it would have been a weakneſs to pity; his aunt, Mrs. Selwyn, joined in the ſentiment; perhaps it was really her own; but at any rate ſhe was apt to agree in opinion with her nephew ſir Thomas, and never had much regard for her ſiſter Bolton, for ſome reaſons no leſs juſt than common: in the firſt place her ſiſter was handſomer than ſhe; ſecondly, ſhe was ſooner married; and thirdly, ſhe had been bleſt with this promiſing boy, while Mrs. Selwyn became a widow, without having had a child. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared then but little proſpect of protection to poor Bolton from this quarter; but, as he had no other relation in any degree of propinquity, a regard to decency prompted the baronet to admit the boy into his houſe.</p>
                     <p>His ſituation indeed was none of the moſt agreeable; but the happy diſpoſitions which nature had given him, ſuited themſelves to the harſhneſs of his fortune; and in whatever ſociety he was placed, he found himſelf ſurrounded with friends: there was not a ſervant in the houſe, who would not riſk the diſpleaſure of their maſter or Mrs. Selwyn, to do ſome forbidden act of kindneſs to their little favourite Harry Bolton.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas himſelf, from ſome concurring accidents, had his notice attracted by the good qualities of the boy; his indifference was conquered by degrees, and at laſt he began to take upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the charge of rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing him to manhood. There wanted only this to fix his attachment: benefits to thoſe, whom we ſet apart for our own management and aſſiſtance, have ſomething ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in their nature, that there is ſcarce a ſelfiſh paſſion which their exerciſe does not gratify. Yet I mean not to rob Sindall of the honour of his beneficence; it ſhall no more want my praiſe, than it did the gratitude of Bolton.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. Some farther particulars of the perſons mentioned in the foregoing chapter.</head>
                     <p>BOLTON, however, felt that uneaſineſs which will ever preſs upon an ingenuous mind along with the idea of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance: he had therefore frequently hinted, though in terms of the utmoſt modeſty, a deſire to be put into ſome way of life, that might give him an opportunity of launching forth into the world, and freeing his couſin from the incumbrance of a uſeleſs idler in his family.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas had often made promiſes of indulging ſo laudable a deſire; but day after day elapſed without his putting any of them in execution: the truth was, that he had contracted a ſort of pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affection for Bolton, and found it a difficult matter to bring himſelf to the reſolution of parting with him.</p>
                     <p>He contented himſelf with employing the young man's genius and activity in the direction and ſuperintendance of his country-affairs; he conſulted him on plans for improving his eſtate, and entruſted him with the care of their execution: he aſſociated him with himſelf in matters of difficult diſcuſſion as a magiſtrate; and, in the ſports of the field, he was his conſtant companion.</p>
                     <p>It was a long time before Mrs. Selwyn, from ſome of the reaſons I have hinted, could look on Harry with a favourable eye. When ſir Thomas firſt began to take notice of him, ſhe remonſtrated the danger of ſpoiling boys by indulgence, and endeavoured to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalance the eſtimation of his good qualities, by the recital of little tales which ſhe now and then picked up againſt him.</p>
                     <p>It was not till ſome time after his return from the univerſity, that Harry began to gain ground in the lady's eſteem. That at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment and deference to the ſofter ſex, which, at a certain age, is habitual to ours, is reckoned effeminacy amongſt boys, and fixes a ſtain upon their manhood. Before he went to the univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Harry was under this predicament; but, by the time of his return, he had attained the period of refinement, and ſhowed his aunt all thoſe trifling civilities, which it is the prerogative of the ladies to receive, and which Mrs. Selwyn was often more ready to demand than ſome males of her acquaintance were to pay.</p>
                     <p>In truth, it required a knowlege of many feminine qualities, which this lady doubtleſs poſſeſſed, to impreſs the mind with an idea of that courteſy which is due to the ſex; for her countenance was not expreſſive of much ſoftneſs, the natural ſtrength of her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being commonly heightened by the aſſiſtance of ſnuff, and her converſation generally turning on points of controverſy in religion and philoſophy, which, requiring an intenſe exertion of thought, are therefore, I preſume, from the practice of the fair in general, no way favourable to the preſervation or the improvement of beauty.</p>

                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018007_0100_0FA4558840A709B8"/>It was, perhaps, from this very inclination for inveſtigating truth, that Bolton drew an advantage in his approaches towards her eſteem. As he was juſt returned from the ſeat of learning, where diſcuſſions of that fort are common, ſhe naturally applied to him for aſſiſtance in her reſearches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by aſſiſtance, I mean oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it being the quality of that deſire after knowlege with which this lady was endued, to delight in nothing ſo much, as in having its own doctrines confronted with oppoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bour one another without mercy; the conteſt having one advantage peculiar to battles of this kind, that each party, far from being weakened by its exertion, commonly appears to have gained ſtrength, as well as honour, from the rencounter.</p>
                     <p>Bolton indeed did not poſſeſs quite ſo much of this quality as his antagoniſt: he could not, in common good-breeding, refuſe her challenge; but he often maintained the conflict in a manner rather daſtardly for a philoſopher. He gave, however, full audience to the lady's arguments; and if he ſometimes ſhowed an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to reply, ſhe conſidered it as a teſtimony of her power to ſilence. But ſhe was generous in her victories: whenever ſhe conceived them completely obtained, ſhe celebrated the proweſs of her adverſary, and allowed him all that wiſdom which retreats from the fortreſs it cannot defend.</p>
                     <p>There was, perhaps, another reaſon, as forcible as that of obliging Mrs. Selwyn, or attaining the recondite principles of philoſophy, which increaſed Bolton's willingneſs to indulge that lady in becoming a party to her diſquiſitions. There was a ſpectatreſs of the combat, whoſe company might have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at the expence of ſitting to hear Aquinas himſelf diſpute upon theology—Miſs Lucy Sindall. My readers have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, in the Introduction, with my prepoſſeſſion in her favour, and the character Mrs. Wiſtanly gave in juſtification of it. They were deceived by neither.</p>
                     <p>With remarkable quickneſs of parts, and the livelieſt temper, ſhe poſſeſſed all that tenderneſs which is the chief ornament of the female character; and, with a modeſty that ſeemed to ſhrink from obſervation, ſhe united an eaſe, and a dignity, that univerſally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it. Her vivacity only roſe to be amiable; no enemy could ever repeat her wit, and ſhe had no friend who did not boaſt of her good-humour.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould firſt have deſcribed her perſon; my readers will excuſe it; it is not of ſuch minds that I am moſt ſolicitous to obſerve the dw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Such was the attendant of Mrs. Selwyn, whoſe company the good lady particularly required at thoſe ſeaſons, when ſhe unveil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her knowlege in argument, or pointed her ſagacity to inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She would often employ Bolton and Miſs Lucy to read her certain ſelect paſſages of books, when a weakneſs in her own ſight made reading uneaſy to her; the ſubjects were rarely of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

kind, yet Harry never complained of their length. This ſhe attributed to his opinion of their uſefulneſs; Lucy called it good-nature; he thought ſo himſelf at firſt; but he ſoon began to diſcover that it proceeded from ſome different cauſe; for when Miſs Lucy was, by any accident, away, he read with very little complacency. He never ſuſpected it to be love; much leſs did Lucy: they owned each other for friends; and when Mrs. Selwyn uſed to call them children, Bolton would call Lucy ſiſter; yet he was often not diſpleaſed to remember, that ſhe was not his ſiſter indeed.</p>

                     <p>THE ſtate of the mind may be often diſguiſed, even from the owner, when he means to enquire into it; but a very trifle will throw it from its guard, and betray its ſituation, when a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal examination has failed to diſcover it.</p>
                     <p>Bolton would often catch himſelf ſighing when Miſs Sindall was abſent, and feel his cheeks glow at her approach; he wondered what it was that made him ſigh and bluſh.</p>
                     <p>He would ſometimes take ſolitary walks, without knowing why he wandered out alone: he found ſomething that pleaſed him, in the melancholy of lonely receſſes, and half-worn paths, and his day-dreams commonly ended in ſome idea of Miſs Sindall, though he meant nothing leſs than to think of ſuch an object.</p>
                     <p>He had ſtrayed in one of thoſe excurſions, about half a mile from the houſe, through a copſe at the corner of the park, which opened into a little green amp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itheatre, in the middle of which was a pool of water, formed by a rivulet that crept through the matted graſs, till it fell into this baſon by a gentle caſcade.</p>
                     <p>The ſun was gleaming through the trees, which were pictured on the ſurface of the pool beneath; and the ſilence of the ſcene was only interrupted by the murmurs of the water fall, ſometimes accompanied by the querulous note of the wood pigeons, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the neighbouring copſe.</p>
                     <p>Bolton ſeated himſelf on the bank, and liſtened to their dirge. It ceaſed; for he had diſturbed the ſacred, ſolitary haunt. "I will give you ſome muſic in return," ſaid he, and drew from his pocket a ſmall-piped flute, which he frequently carried with him in his evening-walks, and ſerenaded the lonely ſhepherd returning from his fold.</p>
                     <p>He played a little plaintive air, which himſelf had compoſed; he thought he had played it by chance; but Miſs Sindall had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it the day before: the recollection of Miſs Sindall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the ſound, and he had drawn her portrait liſtening to its cloſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:018007_0102_0FA4558A6B42BCD0"/>She was indeed liſtening to its cloſe; for accident had pointed her walk in the very ſame direction with Bolton's. She was juſt coming out of the wood, when ſhe heard the ſoft notes of his flute; they had ſomething of fairy-muſic in them, that ſuited the ſcene, and ſhe was irreſiſtibly drawn nearer the place where he ſat, though ſome wayward feeling aroſe, and whiſpered, that ſhe ſhould not approach it. Her feet were approaching it whether ſhe would or no; and ſhe ſtood cloſe by his ſide, while the laſt cadence was melting from his pipe.</p>
                     <p>She repeated it after him with her voice. "Miſs Sindall!" cried he, ſtarting up with ſome emotion. "I know, ſaid ſhe, you will be ſurpriſed to find me here; but I was enchanted hither by the ſound of your flute. Pray touch that little melancholy tune again." He began, but he played very ill. "You blow it, ſaid ſhe, not ſo ſweetly as before; let me try what tone I can give it."—She put it to her mouth, but ſhe wanted the ſkill to give it voice. —"There cannot be much art in it," —ſhe tried it again —"and yet it will not ſpeak at my bidding."—She looked ſtedfaſtly on the flute, holding her fingers on the ſtops; her lips were red from the preſſure, and her figure altogether ſo paſtoral and innocent, that, I do not believe, the kiſſes, with which the poets make Diana greet her ſiſter hun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>reſſes, were ever more chaſte than that, which Bolton now ſtole from her by ſurprize.</p>
                     <p>Her cheeks were crimſon at this little violence of Harry's. "What do you mean, Mr. Bolton?" ſaid ſhe, dropping the flute to the ground. "'Twas a forfeiture," he replied, ſtammering, and bluſhing exceſſively, "for attempting to blow my flute."— "I don't underſtand you," anſwered Lucy, and turned towards the houſe, with ſome marks of reſentment on her countenance. Bolton was for ſome time rivetted to the ſpot; when he recovered the uſe of his feet, he ran after Miſs Sindall, and gently laying hold of her hand, "I cannot bear your anger, ſaid he, though I own, your diſpleaſure is juſt; but forgive, I intreat you, this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking offence of him, whoſe reſpect is equal to his love."—. "Your love, Mr. Bolton!"—"I cannot retract the word, though my heart has betrayed me from that prudence which might have ſtifled the declaration.</p>
                     <p>I have not language, Miſs Lucy, for the preſent feelings of my ſoul; till this moment I never knew how much I loved you, and never could I have expreſſed it ſo ill."—He pauſed—ſhe was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixedly on the ground, drawing her hand ſoftly from his, which refuſed involuntarily to quit its hold. —"May I not hope," ſaid he — "You have my pardon, Mr. Bolton" — "But" — "I beg you," ſaid Lucy, interrupting him, "to leave this ſubject; I know your merit, Mr. Bolton —my eſteem—you have thrown me into ſuch confuſion —nay, let go my hand."—"Pity then, and forgive me."—She ſighed—he preſſed her hand to his lips—ſhe bluſhed, —and bluſhed in ſuch a manner—They have never been in Bolton's ſituation, by whom that ſigh, and that bluſh, would not have been underſtood.</p>

                     <p>THERE was too much innocence in the breaſt of Lucy, to ſuffer it to be furniſhed with diſguiſe. I mean not to throw any imputation on that female delicacy, Which, as Milton expreſſes it,

                     <p>I believe Miſs Sindall to have been ſubject to neither; ſhe did not therefore aſſume the pride of indifference which ſhe did not feel, to the attachment of ſo much worth as Bolton's, and he had ſoon the happineſs to find, that his affection, which every day encreaſed, was not laviſhed without hope of a return.</p>
                     <p>But he did not ſeem to be ſo fortunate, meanwhile, in the eſtimation of every perſon in the family: ſir Thomas Sindall had not of late ſhown that cordiality towards Bolton, with which he had been wont to favour him. As Harry was inconſcious of any reaſon he could have given for it, this alteration in his couſin's behaviour was, for ſome time, altogether unnoticed by him: and, when at laſt, he was forced to obſerve it, he attributed it to no particular cauſe, but conſidered it as merely the effect of ſome accidental and temporary ſhagreen: nor did he altogether change his opinion, even when Lucy ſuggeſted to him her fears on the ſubject, and entreated him to recollect, if he had, in any reſpect, diſobliged his couſin, whoſe behaviour ſeemed to her to indicate ſome diſguſt conceived particularly againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, the baronet informed his family of his intention of changing their place of reſidence, for ſome time, from Sindall park, to his other eſtate, where, he ſaid, he found his preſence was become neceſſary; and at the ſame time communicated to Bolton his deſire, that he ſhould remain behind, to ſuperintend the execution of certain plans, which he had laid down with regard to the management of ſome country-buſineſs at the firſt-mentioned place.</p>
                     <p>Harry thought this ſufficiently warranted his expreſſing a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that his company had not, of late, been ſo agreeable to ſir Thomas, as it uſed to be, and begged to be informed in what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he had offended him. "Offended me! my dear boy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſir Thomas; never in the leaſt. — From what ſuch an idea could have ariſen, I know not; if from my leaving you here behind when we go to Bilſwood, it is the moſt miſtaken one in the world:

'tis but for a few months, till thoſe affairs I talked to you of are finiſhed; and I hope there to have opportunity of ſhowing, that, in your abſence, I ſhall be far from forgetting you."</p>
                     <p>During the time of their ſtay at Sindall-park, he behaved to Harry, in ſo courteous and obliging a manner, that his ſuſpicions were totally removed; and he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Love encreaſes the liſt of our dependencies; I mean it not as an argument againſt the paſſion; that ſex, I truſt, whoſe power it eſtabliſhes, will point its vaſſals, to no purſuit, but what is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
                     <p>Their farewell ſcene paſſed on that very ſpot, which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the laſt chapter, as witneſs to the declaration of Bolton's paſſion. Their farewell —but where the feelings ſay much, and the expreſſion little, deſcription will ſeldom ſucceed in the picture.</p>
                     <p>Their ſeparation, however, was alleviated by the hope that it was not likely to be of long continuance: ſir Thomas's declaration, of his intending that Harry ſhould follow them in a few months, was not forgotten; and the intermediate days were ſwallowed up, in the anticipation of the pleaſures, which that period ſhould produce.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, they took ſomething from the pain of abſence by a punctual correſpondence. Theſe letters I have ſeen: they deſcribe things little in themſelves; to Bolton and Lucy they were no trifles; but by others their importance would not be underſtood. One recital only I have ventured to extract for the peruſal of the reader; becauſe I obſerve, that it ſtrongly affected them, who, in this inſtance, were intereſted no more than any, to whom the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it addreſſes are known; and ſome of my readers, probably, have the advantage of not being altogether unacquainted with the perſons of whom it ſpeaks.</p>

                     <p>TO aſſume her ſemblance, is a tribute which vice muſt often pay to virtue. There are popular qualities which the world looks for, becauſe it is aware, that it may be ſometimes benefited by their exertion. Generoſity is an excellence, by the apparent poſſeſſion of which I have known many worthleſs characters buoy'd up from their infamy; though with them it was, indeed, but thoughtleſs profuſion; and, on the other hand, I have ſeen ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men marked out with a ſneer by the million, from a temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or reſervedneſs of diſpoſition, which ſhuns the glare of public
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018007_0105_0FA4558E43BD3AC8"/>
and the pleaſures of convivial life, and gives to modeſty and gentle manners the appearance of parſimony and meanneſs of ſpirit. The imputation of merit with mankind, Sindall knew to be a neceſſary appendage to his character; he was careful therefore to omit no opportunity of ſtepping forth to their notice as a man of gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</p>
                     <p>There was not a gentleman's ſervant in the county, who did not talk of the knight's munificence in the article of vails; and a park-keeper was thought a happy man, whom his maſter ſent with a hanch of veniſon to ſir Thomas. Once a year too he feaſted his tenants, and indeed the whole neigbourhood, on the large lawn in the front of his houſe, where the ſtrong beer ran caſcade-wiſe from the mouth of a leaden triton.</p>
                     <p>But there were objects of compaſſion, whoſe relief would not have figured in the eye of the public, on whom he was not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for beſtowing his liberality. The beggars, he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were perpetually ſtealing his fruit, and deſtroying his ſhrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: he therefore kept a wolf-dog to give them their anſwer at the gate; and ſome poor families in the village on his eſtate had been brought to beggary by proſecutions for poaching, an offence which every country-gentleman is bound, in honour, to puniſh with the utmoſt ſeverity of the law; and cannot therefore, without a breach of that honour, alleviate by a weak and ill judged exerciſe of benevolence.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Lucy, however, as ſhe could not ſo ſtrongly feel the offence, would ſometimes contribute to leſſen the rigor of its puniſhment, by making ſmall preſents to the wives and children of the delinquents. Paſſing, one evening, by the door of a cottage, where one of thoſe penſioners on her bounty lived, ſhe obſerved, ſtanding before it a very beautiful l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>p-dog, with a collar and bell, ornamented much beyond the trappings of any animal that could belong to the houſe.</p>
                     <p>From this circumſtance her curioſity was excited to enter, when ſhe was not a little ſurprized to find a young lady in a moſt elegant undreſs, ſitting on a joint-ſtool by the fire, with one of the children of the family on her lap. The ladies expreſſed mutual aſtoniſhment in their countenances at this meeting, when the good woman of the houſe running up to them, and claſping a hand of each in her's, "Bleſſings, ſaid ſhe, thouſands of bleſſings on you both! a lovelier couple, or a better, my eyes never looked on."—The infant clapped its hands as if inſtinctively.—"Dear heart! continued its mother, look, if my Tommy be not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you too! well may he clap his hands, if it had not been for your gracious ſelves, by this time his hands would have been cold clay! (mumbling his fingers in her mouth, and bathing his arms with her tears) when you ſtrictly forbad me to tell mortal of your favours, Oh! how I longed to to let each of you know, that there was another lady in the world as good as herſelf."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:018007_0106_0FA4558EECF212B0"/>The ſtranger had now recovered herſelf enough to tell Miſs Lucy, how much it delighted her to find, that a young lady, of her figure, did not diſdain to viſit affliction even amongſt the poor and the lowly. "That reflection, anſwered the other, applies more ſtrongly to the lady who makes it, than to her who is the occaſion of its being made.</p>
                     <p>I have not, madam, the honour of your acquaintance; but methinks, pardon my boldneſs, that I feel as if we were not ſtrangers; at leaſt, I am ſure that I ſhould reckon it a piece of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good fortune, if this interview could entitle me to call you ſtranger no longer." Their landlady cried and laughed by turns; and her two gueſts were ſo much pleaſed with this meeting that they appointed a renewal of it, at an hour ſomewhat earlier of the ſubſequent evening.</p>
                     <p>Lucy came a few minutes before the time of appointment; when ſhe learned that the ſtranger was the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman, whom a difference of diſpoſition from that of ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Sindall, ariſing at laſt to a particular coolneſs, had entirely eſtranged for many years from the baronet; and prevented all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between the families.</p>
                     <p>When this lady arrived, ſhe brought ſuch tidings along with her that I queſtion, if in all the ſumptuous abodes of wealth and grandeur, there was to be found ſo much ſincerity of joy, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ragged and moldering walls of the hovel, which ſhe graced with her preſence. She informed the grateful miſtreſs of it, that by her interceſſion with ſome juſtices of the peace, who made part of the judicature before whom the poor woman's huſband was brought, his puniſhment had been mitigated to a ſmall fine, which ſhe had undertaken to pay, and that he would very ſoon be on his way homewards.</p>
                     <p>The joy of the poor man's family at this intelligence was ſuch, as they could not, nor ſhall I, attempt to expreſs. His deliverance was indeed unexpected, becauſe his crime was great; no leſs than that of having ſet a gin in his garden, for ſome cats that uſed to prey on a ſingle brood of chickens, his only property; which gin had, one night, wickedly and maliciouſly, hanged a hare, which the baronet's game-keeper next morning diſcovered in it. His wife and little ones ſeemed only to be reſtrained by the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſence of their gueſts, from running out to meet a huſband and a father reſtored to them from captivity.</p>
                     <p>The ladies obſerving it, encouraged them in the deſign; and having received the good woman's benediction on her knees, they walked out together, and leaving the happy family on the road to the priſon, turned down a winding romantic walk, that followed the mazes of a rill, in an oppoſite direction.</p>
                     <p>Lucy, whoſe eyes had been fixed with reſpectful attention on her fair companion, ever ſince her arrival at the cottage, now dropped a tear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from each. "You will not wonder at theſe tears, madam, ſaid ſhe, when you know that they are my common ſign of joy and

"There is a blank at the bottom of

                     <p>They now heard the tread of feet approaching the place; Lucy was ſomewhat alarmed at the ſound; but her fears were removed, when ſhe diſcovered it to proceed from a venerable old man, who advancing towards them, accoſted Miſs Walton by her name, who, in her turn, pronounced the word Peter! in the tone of ſurprize. She ſtretched out her hand, which he claſped in his, and looked in her face with a certain piteous wiſtfulneſs, while a tear was ſwelling in his eye.</p>
                     <p>"My dear lady, ſaid he, I have travelled many a mile ſince I ſaw your ladyſhip laſt: by God's bleſſing I have ſucceeded very well in the buſineſs your ladyſhip helped me to ſet up; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome dealings with a tradeſman in London, I have been as far as that city and back again; and, ſaid I to myſelf, if I could venture on ſuch a journey for the ſake of gain, may I not take a ſhorter for the ſake of thanking my benefactreſs, and ſeeing my old friends in the country? and I had a ſort of yerning to be here, to remember good Mrs. Margery, and my dear young maſter.— God forgive me for weeping, for he was too good for this world!" —The tears of Miſs Walton and Lucy accompanied his.— "Alack-a-day! continued Peter, to think how things will come to paſs! that-there tree was planted by his own ſweet hand!— I remember it well, he was then but a boy; I ſtood behind him, holding the plants in my apron thus;—"Peter, ſaid he, as he took one to ſtick it in the ground, perhaps I ſhall not live to ſee this grow."—</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. A change in Bolton's Situation.</head>
                     <p>THE reader will pardon the digreſſion I have made; I would not, willingly, lead him out of his way except into ſome path, where his feelings may be expanded, and his heart improved.</p>
                     <p>He will remember, that I mentioned, in the fourth chapter, the expectation, which Bolton entertained, of ſeeing his Lucy at a period not very remote.</p>
                     <p>But that period was not deſtined to arrive ſo ſoon. When he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſir Thomas's commands, or rather his permiſſion, to viſit the family at Bilſwood, he received a letter from that gentleman, purporting, that he had at laſt been able, to put him in the way of attaining that independance he had ſo often wiſhed for, having juſt procured him a commiſſion in a regiment then ſtationed at Gibraltar; that though he, (ſir Thomas) as well as Mrs. Selwyn, and Lucy, was exceedingly deſirous to have an opportunity of bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him farewell, yet he had prevailed on himſelf to wave that pleaſure, from the conſideration of its inconvenience to Harry, as it was abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhould join his regiment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                     <p>He incloſed letters of introduction to ſeveral gentlemen of his acquaintance in London, remitted him drafts on that place, for a conſiderable ſum, to ſit him out for his intended expedition, and begged that he might loſe no time in repairing thither for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He ended with aſſuring him of the continuance of his friendſhip, which, he declared, no diſtance of time, or place, could alienate or impair.</p>
                     <p>The effect which this letter had upon Bolton, as he was then circumſtanced, my readers can eaſily imagine. There was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other accompanied it; a note from his Lucy: ſhe intended it for comfort, for it aſſumed the language of conſolation; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of her own ſpirits was viſible, amidſt the hopes with which ſhe meant to buoy up thoſe of Bolton.</p>
                     <p>With this letter for its text, did his imagination run over all the delights of the paſt, and compare them with the diſappointment of the preſent. Yet thoſe tender regrets which the better part of our nature feels have ſomething in them to blunt the edge of that pain they inflict, and confer on the votaries of ſorrow a ſenſation that borders on pleaſure. He viſited the walks which his Lucy had trod, the trees under which ſhe had ſat, the proſpects they had marked together, and he would not have exchanged his feelings for all that luxury could give, or feſtivity inſpire.</p>
                     <p>Nor did he part with the idea after the object was removed; but, even on the road to London, to which place he began his journey next morning, 'twas but pulling out his letter again,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018007_0110_0FA45592AFA480B0"/>
humming over that little melancholy air which his Lucy had praiſed, and the ſcene was preſent at once. It drew indeed a ſigh from his boſom, and an unmanly tear ſtood in his eye; yet the ſigh and a tear were ſuch, that it was impoſſible to wiſh it removed.</p>

                        <hi>WHEN</hi> Bolton reached the metropolis, he applied, without delay, to thoſe perſons for whom he had letters from ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Sindall, whoſe inſtructions the baronet had directed him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in that courſe of military duty which he had now enabled him to purſue.</p>

                     <p>The letters, he preſented, were read with a civil indifference, and produced the unmeaning profeſſions of ceremony and politeneſs.

                     <p>A plain honeſt tradeſman, to whom he happened to carry a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Mrs. Wiſtanly, was the only perſon who ſeemed to take an intereſt in his welfare.

                     <p>After ſome days of enquiry and ſolicitude, he learned, that it was not neceſſary for him to join his regiment ſo ſpeedily as ſir Thomas's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had induced him to believe.</p>
                     <p>Upon obtaining this information he immediately communicated it to the baronet, and ſignified at the ſame time, a deſire of improving that time, which this reſpite allowed him for his ſtay in England, in a viſit to the family at Bilſwood. But with this purpoſe his couſin's ideas did not at all coincide; he wrote Harry an anſwer, diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

entirely his intentions of leaving London, and laid down a plan for his improvement in military ſcience, which could only be followed in the metropolis. Here was another diſappointment; but Harry conſidered it his duty to obey.</p>
                     <p>What he felt, however, may be gathered from the following letter, which he wrote to Miſs Sindall, by the poſt ſucceeding that, which brought him the inſtructions of ſir Thomas.</p>

                           <p>As I found, ſoon after my arrival here, that the neceſſity of joining my regiment immediately was ſuperſeded, I hoped, by this time, to have informed my deareſt Lucy, of my intended departure from London, to be once more reſtored to her and the country."</p>

                     <p>BOLTON had a diſpoſition towards ſociety, that did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him an indifference about any thing of human form with whom he could have an opportunity of intercourſe.

                     <p>He had not long poſſeſſed his lodgings in town, till he cultivated an acquaintance with his landlord and landlady; the latter he found to be the repreſentative of the family, from a power of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity very much ſuperior to her huſband, who ſeemed to be wonderfully pleaſed with his wife's converſation, and very happy under what might, not improperly, be termed her government. To Mrs. Terwitt, therefore, (for that was the lady's name) did Bolton addreſs his approaches towards an acquaintance, and from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018007_0112_0FA4559450782FC0"/>
her he had the good fortune to find them meet with a favourable reception: they were ſo intimate the ſecond week of his reſidence in the houſe, that ſhe told him the beſt part of the tranſactions of her life; and conſulted him upon the diſpoſal of her eldeſt daughter in marriage, whom a young tradeſman, ſhe ſaid, had been in ſuit of ever ſince the Eaſter-holidays preceding.</p>
                     <p>"We can give her, added ſhe, ſomething handſome enough for a portion; and the old gentleman above ſtairs has promiſed her a preſent of a hundred pounds on her wedding day, provided ſhe marries to pleaſe him."</p>
                     <p>"The gentleman above ſtairs! ſaid Bolton; how have I been ſo unlucky as never to have heard of him before?" "He is not at preſent in town,', replied the landlady, "having gone about a fortnight ago to Bath, whence he is not yet returned. Indeed, I fear, his health requires ſome ſtay at that place, for he has been but poorly of late; heaven preſerve his life! for he is a good friend of ours, and of many one's elſe who ſtand in need of his friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>He has an eſtate, ſir, of a thouſand pounds a year, and money beſides, as I have been told; yet he chuſes to live private, as you will ſee; and ſpends, I believe, the moſt of his income in charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able actions."</p>
                     <p>"I did indeed, ſaid Harry, obſerve a young man come to the door this morning at an early hour, and I heard him aſk if the gentleman was returned; but I did not then know that he meant any perſon who lodged here." "Ay, ſure enough he meant Mr. Rawlinſon, ſaid Mrs. Terwitt, and I wiſh he may not feel his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence much; for he has called here frequently of late, and, the laſt time, when he was told of his not being yet returned, Betty obſerved that the tears guſhed from his eyes." "When he calls again, ſaid Bolton, I beg that I may be informed of it."</p>
                     <p>Next morning he heard ſomebody knock at the door, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time he had ſeen the young man approach it the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day: upon going to the window, he obſerved the ſame ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but his dreſs was different; he had no coat to cover a thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Bolton let the maid know, that he was aware of his being at the door, and reſumed his own ſtation at the window. The youth repeated his enquiries after Mr. Rawlinſon, and, upon receiving the ſame anſwer, caſt up to heaven a look of reſignation, and retired.</p>
                     <p>Bolton ſlipped down ſtairs, and followed him; his lodgings were ſituated near Queen-Square: the lad took the country-road, and went on without ſtopping till he reached Pancras-church-yard. He ſtood ſeemingly entranced, over a new covered grave at one and of it. Harry placed himſelf under cover of a tomb hard by, where he could mark him unperceived.</p>
                     <p>He held his hands claſped in one another, and the tears began to trickle down his cheeks. Bolton ſtole from out his hiding-place,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018007_0113_0FA45594F5DAA2E8"/>
and approached towards the ſpot. The poor lad began to ſpeak, as if addreſſing himſelf to the dead beneath. "Thou canſt not feel their cruelty; nor ſhall the winds of winter chill thee, as they do thy wretched ſon; — Inhuman miſcreants! but theſe ſhall cover thee"—He threw himſelf on the ground, and ſpread his arms over the grave, on which he wept.</p>
                     <p>Bolton ſtooped down to raiſe him from the earth; he turned, and gazed on him, with a look wildered and piteous, "Pardon a ſtranger, young man, ſaid Bolton, who cannot but be intereſted in your ſorrow; he is not entitled to aſk its cauſe, yet his heart ſwells with the hope of removing it." — "May heaven requite you, replied the ſtranger, for your pity to a poor orphan! Oh! ſir, I have not been uſed to beg, and even to receive charity is hard upon me; did I mean to move compaſſion, I have a ſtory to tell.—You weep already, ſir! hear me, and judge if I deſerve your tears."</p>
                     <p>"Here lies my father, the only relation whom misfortune had left to own me; but heaven had ſent us a friend in that beſt of men, Mr. Rawlinſon. He came accidentally to the knowlege of our ſufferings, and took on himſelf the charge of relieving them, which the cruelty of our own connexions had abandoned; but alas! when, by his aſſiſtance, my father was put into a way of earning his bread, he was ſeized with that illneſs of which he died. Some ſmall debts, which his ſhort time in buſineſs had not yet allowed him to diſcharge, were put in ſuit againſt him by his creditors. His ſickneſs, and death, which happened a few days ago, did but haſten their proceedings; they ſeized, ſir, the very covering of that bed on which his body was laid. Mr. Rawlinſon was out of town, and I fancy he never received thoſe letters I wrote him to Bath.</p>
                     <p>"I had no one from whom to expect relief; every thing but theſe rags on my back, I ſold to bury the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He covered the duſt of the father, and clothed the nakedneſs of the ſon; and, having placed him where it was in his power to make future enquiries after his ſituation, left him to bleſs Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the aid it had ſent, without knowing the hand through which its bounty had flowed. That hand, indeed, the grateful youth preſſed to his lips at parting, and begged earneſtly to know the name of his benefactor. "I am a friend, ſaid Bolton, of Mr. Rawlinſon, and humanity."</p>

                     <p>It was now near midnight, and the hum of Betty's ſpinning-wheel, which had frequently intermitted before, became entirely ſilent, when Bolton was alarmed with a very loud knocking of the watchman at the door, and preſently a confuſed aſſemblage of voices crying out, Fire! Fire! echoed from one end of the ſtreet to the other. Upon opening his window, he diſcovered too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reaſon of the alarm; the flames were already appearing at the windows of the ground-floor, to which they had probably been communicated by the candle, which the maid had burning by her in the kitchen below.</p>
                     <p>She had now at laſt awaked, and was running about before the door of the houſe, wringing her hands, and ſpeaking incoherently to the few who were aſſembled by the outcry, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection enough to endeavour to ſave any thing belonging to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or her maſter.</p>
                     <p>Bolton, who had more the poſſeſſion of his faculties, entreating the aſſiſtance of ſome watchmen, whom the occaſion had drawn together, made ſhift to convey into the ſtreet, a few things which he took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She continued, however, her broken exclamations of horror and deſpair, till, at laſt, ſtarting as it were into the remembrance of ſomething forgot, ſhe cried out vehemently, "Oh! my God! where is Mr. Rawlinſon?"</p>
                     <p>Bolton caught the horrid meaning of her queſtion, and puſhing through the flames, which had now taken hold of the ſtaircaſe, forced his way into the bed-chamber occupied by the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had returned from the country that very evening, and, being fatigued with his journey, had gone to bed before his fellow lodger's arrival at home.</p>
                     <p>He had not waked till the room under that where he lay was in a blaze, and, on attempting to riſe, was ſtifled with the ſmoke that pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The latter preſently recollected his ſituation, and aſking Harry, if it was poſſible to get down ſtairs, heard him anſwer in the negative with remarkable compoſure. "As for me, ſaid he, I ſhall loſe but few of my days; but I fear, ſir, your generous concern for a ſtranger, has endangered a life much more valuable than mine: let me beg of you to endeavour to ſave yourſelf, which your ſtrength and agility may enable you to do, without regarding a poor, worn-out, old man, who would only encumber you in the attempt." Bolton, with a ſolemn earneſtneſs, declared, that no conſideration ſhould tempt him to ſuch a deſertion.</p>
                     <p>He had, before this, vainly endeavoured to procure a ladder, or ſome other aſſiſtance, from the people below; the confuſion of the ſcene prevented their affording it: he conſidered, therefore, if he could not furniſh ſome expedient from within, and having untied the cordage of a bed, which ſtood in the room, he found it would make a ſufficient length of rope to reach within a few feet of the ground.</p>
                     <p>This he faſtened round Mr. Rawlinſon's waiſt, in ſuch a way, that his arms ſhould ſupport part of the weight of his body, and ſliding it over the edge of the window, ſo as to cauſe ſomewhat more reſiſtance in the deſcent, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He conveyed Mr. Rawlinſon to other lodgings hard by, which then happened to be vacant; and having got him accommodated with ſome cloaths belonging to the landlord, he returned to ſee what progreſs the fire had been making, when he found, that, happily, from a piece of waſte ground's lying between the houſe where it broke out, and the other to the leeward, it was got ſo much under, as to be in no danger of ſpreading any farther.</p>
                     <p>Upon going back to Mr. Rawlinſon, he found him ſitting in the midſt of the family with whom he had lodged, miniſtring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to their diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>CHAP X. Effects of his accquaintance with Mr. Rawlinſon.</head>
                     <p>SUCH was Bolton's introduction to Mr. Rawlinſon's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and from the circumſtances of its commencement, my readers will eaſily believe, that neither party could be indifferent to its continuation. Rawlinſon ſaw his own virtues warm and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the boſom of his young friend; while Harry contemplated, with equal delight, that ſerenity which their recollection beſtowed on the declining age of Rawlinſon.</p>
                     <p>In one of his viſits to the old gentleman, ſome time after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident related in the foregoing chapter, he found with him that very youth, whoſe ſorrow, over the grave of his father, he had ſo lately been the means of alleviating. The young man was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the midſt of their recital as Bolton entered the room, and had juſt mentioned, with regret, his ignorance of his benefactor, when the door opened and diſcovered him.</p>
                     <p>Bolton could not help bluſhing at the diſcovery; the other ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his ſeat, exclaimed, "it is he, it is himſelf," threw himſelf on his knees before Harry, with tears in his eyes, and poured out ſome broken expreſſions of the warmeſt gratitude. "It was you then, ſaid Mr. Rawlinſon, who were the comforter of my poor boy, who covered the grave of his unfortunate father! I will not thank you, for Jack is doing it better with his tears; but I will thank heaven, that there are ſome ſuch men to preſerve my veneration for the ſpecies."</p>
                     <p>"I truſt, my dear ſir, ſaid Bolton, that there are many to whom ſuch actions are habitual."—"You are a young man, interrupted the other, and it is fit you ſhould believe ſo; I will believe ſo too, for I have ſometimes known what it is to enjoy them. —Go, my boy, turning to the lad, and wiſh for the luxury of doing good; remember Mr. Bolton, and be not forgetful of Providence."</p>
                     <p>"The father of that young man, ſaid Mr. Rawlinſon, when he was gone, was a ſchool-fellow of mine here in town, and one of the worthieſt creatures in the world; but from a milkineſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, without the direction of prudence, or the guard of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, he ſuffered himſelf to become a dupe to the artifices of ſome deſigning men; and when, ſome time ago. I diſcovered his place of abode in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o obſcure village in the country, I found him ſtripped
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018007_0117_0FA4559A919AD218"/>
of his patrimony, and burthened with the charge of that boy, who has juſt now left us, whoſe mother, it ſeems, had died when he was a child.</p>
                     <p>"Yet, amidſt the diſtreſſes of his poverty, I found that eaſineſs of temper, which had contributed to bring them on, had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him; he met me with a ſmile of ſatisfaction, and talked of the cruel indifference of ſome wealthy relations, without the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of anger, or the acrimony of diſappointment. He ſeemed, indeed, to feel for his child; but comforted himſelf at the ſame time with the reflexion; that he had bred him to expect adverſity with compoſure, and to ſuffer poverty with contentment. He died, poor man, when I had put him in a way of living with ſome comfort; nor had I even an opportunity of doing the common offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of friendſhip to his laſt moments, my health having obliged me to go down to Bath, whence I had removed to Briſtol, and did not receive any accounts of his illneſs till my return to London. I am in your debt, Mr. Bolton, for ſome ſupplies to his ſon; let me know what thoſe were, that we may clear the account."</p>
                     <p>Bolton replied, that he hoped Mr. Rawlinſon could not wiſh to deprive him of the pleaſure he felt from the reflexion of having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſo much filial piety in diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>"It ſhall be in your own way, ſaid the old gentleman; I am not ſuch a niggard as to grudge you the opportunity; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but regret my abſence, when I ſhould have cloſed the eyes of poor Jennings. He was the laſt of thoſe companions of my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whoſe hiſtory in life I had occaſion to be acquainted with; the reſt, Mr. Bolton, had already fallen around me, and I am now left within a little of the grave, without a friend (except one, whom accident has acquired me in you) to ſmooth the path that leads to it; but that is ſhort, and therefore it matters not much. At my age, nature herſelf may be expected to decline; but a lingering illneſs is ſhortening her date.</p>
                     <p>"I would do therefore what good I can, in the ſpace that is left me, and look forward, if I may be allowed, to make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the ſervice of futurity. Here are two papers, ſir, which, on mature deliberation, I have judged it proper to commit to your cuſtody; that in the parchment cover, which is not labelled, my death alone will authorize you to open; the other, marked "Truſt-deed by Mr. Anneſly," I can explain to you now.</p>
                     <p>That man, Mr. Bolton, who is now a ſaint in heaven, was prepared for it by the ſevereſt calamities on earth: the guilt, and misfortunes of two darling children, cut ſhort the remnant of a life, whoſe buſineſs it was to guide, and whoſe pleaſure to behold them in the paths of virtue and of happineſs. At the time of his death they were both alive; one, alas! did not long ſurvive her father; what has become of her brother, I have never been able to learn; but this truſt, put into my hands in their behalf, may ſtill be of importance to him or his, and to you therefore I make it over for that purpoſe; for though, by Mr. Anneſly's ſettlement, the ſubject

of the truſt accrues to me on the failure of his own iſſue, yet would I never conſider it as mine, while the ſmalleſt chance remained of his ſon, or the deſcendant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Bolton, while he promiſed an execution of this truſt worthy of the confidence repoſed in him, could not help expreſſing his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize at Mr. Rawlinſon's choice of him for that purpoſe. "I do not wonder, replied the other, that you ſhould think thus, for thus has cuſtom taught us to think; I have told you how friendleſs and unconnected I am; but while we trace the relatives of birth and kindred, ſhall we allow nothing to the ties of the heart, or the ſympathy of virtue."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. A remarkable event in the hiſtory of Bolton.—His behaviour in conſequence of it.</head>
                     <p>THE proviſions which Mr. Rawlinſon had made, for an event of which he had accuſtomed himſelf to think with compoſure, were but too predictive of its arrival. That worthy man lived not many weeks after the convention with Bolton, which I have juſt recorded.</p>
                     <p>Bolton was affected with the moſt lively ſorrow for his death. This friendſhip, though but lately acquired, had ſomething uncommonly ardent in its attachment, and liberal in its confidence. Harry, who had returned it in the moſt unreſerved manner, felt the want both of that kindneſs which ſoothed, and that wiſdom which inſtructed him.</p>
                     <p>Upon opening the ſealed paper which had been formerly put into his hands by Mr. Rawlinſon, it was ſound to be that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's will, deviſing his whole eſtate. real and perſonal, to Mr. Bolton. The reaſon given for this, in the body of the paper itſelf, was expreſſed in the following words:
<q>Becauſe I know no man who has deſerved more of myſelf; none who will deſerve more of mankind, in the diſpoſal of what I have thus bequeathed him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Bolton was fully ſenſible of af the force of this recommendation to the exerciſe of a virtue which he had always poſſeſſed, and had only wanted power to practiſe. He acted as the almoner of Mr. Rawlinſon, and juſtified his friend's method of benefaction, (for ſo this diſpoſal of his affairs might be called) by joining with the inclination to do good, that choice of object and that attention to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018007_0119_0FA4559C873440E8"/>
propriety, which dignifies the purpoſe, and doubles the uſe of beneſicence. Having ſettled accounts of this kind in town, (amongſt which thoſe of young Jennings and the Terwitt-family were not forgotten) he ſet out for that eſtate which had now devolved to him by the will of Mr. Rawlinſon, With what ideas he made this viſit, and in what manner he expreſſed them on his arrival, I ſhall allow his own words to deſcribe, in the following letter to Miſs Sindall.</p>

                              <hi>After the death of Mr. Rawlinſon, the friend of mankind as of your Harry, there were ſome offices of duty which the ſucceſſor of ſuch a man was peculiarly bound to perform. Though I could diſcover no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his but one, (whoſe fortune, as it had formerly taught him to overlook his kinſman, ſtood not now in need of that kinſman's acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legement) yet there were numbers whom humanity had allied to him. Their claim of affinity was now upon me, and their proviſion a debt which I was called upon to diſcharge: this kept me ſome time in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I have another family here, whom it was alſo neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; I have been among them a week, and we have not been unhappy.</hi>

                              <hi>When I looked into the conveyances of this eſtate, I found it had been once before transferred, in a manner not very common in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of modern property. Its owner immediately preceding Mr. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon, was a friend and companion of his, who had gone out to India ſome years later than he, and, by his aſſiſtance, had been put in the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap> of acquiring a very large fortune. The greateſt part of this he reminded to his former benefactor in England, to be laid out on ſome purchaſe near the place of his nativity, which it ſeems was a village but a few miles diſtant from Wilbrook. This eſtate was then in the poſſeſſion of a gentleman, whoſe London expences had ſquandered the ſavings of four or five generations, and, after having exhauſted every other reſource, he was obliged to ſell this inheritance of his family. Mr. Rawlinſon gave him the price he aſked, and made a preſent of a conſiderable ſum beſides to a very deſerving woman who had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be the wife of this ſpendthrift. His friend ratified the bargain with thanks; but he lived not to enjoy his purchaſe.</hi>

                           <p>The new proprietor took a ſingular method of improving i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s value. He lowered the rents, which had been raiſed to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant height, and recalled the ancient tenants of the manor, moſt of whom had been driven from the unfriendly foil, to make room for deſperate adventurers, who undertook for rents they could never be able to pay.—To ſuch a man was I to ſucceed, and I was conſcious how much was required of his ſucceſſor. The third day after my arrival, I gave a general invitation to my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and their families to dine with me.</p>
                           <p>The hall was trimmed for their reception, and ſome large an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique pieces of plate, with which Mr. Rawlinſon had furniſhed his cupboard, were ranged on the large table at the end of it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors ſtood a caſk of excellent ſtrong beer for any one of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior quality who choſe to drink of it, diſpenſed by an old, but jolly-looking ſervant, whoſe face was the ſignal of welcome.</p>
                           <p>I received my gueſts as friends and acquaintance; aſked the names of their children, and praiſed the blufneſs of the boys, and the beauty of the girls. I placed one of the moſt matronly wives in the wicker-chair at the head of the table; and, occupying the loweſt place myſelf, ſtationed the reſt of the company according to their age on either ſide.</p>
                           <p>The dinner had all the appearance of plainneſs and of plenty: amongſt other diſhes four large pieces of roaſt beef were placed at uniform diſtances, and a plum pudding of a very uncommon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference was raiſed conſpicuous in the middle. I preſſed the baſhful among the girls, commended the frankneſs of their fathers, and pledged the jollieſt of the ſet in repeated draughts of ſtrong-beer.</p>
                           <p>But, though this had the deſired effect with ſome, I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the countenances of others evident marks of diſtruſt and apprehenſion. The cloth therefore was no ſooner removed, and the grace-cup drank, then I roſe up in my place, and addreſſed my gueſts to the following purpoſe:</p>

It is cuſtomary, I believe, on ſuch occaſions, for the tenant to pay a certain fine or premium to the landlord: I too, my friends, will expect one; you and your families ſhall pay it me —be induſtrious, be virtuous, be happy.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. A change in the family of ſir Thomas Sindall.— Some account of a perſon whom that event introduces to Miſs Lucy's acquaintance.</head>
                     <p>THE anſwer which Bolton received to the foregoing letter, contained a piece of intelligence material to the ſituation of Miſs Sindall; it conveyed to him an account of the death of Mrs. Selwyn.</p>
                     <p>Though that lady was not poſſeſſed of many amiable or engaging qualities, yet Lucy, to whom ſhe had always ſhown as much kindneſs as her nature allowed her to beſtow on any one, felt a very lively ſorrow for her death, even excluſive of the immediate conſequences which herſelf was to expect from that event.</p>
                     <p>Theſe indeed were apparently momentous. Mrs. Selwyn had been her guardian and protectreſs from her infancy; and though ſir Thomas Sindall had ever behaved to her like a father, yet there was a feeling in the boſom of Lucy, that revolted againſt the idea of continuing in his houſe after his aunt's deceaſe. By that lady's will ſhe was entitled to a legacy of ſix hundred pounds; by means of this ſum ſhe had formed a ſcheme, which, though it would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>educe her to a ſtate very different from the eaſe and affluence of her former circumſtances, might yet ſecure her from the irkſomeneſs of dependance, or the accuſation of impropriety; this was, to appropriate two thirds of the intereſt of her capital to the payment of an annual ſum for her board with Mrs. Wiſtanly.</p>
                     <p>It was now that Bolton felt the advantage of independance from the hopes of being uſeful to Lucy; but he had her delicacy to overcome: ſhe would not throw herſelf, at this moment of neceſſity, into the arms of a man whom fortune had now placed above her. She adhered to her firſt reſolution.</p>
                     <p>But the kindneſs of ſir Thomas Sindall rendered it unneceſſary; for, a ſhort time after Mrs. Selwyn's death, when Miſs Sindall communicated to him her intention of leaving his houſe, he addreſſed her in the following terms: "I have always looked upon you, Miſs Lucy, as a daughter, and, I hope, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as been no want of tenderneſs or attention on the ſide of my aunt or myſelf to have prevented your regarding us as parents.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, I know the opinions of the world; miſtaken and illiberal as they often are, there is a deference which we are obliged to pay them: in your ſex the ſenſe of decorum ſhould he ever awake; even in this caſe, I would not attempt to plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its voice; but I hope I have hit on a method which will perfectly reconcile propriety and convenience. There is a lady,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018007_0123_0FA4559F6C5CD3A8"/>
a diſtant relation of our family, whom a marriage, ſuch as the world terms imprudent, baniſhed in early life from the notice or protection of it; but, though they could refuſe their ſuffrage to the match, they could not controul its happineſs; and, during the life of Mr. Boothby, (for that was her huſband's name) ſhe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced all the felicity of which wedlock is ſuſceptible. Yet on her huſband's death, which happened about five years after their marriage, the ſtate of his affairs was found to be ſuch, that ſhe ſtood but too much in need of that aſſiſtance which her relations denied her.</p>
                     <p>At the time of her giving the family this offence, I was a boy: and I ſcarce ever heard of her name till I was apprized of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Whatever ſervices I have been able to do her, I have found repaid by the ſincereſt gratitude, and improved to the worthieſt purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>Upon the late event of my aunt's death, I was naturally led to wiſh her place ſupplied by Mrs. Boothby; ſhe has done me the favor to accept of my invitation, and I expect her here this evening. Of any thing like authority in this houſe, Miſs Lucy, you ſhall be always independant; but I flatter myſelf ſhe has qualities ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to merit your friendſhip." Lucy returned ſuch an anſwer, as the kindneſs and delicacy of this ſpeech deſerved; and it was agreed, that, for the preſent, her purpoſe of leaving Bilſwood ſhould be laid aſide.</p>
                     <p>In the evening the expected lady arrived; ſhe ſeemed to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the age ot fifty, with an impreſſion of melancholy on her countenance, that appeared to have worn away her beauty before the uſual period: ſome traces however ſtill remained, and her eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they met the view of the world, which was but ſeldom, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a brilliancy not extinguiſhed by her ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Her appearance, joined to the knowlege of her ſtory, did not fail to attract Miſs Sindall's regard; ſhe received Mrs. Boothby with an air, not of civility, but friendſhip; and the other ſhowed a ſenſe of the obligation conferred on her, by a look of that modeſt tender ſort, which equally acknowleges and ſolicits our kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>With misfortune a good heart eaſily makes an acquaintance. Miſs Sindall endeavoured, by a thouſand little aſſiduities, to ſtrow this lady the intereſt ſhe took in her welfare. That reſerve, which the humility of affliction, not an unſocial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſpirit, ſeemed to have taught Mrs. Boothby, wore off by degrees; their mutual eſteem encreaſed as their characters opened to each other: and, in a ſhort time, their confidence was unreſerved, and their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip appeared to be inviolable.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Boothby had now the ſatisfaction of pouring the tale of her diſtreſſes into the ear of ſympathy and friendſhip. Her ſtory was melancholy, but not uncommon; the wreck of her huſband's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs by a mind too enlarged for his fortune, and an indulgence of inclinations laudable in their kind, but faulty in relation to the circumſtances of their owner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:018007_0124_0FA455A039BCE240"/>In the hiſtory of her young friend's life, there were but few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents to communicate in return. She could only ſay, that ſhe remembered herſelf, from her infancy, an orphan, under the care of ſir Thomas Sindall and his aunt; that ſhe had lived with them in a ſtate of quiet and ſimplicity, without having ſeen much of the world, or wiſhing to ſee it. She had but one ſecret to diſcloſe in earneſt of her friendſhip: it faltered for ſome time on her lips; at laſt ſhe ventured to let Mrs. Boothby know it — her attachment to Bolton.</p>
                     <p>From this intelligence the other was led to an enquiry into the ſituation of that young gentleman. She heard the particulars I have formerly related, with an emotion not ſuited to the feelings of Miſs Sindall; and the ſincerity of her friendſhip declared the fears which her prudence ſuggeſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>She reminded Lucy of the dangers to which youth and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are expoſed, by the ſudden acquiſition of riches; ſhe ſet forth the many diſadvantages of early independance, and hinted the inconſtancy of attachments, formed in the period of romantic enthuſiaſm, in the ſcenes of rural ſimplicity, which are afterwards to be tried by the maxims of the world, amidſt the ſociety of the gay, the thoughtleſs, and the diſſipated.</p>
                     <p>From all this followed concluſions, which it was as difficult as diſagreeable for the heart of Lucy to form: it could not untwiſt thoſe tender ties which linked it to Bolton; but it began to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for itſelf and him.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. Certain opinions of Mrs. Boothby. — An attempt to account for them.</head>
                     <p>FROM the particulars of her own ſtory, and of Bolton's, Mrs. Boothby drew one concluſion common to both; to wit, the goodneſs of ſir Thomas Sindall. This indeed, a laudable gratitude had ſo much impreſſed on her mind, that the praiſes ſhe frequently beſtowed on him, even in his own preſence, would have favored of adulation to one, who had not known the debt which this lady owed to his beneficence.</p>
                     <p>Lucy, to whom ſhe would often repeat her eulogium of the baronet, was ready enough to own the obligations herſelf had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and to join her acknowlegements to thoſe of her friend. Yet there was a want of warmth in her panegyric, for which Mrs. Boothby would ſometimes gently blame her; and one day, when they were on that ſubject, ſhe remarked, with a ſort of jocular air, the difference of that attachment which Miſs Sindall felt, in return for ſo much unwearied kindneſs as ſir Thomas had ſhown her, and that which a few ſoft glances had procured to the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:018007_0125_0FA455A14D607BF8"/>Miſs Sindall ſeemed to feel the obſervation with ſome degree of diſpleaſure; and anſwered, bluſhing, that ſhe conſidered ſir Thomas as a parent whom ſhe was to eſteem and revere, not as one for whom ſhe was to entertain any ſentiments of a ſofter kind.</p>
                     <p>"But ſuppoſe, replied the other, that he ſhould entertain ſentiments of a ſofter kind for you."—"I cannot ſuppoſe it." —"There you are in the wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men of ſenſe and knowlege of the world, like ſir Thomas, are not ſo prodigal of unmeanig compliment as giddy young people, who mean not half of what they ſay; but they feel more deeply the force of our attractions, and will retain the impreſſion ſo much the longer as it is grafted on maturity of judgment. I am very much miſtaken, Miſs Lucy, if the worthieſt of men is not your lover."—"Lover! ſir Thomas Sindall my lover!"—"I profeſs, my dear, I cannot ſee the reaſon of that paſſionate exclamation; nor why that man ſhould not be entitled to love you, who has himſelf the beſt title to be beloved." —"I may reverence ſir Thomas Sindall, I may admire his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I will do any thing to ſhow my gratitude to him; but to love him—good heavens!" There is, I know, rejoined Mrs. Boothby, a certain romantic affection, which young people ſuppoſe to be the only thing that comes under that denomination. From being accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to admire a ſet of opinion's, which they term ſentimental, oppoſed to others which they look upon as vulgar and unfeeling, they form to themſelves an ideal ſyſtem in thoſe matters, which, from the nature of things, muſt always be diſappointed. You will find, Miſs Sindall, when you have lived to ſee a little more of the world; the inſufficiency of thoſe viſionary articles of happineſs, that are ſet forth with ſuch parade of language in novels and romances, as conſiſting in ſympathy of ſoul, and the mutual attraction of hearts, deſtined for each other."</p>
                     <p>"You will pardon me, ſaid Lucy, for making one obſervation, that you yourſelf are an inſtance againſt the univerſal truth of your argument; you married for love, Mrs. Boothby."—"I did ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſhe, and therefore I am the better able to inform you of the ſhort duration of that paradiſe ſuch a ſtate is ſuppoſed to imply. We were looked upon, Miſs Lucy, as patterns of conjugal felicity; but folks did little know, how ſoon the raptures with which we went together were changed into feelings of a much colder kind. At the ſame time, Mr. Boothby was a good-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To this concluding maxim Lucy made no reply. It was one of thoſe which ſhe could not eaſily bear to believe; it even tinctured the character of the perſon who made i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and ſhe found herſelf not ſo much diſpoſed to love Mrs. Boothby as ſhe once had been.</p>

                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:018007_0126_0FA455A1CDB66BF8"/>For this ſort of reaſoning, however, that lady had reaſons which it may not be improper to explain to the reader, if indeed the reader has not already diſcovered them without the aſſiſtance of explanation.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas Sindall, though he was now verging towards that time of life when
<q>the heyday of the blood is tame,</q>
was ſtill as ſuſceptible as ever of the influence of beauty. Miſs Lucy I have already mentioned as poſſeſſing an uncommon ſhare of it; and chance had placed her ſo immediately under his obſervation and guardianſhip, that it was ſcarce poſſible for him not to remark, and having remarked, not to deſire it.</p>
                     <p>In ſome minds indeed there might have ariſen ſuggeſtions of honour and conſcience unfavorable to the uſe of that opportunity which fortune had put in his power; but theſe were reſtraints which ſir Thomas had ſo frequently broken, as in a great meaſure to annihilate their force.</p>
                     <p>During the life of his aunt, there were other motives to reſtrain him; thoſe were now removed; and being ſolicitous to preſerve the advantage which he drew from Miſs Sindall's reſidence in his houſe, he pitched on Mrs. Boothby to fill Mrs. Selwyn's place, from whom his former good offices gave him an additional title to expect aſſiſtance, by means of the influence ſhe would naturally gain over the mind of one who was in ſome ſort to become her ward.</p>
                     <p>As I am willing at preſent to believe that lady' character a fair one, I ſhall ſuppoſe, that he concealed from her the kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes with which he meant to approach her young friend. It is certain there was but one kind, which the principles of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>r Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas allowed him to make.</p>
                     <p>One obſtacle however he foreſaw in the attachment which he had early diſcovered her to have towards Bolton. This, on the moſt favourable ſuppoſition of the caſe, he might eaſily repreſent to Mrs. Boothby, equally hurtful to Lucy's intereſt, and deſtructive of his own wiſhes; and if ſhe was prevailed on to eſpouſe his cauſe, it may account for thoſe leſſons of prudence which ſhe beſtowed upon Miſs Sindall.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, the baronet did not ſcruple to uſe ſome other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, ſtill more diſhonourable of ſhaking her confidence in his couſin. He fell upon means of ſecretly intercepting that young gentleman's letters to Lucy; from this he drew a double advantage; both of faſtening a ſuſpicion on Harry's fidelity, and acquiring ſuch intelligence as might point his own machinations to defeat the purpoſes which that correſpondence contained.</p>

                     <p>UNDER thoſe circumſtances of advantage in which ſir Thomas Sindall ſtood, it did not ſeem a matter of extreme difficulty to accompliſh that deſign which I have hinted to my readers in the preceding chapter. Let him, whoſe indignation is rouſed at the mention of it, carry his feelings abroad into life; he will find other Sindalls whom the world has not marked with its diſpleaſure: in the ſimplicity of my narrative, what is there that ſhould ſet up this one to his hatred or his ſcorn? let but the heart pronounce its judgment, and the deciſion will be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto ſir Thomas had appeared as the parent and guardian of Lucy; and though, at times, certain expreſſions eſcaped him, which the quickneſs of more experienced, that is, leſs innocent minds would have diſcovered to belong to another character, yet ſhe, to whom they were addreſſed, had heard them without ſuſpicion.</p>
                     <p>But ſhe was now alarmed by the ſuggeſtions of Mrs. Boothby: theſe ſuggeſtions it is poſſible the baronet himſelf had prompted. He knew the force of that poiſon which is conveyed in thoſe indirect approaches, when a woman's vanity is ſet on the watch by the aſſiſtance of a third perſon. She who imagines ſhe hears them with indifference, is in danger; but ſhe who liſtens to them with pleaſure, is undone.</p>
                     <p>With Lucy, however, they failed of that effect which the baronet's experience had promiſed him: ſhe heard them with a ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To her virtues ſir Thomas was no ſtranger; they were difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties watch ſerved but as ſpurs in his purſuit: that he continued it with encreaſing ardor, may be gathered from two letters, which I ſubjoin for the information of the reader.

There was ſomething of enviable tranquillity in the ſcene; I ſighed as I looked —"That's a deep one," ſaid ſir Thomas, patting me on the ſhoulder behind; I turned round ſomewhat in a flurry, when I perceived that Mrs. Boothby had left the room. I made a motion towards the door; ſir Thomas placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his back to it. "Where is Mrs. Boothby?" ſaid I, though I trembled ſo, that I could ſcarcely articulate the words. "What is my ſweet girl frightened at? ſaid he, here are none but love and Sindall"</p>
                           <p>He fell on his knees, and repeated a great deal of jargon, (I was ſo confuſed I know not what) holding my hands, all the while, faſt in his. I pulled them away at laſt; he roſe, and claſping me round the waiſt, would have forced a kiſs; I ſcreamed out, and he turned from me.</p>
                           <p>"What's the matter?" ſaid Mrs. Boothby, who then entered the room; "a mouſe running acroſs the carpet, frightened Miſs Lucy," anſwered ſir Thomas; I could not ſpeak, but I ſat down on the ſofa, and had almoſt fainted. Sir Thomas brought me ſome wine and water, and preſſed my hand, whiſpered, that he hoped I would forgive an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which was already too much puniſhed by its effects: but he looked ſo, while he ſpoke this!</p>

concluded, therefore, either that Mrs. Wiſtanly found herſelf unable to aſſiſt her in her preſent diſtreſs, or, what ſhe imagined more probable, that age had now weakened her faculties ſo much, as to render her callous even to that feeling which ſhould have pitied it.</p>
                     <p>She next turned her thoughts upon Miſs Walton, the manner of her getting acquainted with whom, I have related in the fifth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this volume; but ſhe learned, that Mr. Walton had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a few days before, ſet out with his daughter on a journey to the continent, to which he had been adviſed by her phyſicians, as ſhe had, for ſome time paſt, been threatened with ſymptoms of a conſumptive diſorder. Theſe circumſtances, and ſir Thomas's farther conduct in the interval, induced her to addreſs the following letter to Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, though ſhe began to ſuſpect, from the ſuppoſed failure of his correſpondence, that the ſuggeſtions ſhe had heard of his change of circumſtances having taught him to forget her, had but too much foundation in reality.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV. She receives a letter from Bolton.—A new alarm from ſir Thomas Sindall.</head>
                     <p>IT happened that the meſſenger to whom the charge of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going billet was committed, was a perſon, not in that line of aſſociation which the baronet had drawn around her; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it eſcaped interception.</p>
                     <p>When Bolton received it, he was not only alarmed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence it contained, but his fears were doubly rouſed from the diſcovery it made to him, of his letters not being ſuffered to reach Miſs Sindall. He diſpatched his anſwer, therefore, by a ſpecial meſſenger, who was ordered to watch an opportunity of delivering it privately into the hands of the lady to whom it was addreſſed. This he found no eaſy matter to accompliſh; nor would he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been able to effect it at all, but for an artifice to which he had recourſe, of hiring himſelf on a job in ſir Thomas's garden, for which his knowlege in the buſineſs happened to qualify him. He had indeed been formerly employed in that capacity at Sindall-Park, and had there been well enough known to Miſs Lucy, who was herſelf a gardener for amuſement; and, after leaving that place, having gone to the neighbourhood of London for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was met, and hired by his former acquaintance, Mr. Bolton.</p>
                     <p>The very next evening after he had got into this ſtation, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Miſs Sindall enter the garden alone. This was an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity not to be miſſed; on pretence, therefore, of fetching ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from the end of the walk ſhe was on, he paſſed her, and pulled off his hat with a look ſignificant of prior acquaintance. Lucy obſerved him, and feeling a ſort of momentary comfort from the recollection, began ſome talk with him reſpecting his former ſituation, and the changes it had undergone.</p>
                     <p>She aſked him many queſtions about their old neighbours at Sindall-Park, and particularly Mrs. Wiſtanly; when ſhe was ſoon convinced of her miſapprehenſion with regard to a failure of that worthy woman's intellects, Jerry, (ſo the gardener was famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly called) having ſeen her in his way to Bilſwood, and heard her ſpeak of Miſs Lucy with the moſt tender concern. "And what was your laſt ſervice, Jerry?" ſaid ſhe—"I wrought for Mr.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018007_0131_0FA455A8D01460F8"/>
Bolton, Madam."—"Mr. Bolton!"—"And I received this paper from him for your Ladyſhip, which I was ordered to deliver into your own hands, and no other body's, an't pleaſe your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip." She took the letter with a trembling impatience, and whiſpering, that ſhe would find an opportunity of ſeeing him again, hurried up into her chamber to peruſe it. She found it to contain what follows:</p>
                     <p>"I have not words to tell my ever deareſt Lucy, with what diſtracting anxiety I read, the letter that is now lying before me. To give her ſuſpicions of my faith, muſt have been the work of no common treachery: when ſhe knows that I wrote to her three ſeveral times without receiving any anſwer, ſhe will, at the ſame time, acquit me of inconſtancy, and judge of my uneaſineſs.</p>
                     <p>"That diſcovery which ſhe has lately made, is nothing to her or to me. My Lucy is the child of heaven, and her inheritance every excellence it can beſtow.</p>
                     <p>"But her preſent ſituation—my God! what horrible images has my fancy drawn of it! For heaven's ſake, let not even the moſt amiable of weakneſſes prevent her eſcaping from it into the arms of her faithful Bolton. I diſpatch a meſſenger with this inſtantly. I cannot poſſibly follow him myſelf ſooner than two days hence. I will then ſet out for the neighbourhood of Bilſwood. That houſe I am forbidden to enter, ſir Thomas having taken occaſion, from my reſigning a commiſſion which would have fixed me ingloriouſly in a garriſon abroad, that I might be of ſome uſe to my country at home, to write me a letter in the angried terms, renouncing me, as he expreſſes it, for ever. I ſee, I ſee, the villainy of his purpoſe; 'tis but a few days hence, and I will meet him in the covert of his falſehood and blaſt it. Let my Lucy be but juſt to herſelf and to BOLTON."</p>
                     <p>She had ſcarcely read this, when Mrs. Boothby entered the room. The baronet had, for ſome days, quitted that plan of intimidation, which had prompted him to diſcover to Lucy, the circumſtance of her being a wretched foundling, ſupported by his charity, for a behaviour more mild and inſinuating; and Mrs. Boothby, who ſqared her conduct accordingly, had been particularly attentive and obliging.</p>
                     <p>She now delivered to Miſs Sindall a meſſage from a young lady in the neighbourhood, an acquaintance of hers, begging her company, along with Mrs. Boothby's, to a party of pleaſure the day after. "And really Miſs Sindall," ſaid ſhe, with an air of concern, "I muſt enforce the invitation from a regard to your health, as you ſeem to have been drooping for ſome days paſt." Lucy looked her full in the face, and ſigned: that look ſhe did not chuſe to underſtand, but repeated her queſtion as to their jaunt to-morrow. "Miſs Venhurſt will call at nine, and expects to find you ready to attend her."—"What you pleaſe," replied the other; "if Miſs Venhurſt is to be of the party, I have no
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018007_0132_0FA455A933FC26B8"/>
objection." The conſent ſeemed to give much ſatisfaction to Mrs. Boothby, who left her with a gentle tap on the back, and an unuſual appearance of kindneſs in her aſpect.</p>
                     <p>Lucy read her letter again; ſhe had deſired Bolton to think of her no more; but there is in the worthieſt hearts, a little hypocriſy attending ſuch requeſts: ſhe found herſelf happy in the thought that he had not forgotten her</p>
                     <p>When ſhe opened her bureau, to depoſit this freſh teſtimony of his attachment, ſhe obſerverd the corner of a piece of paper which had been thruſt into a fiſſure occaſioned by the ſhrinking of the wood. Her curioſity was excited by this circumſtance, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding the paper, ſhe found it to contain—</p>

                     <p>Amazement and horror filled the mind of Lucy as ſhe read this; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the firſt perturbation of her ſoul was over, ſhe bethought herſelf of endeavouring to find out her friend in the author of this epiſtle, whoſe compaſſion ſeemed ſo much intereſted in her behalf.

                     <p>AS I flatter myſelf that my readers feel ſome intereſt in the fate of Miſs Sindall, I would not leave that part of my narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which regarded her, till I had brought it to the period of her eſcape. Having accompanied her thus far, I return to give ſome account of Mr. Bolton.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:018007_0136_0FA455AD0BC5CB40"/>According to the promiſe he had made to Lucy, he ſet out for Bilſwood, two days after the date of that letter ſhe received from him by the hands of his gardener. That faithful fellow had orders to return, after delivering it, and on procuring what intelligence he could of the family, to wait his maſter, at a little inn, about five miles diſtant from ſir Thomas Sindall's. The firſt part of his buſineſs the reader has ſeen him accompliſh; as to the reſt, he was only able to learn ſomething confuſedly, of the baronet's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to Miſs Lucy.</p>
                     <p>He expected to have ſeen that young lady again on the day following that of their firſt interview; but her attention had been ſo much occupied by the diſcoveries related in the two laſt chapters, and contriving the means of avoiding the danger with which ſhe was threatened, that her promiſe to the bearer of Mr. Bolton's letter had eſcaped her memory. He ſet out therefore for the place of appointment on the evening of that day, and reached it but a very ſhort time before his maſter arrived.</p>
                     <p>Bolton, having learned what particulars Jerry could inform him of, deſired him to return in the morning to his work in ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's garden, and remain there till he ſhould receive farther or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; then leaving his horſes and ſervants for fear of diſcovery, he ſet out on foot, in the garb of a peaſant, which Jerry had found means to procure him.</p>
                     <p>As he had paſſed ſeveral years of his life at Bilſwood, he truſted implicitly to his own knowledge of the way; but ſoon after his leaving the inn the moon was totally darkened, and it rained with ſuch violence, accompanied with inceſſant peals of thunder, that, in the confuſion of the ſcene, he miſſed his path, and had wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great way over the adjacent common before he diſcovered his miſtake.</p>
                     <p>When he endeavoured to regain the road, he found himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in a very thick brake of furze, which happened to lie on that ſide whence he had turned; and, after ſeveral fruitleſs efforts to make his way through it, he was obliged to deſiſt from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and tread back the ſteps he had made, till he returned to the open part of the heath.</p>
                     <p>Here he ſtood, uncertain what courſe to take; when he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a diſtance the twinkling of a light, which immediately deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him. On advancing ſomewhat nearer, he found a little winding track that ſeemed to point towards the place; and after following it ſome time, he could diſcern an object which he took for the houſe to which it led.</p>
                     <p>The lightening, which now flaſhed around him, diſcovered on each hand the earth raiſed into mounds that ſeemed graves of the dead, and here and there a bone lay mouldering on the walk he trod. A few paces farther, through a narrow gothic door, gleam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a light, which faintly illuminated a length of vault within. To this Bolton approached, not without ſome degree of fear; when he perceived at the farther end a perſon, in a military uniform, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

by a fire he had made of ſome withered bruſh-wood piled up againſt the wall. As Harry approached him the echo of the place doubled the hollow ſound of his feet.—"Who is there?" cried the ſtranger, turning at the noiſe, and half unſheathing a hanger which he wore at his ſide.</p>
                     <p>"A friend," replied Harry, bowing, "who takes the liberty of begging a ſeat by your fire." "Your manner, ſaid the other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We are, for the time, joint lords of the manſion, for my title is no other than the inclemency of the night. It is ſuch a one as makes even this gloomy ſhelter enviable; and that broken piece of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock, and this Hint, are precious, becauſe they lighted ſome bits of dry ſtraw, to kindle the flame that warms us.</p>
                     <p>By the moſs-grown altar, and the frequent figures of the croſs, I ſuppoſe theſe the remains of ſome chapel devoted to ancient vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Sit down on this ſtone, if you pleaſe, ſir, and our offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be a thankful heart over ſome humble fare which my knapſack contains."</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke, he pulled out a loaf of coarſe bread, a piece of cheeſe, and a bottle of ale. Bolton expreſſed his thanks for the invitation, and partook of the repaſt. "I fear, ſir," ſaid his companion, "you will be poorly ſupped; but I have known what it is, to want even a cruſt of bread.—You look at me with ſurprize; but, though I am poor, I am honeſt." Pardon me," anſwered Harry, "I entertain no ſuſpicion; there is ſomething that ſpeaks for you in this boſom, and anſwers for your worth. It may be in my power to prevent, for the future, thoſe hardſhips which, I fear, you have formerly endured."—</p>
                     <p>The ſoldier held forth the bit of bread which he was putting to his mouth—"He, to whom this fare is luxury, can ſcarcely be dependant; yet my gratitude to you, ſir, is equally due; — if I have felt misfortune, I have deſerved it." — He ſighed, and Harry anſwered him with a ſigh.—"I ſee a ſort of queſtion in your face, ſir; and, I know not why it is, there are ſome faces I cannot eaſily reſiſt. If my ſtory outlaſts the ſtorm, it will take from the irkſomeneſs of its duration."</p>

You are too young, ſir, to have gained much knowlege of mankind; let me warn you, from ſad experience, to beware of thoſe paſſions which at your age I was unable to reſiſt, and which, in the commerce of the world, will find abundant occaſion to overcome incautious and unexperienced youth.

not when I tell you, that you ſee before you one whom the laws of his country had doomed to expiate his crimes by death, though from the mercy of his prince, that judgment was mitigated into a term of tranſportation ſome time ago elapſed. This puniſhment I incurred from the commiſſion of a Robbery, to which ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances, joined to the poverty conſequent on diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and extravagance, had tempted me.</p>
                     <p>The maſter to whom my ſervice was adjudged in the Weſt-Indies happened to die ſoon after my arrival there. I got my freedom therefore, though it was but to change it for a ſervice as ſevere as my former; I was enliſted in a regiment then ſtationed in the iſland, and being conſidered as a felon, unworthy of any mild treatment, was conſtantly expoſed to every hardſhip which the ſtricteſt duty, or the moſt continual expoſure to the dangers of the climate, could inflict.</p>
                     <p>Had I revealed my ſtory, and taken advantage of that diſtinction which my birth and education would have made between the other convicts and me, it is probable I might have prevented moſt of the evils both of my former and preſent ſituation; but I ſet out, from the firſt, with a fixed determination, of ſuffering every part of my puniſhment, which the law allots to the meaneſt and moſt unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All the ſeverities, therefore, which were now impoſed upon me, I bore without repining; and, from an excellent natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, was not only able to overcome them, but they ſerved to render me ſtill more patient of fatigue, and leſs ſuſceptible of impreſſion from the viciſſitudes of the weather; and from a ſullen diſregard of life, with which the remembrance of better days inſpired me, my ſoul became as fearleſs as my body robuſt. Theſe qualities made me be taken notice of by ſome of the officers in the regiment, and afterwards, when it was ordered to America, and went on ſome Indian expeditions, were ſtill more ſerviceable and more attractive of obſervation</p>
                     <p>By theſe means I began to obliterate the diſgrace which my ſituation at enliſting had fixed upon me; and, if ſtill regarded as a ruffian, I was at leaſt acknowleged to be a uſeful one. Not long after, on occaſion of a piece of ſervice I performed for an officer on an advanced guard, that was attacked by a party of hoſtile Indians, I was promoted to a halberd. The ſtigma, however, of my tranſportation was not yet entirely forgotten, and by ſome it was the better remembered becauſe of my preſent advancement. One of thoſe, with whom I had never been on good terms, was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly offended at being commanded, as he termed it, by a jail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird; and one day, when I was on guard, had drawn on the back of my coat, the picture of a gallows, on which was hung a figure in caricature, with the initials of my name written over it. This was an affront too groſs to be tamely put up; having ſought out the man, who did not deny the charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I challenged him to give me ſatisfaction by fighting me. But this, from the opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of my ſtrength and ferocity, he did not chuſe to accept;
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018007_0139_0FA455B2B4136BC0"/>
on which I gave him ſo ſevere a drubbing, that he was unable to mount guard in his turn, and the ſurgeon reported that his life was in danger. For this offence I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ied by a court-martial, and ſentenced to receive five hundred laſhes as a puniſhment. When their ſentence was communicated to me, I petitioned that it might be changed into death; but my requeſt was refuſed. That very day, therefore, I received one hundred laſhes, (for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was to be executed at different periods) and next morning was to ſuffer as many more.</p>
                     <p>The remainder however I reſolved, if poſſible, to eſcape by an act of ſuicide. This I was only prevented from putting in execution by the want of opportunity; as I had been ſtripped of every the ſmalleſt weapon of offence, and was bound with ropes to one of the poſts of my bed. I contrived, nevertheleſs, about midnight, to reach the fire place with my feet, and having drawn out thence a live ember, diſpoſed it immediately under the moſt combuſtible part of the bed.</p>
                     <p>It had very ſoon the effect I deſired; the room was ſet on fire, and I regained my liberty, by the ropes, with which I was tied, being burnt. At that moment the deſire of life was rekindled by the poſſibility of eſcaping: the flames burſting out fiercely at one ſide of the houſe where I lay, the attention of the ſoldiers whom the fire had awaked, was principally turned to that quarter, and I had an opportunity of ſtealing off unperceived at the oppoſite ſide.</p>
                     <p>We were then in a ſort of wooden huts which had been built for our accommodation on the outſide of one of our frontier-forts; for that, when I had run two or three hundred yard, I found myſelf in the ſhelter of a wood, pretty ſecure from purſuit; but, as there it was impoſſible for me long to ſubſiſt, and I had no chance of eſcaping detection if I ventured to approach the habitations of any of my countrymen, I formed the reſolution of endeavouring to join the Indians, whoſe ſcouting parties I had frequently ſeen at a ſmall diſtance from our out-poſts.</p>
                     <p>I held therefore in a direction which I judged the moſt probable for falling in with them, and a very little after day-break diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a party, ſeated after the manner of their country, in a ring, with the aſhes of their newly-extinguiſhed fire in the middle. I advanced ſlowly to the place, which I had almoſt reached before I was perceived. When they diſcovered me, they leaped up to their feet, and ſeizing their arms, ſcreamed out the war-whoop, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm the different ſmall parties who had paſſed the night in reſting places near them.</p>
                     <p>One of them preſenting his piece took aim at me; but I fell on my knees, ſhowed them my defenceleſs ſtate, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld out my hands, as if imploring their mercy and protection. Upon this one of the oldeſt among them made a ſign to the reſt, and advancing towards me, aſked me, in broken French, mixed with his own language, of which too I underſtood ſomething, what was my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018007_0140_0FA455B419221500"/>
and whence I came? I anſwered as diſtinctly as I could to theſe interrogatories; and ſhowing the ſores on my back, which I gave him to underſtand had been inflicted at the fort, made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, both by imperfect language and ſignificant geſtures, of my friendſhip to his countrymen and hatred to my own. After holding a moment's converſation with the reſt, he took my hand, and, leading me a little forward, placed me in the midſt of the party.</p>
                     <p>Some of them examined me attentively, and upon ſome farther diſcourſe together, brought the baggage, with which two priſoners, lately made from ſome adverſe tribe, had been loaded, and laid it upon me. This burden, which to any man would have been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſively heavy, you may believe, was much more intolerable to me, whoſe fleſh was yet raw from the laſhes I had received; but as I knew that fortitude was an indiſpenſable virtue with the Indians, I bore it without wincing, and we proceeded on the rout which the party I had joined were deſtined to purſue. During the courſe of our firſt day's march, they often looked ſtedfaſtly in my face, to diſcover if I ſhowed any ſigns of uneaſineſs.</p>
                     <p>When they ſaw that I did not, they lightened my load by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and at laſt, the ſenior chief, who had firſt taken notice of me, freed me from it altogether, and, at the ſame time, chewing ſome herbs he found in the wood, applied them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> my ſores, which in a few days were almoſt entirely healed. I was then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a tomahawk, and ſhortly after with a gun, to the dexterous uſe of both which weapons I was frequently exerciſed by the young men of our party, during the remainder of our expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>It laſted ſome months, in which time I had alſo become tolerably acquainted with their language. At the end of this excurſion, in which they warred on ſome other Indian nations, they returned to their own country, and were received with all the barbarous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of joy peculiar to that people. In a day or two after their arrival, their priſoners were brought forth into a large plain, where the kindred of thoſe who had been ſlain by the nations to which the captives belonged, aſſembled to ſee them.</p>
                     <p>Each ſingled out his expiatory priſoner, and having taken him home to his hut, ſuch as choſe that kind of ſatisfaction, adopted them in place of the relations they had loſt; with the reſt they returned to their former place of meeting, and began to celebrate the feſtival of their reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ge. You can hardly conceive a ſpecies of inventive cruelty, which they did not inflict on the wretches whom fortune had thus put into their power; during the courſe of which, not a groan eſcaped from the ſufferers; but while the uſe of their voices remained, they ſung, in their rude, yet forcible manner, the glory of their former victories, and the pleaſure they had received from the death of their foes; concluding always with the hopes of revenge from the ſurviving warriors of their nation. Nor was it only for the pleaſure of the reflexion that they carolled thus
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018007_0141_0FA455B487FEB120"/>
the triumphs of the paſt; for I could obſerve, that, when at any time the rage of their tormentors ſeemed to ſubſide, they poured forth thoſe boaſtful ſtrains in order to rekindle their fury, that intenſeneſs of pain might not be wanting in the trial of their fortitude. I perceived the old man whom I have before mentioned, keep his eye fixed upon me during this inhuman ſolemnity: and frequently, when an extreme degree of torture was born with that calmneſs which I have deſcribed, he would point, with an expreſſive look, to him on whom it was inflicted, as if he had deſired me to take particular notice of his reſolution.</p>
                     <p>I did not then fully comprehend the meaning of this; but I afterwards underſtood it to have been a preparatory hint of what I myſelf was to endure; for the next morning, after the laſt ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſoner had expired, I was ſeized by three or four Indians, who ſtripped me of what little cloaths I had then left, tied me in a horizontal poſture between the branches of two large trees they had fixed in the ground, and, after the whole tribe had danced round me to the muſic of a barbarous howl, they began to re-act upon me, nearly the ſame ſcene they had been engaged in the day before. After each of a certain ſelect number had ſtuck his knife into my body, though they carefully avoided any mortal wound, they rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it over, bleeding as it was, with gun-powder, the ſalts of which gave me the moſt exquiſite pain.</p>
                     <p>Nor did the ingenuity of theſe practiſed tormentors ſtop here; they afterwards laid quantities of dry gun-powder on different parts of my body, and ſet fire to them, by which I was burnt in ſome places to the bone. — But I ſee you ſhudder at the horrid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital; ſuffice it then to ſay, that theſe, and ſome other ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of wanton cruelty, I bore with that patience with which nothing but a life of hardſhip, and a certain obduracy of ſpirit, proceeding from a contempt of exiſtence, could have endowed me.</p>
                     <p>"After this trial was over, I was looſed from my bonds, and ſet in the midſt of a circle, who ſhouted the cry of victory, and my aged friend brought me a bowl of water, mixed with ſome ſpirits, to drink. He took me then home to his hut, and laid applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of different ſimples to my mangled body.</p>
                     <p>"When I was ſo well recovered as to be able to walk abroad, he called together certain elders of his tribe, and acknowleging me for his ſon, gave me a name, and faſtened round my neck a belt of wampum.
<q>It is thus, ſaid he, that the valiant are tried, and thus are they rewarded; for how ſhould'ſt thou be as one of us, if thy ſoul were as the ſoul of little men; he only is worthy to lift the hatchet with the Cherokees, to whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhame is more intolerable than the ſtab of the knife, or the burning of the fire.</q>

                     <p>"<hi>IN</hi> this ſociety I lived till about a year and a half ago; and it may ſeem extraordinary to declare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is certainly true, that during the life of the old man who had adopted me, even had there been no legal reſtraint on my return to my native country, ſcarce any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement could have tempted me to leave the nation to which he belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except perhaps the deſire of reviſiting a parent, and a ſiſter, whom I had left in England ſunk beneath that ignominy, which the ſon and the brother had drawn on his guiltleſs connexions. When we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the perfect freedom ſubſiſting in this rude and ſimple ſtate of ſociety, where rule is only acknowleged for the purpoſe of immediate utility to thoſe who obey, and ceaſes whenever that purpoſe of ſubordination is accompliſhed; where greatneſs cannot uſe oppreſſion, nor wealth excite envy; where the deſires are native to the heart, and the langour of ſatiety is unknown; where, if there is no refined ſenſation of delight, there is alſo no ideal ſcource cf calamity; we ſhall the leſs wonder at the inhabitants feeling no regret for the want of thoſe delicate pleaſures of which a more poliſhed people is poſſeſſed.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is, that I am far from being a ſingle inſtance, of one who had even attained maturity in Europe, and yet found his mind ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, by the habit of a few years, to Indian manners, as to leave that country with regret. The death of my parent by adoption looſened, indeed, my attachment to it; that event happened a ſhort time before my departure from America.</p>
                     <p>"The compoſure with which the old man met his diſſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would have done honour to the firmeſt philoſopher of antiquity. When he found himſelf near his end, he called me to him, to deliver ſome final in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ructions reſpecting my carriage to his countrymen; he obſerved, at the cloſe of his diſcourſe, that I retained ſo much of the European as to ſhed ſome tears, while he delivered it.
<q>In thoſe tears ſaid he, there is no wiſdom, for there is no uſe; I have heard that, in your country, men prepare for death, by thinking on it while they live; this alſo is folly, becauſe it looſes the good, by anticipating the evil; we do otherwiſe, my ſon, as our fathers have better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted us, and take from the evil by reflecting on the good. I have lived a thouſand moons, without captivity, and without diſgrace; in my youth I did not fly in battle, and in age, the tribes liſtened while I ſpake. If I live in another land after death, I ſhall remember theſe things with pleaſure; if the preſent is our only life, to have done thus is to have uſed it well. You have ſometimes told me of your countrymen's account of a land of ſouls; but you were a young man when you came among us, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among them may have deceived you; for the children of the French king call themſelves after the ſame God that the Engliſh do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet their diſcourſes concerning him cannot be true, becauſe they are

oppoſite one to another. Each ſays, that God ſhall burn the others with fire; which could not happen if both were his children. Beſides, neither of them act as the ſons of Truth, but as the ſons of Deceit; they ſay their God heareth all things, yet do they break the promiſes which they have called upon him to hear; but we know that the ſpirit within us liſteneth, and what we have ſaid in its hearing, that we do. If in another country the ſoul liveth, this witneſs ſhall live with it; whom it hath here reproached, it ſhall there diſquiet; whom it hath here honoured, it ſhall there reward. Live, therefore, my ſon, as your father hath lived; and die, as he dieth, fearleſs of death.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"With ſuch ſentiments the old man reſigned his breath, and I bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the life of Chriſtians, while I heard them.</p>
                     <p>"I was now become an independant member of the community; and my behaviour had been ſuch, that I ſucceeded to the condition of my father, with the reſpect of a people, amongſt whom honour is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only by merit. But his death had diſſolved that tie which gratitude, and indeed affection for the old man, had on my heart; and the ſcene of his death naturally awakened in me the remembrance of a father in England, whoſe age might now be helpleſs, and call for the aid of a long loſt ſon to ſolace and ſupport it. This idea, once rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed, became every day more powerful, and at laſt I reſolved to communicate it to the tribe, and tell them my purpoſe of returning home.</p>
                     <p>"They heard me without ſurprize or emotion; as indeed it is their great characteriſtic not to be eaſily awakened to either.
<q>You return, ſaid one of the elders, to a people who ſell affection to their brethren for money; take therefore with you ſome of the commodities which their traders value. Strength, agility, and fortitude, are ſufficient to us; but with them they are of little uſe; and he who poſſeſſes wealth, having no need of virtue, among the wealthy it will not be found.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The laſt your father thought you, and amongſt us you have practiſed; the firſt he had not to leave, nor have we to beſtow; but take as many beaver ſkins as you can carry on your journey, that it may reach that parent whom, you tell us, you go to cheriſh</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"I returned thanks to the old man for his counſel, and to the whole tribe for their kindneſs; and having, according to his advice, taken a few of the furs they offered me, I reſumed the tattered remains of the European dreſs which I had on when I eſcaped from the fort, and took the neareſt road to one of our back-ſettlements, which I reached, without any accident, by the aſſiſtance of an Indian who had long ſhown a particular attachment to me, and who now attended me on my way.</p>
                     <p>"Yonder ſmoke," ſaid my conductor,
<q>riſes from the dwellings of your countrymen. You now return to a world which I have heard you deſcribe as full of calamity; but the ſoul you poſſeſs is the ſoul of a man; remember that to fortitude there is no ſting in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and in death no evil to the valiant.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="unknown:018007_0144_0FA455B7ED68F060"/>"<hi>When he left me, I ſtood for ſome minutes, looking back, on one hand to the wilds I had paſſed, and on the other, to the ſcenes of cultivation which European induſtry had formed; and it may ſurprize you to hear, that though there wanted not ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling attachment to a people amongſt whom my firſt breath had been drawn, and my youth ſpent, yet my imagination drew, on this ſide, fraud, hypocriſy, and fordid baſeneſs; while on that ſeemed to preſide honeſty, truth, and ſavage nobleneſs of ſoul. When I appeared at the door of one of the houſes in the ſettlement that was neareſt me, I was immediately accoſted by its maſter, who judging from the bundle of furs which I carried, that I had been trading among the Indians, aſked me, with much kindneſs, to take up my lodging with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"<hi>Of this offer I was very glad to accept, though I found a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of words to thank my countryman for his favour; as, from want of uſe, my remembrance of the Engliſh language had been ſo much effaced, as not only to repreſs fluency, but even to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an ordinary command of expreſſion; and I was more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a loſs for ceremonious phraſeology, that department of lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage being unknown in the country whence I was juſt returned. My landlord was not a little aſtoniſhed, when I could at laſt make ſhift to inform him of my having paſſed ſo many years among the Indians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"<hi>He aſked a thouſand queſtions about cuſtoms which never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, and told me of a multitude of things, of which all the time I had lived in that country, I had never dreamed the poſſibility. Indeed, from the ſuperiority of his expreſſion, joined to that fund of ſuppoſed knowlege which it ſerved to communicate, a by-ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would have been led to imagine, that he was deſcribing, to ſome ignorant gueſt, a country with whoſe manners he had been long converſant, and among whoſe inhabitants he had paſſed the greateſt part of his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"<hi>At length, however, his diſcourſe centered upon the fur-trade, and naturally glided from that to an offer of purchaſing my beaver-ſkins. Theſe things, I was informed by my courteous entertainer, had fallen ſo much in their price of late, that the traders could hardly defray their journey in procuring them; that himſelf had loſt by ſome late bargains in that way; but that, to oblige a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the ſingularity of whoſe adventures had intereſted him in his behalf, he would give me the higheſt price at which he had heard of their being ſold for a long time paſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"<hi>This I accepted without heſitation, as I had neither language nor inclination for haggling, and having procured as much money by the bargain as, I imagined, would more than carry me to a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, I proceeded on my journey, accompanied by an inhabitant of Williamſburg, who was returning from an annual viſit, to a ſettlement on the back-frontiers, which he had purchaſed in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip with another, who conſtantly reſided upon it. He ſeemed to be naturally of an inquiſitive diſpoſition; and having learned
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018007_0145_0FA455B8445EE968"/>
from my former landlord, that I had lived ſeveral years with the Indians, tormented me, all the while our journey laſted, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories concerning their country and manners. But, as he was leſs opinionative of his own knowlege in the matter than my laſt Engliſh acquaintance, I was the more eaſily prevailed on to ſatiſfy his curioſity, though at the expence of a greater number of words than I could conveniently ſpare; and, at laſt, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entirely maſter of my ſtory, from the time of my leaving the regiment in which I had ſerved, down to the day on which I delivered my recital,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"<hi>When I mentioned my having ſold my beaver-ſkins for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſum, he ſtarted aſide, and then lifting up his eyes in an eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory manner, expreſſed his aſtoniſhment how a Chriſtian could be guilty of ſuch monſtrous diſhoneſty, which, he ſaid, was no better than one would have expected in a</hi> Savage; <hi>for that my ſkins were worth at leaſt three times the money.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"<hi>I ſmiled at his notions of comparative morality, and bore the intelligence with a calmneſs, that ſeemed to move his admiration. He thanked God that all were not ſo ready to take advantage of Ignorance or misfortune, and cordially graſping my hand, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to make his houſe at Williamſburg my own, till ſuch time as I could procure my paſſage to England.</hi>

                     <p>"PURSUANT to this friendly invitation, I accompanied him to his houſe on our arrival in that place. For ſome days my landlord behaved to me in the moſt friendly manner, and furniſhed me, of his own accord, with linen and wearing apparel; ſeveral articles of which, though neceſſaries in the poliſhed ſociety of thoſe amongſt whom I now reſided, my ideas of Indian ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city made me conſider ſuperfluous.</p>
                     <p>"During this time I frequently attended him at his ſtore, while he was receiving conſignments of goods, and aſſiſted him and his ſervants in the diſpoſal and aſſortment of them.</p>
                     <p>At firſt he received this aſſiſtance as a favor; but I could obſerve that he ſoon began to look upon it as a matter of right, and called me to bear a hand, as he termed it, in a manner rather too peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for my pride to ſubmit to. At laſt, when he ventured to tax me with ſome office of menial ſervility, I told him, I did not conſider myſelf his dependant any farther than gratitude for his favors demanded, and refuſed to perform it. Upon which he let me know, that he looked upon me as his ſervant, and that, if I did not immediately obey his command, he would find a way to be revenged of me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:018007_0146_0FA455B8F4EDCA18"/>This declaration heightened my reſentment, and confirmed my refuſal. I deſired him to give me an account of what money he had expended, in thoſe articles with which he had ſupplied me, that I might pay him out of the ſmall ſum I had in my poſſeſſion, and, if that was not ſufficient, I would rather ſell my new habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and return to my rags, that be indebted for a farthing to his generoſity. He anſwered, that he would clear accounts with me by and by. He did ſo, by making oath before a magiſtrate, that I was a deſerter from his majeſty's ſervice, and, according to my own confeſſion, had aſſociated with the ſavages, enemies of the province.</p>
                     <p>"As I could deny neither of thoſe charges, I was thrown into priſon, where I ſhould have been in danger of ſtarving, had not the curioſity of ſome of the townsfolks induced them to viſit me, when they commonly contributed ſome trifle towards my ſupport; till at length, partly, I ſuppoſe, from the abatement of my accuſer's anger, and partly from the flagrancy of detaining me in priſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proviſion for my maintenance, I was ſuffered to be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a veſſel being then ready to ſoil for England, ſeveral of whoſe hands had deſerted her, the maſter agreed to take me on board for the conſideration of my working the voyage. For this indeed I was not in the leaſt qualified as to ſkill; but my ſtrength and perſeverance made up, in ſome operations, for the want of it.</p>
                     <p>"As this was before the end of the war, the ſhip in which I ſailed happened to be taken by a French privateer, who carried her into Breſt. This, to me, who had already anticipated my arrival at home, to comfort the declining age of a parent, was the moſt mortifying accident of any I had hitherto met with; but the captain and ſome paſſengers who were aboard of us, ſeemed to make light of their misfortune.</p>
                     <p>"The ſhip was inſured, ſo that in property the owners could ſuffer little; as for ourſelves, ſaid they, the French are the poſiteſt enemies in the world, and, till we are exchanged, will treat us with that civil demeanor, ſo peculiar to their nation. We are not (addreſſing themſelves to me) among <hi>ſavages,</hi> as you were.—How it fared with them, I know not; I and other inferior members of the crew, were thruſt into a dungeon, dark, damp, and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; where, from the number confined in it, and the want of proper circulation, the air became putrid to the moſt horrible degree; and the allowance for our proviſion was not equal to two pence a day.</p>
                     <p>"To hard living I could well enough ſubmit, who had been frequently accuſtomed, among the Cherokees, to ſubſiſt three or four days on a ſtalk of Indian corn moiſtened in the firſt brook I lighted on; but the want of air and exerciſe I could not ſo eaſily endure. I loſt the uſe of my limbs, and lay motionleſs on my back, in a corner of the hole we were confined in, covered with vermin, and ſupported, in that wretched ſtate only by the infre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent humanity of ſome ſailor, who crammed my mouth with a
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018007_0147_0FA455BA0C6C1590"/>
bit of his brown bread, ſoftened in ſtinking water. The natural vigor of my conſtitution, however, bore up againſt this complicated miſery, till, upon the concluſion of the peace we regained our freedom.</p>
                     <p>"But when I was ſet at liberty, I had not ſtrength to enjoy it; and after my companions were gone, was obliged to crawl ſeveral weeks about the ſtreets of Breſt, where the charity of ſome well-diſpoſed Frenchmen beſtowed now and then a triſle upon the <hi>panvre ſauvage,</hi> as I was called, till I recovered the exerciſe of my limbs and was able to work my paſſage in a Dutch merchant-ſhip bound for England.</p>
                     <p>"The mate of this veſſel happened to be a Scotchman, who hearing me ſpeak the language of Britain, and having enquired into the particulars of my ſtory, humanely attached himſelf to my ſervice, and made my ſituation much more comfortable than any I had for ſome time experienced, We ſailed from Breſt with a fair wind, but had not been long at ſea till it ſhifted, and blew pretty freſh at Eaſt, ſo that we were kept for ſeveral days beating up the Channel; at the end of which it increaſed to ſo violent a degree, that it was impoſſible for us to hold a courſe, and the ſhip was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſcud before the ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>"At the cloſe of the ſecond day, the wind ſuddenly chopp'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout into a weſterly point, though without any abatement of its violence; and very ſoon after day-break of the third, we were driving on the ſouth-weſt coaſt of England, right to the leeward. The conſternation of the crew became now ſo great, that if any expedient had remained to ſave us, it would have ſcarce allowed them to put it in practice.</p>
                     <p>"The mate, who ſeemed to be the ableſt ſailor on board, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them at leaſt to endeavour running the ſhip into a bay, which opened a little on our ſtarboard-quarter, where the ſhore was flat and ſandy; comforting them with the reflexion, that they ſhould be caſt on friendly ground, and not among <hi>ſavages.</hi> His advice and encouragement had the deſired effect; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the perils with which I ſaw myſelf ſurrounded, I looked with a gleam of ſatiſfaction on the coaſt of my native land, which for ſo many years I had not ſeen.</p>
                     <p>"Unfortunately a ridge of rocks ran almoſt acroſs the baſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, with infinite labor, we were directing our courſe; and the ſhip ſtruck upon them, about the diſtance of half a league from the ſhore. All was now uproar and confuſion. The longboat was lanched by ſome of the crew, who, with the captain, got immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into her, and brandiſhing their long knives, threatened with inſtant death any who ſhould attempt to follow them, as ſhe was already loaded beyond her burden. Indeed there remained at this time in the ſhip only two ſailors, the mate, and myſelf; the firſt were waſhed overboard while they hung on the ſhip's ſide attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leap into the boat, and we ſaw them no more; nor had their hard-hearted companions a better fate; they had ſcarcely
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018007_0148_0FA455BA82D013D8"/>
rowed a cable's length from the ſhip, when the boat overſet, and every one on board her periſhed. There now remained only my friend the mate, and I, who, conſulting a moment together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to keep by the ſhip till ſhe ſhould ſplit, and endeavour to ſave ourſelves on ſome broken plank which the ſtorm might drive on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>"We had juſt time to come to this reſolution, when, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a wave that broke over the ſhip, her main-maſt went by the board, and we were ſwept off the deck at the ſame inſtant. My companion could not ſwim; but I had been taught that art by my Indian friends to the greateſt degree of expertneſs. I was therefore more uneaſy about the honeſt Scotchman's fate than my own, and quitting the maſt, of which I had caught hold on its fall, ſwam to the place where he firſt roſe to the ſurface, and catching him by the hair, held his head tolerably above water, till he was able ſo far to recollect himſelf, as to cling by a part of the ſhrouds of our floating main-maſt, to which I bore him. In our paſſage to the ſhore on this ſlender float, he was ſeveral times obliged to quit his hold, from his ſtrength's being exhauſted; but I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo fortunate as to be able to replace him in his former ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till, at laſt, we were thrown upon the beach, near to the bottom of that bay at the mouth of which our ſhip had ſtruck.</p>
                     <p>"I was not ſo much ſpent by my fatigue, but that I was able to draw the mate ſafe out of the water, and advancing to a croud of people whom I ſaw aſſembled near us, began to entreat their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for him in very pathetic terms; when, to my utter aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one of them ſtruck at me with a bludgeon, while another making up to my fellow-ſufferer, would have beat out his brains with a ſtone, if I had not run up nimbly behind him, and daſh'd it from his uplifted hand. This man happened to be armed with a hanger, which he inſtantly drew, and made a furious ſtroke at my head.</p>
                     <p>"I parried his blow with my arm, and, at the ſame time, ſeizing his wriſt, gave it ſo ſudden a wrench, that the weapon dropped to the ground. I inſtantly poſſeſſed myſelf of it, and ſtood aſtride my companion with the aſpect of an angry lioneſs guarding her young from the hunter. The appearance of ſtrength and fierceneſs which my figure exhited, kept my enemies a little at bay, when fortunately we ſaw advancing a body of ſoldiers, headed by an officer, whom a gentleman of humanity in the neighbourhood had prevailed on to march to the place for the preſervation of any of the crew whom the ſtorm might ſpare, or any part of the cargo that might chance to be thrown aſhore. At ſight of this detachment the croud diſperſed, and left me maſter of the field. The officer very humanely took charge of my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and me, brought us to his quarters in the neighbourhood, and accommodated me with theſe very cloaths which I now have on. From him I learned, that thoſe Engliſhmen, who (as our mate by way of comfort obſerved) were not <hi>ſavages,</hi> had the idea
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018007_0149_0FA455BB351CAE00"/>
tranſmitted them from their fathers, that all wrecks became their property by the immediate hand of God; and, as in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that denomination belonged only to ſhips from which there landed no living thing, their hoſtile endeavors againſt the Scotchman's life and mine, proceeded from a deſire of bringing our veſſel into that ſuppoſed condition.</p>
                     <p>"After having weathered ſo many ſucceſſive diſaſters, I am at laſt arrived near the place of my nativity; fain would I hope, that a parent and a ſiſter, whoſe tender remembrance, mingled with that of happier days, now ruſhes on my ſoul, are yet alive to pardon the wanderings of my youth, and receive me after thoſe hardſhips to which its ungoverned paſſions have ſubjected me. Like the prodigal ſon, I bring no worldly wealth along with me; but I return with a mind conſcious of its former errors, and ſeeking that peace which theſe paſſions deſtroyed. To have uſed proſperity well, is the firſt favored lot of heaven; the next is his, whom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity has not ſmitten in vain."</p>

They advanced however on the line in which they imagined the lights to have appeared, when, in one of the pauſes of the ſtorm, they heard ſhrieks, in a female voice, that ſeemed to iſſue from ſome place but a little way off. They ruſhed forward in the direction of the ſound, till they were ſtopped by a pretty high high wall.</p>
                     <p>Having made ſhift to ſcramble over this, they found themſelves in the garden belonging to a low-built houſe, from one of the windows of which, they ſaw the glimmer of a candle through the openings of the ſhutters; but the voice had ceaſed, and all was ſilent within. Bolton knocked at the door, but received no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; when ſuddenly, the ſcreaming was repeated with more violence than before. He and his companion now threw themſeves with ſo much force againſt the door, as to burſt it open. They ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the room whence the noiſe proceeded; when the firſt object that preſented itſelf to Bolton was Miſs Sindall on her knees, her cloaths torn, and her hair diſhevelled, with two ſervants holding her arms, imploring mercy of ſir Thomas, who was calling out in a furious tone, "Damn your pity, raſcals, carry her to bed by force."</p>
                     <p>"Turn, villain, cried Harry, turn, and defend yourſelf." Sindall ſtarted at the well known voice, and pulling out a piſtol, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

His maſter now fired another piſtol, which would have probably taken more effect than the former, had not Bolton's new acquaintance ſtruck up the muzzle juſt as it went off, the ball going through a window at Harry's back. The baronet had his ſword now drawn in the other hand, and, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the object of his attack, he made a furious paſs at the ſoldier, who parried it with his hanger. At the ſecond lounge ſir Thomas's violence threw him on the point of his adverſary's weapon, which entered his body a little below the breaſt. He ſtaggered a few paces backwards, and clapping one hand on the place, leaned with the other on a table that ſtood behind him, and cried out, that he was a dead man. "My God! exclaimed the ſtranger, are not you ſir Thomas Sindall?" — "Sir Thomas Sindall!" cried a woman, who now entered, half-dreſſed, with the miſtreſs of the houſe, "It is, it is ſir Thomas Sindall," ſaid the landlady, "for God's ſake do his honour no hurt."

                     <p>"I HAVE been a wicked woman; may God and this lady forgive me! but heaven is my witneſs, that I was thus far on my way to confeſs all to your honour, (turning to ſir Thomas Sindall) that I might have peace in my mind before I died. You will remember, ſir, that this young lady's mother was delivered of her at the houſe of one of your tenants, where Mr. Camplin (I think that was his name,) brought her for that purpoſe. I was entruſted with the charge of her as her nurſe, along with ſome trinkets, ſuch as young children are in uſe to have, and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum of money, to provide any other neceſſaries ſhe ſhould want.</p>
                     <p>"At that very time I had been drawn in to aſſociate with a gang of pilfering vagrants, whoſe ſtolen goods I had often received into my houſe, and helped to diſpoſe of. Fearing, therefore, that I might one day be brought to an account for my paſt offences, if I remained where I was, and having at the ſame time the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a booty before me, I formed a ſcheme for making off with the money and trinkets I had got from Mr. Camplin: it was, to make things appear as if my charge and I had been loſt in croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the river, which then happened to be in flood.</p>
                     <p>"For this purpoſe, I daubed my own cloak, and the infant's wrapper, with mud and ſleech, and left them cloſe to the overflow of the ſtream, a little below the common ford. With ſhame I confeſs it, as I have often ſince thought on it with horror, I was more than once tempted to drown the child, that ſhe might not be a burden to me in my flight; but ſhe looked ſo innocent and ſweet, while ſhe claſped my fingers in her little hand, that I had not the heart to execute my purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:018007_0152_0FA455BD8D6AAD58"/>Having endeavoured in this manner to account for my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, ſo as to prevent all farther enquiry, I joined a party of thoſe wretches, whoſe aſſociate I had ſome time been, and left that part of the country altogether. By their aſſiſtance too, I was put on a method of diſguiſing my face ſo much, that had any of my acquaintance met me, of which there, was very little chance, it would have been ſcarce poſſible for them to recollect it. My booty was put into the common ſtock, and the child was found uſeful to raiſe compaſſion when we went a-begging, which was one part of the occupation we followed.</p>
                     <p>"After I had continued in this ſociety the beſt part of a year, during which time we met with various turns of fortune, a ſcheme was formed by the remaining part of us (for ſeveral of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions had been baniſhed, or confined to hard labour in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val) to break into the houſe of a wealthy farmer, who, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, had a few days before received a large ſum of money on a bargain for the leaſe of an eſtate, which the proprietor had redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our project was executed with ſucceſs; but a quarrel ariſing about the diſtribution of the ſpoil, one of the gang deſerted, and informed a neighbouring juſtice of the whole tranſaction, and the places of our retreat.</p>
                     <p>"I happened to be a fortune-telling in this gentleman's houſe, when his informer came to make the diſcovery; and, being cloſetted with one of the maid ſervants, overheard him enquiring for the juſtice, and deſiring to have ſome converſation with him in private. I immediately ſuſpected his deſign, and having got out of the houſe, eluded purſuit by my knowlege in the by-paths and private roads of the country.</p>
                     <p>"It immediately occurred to me to diſburden myſelf of the child, as ſhe not only retarded my flight, but was a mark by which I might be diſcovered; but, abandoned as I had then become, I found myſelf attached to her by that ſort of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I would not, therefore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her in any of thoſe unfrequented places through which I paſſed in my flight, where her death muſt have been the certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and, two or three times, when I would have dropped her at ſome farmer's door, I was prevented by the fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                     <p>"At laſt I happened to meet with yoor honour. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, ſir, that the ſame night on which this lady, then an infant, was found, a beggar aſked alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was that beggar, and hearing from a boy who held your horſe, that your name was ſir Thomas Sindall, and that you were returning to a hunting-ſeat you had in the neighourhood, I left the infant on a narrow part of the road a little way before you, where it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible you ſhould miſs of finding her, and ſtood at the back of a hedge to obſerve your behaviour when you came up.

I was tried for the crime, and was caſt for tranſportation. Before I was put on board the ſhip that was to carry me and ſeveral others abroad, I wrote a few lines to your honour, acquainting you with the circumſtances of my behaviour towards your daughter; but this, I ſuppoſe, as it was entruſted to a boy who uſed to go on errands for the priſoners, has never come to your hands.</p>
                     <p>"Not long ago I returned from tranſportation, and betook myſelf to my old courſe of life again. But I happened to be ſeized with the ſmall pox, that raged in a village I paſſed through; and, partly from the violence of the diſtemper, partly from the want of proper care in the firſt ſtages of it, was brought ſo low, that a phyſician, whoſe humanity induced him to viſit me, gave me over for loſt, I found that the terrors of death on a ſick-bed had more effect on my conſcience than all the hardſhips I had formerly undergone, and I began to look back with the keeneſt remorſe on a life ſo ſpent as mine had been. It pleaſed God, however, that I ſhould recover, and I have ſince endeavoured to make ſome reparation for my paſt offences by my penitence.</p>
                     <p>"Amongſt other things, I often reflected on what I had done with regard to your child; and being ſome days ago accidentally near Sindall-Park, I went thither, and tried to learn ſomething of what had befallen her. I underſtood, from ſome of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that a young lady had been brought up from her infancy with your aunt, and was ſaid to be the daughter of a friend of yours, who had committed her to your care at his death. But, upon enquiring into the time of her being brought to your houſe, I was perſuaded that ſhe muſt be the ſame I had conjectured, imputing the ſtory of her being another's, to your deſire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing that ſhe was yours, which I imagined you had learned from the letter I wrote before my tranſportation; till meeting, at a houſe of entertainment, with a ſervant of your honour's, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, in the courſe of our converſation, that it was reported you were going to be married to the young lady who had lived ſo long in your family.</p>
                     <p>"On hearing this I was confounded, and did not know what to think; but, when I began to fear that my letter had never reached you, I trembled at the thought of what my wickedneſs might occaſion, and could have no eaſe in my mind, till I ſhould ſet out for Bilſwood to confeſs the whole affair to your honour. I was to-night overtaken by the ſtorm near this houſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on the landlady, though it ſeemed much againſt her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to permit me to take up my quarters here. About half an hour ago I was waked with the ſhreiks of ſome perſon in diſtreſs,

and upon aſking the landlady, who lay in the ſame room with me, what was the matter, ſhe bid me be quiet and ſay nothing; for it was only a worthy gentleman of her acquaintance, who had overtaken a young girl, a foundling he had bred up, that had ſtolen a ſum of money from his houſe, and run away with one of his footmen.</p>
                     <p>"At the word <hi>foundling,</hi> I felt a kind of ſomething I cannot deſcribe, and I was terrified when I overheard ſome part of your diſcourſe, and gueſſed what your intentions were; I roſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in ſpite of the landlady, and had got thus far dreſſed, when we heard the door burſt open, and preſently a noiſe of fighting above ſtairs. Upon this we ran up together, and to what has happened ſince, this company has been witneſs."</p>

                     <p>IT is not eaſy to deſcribe the ſenſations of Sindall or Lucy, when the ſecret of her birth was unfolded. In the countenance of the laſt were mingled the indications of fear and pity, joy and wonder; while her father, turned upon her an eye of tenderneſs chaſtened with ſhame. "Oh! thou injured innocence! ſaid he, for I know not how to call thee child, canſt thou forgive thoſe — Good God! Bolton, from what haſt thou ſaved me!" Lucy was now kneeling at his feet.—</p>
                     <p>"Talk not, ſir, ſaid ſhe, of the errors of the paſt; methinks I look on it as ſome horrid dream, which it dizzies my head to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect. My father!—Gracious God! have I a father?—I cannot ſpeak; but there are a thouſand things that beat here!—is there another parent to whom I ſhould alſo kneel?"</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas caſt up a look to heaven, and his groans ſtopped, for a while, his utterance.—"Oh! Harriet! if thou art now an angel of Mercy, look down and forgive the wretch that murdered thee!"—"Harriet!" exclaimed the ſoldier, ſtarting at the ſound, "what Harriet? what Harriet?" Sindall looked earneſtly in his face—"Oh! heavens! he cried, art thou? — ſure thou art! — Anneſly!—look not, look not on me—thy ſiſter—but I ſhall not live for thy upbraidings — thy ſiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the mother of my child! —Thy father —to what does this moment of reflexion reduce me! — thy father fell with his daughter, the victims of that villainy which overcame her innocence!" Anneſly looked ſternly upon him, and anger for a moment enflamed his cheeks; but it gave way to ſofter feelings — "What, both! both!" — and he burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>Bolton now ſtepped up to this new-acquired friend. "I am, ſaid he, comparatively, but a ſpectator of this fateful ſcene; let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to comfort the diſtreſs of the innocent, and alleviate the pangs of the guilty.

Lucy) a mediatrix, who forgets the man in the father." Anneſly gazed upon her. "She is, ſhe is, he cried, the daughter of my Harriet; — that eye, that lip, that look of ſorrow!" — He flung himſelf on her neck; Bolton look'd on them enraptur'd; and even the languor of Sindall's face, was croſs'd with a gleam of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pleaſure!</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas's ſervant now arrived accompanied by a ſurgeon, who upon examining and dreſſing his wound, was of opinion, that in itſelf it had not the appearance of imminent danger, but that from the ſtate of his pulſe he was apprehenſive of a ſupervening fever. He ordered him to be put to bed, and his room to be kept as quiet as poſſible. As this gentleman was an acquaintance of Bolton's, the latter informed him of the ſtate in which ſir Thomas's mind muſt be from the diſcoveries that the preceding hour had made to him. Upon which the ſurgeon begged that he might, for the preſent, avoid ſeeing Miſs Sindall or Mr. Anneſly, or talking with any one on the ſubject of thoſe diſcoveries; but he could not prevent the intruſion of thought; and not many hours after, his patient fell into a roving ſort of ſlumber, in which he would often ſtart, and muttter the words Harriet, Lucy, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                     <p>Bolton and Lucy now enjoyed one of thoſe luxurious interviews, which abſence, and hardſhips during that abſence, procure to ſouls formed for each other. She related to him all her paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, of which my readers have been already informed, and added the account of that night's event, part of which only they have heard.

With this, after the moſt horrid denunciations of vengeance in caſe of a refuſal, the poor fellow was fain to comply; and hence his terror, when they were leaving the houſe. They had proceeded but juſt ſo far on their way, as ſir Thomas thought proper for the accompliſhment of his deſign, when he, with his valet de chambre, and another ſervant, who were confidants of their maſter's pleaſures, made up to them, and after pretending to upbraid Lucy for the imprudence and treachery of her flight he carried her to this houſe of one of thoſe pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"I know not, ſaid Anneſly, how to talk of thoſe matters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted as I have been, with the manners of poliſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial nations. When I have any particular deſtination for money I will demand your aſſiſtance; in the mean time, conſider me as a minor, and uſe the truſt already repoſed in you, for my advantage and the advantage of thoſe whom miſfortune has allied to me."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIV. Sir Thomas's ſituation. — The expreſſion of his penitence.</head>
                     <p>NEXT morning, Sindall, by the advice of his ſurgeon, was removed in a litter to his own houſe, where he was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attended by an eminent phyſician in aid of that gentleman's abilities. Purſuant to his earneſt entreaties, he was accompanied thither by Anneſly and Bolton. Lucy having obtained leave of his medical attendants, watched her father in the character of nurſe. They found on their arrival that Mrs. Booth by, having learned the revolutions of the preceding night, had left the place, and taken the road towards London. "I think not of her, ſaid ſir Thomas; but there is another perſon, whom my former conduct baniſhed from my houſe, whom I now wiſh to ſee in this aſſemblage of her friends, the worthy Mrs. Wiſtanly." Lucy undertook to write her an account of her ſituation, and to ſollicit her compliance with the requeſt of her father. The old lady, who had ſtill ſtrength and activity enough left for doing good, accepted the invitation; and the day following ſhe was with them at Bilſwood.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas ſeemed to feel a ſort of melancholy ſatisfaction in having this company of thoſe he had injured aſſembled under his roof. When he was told of Mrs. Wiſtanly's arrival, he deſired to ſee her, and taking her hand, "I have ſent for you, madam, ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

of the paſt." He then confeſſed to her that plan of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction by which he had overcome the virtue of Anneſly, and the honour of his ſiſter. "You were a witneſs, he concluded, of the fall of that worth and innocence which it was in the power of my former crimes to deſtroy; you are now come to behold the retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of heaven on the guilty. By that hand whom it commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to avenge a parent and a ſiſter, I am cut off in the midſt of my days." "I hope not, ſir, anſwered ſhe; your life, I truſt, will make a better expiation. In the puniſhments of the divinity there is no idea of vengeance; and the infliction of what we term evil, ſerves equally the purpoſe of univerſal benignity, with the diſpenſation of good." "I feel, replied ſir Thomas, the force of that obſervation: the pain of this wound; the preſentiment of death which it inſtils; the horror with which the recollection of my inceſtuous paſſion ſtrikes me; all theſe are in the catalogue of of my bleſſings. They indeed take from me the world; but they give me myſelf." A viſit from his phyſician interrupted their diſcourſe; that gentleman did not prognoſticate ſo fatally for his patient; he found the frequency or his pulſe conſiderably abated, and expreſſed his hopes, that the ſucceding night, his reſt would be better than it had been. In this he was not miſtaken; and next morning the doctor continued to think ſir Thomas mending; but himſelf perſiſted in the belief that he ſhould not recover.</p>
                     <p>For ſeveral days, however, he appeared rather to gain ground than to loſe it; but afterwards he was ſeized with hectic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>its a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſtated intervals, and when they left him, be complained of a univerſal weakneſs and depreſſion. During all this time Lucy was ſeldom away from his bed-ſide: from her preſence he derived peculiar pleaſure; and ſometimes when he was ſo low as to be ſcarce able to ſpeak, would mutter out bleſſings on her head, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her his ſaint, his gurdian angel!</p>
                     <p>After he had exhauſted all the powers of medicine, under the direction of ſome of the ableſt of the faculty, they acknowleged all farther aſſiſtance to be vain, and one of them warned him, in a friendly manner, of his approaching end. He received this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the utmoſt compoſure, as an event which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the begining, thanked the phyſician for his candor, and deſired that his friends might be ſummoned around him, while he had yet ſtrength enough left to bid them adieu.</p>
                     <p>When he ſaw them aſſembled, he delivered into Bolton's hands a paper, which he told him was his will. "To this, ſaid he, I would not have any of thoſe privy, who are intereſted in its bequeſts; and therefore I had it executed at the begining of my illneſs, without their participation. You will find yourſelf, my dear Harry, maſter of my fortune, under a condition, which, I believe, you will not eſteem a hardſhip. Give me your hand; let me join it to my Lucy's; — there!— if heaven receives the prayer of a penitent, it will pour its richeſt bleſſings upon you.</p>
                     <p>"There are a few proviſions in that paper, which Mr. Bolton, I know, will find a pleaſure in fulfilling. Of what I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to you, Mrs. Wiſtanly, the contentment you enjoy in

                        </gap>; receive my forgiveneſs for that wound which the arm of Providence made me provoke from yours; and when you look on a parent's and a ſiſter's tomb, ſpare the memory of him whoſe death ſhall then have expiated the wrongs he did you!"— Tears were the only anſwer he received.—He pauſed a moment; then looking round with ſomething in his eye more elevated and ſolemn, "I have now, ſaid he, diſcharged the world; mine has been called a life of pleaſure; had I breath, I could tell you how falſe the title is; alas! I knew not how to live.—Merciful God! I thank thee —thou haſt taught me how to die;"</p>
                     <p>At the cloſe of this diſcourſe, his ſtrength, which he had exerted to the utmoſt, ſeemed altogether ſpent; and he ſunk down in the bed, in a ſtate ſo like death, that for ſome time his attendants imagined him to have actually expired. When he did revive, his ſpeech appeared to be loſt; he could juſt make a feeble ſign for a cordial that ſtood on the table near his bed: he put it to his lips, then laid his head on the pillow, as if reſigning himſelf to his fate.</p>
                     <p>Lucy was too tender to bear the ſcene; her friend. Mrs. Wiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, led her, almoſt fainting, out of the room; "That grief, my dear Miſs Sindall, ſaid ſhe, it too amiable to be blamed; but your father ſuggeſted a conſolation which your piety will allow: of thoſe who have led his life, how few have cloſed it like him!"</p>
                     <div type="conclusion">
                        <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>EARLY</hi> next morning ſir Thomas Sindall expired. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable zeal of the coroner prompted him to hold an inqueſt on his body; the jury brought in their verdict Self defence. But there was a judge in the boſom of Anneſly, whom it was more difficult to ſatisfy; nor could he for a long time be brought to pardon himſelf that blow, for which the juſtice of his country had acquitted him. After paying their laſt duty to ſir Thomas's remains, the family removed to Sindall-Park. Mrs. Wiſtanly was prevailed on to leave her own houſe for a while, and preſide in that of which Bolton was now maſter. His delicacy needed not the ceremonial of faſhion to reſtrain him from preſſing Miſs Sindall's conſent to their marriage, till a decent time had been yielded to the memory of her father.</p>
                        <p>When that was elapſed, he received from her uncle that hand, which ſir Thomas had bequeathed him, and which mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment intitled him to receive. Their happineſs is equal to their merit: I am often a witneſs of it; for they honour me with a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which I know not how I have deſerved, unleſs by having few other friends. Mrs. Wiſtanly and I are conſidered as members of the family. But their benevolence is univerſal; the country ſmiles around them with the effects of their goodneſs. This is indeed the only real ſuperiority which wealth has to beſtow; I never envied riches ſo much, as ſince I have known Mr. Bolton. I have lived too long to be caught with the pomp of declamation, or the glare of an apothegm; but I ſincerely believe, that you could not take from them a <hi>virtue</hi> without deſerving them of a <hi>pleaſure.</hi>
