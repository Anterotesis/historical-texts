            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THOU haſt here preſented to thy View, <hi>A GLIMPSE of GLORY</hi> from the heavenly <hi>Zion,</hi> ſo bright and lively, as nothing of humane Compoſure, yet extant, can equal. A Ray of ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Fire, as, being received into an Heart affected with Eternal Objects, may prove a bleſt Mean to inflame it into a Divine Rapture of holy Longing, to ſee, and enjoy theſe unſeen Things, which are here in ſo bright Colours repreſented. Whoſoever will in Sincerity, and with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, peruſe this ſmall TREATISE, will be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a delightful Contemplation of divine and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things, as may, in a Manner, tranſport his very Soul into that heavenly <hi>Paradiſe</hi>; carry him along the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Banks of that pure River of the Water of Life; and repreſent to the Eyes of his Mind, that noble and glorious Company that ſtands about the LAMB, on Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> in white Robes, with Palms in their Hands, ſinging a new Song of Praiſe to JEHOVAH and the LAMB. Here ſhall he find the incomparable Beauties of that upper <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and royal Palace of the King of Kings, deſcribed ſo brightly, in ſuch high and lofty Expreſſions, as well ſuit theſe ſublime and ſupernatural Objects; and yet withal ſo eaſy to be underſtood, that
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005510_0003_101848B56311F760"/>
the meaneſt Capacity, exerciſed in ſpiritual Things may apprehend the true Senſe and Meaning of them. The holy Heart of the Author has been ſo much in Heaven, that from the End of the <hi>Prelude,</hi> to the Concluſion, he talks altogether like one in Heaven already, and as a Poſſeſſor of the GLORY he deſcribes: Which is to be attentively noticed, for the better underſtanding of the Scope and Intent of the Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Deſcription of Heaven, and the Glory which the Saints ſhall enjoy there; (which is the profeſſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Book:) There are not a few other excellent Subjects interſperſed, and pretty largely handled. How ſweetly doth he expatiate upon the Praiſes of Chriſt, the ever-bleſſed Redeemer? How lively doth he deſcribe him, in his humbled State: his humble, laborious, ſorrowful, yet holy Life; his painful, ſhameful and accurſed Death; his infinite Love to his Choſen, that put him upon all that voluntary Humiliation and Suffering? With what Raviſhment doth he admire the Difference of theſe Two, ſo diſtant Eſtates? In what ſweet, lively and bright Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions doth he declare the mutual Intercourſe betwixt this glorious Redeemer, and his Choſen, eſpecially in the upper HOUSE? It is alſo another great Aim of the Author, to diſplay the Attributes of GOD, to his Glory: His Grace &amp; Mercy towards the Elect; his Sovereignty in his Works of Creation, Providence, and eſpecially Election; his Truth &amp; Faithfulneſs, in making good all his Promiſes; his Unchangeableneſs, in his Purpoſes of Love and Grace to his own; his ſpotleſs Holineſs and Juſtice, in puniſhing the Wicked. How lofty is he in deſcribing the Sovereignty of God over his Creatures; either to create, or not create, elect, or paſs by, as he pleaſed? How ſweet, large &amp; raviſhing is he, in holding forth the FREEDOM &amp; RICHES of REDEEMING GRACE! And how doth he exult and glory in the Unchangeableneſs of God, which ſecures the ſame to all Eternity? His wonderful Wiſdom, in contriving the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:005510_0003_101848B56311F760"/>
Saints Way to the Kingdom, thro' a Life of Sufferings, Afflictions, Poverty, Labours, Watchings, Sorrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is pleaſantly cleared up; and many myſterious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, relating thereunto, judiciouſly unfolded; which may ſerve much for Confirmation and Conſolation to many poor drooping Believers. In deſcribing the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice of God, in the eternal Puniſhment of the Damned, he takes Occaſion largely to delineate the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eſtate of the Ungodly: Nor is this improper for his Subject; for Contraries, ſet beſide other, ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten one another. He ſets forth their extreme Miſery from the Greatneſs of their Torments; the great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Loſs they undergo, in their eternal Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Preſence of GOD and the LAMB; the Eternity, yet Juſtice of their Puniſhment: Which Juſtice he founds not on an arbitrary Conſtitution, but on the infinite Holineſs, Juſtice and Sovereignty of God, againſt whom Sin is an infinite Offence, as ſtriking againſt his very BEING and GLORY; and therefore deſerving an Infinity of Puniſhment. The Blaſphemies they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually belch forth againſt their Creator, for his puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them, tho' at the ſame Time their Conſciences ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him juſt; and their horrid Inclination to fulfil their Luſts, tho' they cannot: All which he reckons their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as well as their Sin, for he was at no Loſs to believe, <hi>That there is Sinning in Hell.</hi> And finally here is ſet forth the holy Triumph of the Righteous over the Wicked, Devils and Men, once their mortal Enemies; now laid low under the Soles of their Feet, and for ever baniſhed their holy and happy Society. All which the Author deſcribes in ſuch a moving and pathetick Manner as might cauſe an Adamantine Heart to relent &amp; tremble, and to enquire, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved? How ſhall I eſcape the Wrath to come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, to bring Souls to ſuch a ſerious Enquiry, and draw Hearts from this baſe, empty Earth, to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt after Heaven and Salvation, is the great Aim of the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005510_0004_101848B8565A5210"/>
Author through all this Book. And hence, how pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and vigorous is he, in his Inviting, Perſwading, and Reaſoning with the Unconverted (whom he commonly ſtiles <hi>Worldlings,</hi> becauſe yet intangled in the Luſts of the World) to awaken them to a due Concern about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Things, and wean their Hearts from earthly Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and by leſſening their Eſteem of them, to draw their Affections from them?</p>
            <p>And that ſuch as are perſwaded, ſeriouſly to mind and apply themſelves to this noble and neceſſary Study, may not want an Help at Hand, to diſcover to them the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Badneſs of their Eſtate: He hath added in the Concluſion of the Work a conſiderable Number of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Marks or Notes, whereby a Chriſtian may diſcern his being in Chriſt, and whether he be in an heavenly Frame, or not; alſo by them a formal Hypocrite may be detected.</p>
            <p>If there be any Flights of lofty and ſublime Thought, here and there, that may offend the Cenſorious, 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, That before they cenſure, they would firſt compare them with the Similitudes and Expreſſions of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and next with the Sentiments of ſound Divines, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome Grains of Allowance, on Conſideration of the ſublime and rapturous Way of writing, here uſed; and, 'tis confidently preſumed, they'll find Nothing, but what is moſt agreeable to Truth, in this whole Tractate. There is a Sentence, Sect. 54, where he ſeems to make <hi>Sincerity</hi> the Condition of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> as Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Obedience was the Condition of the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi>; which may perhaps offend ſome, who diſlike the very Term <hi>Condition in a Covenant of Grace.</hi> But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conſiders how large and pathetick he is, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the free Grace of God, and aſcribing all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Redemption and Salvation to Chriſt, and only to Chriſt, muſt be perſwaded, he cannot mean, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's Sincerity, or any Grate of his whatſoever, is the Condition of the New Covenant, in a legal Senſe; for ſo
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:005510_0004_101848B8565A5210"/>
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone is the Condition of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Nor can we charitably judge, That this Term, <hi>Condition,</hi> is in any worſe or ſtricter Senſe affirmed of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> which preſuppoſeth and includes Faith, than it is of Faith it ſelf, in the 32 <hi>Anſwer</hi> of our <hi>Larger Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</hi> It is clear then, That the Author takes <hi>Condition</hi> in a large Senſe, for any Thing required or accepted in the new Covenant: And ſo it is true, That as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Works were to be perfect, in Order to Acceptation; ſo the Believer's good Works cannot be accepted without Sincerity; and will, thro' Chriſt, be accepted when Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere: Which muſt certainly be all the Author intends by <hi>Condition</hi> in that Place.</p>
            <p>He is alſo pretty poſitive in his Opinion of the Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Earth and viſible Heavens, at the Day of Judgment; which he deſcribes in bright and beautiful Emblems. The Opinion is indeed controverted among the Learned: But moſt of the Orthodox are of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Side. Hence, when he is ſpeaking of Things in that renewed State, after the Day of Judgment, none needs marvel, that he calls <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars everlaſting,</hi> and the Earth an <hi>eternal Monument,</hi> as in Sect. 43; Or, ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at any ſuch uncommon Expreſſions: For he ſpeaks as one beyond Time in Eternity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the intelligent and obſerving Reader will here find ſuch a ſurpriſing Variety of the moſt profound Goſpel-Myſteries, interwoven in ſuch a beautiful and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contexture, as will every where entertain his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with an uncommon Delight.</p>
            <p>'Tis hoped, none will deſiderate Method, or quarrel the Want thereof as a Defect; if it be but reminded, That devotional Books, amongſt which this may juſtly claim a chief Room, are not uſually aſtricted to the Rules of Art and <hi>Logical</hi> Method: It being the Deſign of ſuch Writers, not ſo much to pleaſe the Fancy, or entertain the Underſtanding with an orderly Ranging &amp; Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Things, as to quicken and inflame the Affections
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:005510_0005_101848BC60F3D250"/>
with divine and ſublime Meditations: Where, not a Gingle of empty Eloquence fills the Ear; but heavenly and ſupernatural Objects, brought down, as it were, from the eternal World of Spirits, and made familiar to the Underſtanding, move and engage the Heart, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Soul to follow hard after theſe only worthy and ſubſtantial Delights. And beſides, the intelligent Reader will find upon due Peruſal, that 'tis not a meer rude Heap of indigeſted Matter; but that there is really a comely Order obſerved, in the Diſpoſing of the Thoughts herein contained, which will ſufficiently gratifie the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, while the incomparable Matter melts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the Affections.</p>
            <p>As for the Titles of the Sections, the Publiſhers were not aſſured, whether they were added by the Author himſelf, or by ſome other Hand: Nay, they did not want Ground of Suſpicion, both from the Difference of Expreſſion, and ſometimes from the Unſuitableneſs to the Matter, that ſome leſs ſkilful Perſon had added them. Yet having no Copies ſave one (except the Letters, and Saint's Song, whereof we found ſeveral Copies) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, 'twas tho't ſafeſt to retain them, leſt any Thing might be deſiderate that was in the Manuſcript: And the judicious Reader is left to his Choice, whether to read on the Matter, without Regard to theſe Titles, or otherwiſe; for it muſt be owned, That, conſidering the Variety of heavenly Purpoſes, ſometimes comprized in one of theſe Paragraphs, 'tis no eaſie Matter for any Man to deviſe an appoſite Title, to expreſs the Subſtance of the Matter therein contained.</p>
            <p>There is no Doubt, but the Reader, by this Time, will be longing for ſome Account of the Author: And it were to be wiſhed, that a true and genuine Relation of the Life of that pious Youth could have been recovered, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further to oblige the Publick; which had it been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, no Pains would have been ſpared to tranſmit it: And without all Doubt, ſuch a Life would have been a

rare and excellent Draught, worthy of Chriſtian Imitation. He was the Son of a godly Father, Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at <hi>Tondergirth</hi> in <hi>Annandole</hi>; concerning whom there is related this remarkable Paſſage. When the LORD had taken away from him his beloved Wife, the Deſire of his Eyes, he ſpent the whole enſuing Night in Prayer and Medication in his Garden. One of the Elders of the Pariſh coming next Morning to viſit him, and condoling his Want of Reſt by Reaſon of the Diſpenſation ſo lately befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len him, he replied thus, or to this Effect: <q>I declare I have not all this Night had one Thought concerning the Death of my Spouſe; I have been ſo wholly taken up with the Meditation of heavenly Things. I have been this Night upon the Banks of <hi>Ulai,</hi> plucking an Apple here and there.</q> This Paſſage plainly ſhews what a heavenly Soul this holy Man hath been; and how plentifully this gracious Youth, his Son, hath been bleſſed with the ſame Spirit, is abundantly evident from the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe. His Brother Mr. <hi>John Welwood</hi> was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well known to many, and his Memory ſtill favory to all that knew him, for his Holineſs, Diligence in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the Miniſtry, amidſt many Perils from Bloody Perſecutors and falſe Brethren; his undaunted Zeal and Courage in the Cauſe of Chriſt, tho' under a very weak and ſickly Conſtitution of Body. What a Life of Faith he lived in theſe Perillous Times, is evident from ſeveral Letters of his, written to his Godly Acquaintances, and Friends, yet extant in Manuſcript. And as he excelled in the Grace of Faith, ſo this holy Youth, the Author, ſeems to have peculiarly abounded in that of Love, as will be abundantly manifeſt from the whole of this heavenly Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate. And how zealous he was for the royal Prerogatives of his lovely Redeemer, uſurped by wicked Rulers; and the public Concerns of His Houſe and Glory; may be gathered from ſeveral Paſſages in this Treatiſe, tho' the Nature of the Subject did not permit him to enlarge much this Way. It appears plainly, from his Letters annexed
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:005510_0006_101848BE23DD84C0"/>
to this Treatiſe, that he deſigned to have ſerved the Lord Chriſt in the Work of the Miniſtry, if it had pleaſed the Lord to have continued his Abode here below: But the good Lord was pleaſed early to tranſport him from the Wilderneſs of Earth to the Paradiſe of Glory; and to accept the Will, in that Matter, for the Deed, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaketh. He died at <hi>London,</hi> in Time of our late Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, as would ſeem, of a Conſumption; under which Affliction, how much he profited and grew in Grace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears alſo evidently from the ſame Letters. He conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his holy and happy, tho' ſhort, Life, with the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Aſſurance of obtaining that Coeleſtial Bleſſedneſs, he here deſcribes, and quietly ſlept in the Lord. And tho' the reſt of the Hiſtory of his Life cannot here be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Writing, (as was deſign'd, if certain Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could have been obtained) yet there is here a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Tranſcript of it to be read; for no doubt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to live what he wrote, and ſuch a laſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment erected to the Glory of his Redeemer, as will alſo ſerve to tranſmit his Memory embalmed to Poſterity, without needing an Elogium from any other Hand.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the Treatiſe it ſelf will, upon due Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal, ſo approve it ſelf to every gracious Heart, by its heavenly and divine Strain; the noble Deſign it drives, namely to exalt Chriſt, and allure Souls to him, by its moſt ſweet and taking Compoſure; its Stile being both lofty, as to the Subject, and condeſcending to the moſt I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>literate; and finally by the ſweet Diſcoveries it makes of that holy City, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Hope, Reſt and Joy of all the Saints: The Treatiſe, I ſay, will ſo recommend it ſelf, as that it ſhall need no Ivy to be hung out to invite the Paſſenger; and will only need to be known, to recommend it ſufficiently to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Soul.</p>
            <p>That the Almighty Lord, with whom is the Reſidue of the Spirit, and who only can command the Bleſſing, may make this TREATISE a bleſſed Mean, in the Hand

of his holy Spirit, to build up and comfort Believers, to quicken them to Heavenly-mindedneſs, and draw them from the too eager Love of this Earth; and awaken, allure and draw Sinners to JESUS CHRIST, charmed and raviſhed with the unspeakable Glory of the great Reward, here deſcribed, which He hath promiſed to all them that turn from Iniquity, and ſincerely love Him; is the earneſt Deſire of the Publiſhers.</p>

            <p>ROUSE thee, O my Soul, from this baſe and contagious Earth: Why ſhould lower Thoughts, and baſe Aims poſſeſs thee thus? What haſt thou here, that may draw thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from the Centre of thy Felicity, but for one Moment? If this World, in her roſy and youthful Conſtitution, be very Vanity and Vexation of Spirit; what muſt there be now in her ſad and withered State? If in her Smiles, ſhe be not worth the regarding; what Folly is it, to court a frowning Nothing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it Time, O my Soul, to place one Beam of thy Affection upon ſuch a filly, baſe Dunghill, ſo as to give it an affectionate Look? Trample it under thy Feet: Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thy ſelf after the Manner of theſe, who expect the Kingdom. GOD hath formed thee of ſuch a capacious Conſtitution as nothing can ſatisfy thee below his infinite SELF; and ſhouldſt thou be confined, in thy Outgoings, within the Limits of this lower, ſmoky Region? Mount up ſwiftly, far above the Sun, Moon and Stars, beyond the Borders of this narrow Vault, where thou mayeſt ſweetly bathe thy ſelf, in theſe Oceans of Joys and Felicity, that know neither Brim nor Bottom: Thou art not to waſte away thy Conceptions on Things to Day in their Vigour, and to Morrow they are not: Shadows, empty Nothings, Night-dreams &amp; Vanities, inſufficient Objects for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of ſuch a noble Being, to fix upon. Art thou not
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005510_0009_101848C7F92424B0"/>
beginning to conſider of a more enduring Subſtance? The Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, <hi>Emmanuel</hi>'s glorious, ſtately and ever flouriſhing Land, the ſmiling, roſy Place where his Servants do inceſſantly ſerve him, and ſee his Face eternally, without a Cloud; where our all-lovely WELBELOVED doth corporally dwell, and ſhall for ever take up his eternal Abode; a fruitful, fragrant, beautiful, delightſom Soil, overflowing with the true and real <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia</hi>; a Garden of Delights, a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of Pleaſures, planted at the Beginning by the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's own Right-hand, whereon he hath manifeſted, in an high &amp; tranſcendent Manner, the incomprehenſible Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Power, Love and Goodneſs, wonderfully, above what Eye hath ſeen, Ear hath heard, or the Mind of Man, within the Tents of Mortality, conſidered: What a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Frame is this! O the alluring Objects up above! The firſt Thought whereof ſet all on a Flame: O what Deſires! O what Longings! When ſhall Mortality be ſwallowed up of Life, Death of Victory, Time of Eternity, Miſeries of Bleſſedneſs, Sorrows of Joys, Pains of Pleaſures, painted Enjoyments &amp; Delights of his Love &amp; eternal Sweetneſs?</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Creatures are ever in Action, eſpecially theſe of the higheſt and moſt noble Rank, which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have ſome Object or other, to fix their Outgoings upon: The moſt excellent and ſublime are then to be choſen; and what more excellent, than what will fill all the Powers and Faculties of bleſſed Men and Angels throughout all Eternity?</p>
            <p n="4">4. To take a View of the higher <hi>Canaan,</hi> is neither Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity nor Audacity, but a neceſſary Duty, lying upon all, who are travelling thither: The Advantages of ſuch a noble Study cannot be told, nay, nor conceived, but by the Exerciſed therein.</p>
            <p n="5">5. According to the Knowledge, ſo are the Affections, both as to Kind and Degree: What we know not, that we cannot love; &amp; what we behold lovely, we cannot but love it. Seraphick Spirits, no Wonder you are ofttimes

Ah ſilly Worldlings, you cannot but have a drooping Life of it; ſince you know nothing but Earth: Had you an half Glimpſe of the more enduring Subſtance of the ever-flouriſhing, never-fading Glory, how ſhould you be in an unexperienced Frame of Joy and Admiration! How ſhould you diſdain all the leſſer Beauties on this Side of Time! But ah! you never ſaw the enduring Glory; and what Wonder you are as you are?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Mortality hath no greater Joy, than the ſolid Hope of Glory; the Sweetneſs, ariſing from the ſolid Hope of ſo great Things, fills the Soul with wonderful Raviſhments, and perfumes the loweſt of earthly Enjoyments: Surpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Joys to my Soul: Theſe temporal Things, my LORD beſtows upon me, are as Pledges of the fair Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.

If we ſearch not for the Glory to come, then let us ſearch after nothing at all. Sirs, what Madneſs, to notice this Earth, unleſs in Order to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Do you not clearly ſee all your temporary Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments die in the Birth? Are not the gliſtering Shews of Men on this Stage of the World, like the Appearance of Aerial Things in the Clouds?

            <p>Is it not evident, we have our Eyes too much upon Shadows, and that we divide our Looks betwixt Heaven and Earth; ſince our Joys are more carnal than ſpiritual, and our Longings and Deſires run ſo little heaven-ward? Ah, our Love to the only WELBELOVED, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that that every Nation carries to their God; elſe we would be often crying out, Is not my Welbeloved gone unto another Country? and ſhall not my Heart &amp; Love for ever dwell there, and only there? Sit I down here, When he hath removed himſelf to another Place? Can there be any Thing deſirable where he is not? O, all ye Beauties of this lower World, what are you to me, if my LORD be abſent ? Let me paſs through all poſſible Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, even through ten thouſand Oceans of burning Fire and Brimſtone; providing I land at laſt, on that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times happy Place, where he for ever dwells; that theſe Arms may be bleſſed in embracing, theſe Eyes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal beholding, and all my Faculties may be filled with his eternally raviſhing Sweetneſs. Oh, when ſhall I behold thy Countenance! When ſhall I hear thy Voice! When ſhall I ſtand amongſt theſe happy, happy, happy Ones, who ſtand in the immediate Preſence of thy all-glorious Majeſty, and have the naked, immediate and clear Viſion of thine eternally raviſhing Godhead; Ah, how is it I think of any Thing, but Heaven? Why are we not ever in an impatient Longing, to be in his everlaſting Embraces? Know we what it is, to take him for our only WELBE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVED?

Do not the Tho'ts of our being in his naked Embraces ere long, fill us with an Extaſy of Joy?

Had we the Impreſſions of Glory on our Spirits, lower Objects ſhould not eaſily draw down our Tho'ts, or turn them aſide; yea, our higher Powers ſhould be ſo ſtrongly affected, as that the lower Powers ſhould be regulated even in Sleep; our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations would be compoſing and dividing the Ideas of the Life to come, they received, according to their Natures, from the higher Faculties.

            <p>I am quite amazed, confounded and raviſhed at once. O eternal Dwelling-place of bleſſed Men and Angels, and of the MAN infinitely more excellent than all! How am I affected with thy various Beauty, excellent Glory, and delightſom Sweetneſs! What appeareſt thou now, O lower World? Thou art the Dunghil; this the Palace-royal: Thou art the Footſtool, this the Throne. Were the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains betwixt the higher and lower World drawn aſide, all lower Glories would diſappear: All Glories are here, and only here: This is the World. Where ſhall we find Emblems any where elſe, ſufficient to repreſent, in the thouſand thouſand Part or Property, one of the infinite Beauties, various Glories, admirable Excellencies, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Vertues, wherewith this Land is ſtored? Verily it is a large Land indeed, like a Confluence of infinite Number of Worlds. O my Lord, thy Report was true, <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions.</hi> The Earth is Nothing to the viſible Heavens, and the viſible to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. O vaſt Land! Are they not ſhallow Fools, who
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005510_0018_101848E2B614C5B8"/>
boaſt themſelves of Shovelfuls of Earth? But Worms are much taken up with Dunghils. Nothing below this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Vault of the viſible Heavens can bound the Outgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of capacious and ſublime Spirits.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We may imagine, in this our Childhood, childiſhly; and ſo conceive of Glory in a metaphorick Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And O the Beauty and Sweetneſs, wherewith this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Land is adorned! Earth in its <hi>May</hi>-clothing, with its various Beauties, appeared ſomewhat delightſom before; but all former Apprehenſions are ſwallowed up; all the Senſes &amp; Faculties are loſt in the endleſs Maze of infinite Varieties of Beauties and Excellencies.

What Varieties! what Glories! what numberleſs Numbers! Every Object is enough to allure unto Raviſhment: But the Conſpiration of them all cannot be told. How are the Ears charmed with number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Variety of melodious Raptures! ſo that the Ears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Harmony itſelf. How do inceſſant and full Gales of odoriferous Exhalations perfume and fill with a paſſing Sweetneſs, not only the Brain, but every Vein, Artery and Sinew I That which enters the Mouth, every where, ſurpaſſeth <hi>Ambroſia</hi> &amp; <hi>Nectar.</hi> The circumjacent Spirits have ſo pleaſant Embraces, as they ſtill refreſh the Body, that cannot be weary.

O mighty God, this World is a Maſter-piece of thy Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs indeed.

Sure the Sun in its Strength would bluſh to let forth its Rays on ſo beautiful a Place, the leaſt Stone here would look him out of Countenance; Nothing in the lower World, which is not here; and nothing here, which is to be ſeen in the lower World. If we ſpeak any Thing in earthly Idiom, it muſt be in perfect Contradictions; all is covered over with all Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of Beds of Lilies, and Roſes, and dropping ſweet-ſmelling Myrrhe, every where the Vines flouriſh, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes ſend forth an odoriferous Exhalation, the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates bud, the Grapes and all Fruit hang in goodly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; all is overſlown with <hi>Ambroſia, Milk</hi> and <hi>Hony</hi>; all is an Orchard, all a Champain Field; every Place is the ſunny Side of the Hill, and alſo a pleaſant Shadow; every Place is filled with odoriferous Gales, and yet there is nothing but one ſweet and endleſs Calm: The Winds that blow here are like vital &amp; animal Spirits. Are they not theſe Heart-refreſhing, and Soul-rejoicing Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of the Spirit of Life? All are planted with Trees, every one of which doth ſpecifically differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bears every Month, every Hour, every Minute, Ten thouſand Kinds of Fruits; and every Fruit contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Ten thouſand Qualities; and every Quality Ten thouſand Vertues, and every Vertue Ten thouſand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and every Delight is enough to confound My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads of Worlds of Men and Angels. All Things ſend forth melodious Notes, odoriferous Perfumes, and what may charm Thouſands of Senſes, differing ſpecifically from one another: All Things here do more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the Vertues and Excellencies of Sun, Moon and Stars. O what every Thing is, how inconceivable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Imagination! This World is all Things, 'tis a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, alſo it is a glorious and ſtately City, decked with the Glory and Comelineſs of her Builder; <hi>Whoſe Light is like unto a Stone moſt precious,</hi> whoſe Walls are high

and beautified with <hi>Twelve Gates, and at the Gates are Twelve Angels, whoſe Figure is Four-ſquare, whoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit Twelve thouſand Furlongs, and the Height of the Wall an Hundred forty four Cubits; the Building thereof is of Jaſper, and the City of pure Gold, as it were tranſparent Glaſs.</hi> If the Foundations thereof be of Pearl, the Houſes, Streets and Walls of Gold, what muſt the Deckings of the Houſes be? If the ordinary Stuff exceed the Price of the Diamond, who can weigh our moſt noble JEWEL of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>? Sure all the Excellency of this lower Univerſe would be of no Reckoning here; yea, many Worlds are not to be valued. Muſt not this be a glorious and delightſom City, which is immediately enlightned with the uncreated Glory of JEHOVAH, and the LAMB? <hi>All the Kings of the Earth bring in their Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hither</hi>: All other Glories and Excellencies are ſwallowed up, and concentred here: All Joys, all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, all Contentments, all Deſires are for ever here.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But let us draw near, that we may diſcover more of theſe wonderful Things: What raviſhing Melody is this? Were it not Heaven to dwell within the Sound of Heaven's Melody?

The Idiom of Glory hath a wonderful Efficacy and Deepneſs, beyond our ſhallow Uptakings, as far tranſcending Earth's Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as Immortality doth tranſcend Mortality: And I want an Ear celeſtial, muſical, to perceive diſtinctly, and underſtand theſe angelical Songs, and wonderful Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Joy, Love and Admiration in the higher Houſe: But the very Sound is enough to raviſh all our Senſes.

Worthy is the Lamb, that was ſlain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God, by thy Blood, out of every Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation; and haſt made us unto our God, Kings and Prieſts; and we ſhall reign for ever and ever.

Choiceſt Beauties of Yeſterday, were it poſſible for you to draw my Affections in the leaſt aſide? I have taſted of Creatures Sweetneſs, but they could not ſatisfy: Shall it not be my endleſs Exerciſe, inceſſantly to kiſs, and draw raviſhing Conſolations from the Lips, that brought the joyful Tydings of this boundleſs Happineſs? None but Thee! If I love and delight in other Beauties, it is as they are decked with thy Lovelineſs; as they are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, Shadows and Reflections of thee, who art <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely</hi>: But thou art the ſubſtantial Beauty, thou art the Beauty! Let innumerable Millions of Worlds of Beauty ſtand round about Thee, one Ray of thy Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendancy would eclipſe them all. Beholders, can you tell what you ſee? O his Beauty, his Beauty! What more can be ſaid, than that it infinitely tranſcends the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men and Angels?</p>
            <p>Other Loves are but the Picture and Reſemblance of Love, to this ſublime and noble Love of JESUS: This is Love indeed; ſhould I ſpeak of Flames? am I not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Ocean?

What ſhouldſt thou have done, dread Sovereign of all Things, with baſe, monſtrous and ingrate Mankind, but make it wholly the Butt of thy unmixed Wrath? What are never ſo many Worlds of Men and Angels to Thee, that thou ſhouldſt ſpare them, if once they dare to utter one World againſt thee? Shouldeſt thou reduce to Nothing, what thou haſt created?

            <p>O Joy inexpreſſible, and altogether glorious: Now, now I find to the full, by ſweet, ſweet Experience, That <hi>in thy Face there is Fulneſs of Joy, and at thy Right hand are Pleaſures for evermore!</hi> In the Days of my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, <hi>Thou put more Joy and Gladneſs into my Heart, than in the Time, when Worldly Enjoyments abounded in Worldlings:</hi> Then have I been ſo raviſhed with the Glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thy Countenance, that earthly Joys could take no Place; ſo that I could not but imagine my ſelf in Heaven already; thinking that the Vintage had come in place of the firſt Fruits: Now, O now! I am in thy immediate Preſence. Thy Sweetneſs, O thy raviſhing Sweetneſs; The Floods, Oceans, Worlds of eternal raviſhing Delights treaſured up at thy Right-hand, wherein I am entred and ſwim for ever and ever! Thy Land, O Emmanual, overflows with Pleaſures. Never, never did I know what Joy was, until now. Now I feel, <hi>Light hath been ſown for the Righteous, and Joy for the Upright in Heart.</hi> Joy is come to its <hi>May</hi> blooming Vigour. O the Rivers of Pleaſures, that ſweetly run through all the Faculties of the Soul and Body! O the full Gales of the Spirit of Conſolation! Am I not almoſt Joy it ſelf? Are theſe the Joys that were ſo much ſpoken, and written of, on the other Side of the Water? Surely, Earth's Idiom hath come wonderfully ſhort! Thy Word was written to Children, and therefore did expreſs all in a Manner ſuted to childiſh Capacities; but nothing low and childiſh here! O Maſſie, Solid, Subſtantial, Enduring Joys! O Sublime, High, Manly Frame! None to the <hi>Joy of my Lord</hi>! Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was ſometimes filled with Joy; but now I am entred into Joy it ſelf. I live and dwell in Joy! No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but Joy for evermore! Thou haſt brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe glorious Manſions of Glory: How ſhall we for ever be glad, and rejoice in Thee! <hi>As the Apple-Tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo art thou among the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

They who come under the Covert of thy Wings, never deſire to remove from thence. Sirs, is not this a Life of unmixed Joy and Sweetneſs, to ſit under the Boughs of this Tree of Life? Is it not good to be here? <hi>Have not the Lines fallen unto us in pleaſant Places? Have we not a goodly Heritage?</hi> and after ſuch a World of Wo and Tribulation, to enter over Head and Ears, in theſe ſuper-abundant Joys! O ſweet Diſpenſation! firſt to be afflicted, and then comforted; to weep, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, to run, and then to reſt! O High-tide of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Joys! which hath ſwallowed up all former Griefs and Sorrows. The firſt Sight of thy raviſhing Countenance, O my God, made me, as it were, forget that ever I was on Earth! This Land hath a ſweet-ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Countenance: Pain and Sadneſs ſhould be converted here into Joy and Delight. Here is an eternal Spring; <hi>For the Winter is paſt, the Rain is over and gone, the Flowers appear on the Earth, the Time of the Singing of Birds is come, and the Voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land.</hi> Now we have everlaſting Joys for Sorrow, the Oil of Gladneſs for the Spirit of Heavineſs. We exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rejoice with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who have loved her! <hi>We ſuck, and ſatiate ourſelves with the Breaſts of her Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: we milk and delight ourſelves with the Abundance of her Glory: For the Lord extendeth Grace to her, like a River.</hi> Our Eyes do ſee this, <hi>our Hearts do rejoice, and our Bones do flouriſh like an Herb.</hi> He hath made us <hi>an everlaſting Excellency, a Joy of many Generations: Sing, O Heavens, for the Lord hath done it: Shout, ye lower Parts of the Earth; break forth into Singing, ye Mountains; For the Lord Jehovah is my Strength and my Song, He alſo is become my Salvation: Therefore with Joy will I draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</hi> Cry out, and ſhout, O ye Inhabitants of the higher

Nothing on Earth was heard among us, but the confuſed Noiſe of Warriors, the Sighs and Groans of Men in an Agony. Now the Heavens of Heavens are filled with the joyful Melody of Heroick Conquerors. We ſowed in Tears for a Moment; and now reap in Joy for evermore! Thou haſt made us glad, unconceivably above the Days Thou hadſt afflicted us: Thou haſt ariſen, and thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ſcattered, and all thy Haters are fled before Thee; as Smoke is driven away before the Wind, ſo are they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaniſhed before thy terrible Preſence: But all the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are glad, and they rejoice before Thee; yea, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rejoice.</p>

Let the Crown flouriſh on his Head throughout all Ages. O my Happineſs, who ſhall ever praiſe Thee. And was I elected before all Ages, to be the everlaſting Beholder, and Extoller of thy infinite Glory; Hadſt Thou ſuch wonderful Thoughts of Love to me, when I was not? Were I in the Place of my Deſerving, ſhould I not been even now Blaſpheming thine all-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and exalted Name? O thy free, free Love! O the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches of thy Grace! who choſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, out of the baſe and helliſh Maſs of Mankind, to be a Veſſel of Glory and Honour, in the high Hall of Glory.

O the Carrying on! O the Copeſtone thereof! Strange! how haſt Thou brought me hither? I ſee, thy Counſels cannot, in the leaſt, be fruſtrate by all the Power of Creatures. When I was a wretched, loſt Creature, <hi>lying in my Blood, and no Eye pitying me; then didſt Thou, in thy By-going,

caſt a Look of Love on me,</hi> and ſaid unto me, <hi>Live</hi>: And that Time became <hi>a Time of Love.</hi> Free Love was the Rule thou walked by; not my Diſervings, or Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Had I been left to my helliſh Will, I ſhould for ever have deſtroyed my ſelf: But Thou ſweetly and connaturally, ere ever I was aware, didſt raviſh Heart and all from me; So that my Will could not but ſtoop to thy overcoming Lovelineſs. When I was following after the monſtrous Imagnations of my evil Heart, debauching my Loves and Joys on Creature-enjoyments, deſpiſing the only Excellent Things, then didſt Thou diſcover thy irreſiſtible Lovlineſs unto me; which bowed, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and enamoured all the faculties <hi>of my Soul</hi>; ſo that I could not but yield, moſt willingly yield: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally did the Influences of thy Spirit work on the Powers of my Soul; So that I cloſed with Thee on thine own Terms, as freely as I had been abſolute Sovereign of myſelf; and yet as infallibly as I had been no intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Agent. Verily Thou, Thou alone, art the abſolute Sovereign of all Things. O thy wonderful Way of Working! who can trace thee in all thy Proceedings?</p>

How well haſt thou kept, what I have committed unto thee, and preſented it ſpotleſs &amp; glorious before the Father? Now I behold all thy Promiſes compleatly accompliſhed. Thou haſt ever held me in thine Hand, thro' all the dangerous Wilderneſs, I have overpaſt; <hi>Thou haſt guided me by thy Counſel,</hi> and at laſt <hi>brought me to Glory.</hi> How hath thy Strength been ſeen in Weakneſs?

My Feet for ever ſtand now within the glorious Land of <hi>Emmanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s bleſſed Conqueſt. All the united Strength of bleſſed Saints &amp; Angels could not have bro't me hither. Sirs, ſhall we not be telling to one another throughout Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, what God hath done for us in Time? That E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity may be filled with a Song to Jehovah, and the Lamb. Who ſhould exalt, and love, and fear, and obey, and ſerve Thee, if not we? Didſt thou love us from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? And ſhall we not praiſe thee to Eternity? And can we but extol thee? Not ſo much becauſe thou art Good to us, as becauſe thou art Good in thy ſelf. But, O how is my Heart inflamed, to think, how thy Love from Eternity brake forth in Time! How didſt thou ſhew forth the Acts of thy free ſovereign Love? in that thou hadſt written my Name for eternal Life! How bravely have all Exigences, and croſs Diſpenſations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to my Welfare? Now I ſee, <hi>All Things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the Good of thoſe that love Thee.</hi> The ſaddeſt and moſt croſs Junctures of Providence have been the beſt: When thou ſeemeſt to be ſmiting, thou waſt healing!

Thy Ways to me in Time are the Matter of an eternal Song! All Exigences of Time did ſo jump together, as every one hath proved a Step to this inexpreſſible Glory. Free redeeming Love hath been written on all the Paſſages of my Pilgrimage! and moſt in the laſt Water; when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſink, thou held me up in thy Arms, and put my Head in thy Boſom, and ſaid, <hi>Be of good Cheer my Love, thy Sins are forgiven thee; fear not, my Dove, but rejoice exceedingly; for thy God, thy Head, thy Lord, thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, thy Saviour is here, holding thee in his Arms.

No Beauties, no Comelineſs, no Joys, no Delights here, if we ſpeak according to Earth's Dialect; yet, here are all Things in an high and eminent Manner. O my God, how incomprehenſible art thou in thy Works? How ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing in that Reflex of thy Glory, which ſhall endure for ever?

We are in every Part transformed into thy lovely Image: Whatever before was Terreſtrial, is now Heavenly and Divine.

The Diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Excellency of the Terreſtial, and Celeſtial, cannot be told: And no Wonder we are ſo vivacious and ſtrong; ſince our earthly Part is become heavenly and glorious: Fleſh and Blood is done away, as incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſuch heavenly Majeſty.

In the Days of Mortality, the Conſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them was, in a great Part, jarring and unpleaſant, the one did obſcure the Excellency of the other: But now the Soul in the Body, is like the Sun ſhining in its proper Sphere; or like the Light darting thro' a perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Body, adorned with various modifying Beauties, whereby the Rays are variouſly perfected, in their modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Out-goings: All the Properties, Perfections, Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Actions of Soul and Body, are modified and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their ſubſtantial Connexion.

All our natural Propenſities are fully ſatisfied, and we are every Way filled with God: As our Fellowſhip with him was interrupted, imperfect, and at a Diſtance on Earth, ſo our Converſe with Creatures was of ſmall Profit: Vanity (as to us) was poured out on all Creature-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; ſince our Faculties were in a great Part, viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, was not our Fellowſhip on Earth oftentimes for the worſe, as well as for the better? for that our Converſe ſavoured ſtrongly of Earth, differing little from that of Worldlings. But, is not this a wonderful Change? We look like an Aſſembly of Kings and Prieſts indeed. Are we not all one, in Mind, in Love, in Joy? for we have the <hi>Mind of Chriſt.</hi> All of us reſemble advantageouſly that perfect and only Pattern of Holineſs, that infinite World of raviſhing Beauty, and boundleſs Ocean of overcoming Sweetneſs, that only Delight, Love, Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, Wonder, and All, of Men, and Angels. I am like Thee, O my WELBELOVED: I am like Thee. O Joy! ſuperabounding Joy! This one Thought bears in its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, Ten Thouſand Heavens. O Sirs, are not his Glory, his Excellency, his Sweetneſs diffuſed among us? We are one in Chriſt; and therefore one among our ſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

If, when clothed with Mortality, you were of ſublime and princely Spirits; what are you now, when <hi>Mortality is ſwallowed up of Life</hi>? Was our Converſe ſweet in the Valley of Tears and Sorrows? and is it not more than pleaſant in this Paradiſe of Joys and Delights? Was our Lamenting our Diſtance from God, to one another, ſweet? What Raviſhments in our mutual Congratulations of theſe overflowing Delights, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in the immediate Preſence of JEHOVAH and the LAMB? What a golden Life is this! As this full Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Thee, O my God, doth ſwallow up all other Enjoyments; ſo doth it perfect them alſo. Until our Love to thee was perfected, never did we love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother perfectly. The more thou art loved, the more of thy Image. Thou art the Centre of all my Faculties; All my Love to Saints and Angels terminates in Thee; Thou haſt clothed them with thy Lovelineſs, and they are become Lovely: Yea, tho' they were not, yet, ſince they are the Object of thy Love; therefore will I love them: But, becauſe thou haſt loved them, therefore haſt thou made them wonderfully lovely; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how are we all kindled together, into an eternal Flame! O what a wonderful Sympathy! As we ſuffered in one another's Afflictions; ſo do we rejoice in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Joy. O this ſuperabundant Joy and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Since all your Joy and Happineſs, Men and Angels, are mine; even me they affect; I am as filled with them: The Happineſs of Thouſands, and Myriads

of Thouſands, are abridged into one Happineſs. And how diſcovering is the Light of thy Glory! I know every one of you in particular, as by Name, and what was your Lot on Earth. When our Converſe is more joyful, ſhall not our Fellowſhip now be paſſing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent? The Faculties are great, the Objects are great, and great is Eternity, which we have ever before us in our Fellowſhip: We are not confined, as on Earth, to Days, Hours and Years; but ſhall ſpeak to one another of his infinite Excellencies again and again and more and more, and for ever ſpeak: And what new Delights, ſince Earth's childiſh Dialect is done away!

What tho' little of thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were let forth on Creatures? the Manifeſtation of thy Goodneſs to Creatures adds juſt Nothing to Thee: Whether Thou create or not create one Creature, on a World, or Millions of Worlds, all is the ſame to Thee. Thou art infinitely above the Praiſes, or the Blaſphemies of Creatures. Thy Glory is unchangeable; before all Ages did thy infinite Perfections ſhine forth, in the ſame infinite Splendor; So that, in the Fulneſs of Time, when it pleaſed Thee, to ſhew forth thy Glory, in the Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Adorning of finite Beings, nothing in the leaſt was added to thy boundleſs Excellency: Thy Creating was the Manifeſtation of what was from Eternity; not the bringing forth of what was not at all: As when the Sun ſhould dart forth his Light, which before he kept within himſelf; or a Box of precious Ointment, when broken, exhales a Perfume, which before lie hidden.</p>

Thou haſt caſt from Thee the baſe Garb of <hi>Mortality,</hi> that in a great Part obſcured thy matchleſs Glory and Lovelineſs, and haſt decked thy Self with raviſhing <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> and Lovelineſs, as with a <hi>Garment.</hi> Thou ſought and <hi>wooed thy Bride</hi> in a low and contemptible Equipage; Thou madeſt it known thou couldſt draw Hearts to Thee in the moſt low and deſpicable Condition: It would not have been ſo wonderful, if thou hadſt allured, and gained Conſent, appearing in thy royal and majeſtick Eſtate. But here is the Wonder! yet, no Wonder: Since Lowneſs, Weakneſs, Shame and Contempt, cannot but change their Nature, and become Exaltation, Vigour, Glory and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown; if once Thou aſſume them.

in an eternal Act of Marrying, Eſpouſing, Embracing, Kiſſing, and full Communications of Love, is ten thouſand Lives of Satisfaction, ten thouſand Worlds of perfect Bleſſedneſs, all beaten in one Maſs. Who but CHRIST, and US! How hath he arrayed us, according to his Grandeur and Excellency? All is embroidered with Gold and Gems; every Diamond, every Rubie, every Sapphire tranſcends, by innumerable Stages, the Sun of the lower World, ſhining in his Strength. And doth not this great ALL appear in joyful Apparel, as befitting the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſals of ſo glorious a COUPLE? All Things dance and ſound forth melodiouſly, our <hi>Epithalamium.</hi> What a Life is this? ever to be Marrying! ever to be at the Marriage-Feaſt! ever to be entring the Bed of Love! This Feaſt is furniſhed with all Delights, it raviſhes every Moment, and throughout all Eternity! O what Variety! O what Efficacy in every Delicate! Every one doth forever ſatiate: and yet Delights are ever renewed! This Land is nothing but a Table furniſhed with all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Fruits always. All Milk, all Spices, all Delights, every where ſuperabound eternally. And in what a raviſhing Manner art thou ever inviting! <hi>Eat, O Friends, drink yea drink abundantly, O Beloved</hi>: Drink and drink again, and forever drink. This is a Day of Gladneſs and Rejoicing; this is the Day of the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all our Deſires. The POMP of this Day is glorious indeed! Verily, my GOD, Thou haſt made us as happy as can be! This Diſpenſation tranſcends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably all other! This Delight and Love is ever blooming and green! O this ſweet and delightſom Bed of Love! One Sight and Smell of it, afar off, is raviſhing. How is it all ſtrewed over with ever-flouriſhing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing Roſes and Lilies; with infinite Kinds of odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous and beautiful Flowers of infinite Virtues? All my Faculties are filled, and overfilled with all Manner of Delights and Sweetneſs! Is not this Wine of Glory, O Enjoyers, of wonderful Efficacy? who can endure to

Do not its Spirits fill all the Faculties and Powers with an immortal Vigour; an unſpeakable Sweetneſs, and ſurpaſſing Joys? Great Things haſt thou prepared, O WELBELOVED, far above all our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! What ſhall be my never-ending Exerciſe, but to be ſatiate and raviſhed with thine uncreated Sweetneſs? If my Cloſing with Thee, tho' abſent, was paſſing joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how ſhall I now rejoice, and exult, in ſolemnizing the BARGAIN, in ſatiating my ſelf for ever with fully-manifeſted LOVES, in this Bed of Love? The Wooing-time ſeemed ſmall and inconſiderable; O the Marriage is wonderfully glorious and excellent! What eſteemed a baſe World of thy great Call, when thou ſent thine Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to call them unto this everlaſting Supper? How did they ſlight ſuch an aſtoniſhing Diſpenſation, as a well-invented Fancy, and turned themſelves wholly to their Earthly Enjoyments, as being the only real Things, which affected their <hi>brutiſh Minds?</hi> Do you not now ſee your deſperate Madneſs, O vile Worldlings? Is not your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion wonderfully changed? Did you ſlight the ſweet Invitations of the Almighty, to ſuch boundleſs Happineſs? Well, you ſhall never taſte it, through all Eternity. You have gotten your Choice, a momentany Enjoyment of Earth have you received: This boundleſs Joy you never cared for. If you have done wiſely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice therein throughout Eternity.

O bleſſed Choice! thouſand Times bleſſed Choice! Had I known in Time, how happy a Bargain I had made, ſhould I not have been overjoyed unto the Death? And was there ſuch Difficulty, to get the Children of Men to ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to ſuch an advantagious Bargain? Didſt Thou knock, and knock again, O Welbeloved, at the Doors of our

Who would have thought, but one ſerious Invitation had been enough for all Mankind! O blockiſh Mortality! O ſtupid brutiſh Madneſs! Thou haſt not Cauſe here to exalt thy ſelf, O empty Self, who deſpiſed, and overlooked, ſo much this glorious Match: Who ſtood more out againſt theſe glorious Offers? Didſt thou not <hi>play faſt</hi> and <hi>looſe</hi> with JESUS, as all others? When He ſaw, he could not prevail with thee, more than others, (all Mankind being alike in their Orignal) He put in his Hand by the <hi>Hole of the Door,</hi> and then cauſed <hi>thy Bowels be moved for him</hi>: He filled thine Heart, <hi>ere ever thou waſt aware,</hi> with his overcoming Love and Sweetneſs. Thou waſt hearing the Sound of this Goſpel in a dead and natural Way, but he breathed upon all thy Faculties, and ſaid unto thee, Live; and thou aroſe from the Dead, and heard, and ſaw Wonders in the Goſpel, that blind ſtupid World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings could never perceive. Had he ſuffered thee to follow thy natural Inclinations, thou hadſt marched on, to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Deſtruction, contrary to all his loving Invitations. Nay, but ſince from Eternity he had choſen thee, of his own good Pleaſure, out of the Maſs of Mankind, He could not but manifeſt his Love to thee, in Time, in a ſpecial Manner; and therefore he paſt from Intreaty, to Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and drew thee with ſuch ſtrong <hi>Cords of Love,</hi> that thou couldſt not but yield. O my holy One, no Creature can reſiſt thy overcoming Beauty: When thou darteſt forth thy Love, all is ſet in a Flame; Hell and Death could not reſiſt thee. Ever haſt thou been drawing Sinners up to Heaven after thee, unto this great Marriage; and now we are all within the Bed of Love. Love! Nothing but raviſhing Love! O what Looks of Love! Nothing but Kiſſes, but eternal Embraces! Men and Angels, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible we can be more happy? What can Creatures have more?

            <p>All Creatures live according to the Capacity of their Being, but no Life to that which is Divine! The Animal Life is dead and dark, and without Efficacy and Beauty; the Intellectual is a low and baſe Thing: But this Life of Glory doth only excel all other Excellencies.

ſoon did animal, rational and intellectual Lives fall from their native Conſtitution? Nothing permanent, which is not Divine; nothing everlaſting, which lies not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately without the Mixture of Creature-imperfections; The nearer thee, the ſafer; the further off thee, the more dangerous; to be quite cut off from thee, is perfect and only Miſery. Curſed Men and Angels have no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the Fountain, but that which conſerves their natural Beings, in their natural Operations.

And art thou, O my GOD, become All unto me? The Want of all my temporal Enjoyments is a Gain, that cannot be told! How have I been vexed, and wearied, with being occupied about vain, empty, unſatisfying <hi>Nothings</hi>; So that I was glad of a borrowed Viſion of thee, of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex Manifeſtation of thy Glory and Excellency; and was ſo covered over with <hi>Shadows,</hi> that I could neither order right Expreſſions, nor Conceptions, becauſe of Darkneſs. How oft have I bemoaned, <q>When ſhall the Day dawn, and the Shadows fly away that I may be filled im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with his Glory?

I cannot; Ten thouſand Things ſtand in betwixt me and him, through this earthly and ſinful Eſtate; ſo that I am oftimes ſo confuſed and diſordered, that I can deſire nothing at all: How doth this poor Life depend every Moment, on ten thouſand Things? Here am I diverted, through Mortality, by every Thing that comes in my Way; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Creatures having a commanding, diverting Influence over me: Muſt I be ever ſleeping, eating, drinking, converſing in this and that Trifle? Muſt I draw Conſolations from this, and the other, and the third Creature; and have a Fellowſhip with my GOD, by Benefit of Means and Ordinances, which ever have the Tincture and Savour of Imperfection? And are not the Conduits oftimes ſo corrupt, as that they imbitter my Enjoyments? And are they not ſo ſtopt, as that I am almoſt dead ſon Want? How am I drawn aſide

What a nauſeating Round do I run, ever toſſing the ſame Stone? That <hi>which hath been, is that which ſhall be, and there is no new Thing under the Sun. What Profit hath a Man of all his Labour?</hi> For tho' the Eye is not ſatisfied with Seeing, nor the Ear with Hearing, ſo that new Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ever required; yet, muſt the ſame Things be run over, and over again: And what might ſeem more excellent, than by the ſerious Search and Study of Things, to have the Heart filled with great Experience of Wiſdom and Knowledge?

The more Creatures adore, and love and obey Thee, the more they are run into the Debt of thy free Grace: Yea, tho' Creatures could deſerve, the very active Glorifying of thee carries in its Boſom full and overruning Recompenſe.

Even on Earth, the Spouſe was adorned with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Excellencies, chiefly for Beauty, and not for Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: Nay, the Heavens and the Earth are not defective herein: Were every Star like the Sun; or all the Stars of equal Glory; or, the whole Expanſion adorned with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Glory; or were every Part of the Earth covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the ſame Beauties, ſo that nothing did excel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Were all Heaven, or all Earth; or were Earth of equal Glory with Heaven; or were all a Sun; or were the higher and lower World nothing differing in Glory; all would be every Way the ſame; and ſo nothing ſo beautiful as it is. Indeed the Head is loving to all the Members, and is alike affected with them all; yet, every Member is in its own Order, <hi>According to his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which</hi> from Eternity <hi>he purpoſed in himſelf.</hi> As he diſtributed, after divers Degrees and Manners, his Gifts and Graces, to his Choſen in Time; ſo doth he make the Harveſt correſpondent to the Seed-time, the manly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to the Infancy, the Vigour and Blooming to the Budding and firſt Springing forth.

All our Excellency, and all our Acting, or Suffering, was only of him, and not of our ſelves: He alone did <hi>work in us both to will, and to do, of his good Pleaſure.</hi> The more we were graced, the more we were enabled, the more we were obliged: Only it hath pleaſed his infinite Bounty to perfect in Eternity, according as he did begin in Time; and to give us the purchaſed Poſſeſſion, by Way of Reward.

have made betwixt them &amp; you a vaſt Gulf of eternal Separation: Had you known their Dignity, you ſhould have wondered, that I ſuffered you to abide in the ſame World with them. What think you now of provoking me, vile Wretches? Are you the Creatures, that tho't highly of ſinning? Are you able to deſpiſe and mock at the juſt Puniſhment thereof? No more vain Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Jollity; the Fewel of your baſe ſinful Delights have I taken for ever from you: Not one Smile of Joy from henceforth. All the Mercies I vouchaſed upon you, did ye uſe againſt me; the more I continued my Bounty, the more you rebelled and vexed my holy Spirit; tho' <hi>in me you lived, moved and had your Being,</hi> yet you forgat me, and minded your own worldly Things, more than my Glory and Intereſts through the World. All your Actions were ſubordinate to baſe Self; even your moſt excellent-like Actings and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for my Cauſe, were ever out of one ſelfiſh Deſign or other: I will fill you with your own Ways. You ſhall not be troubled with Offers of Mercy any more, or with the Exerciſes of Godlineſs any more: Nothing but Blaſphemy fills your helliſh Mouths. You ſhall not be vexed with the Company of my Saints any more: You ſhall have your Fill of one anothers helliſh Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip throughout Eternity: Your Choice and Delight ſhall not be taken from you. Know you not who I am? Am I not he, whom you deſpiſed and forgot? Am I not he, whoſe Yoke ye brake aſunder from your Necks? Am I not he, whom you defied, and proclaimed War againſt?

Miſery of you all; only your ſelves have deſtroyed your ſelves: Madly and deſperately have you run to your own Deſtruction; and who was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſtand in your Way? Who hath ſtruck you with ſuch a monſtruous Hatred to all Good, and Inclination to all Evil? Are ye not naturally wicked, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable? Are you not Haters of my Holineſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency? Had ye not from the Beginning a ſtrange Averſeneſs from my ſpotleſs Holineſs? Blaſphemous Wretches, you ſee <hi>my Ways are equal,</hi> to your eternal Torment and Confuſion; your Mouths are for ever ſtopped, and you are found guilty: Nothing have you to ſay for your ſelves, your monſtrous helliſh Frame is as a thouſand Witneſſes againſt you. Should not I alone be exalted? Should I not cruſh to Pieces all the Deſpiſers of my Glory? Shall I not for ever cauſe you to drink the pure and unmixed Wrath of the Almighty, that is poured forth without Mixture? That ye may be filled with my Fury and Indignation, and may be drunk, and made mad, and torment and tare, and devour and curſe yourſelves, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that every Thought may bring in a dreadful Horror, and helliſh Pangs. O mine Enemies! mine Enemies, whom I made the Shields of the Earth, who became greater in Wickedneſs, than in your worldly Greatneſs: You Ringleaders of Iniquity, Betrayers of the great Truſt I dignified you with; the Ruin of thouſands ſhall fall on your Heads. Did you tyrannize, without Law, or Reaſon? Alledging, You were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to none for Outrages, but unto me; that you might fulfil your wicked Deſires without Countroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? O vileſt of Wretches, whom I ſet over my Church, to defend Her from all external Damages, to hold her in all her glorious Privileges, that I left her, in my Legacy; and to hold the Crown, upon my Head, in Deſpite of the Oppoſers: Did you make Havock of her? Did you rob her of her Adornments? Did you pull
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:005510_0083_1018498ED82DDD78"/>
the Crown off my Head, and put it on your own? Did you neglect the Affairs of my Church, and ſubordinate them to your own temporal, vain, tranſient Affairs? Did you put the Sword in the Bowels of my Choſen, which I gave you to protect them with? O mine Enemies! I will neither fight with ſmall or great, in Compariſon of <hi>You</hi>; even <hi>you,</hi> I will ever be avenged upon; <hi>you,</hi> and all your Paraſites, Executors, Applauders, Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Conſulters to your horrid Rebellion.

Durſt you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, impriſon, baniſh, torment, and be as Thorns in the Sides of my excellent Ones? What you did to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them you did to me; I will recompenſe it. It had well become you, <hi>to ſtoop and lick the Duſt at the Feet of my Brethren</hi>: It had well become you, <hi>to hold up the Train of my Robe-royal, in the Day of my Wounding:</hi> It had well become you, <hi>to have honoured, and reverenced every one of them, from the higheſt to the leaſt: Had you conſidered their Dignity, you would have wondered I permitted you in my Providence to dwell in that World they inhabited; far more to have had any Manner of Superiority over them.</hi> Here I meet you, my curſed Enemies; know <hi>you</hi> with whom <hi>you</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?

Did you take it upon you, to ſhape out the Government of my Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your fooliſh Fancy, as an indifferent Thing?

All have been ſad-like until now: Who can open their Eyes, and not be over-joyed, tho' they extracted their Delights only from Creatures mediately? But what is this to you, <hi>Loſt Wretches,</hi> ſhut up in utter Darkneſs? Your beſt World hath eternally vaniſhed: This is a black miſerable World to you. What have you to do with this fair Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is ours, only ours; for <hi>we are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's.</hi> Even the former Earth, you took for your Country, Heaven and Happineſs, was only yours by Uſurpation and Oppreſſion; but now you ſhall uſurp no more: If any Thing be yours, it is that bottomleſs Lake, wherein you crawl, like ſo many filthy Toads, Snakes and abominable Vermine: To behold you, would confound any Creature, not indowed with Immortality. O monſtrous Sights!

Where are all your excellent Gifts, your Prudence, and Civility, your fine natural Diſpoſition; your Love to God, you ſo much talked of? Now it appears, That <hi>the Heart of Man is deceitful above all Things, and deſperately wicked, above Imagination.</hi> On Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of natural Ties, we could not but love you; your eternal Rebellion not being manifeſted to us: But now you are for ever our Lord's ſtated Enemies; that tho' he would offer you Pardon, your curſed Hearts would no leſs riſe againſt him; your Hatred is unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable, and augments thro'out Eternity. Fools, are you belching out the Venom of Hell againſt him, who for ever tramples you under his Feet?

Not becauſe of his Wrath, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt you, are you mad againſt him; in the midſt of his Bounty did you continue in your Enmity. His Holineſs, his ſpotleſs Holineſs is the Butt of your hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Malice: Your Wickedneſs is come to its Perfection: Mortality was not capable of outing the ten thouſandth Part of what is now manifeſted: Ever were you averſe from the Fellowſhip of the ever-bleſſed God: Now you directly avouch your Enmity, as juſt and equitable, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of your Conſciences, ſhowing Right and Wrong.

What think you now of thoſe You contemned not long ago, whom You eſteemed as the <hi>Filth and Off-ſcourings of all Things,</hi> whom You thought unworthy of Your excellent Preſence, becauſe they were not laded with the thick Clay of the Earth?

Which of us have choſen the better Part? Judge ye: Preſent Things you eſteemed only real; and wondered at our Folly, that lived upon the Hope of Things to come; yea, and to come after Death, and the Diſſolution of all Things: And are you not Fools, who neglected Immortality and Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, tho' you had a miſerable, pining Life on Earth, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your daily Bread by ſore Labour and Grief?

The Rottenneſs of your Heart was overvailed with a Multitude of natural Gifts, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation: But he, who knoweth all Things, hath found you out; he hath weighed you in an even Balance, and ye are found wanting. Now, it is manifeſt, who is the Searcher of the Hearts, and the Trier of the Reins: Were they not wiſe, who overlooked the Approbation of Men, and gave all Diligence to be approved to thee? What thy Tho'ts are concerning a Creature, that it is indeed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hypocrites have paſſed off the Stage of Time, with the Paſport of many of the Saints; but thy <hi>Well done</hi> hath only landed fair in thy bleſſed Kingdom. Indeed, LORD JESUS, in Time thou madeſt a brave Separation betwixt the Righteous and the Wicked; how oft haſt thou ſifted thy Church over, and over again, with ſmaller and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Sieves? So that the Difference betwixt the Wheat and the Chaff was very diſcernable.

So that many, who, for Shame, could not, inpalpably groſs Things, comply with the Devil and his Slaves; yet in Matters that ſeemed of leſs Conſequence, did they ſide with them; whence their Hypocriſie and Luke warmneſs in the Matters of GOD did appear.

The Nations ſaw, and were confounded; they laid their Hand upon their Mouth; they licked the Duſt like a Serpent, they moved out of their Holes like Worms of the Earth</hi>; and <hi>were greatly afraid, and confounded becauſe of the LORD our GOD: For he is jealous, and revengeful; He revengeth, and is furious; Who can ſtand before his Indignation?

Surely Men of low Degree were Vanity, and Men of high Degree were a Lie; To be laid in the Balance, they were altogether lighter than Vanity.

In Famine he hath redeemed us from Death, and in War from the Power of the Sword; we have been hid from the Scourge of Tongues; neither were we afraid of Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction when it came: At Deſtruction and Famine we did laugh; we knew alſo that our Seed ſhould be great, and our Off-ſpring as the Graſs of the Earth; and that our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould for ever be made our Footſtools: For thou haſt deſtroyed them for ever, O GOD; and haſt made them to fall by their own Counſels: Thou haſt caſt them out, in the Multitude of their Tranſgreſſions; for they rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.

               <p>Believe it, Holineſs, or Wiſdom, is a rare Thing: A Saint is a Wonder. God hath placed them among the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Multitude of Mankind, like ſo many Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: So many Saints in the World, ſo many Miracles of Nature: A Saint, in the Kalender of the Generality of Profeſſors, is an ordinary Perſon; but, in Chriſt's, moſt extraordinary.

And no Wonder the Saint cannot want Chriſt, ſince he is transformed into his lovely Image, a Partaker of his divine Nature; one, who is endued with the ſame Mind that was in him; one, who hath Chriſt <hi>dwelling in him</hi>; one, who hath <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven within him</hi>: So that it is natural unto him to tend God-ward, and Heaven-ward; even as it is natural for the Worldling to tend Earth-ward and Hell-ward. Every Thing hath a Propenſity and Love to its own Centre and Like; and bends off from its Oppoſite: The Fire aſcends towards the Centre and great Glob of Fire; every Bit of Earth disjoined, tends back to the whole again. Tho' there were neither Reward, nor Puniſhment; yet a holy One muſt love, ſerve, obey, praiſe and adore his God; for Heaven muſt operate like Heaven, even neceſſarily, tho'
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:005510_0113_10184A272A1F91C0"/>
freely, ſweetly, and without Compulſion. Again, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings muſt tend Earth-ward, tho' they ſhould find never ſo much Vexation, Torment and Grief in it; tho' he ſhould never be ſo often threatned, and perſwaded of all the Miſeries that follow an earthly, ſenſual and brutiſh Way of living; ſince he is all Senſe, Earth and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, altogether deſtitute of the Divine Nature: In a Word, a Worldling is a viſible incarnate Devil; a Saint, a viſible incarnate Angel: Only Hell, on this Side of Time, is not fully accompliſhed in the one; nor Heaven fully perfected in the other. The holy One ſmells ſtrongly of Glory; and the nearer he approacheth to his Journey's End, the more reſplendent a Luſtre hath he of Heaven: <hi>The Path of the Juſt</hi> being <hi>as the ſhining Light, that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more and more unto the perfect Day.</hi> O Tincture of Heaven! Their Actions have ſtill a greater Smell of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but all is nothing to the Glory and Excellency of their inviſible and inward Operation: Little or nothing appears without, in Compariſon of that which is within. O the noble and ſeraphick Thoughts! O the ſtrange Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Love, and Joy, and Admiration, above all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expreſſion! O the raviſhing Perfumes of paſſing Joys and Sweetneſs, wherewith the Beloved fills the Heart! It is impoſſible for the Saint, to put down in Black and White, what he feels on his Soul: All the Tongues of Men and Angels cannot manifeſt his ſweet and noble Thoughts of his only WELBELOVED. He would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs them to all that are about him, but he finds it impoſſible. He is ſometimes contending with his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Fancy, that it cannot find out a more ſublime, clear and excellent Way of expreſſing the matchleſs Worth of his Welbeloved: Other whiles, he is angry at the cold, ſhallow and putid Manner of others Diſcourſing: He would have all Men ſpeak nobly, write nobly, do nobly, for Jeſus. Nothing vexeth him more than to perceive the Generality of Men forget him: Or, when they ſpeak of him, to talk ſo coldly and creepingly, as if he were a

common, ordinary Beloved. He would have his Lovely One filling the Hearts and Mouths of all: He hates the Fellowſhip where he is not highly eſteemed, loved, praiſed and adored: He greatly honours, and loves that, (tho' otherwiſe never ſo low and deſpicable) where he is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, worſhipped and much accounted of. It is his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Torment and Affliction, he hath ſo low and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming Thoughts of him: He is in great Rage at his Heart, that it ſhould, at any Time, go aſtray, from ſuch an excellent Object, after Vanity: He lays Bands on, watcheth over, and commands his Heart, that it have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent Thoughts of him; and entertain no other Beloveds beſide him: He deſires Nothing more, than to have his Heart wholly ſet upon him, and forever raviſhed and overcome with his Love. And no Wonder; ſince Chriſt, and he are One; One in Nature, Mind, Affections, Spirit, and all Things: As the Lord Jeſus is, ſo is he, in a great Part. Every one of the Saints reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Children of the King of Kings: Among all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> there are none their like; for they are <hi>a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People; that they ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of him, who hath called them out of Darkneſs unto his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Light.</hi> The Generality of Mankind hath, ever from the very Beginning, looked upon them, as ſtrange Manner of Perſons, &amp; nick-named them with various and ſtrange Sorts of Names, according to the Iniquities of the Times and Places they lived in, becauſe of their Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Number, Singularity in their Way of Living and Practice, Preciſeneſs in their Principles, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Sins of the Times their Lot is caſt into.</p>

So deſperate are Worldlings, that they cannot abide to examine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and when others hold out the Light, that they may diſcover them, they wink, leſt they behold their own Miſery and Vileneſs. But, Worldlings, may you not ſee your Nakedneſs, If you will but aſk ſeriouſly, at your ſelves, a few ordinary Queſtions, and ſolve them faithfully, according to the anſwer of your Conſcience?</p>

Were you ever wreſtling with Sin, as for your Life, and ſaying, Bleſſed Jeſus, I muſt have Thee; Thee to be my Lord, my Head, my Advocate, my King, my Prieſt, my Prophet, my only Beloved, or I cannot live? Ah! Sirs, you, who know not experimentally what I am ſaying, have your Religion to ſeek yet.</p>

How comes it to paſs, you have more Delight in earthly Enjoyments, than in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Godlineſs? Why is Meditating on him, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Perſon, and the Glory of his Kingdom, ſo melancholious, and ſeldom an Exerciſe! Why are you not making it your Study and Delight, to keep up a near and intimate Fellowſhip with the Father, and the Son?

Surely, if you be Partakers of his Nature, you cannot but bend to him with a ſtrong Benſil.

Have you not found his Love better than Wine, and the Savour of his good Ointments moſt cheering and refreſhing? Nay, found you not, in ſome Meaſure, to your own ſweet Experience, all the Intercourſes written down in the <hi>Song of Songs</hi>? What ſay you?

And yet Saints! and yet Lovers of JESUS! That's impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="13">13<hi>thly.</hi> Doth your Goodneſs reach the Saints, <hi>the Excellent of the Earth,</hi> in whom is all your Delight?

As for the ſeveral Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Riches and Honour, you value them not, theſe are not the Things that heighten and depreſs Perſons in your Account: But on the contrary, are you the People, that eſteem Perſons, according to Gay-clothing, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Traſh, much of earthly Honour, Power, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Renown? Affect you more to have a really ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Conſort, Children, Kinſmen, and Friends, than to have them wiſe and holy? Art thou ſuch a Creature, that thou loveſt the Converſe of the Wealthy and Proſperous; and can take a Wordling, known to be ſuch, to be the inſeparable Companion of thy Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of worldly Advantages; And can converſe famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly and merrily with Worldlings, without any Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, or Hurt to the Frame of thine Heart?

an one, and yet a Saint? Ah! poor Thing, thou art a Stranger to Holineſs. It may be thou art a Formaliſt; that is, a Perſon illuminated, who hath a Cuſtom of reading, and conferring, and meditating, and praying; and it may be, weeping, and hearing the beſt, it may be with Jeopardie; but the Life and Marrow of Religion thou art altogether ignorant of.</p>
               <p n="14">14<hi>thly.</hi> Do not the Affairs of Chriſt's Church through the World, and eſpecially through the particular Church He doth moſt own, lie nearer your Heart, than all other Things?

Are not your own Affairs oft-times forgotten by you; ſo much are you taken up with the Affairs of CHRIST? That Chriſt may be great, his Intereſts glorious, and his People exalted, is the Flower and Top of your Deſires. You are exceeding angry againſt, not only his open perſecuting Enemies, but all who are indifferent or luke-warm in his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Thou canſt abide none, but the zealous Ones; Art thou not, as it were, burnt up with Zeal for the Glory of the only excellent ONE? So, that thou art crying out, <hi>Let the Sinners be conſumed from the Earth; Let the Wicked be no more; Let all his Enemies periſh; but let thoſe, that love Him, be like the Sun, going forth in his Strength.</hi> But on the contrary, do thine own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſhare largeſt of thy Thoughts? thou art oft-times ſo occupied with them, that the Affairs of <hi>Zion</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten: It may be, thou wiſhes well unto her, and had rather ſhe did ſwim, than ſink; yea, would undergo a conſiderable Loſs, upon Condition ſhe might be exalted: But wouldſt thou have the Affairs of Chriſt great, meerly out of Deſire to his Glory and Exaltation?

Compariſon of the ſmalleſt Things of CHRIST?

And is not thy Hatred, and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at his Enemies, weak and indiſcernable? Thou canſt hear his Work and People ſpoken Evil of, unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and be little or nothing moved: Thou art a very meek and moderate Man in his Cauſe; and art thou one of his? Hath he the Flower of thy Love? Is that <hi>Love</hi> burning in thine Heart, <hi>which many Waters cannot quench</hi>?

But, on the contrary, doſt thou look upon thine Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a lovely and warmly Manner, and haſt ſweeter and more pleaſant Thoughts of them, than of the Life to come? When the World ſmiles upon thee, doſt thou ſmile upon it again; and canſt eaſily bear the Want of the full Enjoyment of GOD; being ſo well pleaſed with an eaſy, earthly Life, either in Reality, or in Imagination; as thou art ſaying to thy ſelf, <hi>It is good to be here</hi>? Art thou thus, and yet a Saint, a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, who is travelling heaven ward, a Creature, whoſe Heart and Love is in another Country, and not here? This is a Repugnancy; never think it, Man: Think thy ſelf the Thing thou art, <hi>an Home-born Slave</hi>; and then thou art a Step in the Way to true Liberty.</p>
               <p n="16">16<hi>thly.</hi> Art thou longing to be in the immediate Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>of the Chief of Ten thouſand</hi>? To behold <hi>him Face to Face,</hi> and be ſatiate with his immediate Fellowſhip? Is it

oft the Cry of thy longing Heart, <hi>When ſhall I ſee him as he is,</hi> and that white and beautiful Company following him <hi>whitherſoever he goes</hi>? When ſhall I ſee the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and the Bride kiſs and embrace one another? When ſhall he ſet his majeſtick Head thro' theſe viſible Heavens, and appear in his royal Marriage-robes, before the whole Creation? Ah! the envious Heavens, that hide him from my longing Eyes! Ah! the longſom Days, that ly betwixt me and him! When ſhall we be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in others immediate Embraces? But on the contrary, canſt thou live contentedly, in the Midſt of earthly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, with ſmall or no Deſires of his immediate Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip? Is this the ordinary Frame of thy Spirit: And yet a Saint! It cannot be. Can the chaſte Spouſe not long for her abſent Bridegroom? Can the true Lover live patiently, without beholding the Beloved's Face? Ah! Sirs, you have not been really eſpouſed to him. Have you not received his Love-tokens, nor been raviſhed with the Smell of his fragrant Ointments? and what Wonder, you are as you are?</p>
               <p n="17">17<hi>thly.</hi> Are you depending on God in every Thing?

So that you find your Mind greatly eaſed; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving One to your Father, who is both able and willing to carry you thro' all Difficulties and Afflictions?

Have you renounced the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of your ſelves, and reſigned that, with all your Concerns, even unto him? And dare not do any Thing without his Approbation?

Confidence in GOD, that may hold up thy Heart, in as cheerful a Condition, as <hi>when Corn and Wine abounded</hi> unto Worldlings. Thou cannot lay as much Weight on the large Promiſes in the Book of GOD, as Worldlings on their Charters in earthly Poſſeſſions; and therefore, thou art ever anxious about the event, and commits not the Diſpoſing of thy ſelf to him: Thou walkeſt by the Compaſs of Riches, Eaſe, Reputation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whether it be the Will of Chriſt, is thy laſt Conſideration: Whether it be a Courſe, that will moſt glorify him, and make thy Progreſs ſwifter to Glory, doth not ſo much trouble thee; as whether it be a Courſe, will render thee proſperous, full of Eaſe, Wealth and Eſteem in a World. Doth thine Heart dictate unto thee ſuch an Occupation, ſuch a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſuch an Interprize will bring in great Wealth, much worldly Joy, a Multitude of Friends, greater world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honour, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? Therefore it is to be followed. Ah! deluded Wretch, walkeſt thou by earthly, carnal Rules; and yet ſuch a noble Creature, as a Saint? Never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch Fancies: The Saints walk as Chriſt walked, He is their Fore-runner, and Captain.</p>
               <p>The Difference between a Saint and a Worldling, may, in ſome Manner, be apprehended from what we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Aſk ſeriouſly, at your ſelves, ſuch Queſtions; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon your Way of Walking; ſee what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Frame of your Heart, and what your Heart affects moſt; what your have been, and what you are aiming at, and ſeeking moſt; what you rejoice moſt in; what the Thoughts and Intentions of your Heart run out moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O Sirs, be not beguiled in ſo weighty a Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If you err here, you are eternally undone: It is Satan's great Endeavour, to hinder you from conſidering your ſelf, or your Condition; he delights to ſee you paſs away your Time, in conſidering your natural Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, your corporal Endowments, your Eſtate in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he is afraid you conſider your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eſtate, how it ſtands betwixt God and you; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

you be in friendly Terms with him, or not: If not, how you may attain unto a near Fellowſhip; and how you may keep your ſelf in his Love and Favour, and grow more and more familiar with him. He loves, and endeavours to divert your Mind off eternal Concernments to temporal. But, Sirs, ought you not to give Eternity the firſt Place, the Firſt, and Flower, and Choice and Might of all your Endeavours? Make ſure Work in ſo great, great a Matter: Thy eternal Weal, or Wo, is upon the Wheels, Man; what ſhall be your Lot through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endleſs Ages, is a Concernment above all you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or endeavour.

Is it not moſt ordinary, that Men die, as they live; and moſt certain, that their eternal Condition is, as they die? Knoweſt thou not, that it is written, <hi>To Day, if ye will hear my Voice, harden not your Hearts? Thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> Come, O come, and embrace ſo friendly a Call. Have you any Excuſe? Are you about any Buſineſs of ſuch Concernment? Is any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Hour better than now? Doth not thine Heart draw on a new Scruff of Hardneſs? Why then, fall to Work in good earneſt, as for Life and Death: Make ſure Work, build not upon Sand, but on the Rock? Never reſt, till you have Chriſt indeed, and not ſome Fancy in his Place; be ſure you get an Intereſt in him. Never think your ſelves right, until you have a familiar and lively <hi>Fellowſhip with the Father and the Son</hi>; until there be mutual Communications of Love betwixt Chriſt and you; until you have heartily, and for ever, given your ſelf wholly over to him, and taken him wholly over to you, to be your King, Prieſt and Prophet; to be your All, and only One; until you be enamoured with his matchleſs Beauty, overcome with his paſſing Sweetneſs; until Earth, in its beſt Condition, be an empty Nothing,

               <p>IF I were able to dictate now, when I am entring into Eternity, I could tell you the Conſolations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am comforted of God, even when the chiefeſt Delights of the World, theſe Trifles, upon which the Sons of Men dote, can be no Comfort to me. Alas! what are all the Comforts, that flee away at Death? Even the Vanities of Time, which cannot convoy a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Borders of Time; and far leſs endure with him through Eternity. My Death would ſeem Judicial-like to blind Worldlings, who ſee no Judgment, but to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the empty and taſteleſs Vanities of Time; But I ſee, That <hi>all Things work together for Good to them, who are the Called according to his Purpoſe</hi>: Even Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties Temptations, Griefs and Woes have all an happy End to the Godly: <hi>Out of the Eater cometh Meat, and out of the Strong cometh Sweetneſs</hi>: So, even eating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Griefs, Sickneſs and Loſſes, which make the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man decay, renew the inward Man, and make him flouriſh; Even the ſtrongeſt Difficulties, Temptations and Foes, when overcome, yield the ſweeteſt Victory: And the Thoughts of having ruſhed through ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſo ſtrong, ſhall be ſweet throughout Eternity. I ſee clearly, all the Steps of divine Providence toward me, have conſpired to a bleſſed Cloſe; even the moſt difficult of them, eſpecially this Half-Year: I would not,

for never ſo much, but that I die were I die, and am ſick in this Place; for his Diſpenſations have a wonderful Depth in them, &amp; cannot well be diſcerned, but by Eyes inlightned from above. But Worldlings are blind, and vary ſtrangely in their Judgment of Things; and even the Saints, while here, are much blinded with Sin and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of this over-powering Mortality: Death has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a terrible Face to theſe, that place all their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this Life; but I fear it not; it is not Death, but an Harbinger of Glory unto me: It is an hard-favoured Meſſenger, ſent from my ſweet <hi>Lord</hi> to me; 'Tis a dark and ſad Chariot carrying to the Land of Light and Joy. My <hi>LORD</hi> hath done to me, what he hath determined from Eternity; and all his Purpoſes, even all the Tho'ts of his Heart, are full of Love, infinite Love, to thoſe that wait upon him. I reſolved to glorify him on Earth, and dedicated my Life wholly to my <hi>LORD's</hi> Service; and I know it is all one with him, as if I had done it: And I ſhall, in another Manner, exalt and ſerve him above, than I could have done here below, weighted with Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and innumerable Infirmities. My <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſaid to me, It would weary thee, to ſtay too long in this Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Tears and Miſery; I take it, as if thou hadſt done me many Years Service: I have abridged thy Days, but not thy Life: I have ſhortned thy Toiling, but not thy Reward. And O what a bleſſed Thing it is, that He takes the Taſk of many weary Years Service off my Hand! My Warfare is ended; O the joyful Change I am undergoing! When ſhall I ſee Him, as He is; When ſhall I get my Fill of lovely Jeſus? O his Beauty, his Beauty, his Beauty! Men and Angels may admire the Freeneſs of his Grace, and admire it, and ever admire it! But what can they ſay, or comprehend of it? O the Freeneſs of his Grace! that he ſhould admit the like of me to ſtand eternally before him, and to be for ever in his Preſence; to be one of his honourable Train; Nay, to enjoy him, as near as can be! O! think ye, I loſe any

Thing, who get the Foreſtart, and become Poſſeſſor of that Inheritance? The Inheritance of many a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ancient Saint than I; nay, the Inheritance of the Heir of all Things? 'Tis little of Heaven I know, being obſcured with Mortality, and living by Faith, and not by Sight. But O to think of the Expreſſions of Scripture concerning it; <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what GOD hath prepared for thoſe that love him:</hi> If Heaven could be conceived by us, I ſhould not ſo much eſteem it. But O, it is a maſſie Thing! O ſtrange! that GOD ſhould make Bits of mortal Men (and what a poor worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Thing Man is, let any behold in a dying and dead Carcaſe) not only as happy as we can deſire, or conceive, but as happy as can be! O, the beholding of the Face of the Ancient of Days! But I know in whom I have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and that he is able to preſent me ſpotleſs before the Father, with exceeding great Joy. If I periſh, let him ſee to his Promiſe. I have laid all upon him: If I periſh (through the Strength of my LORD, by whom I can do all Things) I ſhall periſh believing. I expect much of Heaven, more than I can conceive; But, O! I think I ſhall be exceedingly deceived, (O ſweet Deceit!) for I ſhall find more than Ten thouſand Worlds can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. I ſhall ſee my Father ere long; Many ſweet Days have he and I had upon Earth: Many innumerable Ages ſhall we have in Heaven together. O Heaven! O, the Difference betwixt this melancholious, ſmoky Inn, and the Magnificent Hall of Glory! O the Change I am undergoing! I go from the Twilight of the Sun and Moon, to the Noon-day of the Splendour of Glory; from a Dunghil, to a Throne; from bodily Infirmities, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, Diſeaſes, and Pains, to a Land, whoſe Inhabitants do not ſay, I am ſick; from weariſom Labour and Toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, into an inconceivable ſweet Paradiſe, where I ſhall reſt for evermore; from a mortal Company, to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable immortal <hi>Company of Angels, to the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,

and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in Heaven; and to GOD the Judge of all; and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect; and to JESUS the Mediator of the New Covenant.</hi> O! what think ye, to be eternally, even for ever and ever among ſuch ſweet Company? Are there any more honourable and amiable Company, than they? O! what ſhall I ſay? What ſhall I think? that filthy and unworthy I ſhould ſhew my Face among ſo glorious an Aſſembly. What is here, but Vanity and Grief of Heart? O do you not long to be gone, to be in that ſweet and inconceivable Paradiſe? Caſt your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor within the Vail, and then you need not fear Death, come when it will. But O, long Life, or Death rather! For the ſooner at our Journey's End, the better; and the longer we are clogged with Sin and Miſery, the worſe; but the more we will love to linger in this <hi>Sodom.</hi> 'Tis hard to get our Hearts drawn quite off Time: We look kindly to the Baſtard's inheritance; and therefore we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor Death, and can friſt Heaven longer than any Thing elſe: But if we could get a Sight of the King in his Beauty, and <hi>of the Land that is afar off</hi>; then, O to be gone! O to be up above theſe viſible Heavens, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe gliſtering Companies, who enjoy him to the full! O! if Man knew how vain a World this is! O! but they are happy, and inconceivably happy, who eſcape fairly the Temptations, Snares and Difficulties that are in this Valley of Tears, and who are fairly landed on that odoriferous, flowery Land, an that raviſhing Land, which infinite and eternal Love did contrive to be the royal Theatre, whereon ſhould be ſhown, to Men and Angels, <hi>the Height and Breadth, Depth and Length, of that Love, which paſſeth Underſtanding!</hi> If you run faſt, you cannot be long behind me; and we ſhall ſee one another immediately: Death is no Separation to the Saints; For Time is nothing: For what is it to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for a few Hours, <hi>to them</hi> that are to dwell eternally together?

of Joys! Death is far miſtaken by the moſt Part of Saints, they have a wrong Conception of it; It is a ſweet Repoſe to a weary Soul, and looſeth the Soul from the Bands of Mortality, letting it out from a filthy, ſtinking Priſon, unto the ſweet and fragrant Air of Glory; It ends all Sorrows and Sighings, and begins unſpeakable Joys: 'Tis but a dark Cloud uſhering in the bright Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eternal Glory. O but my Lord hath excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumſtantiated my Death! O I admire his Love! I could tell many ſweet Paſſages of Providences he hath caſt in my Way: But I delay, until I be ſitting upon the Brink of the River of Life; and then I ſhall number them: I cannot now praiſe him; Alas that I am ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and dull; but I ſhall praiſe him anon, I ſhall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally praiſe him! <hi>O be glad and rejoice in our God!</hi> O ſweet! that poor, dying, miſerable I was not left to Uncertainties, not to know what to do; but to have ſuch a ſweet and kind Lord to repoſe on! Had I ſtayed long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this wretched Life, I was reſolved to have ſhown my ſelf as faithful to you as I could: But I commit you unto his Grace, who hath cared for me, even unto Death: Commit your ſelf to him, he will bring all to a good Iſſue that is truſted to him. We are not our own; therefore we are not to diſpoſe of our ſelves. CHRIST is a good Tutor and Governour, and carries all theſe well through, that commit themſelves to him. See that <hi>Mary</hi> neglect not Seeking of God, Praying, Reading of the Scriptures; Let her not frequent ill Company. O the Worth of a Soul! and the Reward of theſe, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in gaining of a Soul! Our Bodies muſt go to the Duſt; but our Souls are of more Worth than Ten thouſand Worlds. I am not able to ſay more, I am ſo weak. O! run faſt, Death is at the Door. We are all ſtepping into Eternity; What is Time, but a Preparation for it? Overlook Time, and live, as daily Dying, as one that muſt paſs away immediately, and never be here any more.

Conſider what I ſay, The Buſineſs is ſo weighty, ſo exceeding weighty, that Time, with all its Well and Wo, is to be overlooked, in Compariſon of this abſolutely and only neceſſary Thing: I tell you, There is an abſolute Neceſſity, that you be
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:005510_0129_101849EAAD6D3A08"/>
holy (let not the Poor Name affright you; for Holineſs is the ſweeteſt, and moſt eaſy Thing in the World, to them that are holy:) For, <hi>Without Holineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the LORD</hi>: And Salvation muſt be nearer your Heart, by many Degrees, than all other Concernments, tho' they were Ten thouſand Worlds. You muſt know the Bargain of the New Covenant, &amp; cloſe heartily with it, in all its Fulneſs, without the leaſt Reſervation: Upon it, I recommend unto you Mr. <hi>Guthry</hi>'s <hi>Trial of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intereſt in CHRIST</hi>; and deſire you to read it, till you become ſuch an one, as he deſcribes. Believe it, <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for all Things; having the Promiſes of this Life, and that which is to come.</hi> Tho' it may ſeem troubleſom in the Beginning; and tho' Chriſt's ſweet and eaſy Yoke may ſeem an hard Wreath; yet believe me, there is Nothing in the World, but it, which can give Reſt, and full Satisfaction to the Soul: All Things here are unſatisfying, tho' you had all that you can deſire of them. O this is a vain World! Theſe who are near Eternity will ſay ſo. O the vaſt Difference betwixt Time and Eternity! I aſſure you, if you had all that your Heart could wiſh or deſire of the Pomp, Treaſures and Pleaſures of Time, you would find no Contentment in them: And when you ſhall be in ſuch a Condition, as I am in, when pale Death ſhall be ſtaring you in the Face; then all the Glory of Time will be, in your Eyes, nothing but a withered Flower. But alas! we are drunk with this World; and we never know well what we are doing, till Death make us ſober. I muſt ſay again, and again, O the Difference betwixt Time, &amp; Eternity! They that get Heaven, can get no more; for, alas! What are all Additions of Time? What is a few Days Eating, and Drinking, &amp; Trifling? Yea, what are all the maſſie Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Time, compared with the Exerciſes of Glory? We place too much of our Happineſs in this Side of Time; and therefore Death is a great Diſappointer: But we ſhould be indifferent to all Things in Time, and have our Eyes
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:005510_0129_101849EAAD6D3A08"/>
ever fixed upon the Thoughts of Eternity: Then 'tis not at all to be regarded, in what Time of a Man's Life he die, if he die in the Lord: Yea, 'tis an invaluable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for the Priſoner, or weary Pilgrim, to have all his Toilings by his Hand, and to win to his native Soil. You may think, I put a hard Taſk upon you; becauſe our Nature is all polluted, and we are accuſtomed to do Evil. But the Ways of Holineſs are ſweet, and <hi>all its Paths are Peace</hi>: If you were once acquainted with the Ways of it, you would ſay, That Sin is the moſt baſe and vile Thing in the World; and Holineſs is the moſt noble Ornament. And conſider this, The more you ſet your Mind on Holineſs, the more ſweet and eaſy will you find it. As for temporary Things, take no Care for them; they are but Additions to the Son's Inheritance. I may ſay by Experience, He hath made good his Word to me in all theſe Things of Time; He hath made it good unto the End of my Race, in a moſt ſtrange and wonderful Way: So that I have taſted more of my Lord's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wonderful Providence, in this laſt Half-year of my Life, than in many Years before: I think it a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Diſpenſation, that he hath weaned my Heart from the World, more in this Half-Year's Sickneſs, than in many Years Health; This whole Half-year of my Life hath been a continual Winter, for bearing down my Corruption, both Original and Actual: And now the World hath no Reliſh to me. Farewel, vain World, I heartily ſubmit unto Death, if it were for no more, but becauſe it is the good Pleaſure of my Lord, who moſt mercifully takes me away from the Bondage of my Corruption, and from the dreadful Evils to come. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſeriouſly on Death: It is a Buſineſs moſt weighty, a Buſineſs upon which your eternal Well or Wo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: The End crowns the Work; die well, and you are well, even well for evermore. And O! is not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERMORE a maſſie Word? You ſhall find Death eaſy, if you be a diligent Seeker of God in your Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time:
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:005510_0130_101849EC3A6975F0"/>
If otherwiſe, you ſhall find it the foreſt Battle, that ever you fought; and you ſhall quake, when you ſhall hear an avenging God ſpeaking audibly in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>He is not mine, take his evil Soul, Devils; pull him to Pieces, and hale him away to utter Darkneſs:</hi> The poor Soul wreſtles in vain, but an avenging God leaves it for a Prey to Devils. Look not on Death, as afar off: Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle will be the Difference betwixt my Death and yours. This Generation will quickly be gone: Time is a gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Star, appearing ſomething before-hand, but indeed it is a tranſient Nothing. And one that dies at Sixty Years of Age, and another that dies at Twenty Years, think both alike, their bypaſt Time is a Dream. Short, or long Time is not to be regarded, but in Preparation for Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And he that is prepared, hath lived long enough. I could give you many Inſtructions, were I not very weak: Beware of ill Company; never think to ſee God, if you walk with ill Company: Companions in Time, &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in Eternity. Lay ſome Vows upon your ſelf; but remember this, That you vow to do nothing, in your own Strength; for you ſhall find, that when you are weakeſt in your own Eyes, then are you ſtrongeſt: I ſay, Lay ſome Vows upon your ſelf, as to pray thrice a Day ſeriouſly and conſcientiouſly; to read ſo much Scripture; and to mediate. Not that Men are tied to particular Times, but it is moſt profitable to lay Bands upon our looſe Corruptions, which elſe will plead for too much Liberty. Imagine not your Thoughts to be free; vain Thoughts are the Source of vain Words, and unprofitable Actions; the Mind is the Spring of all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Sins of the Time, as you would ſhun the terrible Judgments that threaten an apoſtate Generation: The Paſtors are become brutiſh, they are <hi>Sons of</hi> Belial, <hi>and know not the Lord</hi>; therefore they, who hear them, are Partakers of their Abominations. I need ſay no more. You never have rightly ſought God, until it be your chief Delight to ſeek him; therefore, never reſt till you
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:005510_0130_101849EC3A6975F0"/>
can ſay, <hi>I will go to God, my chiefeſt Joy.</hi> O then you are as happy as God can make you (to ſpeak ſo, with Reverence to that <hi>High and Lofty One, who inhabits Eternity</hi>) and can you be more happy? I take to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt you, your own Conſcience, and the great Judge of the Quick and the Dead, that, if you continue in any vain Imagination, <hi>living without God in the World,</hi> neglecting <hi>ſo great a Salvation,</hi> you are <hi>a Trampler under Foot of the Blood of the Covenant,</hi> and a Deſpiſer of all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions: But all this will do little, until He, who made Heaven and Earth, regenerate you. It may be he will hedge up your Way on every Side by Affliction, that you may be conſtrained to flee unto him, who is a <hi>preſent Help in Time of Trouble.</hi> This, if you follow it, is the beſt Legacy I could have left you; for, if you knew the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Pelf of this World, little of it would ſuffice. I would not for a World, I had been born to be rich: The lighter burdened with thick Clay, the better; 'tis hard to get up the Mount, tho' ye had but a very ſmall Weight upon your Back: For our Corruptions are weighty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, without any Addition. If you neglect that, which not I, but Chriſt commands you, Farewel for ever. If you obey, Farewel for a few Days; and then you and I ſhall meet, in the only Paradiſe, the Flower of the whole Creation: We ſhall ſit down upon the flowery Banks of the River of Life, and raviſh our ſelves for ever and ever, with everlaſting and unſpeakable Joys.

laſt Breath upon you, if I could do you any Good. I cannot forget you, even when I have forgotten the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the World; you are precious unto me, ſince I knew you in ſome Meaſure a Seeker of God. O what Advantages there are in ſeeking of Him! I defy Men and Angels to number and comprehend them: Endleſs Eternity ſhall be ſhort enough to lay open the inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Gains of Godlineſs. If you ſeek him diligently, ſincerely and conſtantly, you ſhall have all Things: And O is not that a vaſt Word, ALL THINGS? All ſhall be yours, <hi>whether the World, Life or Death, Things preſent, or Things to come</hi>; all theſe ſhall be yours, even the Great ALL, and whatſoever is his. O but the Saints have a long, large and full Charter! If you had a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for many Lands, it were but a narrow Thing: But now every Place where you tread on is yours; and what can you deſire more? Beheld the Heaven, and conſider even the Heaven of Heavens; for theſe are yours: Is it poſſible, that a Saint, the Heir of all Things, and Joint-Heir with the Son of the Eternal; Is it poſſible, I ſay, that he can want any Thing? Nay, the great Eternal, the Maker of all Things, He is yours; and what can you deſire more? Is it poſſible, that a Saint can want any Thing, whether ſpiritual or temporal? I mean any Thing that is good for him: And he alone knows what is beſt for us. When I look through the Paſſages of my Life, I ſee my Lord and Guide hath led me the beſt Way; and theſe have been the ſweeteſt Diſpenſations, which croſſed moſt my natural Diſpoſition, and which ſeemed moſt Judgment-like to carnal Eyes. We are like ignorant Children, that have no Judgment to make Choice of Things; but would ſwallow down ſweet Poiſon, and give away a rich Inheritance for painted Trifles. No Wonder then, the World be Fools and Mad-men in their Choice. My Life hath been but a Tract of Afflictions, and I would not for a Thouſand Worlds it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Tho' my <hi>Old-Man</hi> deſired ſtill to be ſwiming in the
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:005510_0131_101849F0590D0278"/>
Eaſe and Vanities of the World; yet I ſee my Lord hath been kindeſt, when I eſteemed him moſt cruel. The laſt Part of my Life might ſeem Judgment-like: But O you would wonder, if you knew what I know, and what my Lord hath done for me, in this laſt Half-year of my Life, both as to Things temporal and ſpiritual: I cannot underſtand them now, but I ſhall very ſhortly; and they ſhall be to me Matter of eternal Praiſe. Tho' I had abounded with all the Eaſe, Delights, Pomp &amp; Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Riches of Time; yet would I be glad to die, and leave the Puddle of ſwiniſh Pleaſures, and drink of the pure River of everlaſting Joys, that floweth from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Throne of GOD. This World quite miſtakes Death: O! who would not willingly leave ſuch a vain periſhing World? wherein we are ſtill diſhonouring our God; a World wherein the Saints get bad Entertainment; a World wherein the LORD of Glory was, and is daily, crucified: What is here? All the Glory and Excellency of the Creation is up above: A few imperfect Saints are only here. But it is above, I ſhall ſee and embrace all theſe Worthies, the Courtiers of the King of Glory. You need not be ſad for my Death; and will not, if you poſt hard after me, and follow on to know the LORD: For Time is juſt Nothing. We ſhall be glad and rejoice, with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, throughout all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in that Land of Glory, and inconceivable Joys. O, if you knew but a little of the Excellency of that Land of Bleſſedneſs! You would, in a Manner, envy thoſe who go before you. Tho' you ſhould paſs never ſo many ſweet Days ere you can get thither, you would weary: For your ſelf, you are yet in an Hell, of Sorrow and Sin, while out of Heaven, and while they are in an Heaven of Joy, and Pleaſure. O! Beware of Worldly-mindedneſs, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Cares; Commit all to your Father: <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof; and then all other Things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Fear not, <hi>It is your Father's good Pleaſure to give you a Kingdom</hi>:

And he that gives Heaven, will give as much Earth as will ſuffice you, and more than is ſufficient, is a heavy Weight, that will pull you down the Mount. O mark this! <hi>He that gave his only begotten Son,</hi> out of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, to be tormented unto Death for you; <hi>Will he not alſo with him freely give you all Things,</hi> even every Thing that pertains to Life and Godlineſs? As for Things temporal, the leſs of the World, the better: All the Saints will teſtify it, at leaſt when they are leaving it. I can put my Seal to it now, when I am entring into Eternity, that it is moſt dangerous to be intangled ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Riches, Honours, or Pleaſures; And that it is the ſweeteſt Diſpenſation, to be afflicted, and cut ſhort of them; for Proſperity is the Neck-break of the Life of Godlineſs, as the Experience of many a deceived Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor may teſtify; who ſeemed Something, when afflicted; but when once they got the Bag, betrayed Chriſt. 'Tis hard for a <hi>Camel to go through a Needle's Eye</hi>: The more we are inveigled with this deceitful World, the leſs do we value Heaven. Now Nothing more glews a Man's Heart to the Earth, than Riches, which have weighed many a Man down to the Pit; where he is weeping and gnaſhing his Teeth, curſing Riches, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting himſelf, that ever he deſired them: Whereas, if he had been poor, he ſhould have been now (as Men may conjecture) rejoicing amongſt theſe glorified Ones. Remember, that it is utterly impoſſible to ſerve God and <hi>Mammon</hi>; And if your Treaſure be not in Heaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will your Heart be there. I bleſs my LORD for mine Afflictions (which have been ſtill greater and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, till now, I am leaving them all) as much as for any Mercy, I ever received: For now I reap the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs, And tho' now I be weeping, while I ſow; yet ſhortly ſhall I have as much as I can bear of the maſie Sheaves of unconceivable Glory. <hi>Weep and howl, ye rich Men, for your Miſery that ſhall come upon you:</hi> For <hi>you now receive your good Things,</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="unknown:005510_0132_101849F1E04A1918"/>
and the Saints <hi>their evil Things</hi>; therefore immediately ſhall <hi>ye be afflicted and tormentod, and they ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. Bleſſed are they that mourn now, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> For the Saints weep, while the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth; but our Sorrow ſhall be turned into Joy, and their mad Mirth into unſpeakable and eternal Horrour. O! if Men did conſider this, they would not toil for their Eaſe and Pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor would they envy the rich Gluttons, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poor <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, that are deſpicable in the Eyes of all. <hi>Fret not when you ſee the Wicked proſper</hi>; nor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue Poverty, Shame and Contempt; ſince the only excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ones, <hi>of whom the World was not worthy, wandered about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins; being deſtitute, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and tormented:</hi> And the honourable Apoſtles, and Followers of the Lamb, were accounted <hi>the Offſcourings of all Things.</hi> O if the Saints would take Time, ſit down and conſider theſe Things! they would find it ſweet, to be conformed, in Sufferings, to their Lord, <hi>who was a Man of Sorrows, &amp; acquainted with Grief</hi>; That they might alſo be conformed to him in Glory. I fear Earthly mindedneſs may be your Predominant; therefore ſtrive moſt againſt it: For, how can one ſet their Heart upon Traſh, and earneſtly deſire it, and Heaven alſo? I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you, the only Way to have as much of the World as is neceſſary and good for you, is to commit your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lot wholly to Chriſt, without the leaſt Reſervation: This is beſt; for Nothing can be committed to him, and go wrong: Try him, and if ye do not find that he will carry you bravely through, ſo that you ſhall lack Nothing that is good for you, then call him a Liar: Yet, never any of the Saints could ſay, he failed them in a Jot of what he promiſed them. And how great are his Promiſes! as you will find in Scripture: They are all comprehended in this, <hi>The Lord is a Sun and Shield; he will give Grace and Glory; and no good Thing will he withhold from them that love him, and walk uprightly.</hi>

Truſt all to him; for, whether ſhould you tutor your ſelf, or he? Which of you is wiſeſt? Caſt all upon him, to the leaſt Bit of Bread! and ye ſhall find a great Eaſe. They are miſerable, who muſt care for themſelves, and what concerns them, and have not a GOD to run to, on whom they may lay themſelves, and all their Burdens. O! learn to truſt in God for all Things, temporal and eternal: It is an hid Myſtery to many Saints, in many Things, eſpecially, to truſt againſt Senſe, to hope againſt Hope; when there is no humane Probability, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the bare Word of him who is true, is a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; where his Providence ſeems to contradict his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or to make his Promiſe a Liar: But will you truſt him for Heaven, and not for a Moment of Time? Think you, he will withhold Journey-bread, if you be a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the higher <hi>Canaan?</hi> It were a great Abſurdity, to command any to go a Journey, and not to give what is neceſſary for it. Go on to Heaven, hold your Face ſtill thitherward, and Chriſt will ſtill be ſupplying all your Wants: Indeed he will not ſatisfie your carnal Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor give you more than a Pilgrim needs; ſo that you ſhould forget the Race ſet before you, by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with a Number of Superfluities. I would ſay more, If Breath and Strength would permit: You know not what a World you are into; 'Tis full of Snares and Difficulties. You will find it hard to keep clean Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; unleſs you commit your ſelf unto him, who can carry you as <hi>with Eagles Wings,</hi> and ſtrengthen and ſupport you, when you are ready to fall. Tho' you ſhould be the preciſeſt of all round about you; you will find all little enough, when you come to Death: O! Death is a weighty Buſineſs. You have ſcarce Time to prepare for it: All our Time is little enough for Preparation, tho' we ſhould cut our ſelves ſhort of our indifferent earthly Exerciſes: What Need had we then, to beware to paſs our Time vainly? 'Tis precious every Moment of it having a Relation to Eternity. O Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity!
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:005510_0133_101849F5D4AC6F48"/>
Eternity! Get ſome Sight of it, and your Thoughts ſhall be wonderfully changed: For, I tell you, could you get a Glimpſe of that maſſie Thing, called, ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY, all the Things in Time ſhould be no more in your Eyes, than a childiſh Toy in the Eyes of a Man. Even the World decked in its beſt Robes, ſeems ſuch a poor Thing to me, that I would not be at the Pains to ſtretch out my Hand, if I had it for the taking up; &amp; ſuch will it ſeem ere long to many. Worldlings are but Beaſts; and the richeſt and moſt flouriſhing of them, could you ſee them with my Eyes, are but mean Dunghil Worms; their Meditations cannot flee over Time. Then look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World as mad, they know not what they are doing; they value only Time, and yet they know not how to get it paſt away. Be a great Reader of the Scriptures; for there ſhall you find Inſtruction, to make you wiſe to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and thereby you may guide your Steps warily, in an evil Time: There ſhall you find Threatnings, to rouſe you up; and Promiſes, to comfort and ſuſtain you in the ſaddeſt of Conditions. Reverence the Ordinances, adminiſtred by faithful Paſtors; for they are the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the Lord, our King: But, abhor falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which lead Men into Deſtruction. Alas that there ſhould be any of Chriſt's Servants, who give an ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to theſe that are Simple, counſelling them, by their Practice, to follow Thieves &amp; Robbers, whoſe Voice Chriſt's Sheep will not hear. Set, at leaſt, three Times a Day apart, for Prayer; for when we neglect that, our Hearts are cold all the Day long; and then we are eaſily ſnared with any Temptation we meet with. Sometimes meditate, and conſider your Self, and others; that ſo you may not go on in your Journey like the World, who never ponder their Way, but are led to Deſtruction by their earthly Deſires, ruſhing into it, as Horſes to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. What have you to do here, but to mind Salvation? Conſider this; for Death will ſtrip you naked of all Things here; but chuſe the <hi>one Thing neceſſary, that ſhall never
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:005510_0134_101849F8DA8A72E8"/>
be taken away.</hi> Remember then, that all Things here are ſubordinate to Salvation: Our Time is ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, we flee away. Death will be upon you ere you be aware; it ſurpriſeth alike all Sorts of Ages, Young and Old: Chuſe you, whether you will have Death ſweet or bitter. For my Part, I fear not Death; my LORD hath ſaid to me, <hi>Son, be of good Cheer, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi> O who would not go hence, if it were but to ſtand at one of the Gates of the golden City, and ſee the Lord, with all the Ranſomed Ones, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Company of Prieſts and Kings, ſtanding round about the LAMB, crowned with Honour and Glory! One Hour of Heaven, yea, one Sight of the Face of the Ancient of Days, would do more than make up all the bitter Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I have ſwimmed through in Time: Nay, I think the very Fore-thoughts of Glory do already ſwallow up all the Impreſſions of the Tribulations of Time, that have ſeized on me: They are nothing now; they are gone, and ſhall never return again; Yea, they are, as if they had not been. This ſhall be Matter of high Praiſes, through endleſs Eternity, for evermore. O vaſt Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! But O ſilly Time! No Wonder <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>We look not at the Things that are ſeen, but the Things that are not ſeen; for the Things that are ſeen, are temporal; but the Things that are not ſeen, are eternal:</hi> The Things that are ſeen, were not from Eternity, neither ſhall they be to Eternity. O then! overlook them: Cloſe your Eyes, as it were, upon them; and you ſhall ſee ſtrange Sights, which ſhall make your Courſe to Glory ſwift and cheerful? O! what think you of Chriſt? Is there any like him? is there any but He? If you have him, you have all Things: His Words cannot be told. What think you of it, to be ſaved from everlaſting Burnings? What think you of it, that ſinful wretched we ſhould be as happy as can be? Even eternally, and unconceivably happy! and all this purchaſed by the Death and Blood of our kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt LORD JESUS? O who would not love ſuch an

One? Surely, it is impoſſible to know him any Way a right, and not to love him: He is the Raviſhment of Men and Angels. Increated Glory ſhines through the Vail of his humane Nature: We cannot enjoy God more ſweetly, familiarly and fully, than through him: He is the bleſſed Days-Man betwixt God and Man; the Man Chriſt Jeſus. Him I wiſh I could declare evermore: But my laſt Words, tho' they were fewer, may have a ſtrong Impreſſion upon you. Run faſt, loſe not the Crown; Heaven is well worth an Inch of Time's Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Croſs corrupt Nature's Diſpoſition; as you ſow, ſo ſhall you reap: And conſider, That Death will teach you, that all that you do is fruitleſs, which tends not to the great Salvation: All other Mercies are not worth, in Compariſon of this great Salvation; and a ſhort Time will ſpend them all: But it ſhall endure for evermore. O but the News of Heaven, ſuch a ſweet Heaven to weary Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, ſuch a raviſhing Paradiſe to theſe that are in this ſmoky Dunghil; I ſay, They are the greateſt News that can be!

                  </gap>hip we have had together; and becauſe you are (I'm perſwaded) one of the Heirs of Glory, and among thoſe who wreſtle through manifold Temptations, unto the Land of eternal Conſolations! O if I could tell you what my Lord hath done for me unto this very Hour; and much more ſince I came hither, than in many fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Years! I think, if I had Time, I could fill a whole Volume with wonderful Experiences of his Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtrange Providences, and ſweet Chaſtiſements: So that an Half-Year may be better than an hundred. 'Tis not the Length of Time, we are to look to: We have a race to run to Heaven; and when we have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it, we have done. Oh! <hi>Couſin,</hi> even a Saint may live long, and make very ſmall Progreſs to Glory: Yea, many go backward; and it were better for them, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ere that be, before they diſhonoured God by their backſliding Carriages: Therefore run faſt, <hi>Eye the Joy that is ſet before you,</hi> and patiently endure all the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Troubles in Time; for your Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that <hi>He will never leave you nor forſake you: And none ſhall be able to pluck you out of his Hand.</hi> Indeed you may have ſore Trials, both outward and inward; but <hi>be of good Courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen your Heart</hi>: For you are not to bear your own Burden, but to caſt it fully over upon Him. And I promiſe you, in my Lord's Name, you ſhall be ſuſtained: He is our Strength, our Wiſdom, our Righteouſneſs, and our All; even all that we want, all that we can deſire. Never notice

long or ſhort Life: but live to die, and then you die to live eternally. O! think much upon Eternity, and you ſhall think Nothing of Time. Alas! alas! the Things of Time fill our Eyes ſo, as we never regard Eternity: Yet, Time will be at a Cloſe ere ever we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. I have ſomewhat the Advantage of you in getting the Fore-ſtart: But we ſhall be together perpetually, even immediately; &amp; we ſhall have another Manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, than poſſibly we could have had on Earth. In Heaven they are not confined to Moments, Days &amp; Years; we ſhall have Eternity to rejoice and be glad in: O what a Life ſhall we have, when you and I ſhall <hi>follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goes</hi>! When we ſhall have Sin, Temptations and Miſeries done away! We know not the Excellency of our invaluable Inheritance; and therefore are we ſo much taken up with earthly Trifles, and Shadows, that are Nothing; which bewitch all the Worldlings out of their Wits, &amp; the Saints too, in a great Meaſure: It were more Wiſdom in us, <hi>to uſe the World, as not abuſing it,</hi> as not ſetting our Hearts upon it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Cares of the World, and the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, wherewith you may be intangled, in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you are in; if you take not Heed, your Courſe to Glory will be the more ſlow, and you will drive your Chariot-Wheels heavily up to the higher City; yea, the thick Clay will make them come back upon you. O conſider how great a Buſineſs Salvation is! We can never conſider it enough. You will think ſo, when you come to Death, which you ought to look upon as at the Door.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not theſe Things, as if you knew them not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but I put you in Remembrance, deſiring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a little of my Mind to you, now, when I am at the Brink of Time; becauſe Providence hath ſo ordered that we cannot ſpeak Face to Face theſe Things, which are the true and genuine Thoughts of my Heart. Beware of the Pollutions of the Times. It is comfortable to me
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:005510_0136_101849FEC411EE60"/>
that I had Little or Nothing to do, as to outward Things, with this horrid, curſed Defection. <hi>Hate the Garments ſpotted with the Fleſh</hi>: Clean Garments are of great Worth; and theſe few, in this woful Time, that have kept their Garments clean, <hi>ſhall walk with our Lord in White; for they are worthy.</hi> To keep clean Garments, that is, to be pious alone; pious in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in your Worſhip; pious in your worldly Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; full of Charity, deſpiſing the World; walking wiſely towards theſe that are without, and towards theſe that are within. And as to the Times, let your Zeal be wiſe, and your Wiſdom zealous. You may believe a dying Man, I am fully perſwaded that this Prelacy is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Antichriſtianiſm; and that the Prelates and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates are the Miniſters, not of CHRIST, but of Antichriſt and Satan; and that it is utterly unlawful to hear them, or do any Thing, that may ſhew you eſteem them Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or any Way ſtrengthen their Hands. O the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wrath, that is hanging over theſe Lands like a Cloud, which will fall down in a Deluge of Divine Vengeance. God will make this Land to ſwim in Blood; even the Blood of all Sorts, Great and Small, Rich and Poor, Old and Young, ſhall be poured out like Duſt: He ſhall be a ſtrange Man, that ſhall happily eſcape ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. I will not ſpeak much of the Matter, but I ſee fearful Things coming. But, O the glorious Days ſucceeding theſe! I cannot apprehend the Glory that ſhall ſhine in <hi>Britain,</hi> which ſhall enlighten to the Ends of the Earth. I fear not Death, 'tis Sin only we ought to fear; <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin</hi>; That being taken away, it is moſt harmleſs. It is ſweet to die in Chriſt! O what an Exchange do I make! I ſhall ſee him, and that glorious Company of Saints and Angels, <hi>following Him whitherſoever He goes</hi>: The firſt Hour of Glory ſhall, in a Manner, make me forget that ever I was upon Earth. My Afflictions have been greater than the Spectators could imagine; and ſtill greater and greater, until I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:005510_0136_101849FEC411EE60"/>
at the Haven of eternal Reſt. O 'tis ſweet! O 'tis ſweet! after a great-Toil and Labour. My Lord is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me in the fitteſt Time; for both Body and Soul are very weary and ſore toſſed: But this Body ſhall get a ſound Sleep, and a raviſhing Wakning. O the great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt what it is now, and what it ſhall be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! Who can conceive what Chriſt hath done for the Saints? O the Depth of free, altogether free Love and Grace! It ſhall take up Eternity to cry up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Love of JEHOVAH and the LAMB. O to think that Bits of Clay, ſinful Clay, like you and me ſhould be conformed unto the Image of our only Lord Jeſus! That is a wonderful Exaltation! wonderful in the Eyes of all theſe, that ſee their own Emptineſs and Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. O admire! O praiſe! O adore! Let theſe Things be ſtill imprinted on your Heart; all other Things are but Trifles. Look upon the World, as a Number of mad Bodies: They are Beaſts, whoſe Conceptions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within an Inch of Time: They are poor Spirits, who gape after Time's Riches, Honour and Pleaſures. If the World knew what they were doing, they would wonder at themſelves; at leaſt, they would begin to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether their Life on Earth was real, or only emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Night-dream. O ſuch a Sight as I have gotten of the World! O 'tis but vain, Vanity of Vanities: The Flower and Choice of it is curs'd, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Vanity. O if I could tell you of the Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The moſt Part of Profeſſors (among whom I put my ſelf) take an eaſy Way to Heaven: And O where will you find the Man, or Woman, that ſtudies a cloſe Walk with God! 'Tis recorded of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that <hi>He walked with God Three hundred Years</hi>: But who can ſay, He hath walked with God one Day? We loſe God in the Midſt of our worldly Employments, and cannot ſay, <hi>We have ſet the

Lord always before us</hi>; Therefore, we cannot ſay, <hi>We ſhall not be moved.</hi> We approach to Him, in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Evening, and at other Times; but we neglect our Thoughts: Whereas to live full of holy divine Tho'ts, is to live a Saint: As the Man is, ſo are his Thoughts. Alas! I may ſay it, by ſad Experience, Unwatched-over Tho'ts have made me, many a Time, not to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much from a Worldling. Keep your Thoughts right, and all ſhall be right: <hi>Keep thine Heart with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> (ſaith the Spirit of God) <hi>for out of it are the Iſſues of Life.</hi> If your Thoughts be right, your Prayers will be ſeaſonable, your Words and Actions will be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, for, <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> and the Hand acteth. Commit all your Affairs, temporal, ſpiritual and eternal, wholly to your heavenly Father, without the leaſt Reſervation: <hi>He cares for you</hi>; Therefore, <hi>be careful in nothing, but in every Thing give Thanks. Run, run with Patience, the Race that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; Laying aſide every Weight,</hi> that may bear you down: Intangle not your ſelf with the World; have as little ado with it, as you can: <hi>The Righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved</hi>; they, who go uprighteſt, ſhall find hard enough Work: We are ſo full of Corruptions ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and actual, that Holineſs is quite contrary to our corrupt Natures: I mean not the common Holineſs, which even thoſe, that are ſtrict, are thought to have; but that which our Lord commands; <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother, Siſter or Brother, or the World, or himſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> O it is an unknown Thing, to <hi>deny all, to take up their Croſs daily, and follow CHRIST.</hi> I had a great Deſire to preach CHRIST; But He will accept the Will for the Deed: I go to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Exerciſe, whereof one Hour is better than all the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings betwixt this, and Chriſt's ſecond Coming, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendized in one. All here are but Shadows; all above is Subſtance. O what elevated Divines are above! They are all filled with all the Fulneſs of God; &amp; do preach

and cry up the tranſcendent Excellencies of JEHOVAH and the LAMB: There is a perpetual Crying-up of Chriſt. In <hi>Canticles,</hi> He can never enough ſpeak of his Spouſe: Up above, his Spouſe can never enough ſpeak of Him. There all are raviſhed with the Ancient of Days! Who, but the Ancient of Days? Who but CHRIST? Who, but the Saints? Then, let never Earth &amp; Heaven be compared together; for I tell you, Earth, is but a tormenting Hell, in Compariſon of that unſpeakably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, and altogether raviſhing Land, unto which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy (but happy) I am going, O methinks, I am touching the Skirts of the fragrant Breathings of the Mountains of Spices! And O how I muſt be raviſhed, when I ſhall draw in no other Air, but the Breathings of the higher Paradiſe? They have the Advantage, that get the Fore-ſtart to Heaven, and ſeeing the Face of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH firſt; and being more antient Poſſeſſors of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Inheritance. Why ſhould any be afraid to go to Heaven too ſoon? Why ſhould any be afraid he be too ſoon happy? Let Worldlings deſire to crawl long on their Dunghils: But let us ever be longing <hi>to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and to be with our LORD, which is beſt of all.</hi> I commit you, your Mother-in-law, your Wife and Children, to the Protection of the Almighty; and pray for temporal and eternal Bleſſings to be poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.

               <p>THough I be ſtepping into Eternity, and was thought to have been juſt entring into it about Half an Hour ago, I could not but remember you and
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:005510_0138_10184A0458479F38"/>
dictate a little of my Mind unto you: Not that I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write any Inſtructions unto you, but only ſhew, That God is good to them that ſeek him; and that in his Providence, his Promiſes are all accompliſhed to the Full, to me. I cannot tell what he hath done for my Soul; but I think, He hath brought me to the End of my Days, to the End of my Race, by ſuch a wonderful Chain of divine Providence, that I would not, for Ten thouſand Worlds, He had brought me any other Way; or, that my Race had been either longer, or ſhorter. He liveth long enough, who liveth till he get Heaven: All other Things are but Pendicles. He liveth ſhort While, who is unprepared for it; of whatſoever Age he be: Therefore my Death needs not offend any Man; for, what can I get more, than the <hi>Kingdom immoveable, undefiled, and that fadeth not away</hi>? I deſired to live, for no other End, but to preach my <hi>Lord to the great Congregation</hi>; And think you not, He will accept the <hi>Will</hi> for the <hi>Deed</hi>? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated my Life for his Service; and I hope, He will graciouſly take it off my Hand, as if I had done him many Years Service. And I muſt tell you, He hath many wonderful Ways of Bringing his Children unto Glory: I could tell you it by ſweet Experience, if my Weakneſs and Breath would permit. I would not, for all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Riches and Pleaſures of a vain World, my Lot had been another than my Lord hath appointed it; yea, my laſt Half-Year's Providence hath been a golden Chain, which neither I, Men, nor Angels can ſufficiently value. Would you know, what I think now of Heaven? Tho' I were out of this State of Mortality, I could never think of it enough! O! O! O! the Joy of being with JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH and the LAMB! O the <hi>Excellency of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> even on this Side of Time! But to ſee Him as he is, O who can tell what a Sight it is? Even theſe who ſee <hi>Him Face to Face,</hi> ſee, as it were, but the Skirts of his Beauty and Excellency: And let them dive ſtill deeper and deeper, till Eternity, as it were, be at

an End, they ſhall ſtill be but beginning, and yet never well begun. To ſhew my great Love and Reſpect I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had to you, both formerly and now, I write unto you, even when the Dead-Rittle is in my Throat: And tho' I be in a great Agnoy, I find the only Way to Heaven, that <hi>New and Living Way,</hi> is only by the Blood of the Son of GOD: There is no other Way, but, <hi>Believe</hi> in Chriſt and be <hi>Saved.</hi> But it is a lively, purifying, loving and believing Way. I cannot ſay much, I am in Death's Pangs. But, <hi>O Death! where is thy Sting? O Grave! where is thy Victory?</hi> I am like to have a ſharp Combat; but, I hope, Chriſt will not be an indifferent Spectator. The End crowns the Work. And if once I were within <hi>Emmanuel</hi>'s ſurpaſſing ſweet Land of Conqueſt, then ſhould I trample Death and Hell under Foot; and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all the Miſeries and Afflictions of Time, which ſeemed to triumph over me. O Death what art thou, in mine Eyes! My LORD hath ſwallowed thee up in Victory: And can a free-born Son, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, through the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, be afraid of a conquered Slave? <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.
