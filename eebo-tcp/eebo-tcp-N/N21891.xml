            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF CONSTANTIUS &amp; PULCHERA.</head>
            <p>IN the ſuburbs of the city of Philadelphia, in the ſoft ſeaſon of the year, about one o'clock, on a moon ſhining morning, on the terrace of an high building, forty feet from the ground, appeared a moſt beautiful lady of the age of ſixteen—ſhe was clad in a long white veſt, her hair of a beautiful cheſnut colour, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſsly over her ſhoulders; every mark of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was viſible in her countenance, which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt with a ſolemn gloom, and now and then, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing tear, unnoticed, rolled down her cheek.</p>
            <p>She caſt her eyes around, taking a ſurvey of the garden below, and the places adjacent—a fixed melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, apparently, increaſed on her countenance, and now and then the big ſigh would burſt from her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring boſom—more than once ſhe attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the chamber from which ſhe had made her appearance—and then would appear unreſolved. At length, taking a chair, and ſeating herſelf near the ſide of the terrace, and after a few moments of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſilence, ſhe thus uttered herſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028832_0004_0FDD5CB9777B9148"/>"O cruel fortune! O more cruel parent!—when ſhall I again behold my adorable CONSTANTIUS? but why do I mention him? why do I recall his loved ideas? He is gone,—I am baniſhed forever from him, cloiſtered up in this unbleſſed manſion—debarred from him, for whoſe ſake only I could wiſh to live!—But I muſt deface his memory.—O for one draught from the river Lethe, that the tender feelings of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted boſom might no more be harrowed up by his recollection! Alas! vain is the wiſh; the impreſſion on my heart is ſo deep, that it cannot be defaced but by annihilation!—Can I ever eradicate from my mind his lovely features, his charming diſpoſition, his fine ſenſe, with all his finiſhed accompliſhments! No, ſooner than that could be the caſe, the adamant would vegetate. All impoſſibilities will become practicable, ſooner than I could forget that ſtood of tranſport with which I ſurrendered my heart to him, and took deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of his in exchange, and called on Heaven to regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the indiſſoluble contract.</p>
            <p>Oh! the effuſion of extacy of that happy moment, the ſoft remembrance of which ſerves no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to plant daggers in my diſtracted boſom. Why ſhould a father be loſt to every tender feeling, and tear me inſtantaneouſly from the ſummit of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and place me in the <hi>focus</hi> of torment!—"never more to ſee him!" The cruelleſt accents which ever were uttered by one who is totally unworthy the name of "<hi>father!</hi>" Has he aſſaſſinated him? or has he procured his manumiſſion to ſome foreign barbarous land? O could I but once more ſee him, though it were but juſt long enough to bid him a final farewell— O could I but have the ſatisfaction of taking my leave of him, though it were in the agonies of death; how would I waſh his mangled limbs with tears, and kiſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028832_0005_0FDD5CBE14B94470"/>
the departing ſoul from his quivering lips! How would my ſoul burſt through the ſhackles of its clay tenement, and bear him company through the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored regions of Elyſium! but in vain the wiſh.— But what doth my eyes ſee paſſing through the moon ſhade of the garden? It is my dear, loved CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIUS, or his ſpirit returned from the Elyſian fields! But hark, I hear his footſteps, it is he, and not his ſpirit—Once more have my optic nerves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated my almoſt deſerted body—CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS! CONSTANTIUS! once more your PULCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA beholds you; my eyes are enchanted at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, though bars of iron hold me from your embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! Three bolted doors ſecure me from you—yet I behold you, and never more will I complain of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fortune, if I can but expire before you are taken from my view, dear CONSTANTIUS! CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS!" He lifted up his eyes and beheld her—with the ſtrongeſt emotions of elevated joy, he exclaimed, "my dear PULCHERA, it is enough! once more I do behold the object to which in my mind I had given a final adieu!—driven from your arms by a father, who till the fatal moment had expreſſed his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me in the moſt flattering terms, with a ferocity which I never before believed human nature capable of, he drove me from his houſe, after having torn from me the delight of my eyes, and the raviſher of my heart—tell me, my deareſt PULCHERA, what was the cauſe of this ſtrange alteration of conduct in him, whom once I thought worthy to be called your father."</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſed PULCHERA replied,—"Ambition! cruel ambition is the cauſe of our misfortune—no man was ever better pleaſed with another than my father was with you, until Monſieur <hi>Le Monte,</hi> only ſon and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028832_0006_0FDD5CBF604E4380"/>
heir to a rich nobleman in France, waited on him, and offered to make me his wife, giving a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting deſcription of the honours and pomp he would advance me to—the temptation was too great for him to withſtand—the anticipations of tinſelled greatneſs took the full poſſeſſion of his ſoul—he prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed Monſieur that I ſhould be his—he ſoon informed me of my deſtination, and I could ſee joy ſparkling in his eyes when he reflected on the good fortune to which he fondly imagined my good ſtars had deſtined me.—In vain did I remonſtrate to him, that by his own voluntary conſent I had formed an indiſſoluble union with my deareſt CONSTANTIUS, and that love had cemented us beyond the power of ſeparation; and while I was going on with my moſt pathetic lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his conduct, your approach interrupted me— a degree of rancour, which till then I ſuppoſed him totally incapable of, appeared in his viſage, and your own recollection will furniſh you with ideas of his conduct, until he drove you from the garden in which we were, and gave you the ſolemn aſſurances you never ſhould ſee me more.</p>
            <p>He then ſecured me in the chamber communicating with the terrace, on which you ſee me forty feet high; and tomorrow I am to embark for France, in a pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, lying in the river, with Monſieur, to be his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever"—Here her voice failed her, and ſhe almoſt diſſolved in a flood of tears. CONSTANTIUS was on the rack at this fatal intelligence—in deſpair he drew his ſword, and was on the eve of falling on its point, thereby putting a period to an exiſtence which he no longer could conſider as a bleſſing; but fortune, which always favours the virtuous, ſuggeſted to his mind a tow line he that day had obſerved in his ſtore, which had been left there by accident—he cries out, PUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHERA,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028832_0007_0FDD5CC361C57648"/>
be contented a few moments, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you. So running to his ſtore, which ſtood not far diſtant, he takes the tow line, and laſhing three oars at the end of each other, made the rope faſt to the end of them. He by this means reached the rope to PULCHERA, who diſengaged it from the oar, made it faſt to one of the banniſters of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, by which means ſhe deſcended, tho' the knot by which ſhe made the rope faſt, ſlipped before ſhe had got to the ground, yet ſhe was ſo near it that ſhe received no material damage thereby. Never, perhaps, was joy more triumphant than on this occaſion: he ſtraitway conveyed her to his chamber, where the remainder of the night was ſpent in a far more agreeable manner, than the former part thereof had been.</p>
            <p>Never was there, perhaps, a greater tranſition from doleful anticipations to real joy, than had been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by PULCHERA; for nothing could be more diſtreſſing to her than the idea of being forever ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from CONSTANTIUS; to be forced by cruel pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental authority from her home, her friends, and from every pleaſing proſpect, into a foreign land, and there to be ſhackled for life to a man to whom ſhe had the moſt fixed and irreverſable averſion, and from whom ſhe had no other conceivable way to eſcape than through the avenue of death; thus circumſtanced, to be in a manner bordering on the inviſible world, and diveſted of all her fearful apprehenſions, at the ſame time to find herſelf in the full poſſeſſion of him who was dearer to her than all things elſe, was well nigh too hard for her. They ſcarcely had finiſhed their reciprocal congratulations, when the clock advertiſed them that two hours of the laſt half of the night was expended, when CONSTANTIUS informed her that her ſafety required her to be put in ſome place more
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028832_0008_0FDD5CC49D4C5DC0"/>
ſecure from the reſearches of her father, who would doubtleſs make the moſt vigorous efforts to recover her. This piece of information gave a moſt ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhock to PULCHERA, who till that moment had conſidered herſelf in the moſt perfect ſecurity; vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchemes of ſafety were propoſed by each of them, not one of which on examination proved admiſſible; at length the dawn of day approaching, neceſſity obliged them to leave their preſent place of retreat, and conclude on ſome place of ſecurity after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the haven.</p>
            <p>In this determination they quitted the chamber, hand in hand through the meadows, while invention ſupplied the place of converſation until they wandered down the banks of the Delaware ſome miles; when on ſome occaſion PULCHERA being a few rods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, CONSTANTIUS, as juſt entering a ſhort turn of the bank, was ſeized by half a dozen armed men, who hurried him on board of a boat. PULCHERA, by the means of the feeble rays of light which were retained by the atmoſphere, had a dim proſpect of this tranſaction; and altho what ſhe eſteemed as her <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> was torn from her, yet ſo ſudden was the onſet, and ſo complete the ſurprize, that it ſummoned all the tender and fearful feelings which female nature is ſuſceptible of; and PULCHERA retired behind the oppoſite declivity of the bank, out of the proſpect of the ſcene, and ſecure from their view. Dreadful were the ſenſations which ſhe here experienced; her apprehenſions of perſonal danger being at laſt in ſome meaſure abated, the ſafety of CONSTANTIUS in the next inſtance occupied her diſtracted boſom; ſhe burſt into a flood of tears, and exclaimed, "Oh! heavens, where is he! what have they done with him! he is gone! he is gone! never more ſhall my wretched eyes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028832_0009_0FDD5CC62F96E068"/>
behold him! he has fallen a prey to relentleſs <hi>Britiſh barbarity!</hi> he muſt expire in ſome loathſome priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or give up the ghoſt in ſome forlorn, death-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated dungeon, without a friendly hand to cloſe his eyes when they are dimmed by death! Why did my cowardly fears prevail on me to leave him? Why did I not like a true lover (as I thought I was) preſs forward to him, and have been a partner in his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes? Had I been worthy the name of a lover, I ſhould have done it; but I was a ſtranger to love, tho' I profeſſed it, and now I am juſtly left to ſuffer tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments greater than would be probable on any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where he was preſent. But can I not yet get to him?—She ran to the bank of the river, where ſhe was ſeized by the party, but nothing of him or his captors could be diſcovered—Frantic in deſpair, ſhe beat her breaſt, tore her hair, curſed her fate, and prayed for annihilation, and was juſt about commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her body to the watery grave, when ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented therefrom by her father's taking hold of her arm.</p>
            <p>The conſternation ſhe was now in is more eaſily conjectured than deſcribed—Her father, unacquainted with what had happened to CONSTANTIUS, any further than he gathered from the exclamations of PULCHERA, ſuffered her to ſtay there no longer, but inſtantly conducted her home, and confined her to an inner chamber, leaving her to the reflections of her own mind, where ſleep and comfort were equally ſtrangers to her.</p>
            <p>The next day her father entered her chamber in a pleaſant air, inquiring after her health, and ſaying a a variety of pleaſant things to her, taking no notice of her late elopement: — At length, in ſoft accents, he obſerved to her that this was the day on which <hi>M. Le
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028832_0010_0FDD5CCA1A9CF530"/>
Monte</hi> had propoſed to embark with her for his native country, in order to make her his wife; and that all he waited for was to be informed of her readineſs to attend him. Her father was about to proceed, but was interrupted by PULCHERA, who thus accoſted him, "Dear father, the obligation of paternal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the duty of filial obedience, are amongſt the firſt ideas which took place in my mind; and with ſuch forcible leſſons have thoſe duties been inculcated on my mind, that nothing will ever be able to deface them; and I ſhall make it my firſt buſineſs, as long as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a rational exiſtence, to practiſe the one, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit cheerfully to the other. But, dear and reſpected father, the barely naming of <hi>M. Le Monte</hi> to me, under my circumſtances, cannot fail of giving me ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, worſe than the moſt ſtudied torture of the <hi>Wheel</hi> and <hi>Rack</hi>: But was I at my own diſpoſal, you, Sir, could command nothing which I could heſitate at obeying! but I am not my own.—At your ſpecial leave and requeſt, I have, in a moſt ſolemn manner, given up myſelf to CONSTANTIUS, and am no more my own—he took full poſſeſſion of my heart when I gave him my promiſe, and I have neither power nor inclination to take it back. You, Sir, was preſent, and ratified our contract by your moſt explicit appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thereof; and therefore ceaſe to poſſeſs the right or power of diſpoſing of me again: Pray, dear Sir, give theſe conſiderations that weight which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: remember that I am under the moſt ſolemn obligations to my dear CONSTANTIUS, that heaven has recognized it, and that a violation thereof would involve me in the horrid ſin of perjury, which would eventually deprive me of every ſpecies of peace here, and procure endleſs miſery to me hereafter. Conſider alſo, I pray Sir, that <hi>Le Monte</hi> is as odious to me as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028832_0011_0FDD5CCB5CF25AC8"/>
CONSTANTIUS is agreeable—that his temper and diſpoſition is naturally fierce and cruel to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree—that it is one of the articles of his religion, that "no faith is to be kept with hereticks," and ſuch, you are ſenſible, he eſteems me—that he deſpiſeth that holy religion, whoſe principles, in my early infancy, you have taught me to have the higheſt regard for, as being inſeparably connected with my future welfare. I hope you will reflect ſuitably on theſe things, and not let the idea of the pomp and ſhow of tinſeled greatneſs, and the place near a Monarch's court, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to deſtroy the preſent peace and future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of your only child."</p>
            <p>Her father liſtened to what ſhe ſaid until ſhe had gone through; when, with a ſtern aſpect, he replied, "Poor ſilly creature, your folly would be your utter ruin, had you not a father living to bridle your giddy paſſions: but to reaſon with a perſon void of ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality is no part of my buſineſs. Remember you are under my government, and that my will is your law— that nothing will be able to divert me from my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of having Le Monte for a ſon in law, and you may as well ſubmit to my pleaſure quietly, as to be dragged to it by force, which will be the caſe if you prove refractory. As to your CONSTANTIUS, he is a man whoſe fortune does not exceed that to which you are born; but Le Monte has an inexhauſtible fund, both of riches and honour." Thus ſaying, be left her to her own doleful reflections. Sleepleſs and weariſome moments were her companions until the next morning, when a ſervant of the family entered the room, informing her it was her father's pleaſure that ſhe ſhould prepare herſelf to breakfaſt with <hi>Le Monte</hi> and himſelf; at which he left the room throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into her lap a newſpaper of that day. She took
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028832_0012_0FDD5CCF54BE8048"/>
up the paper, and the firſt thing ſhe eſpied therein, was the fatal intelligence that CONSTANTIUS, after he had been taken priſoner by the Britiſh, proved ſo franticly refractory, that in a fit of rage one of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers had ſheathed his ſword in his heart, and he was dead!—At the reading of which, poor PULCHERA ſwooned away, and fell on the floor; the noiſe of which brought the ſervant again into the apartment, for, by his maſter's order, he had waited at the door to obſerve her. He, ſeeing her in that condition, called up the family, and a long time it was before they could reſtore her to her ſenſes; and when at laſt it was effected, with eyes ſtarting with horror, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "He is gone! He is gone! CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS is no more! Had it not been for my cruel fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would ſtill have been alive and with me; but untimely death hath cloſed his eyes; and you, Oh! my father, muſt be anſwerable for that and all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences! But you ſhall be diſappointed; never will I be <hi>Le Monte's</hi>; if I am deprived of him in life, I will ſtill be his in death; he has my heart, and I will never give it to another. I will deſcend to the grave! I will retire from the theatre of this world, which has no longer any thing in it to allure me, and will ſeek that peace, in the unexplored regions of futurity, of which I am deprived here by a relentleſs father."</p>
            <p>To no purpoſe did her father attempt to reaſon with her, telling her, that as CONSTANTIUS was dead, ſhe was abſolved from all her obligations—that ſhe, in conſequence thereof, was again under parental diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal—that now ſhe had no excuſe of duty to CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIUS—that <hi>that</hi> religion which ſhe the day before ſpoke ſo highly of, made it her duty now to ſubmit to the dictates of her father, and that if ſhe refuſed, ſhe muſt loſe his bleſſing and her own peace
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028832_0013_0FDD5CD09E608CE0"/>
conſcience here, and be ſure of the indignation of her Maker and Judge hereafter; and that for her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obſtinate would be of no ſervice to her, as ſhe was totally in his power, and that he was fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſhe ſhould, that very night approaching, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark with <hi>Le Monte.</hi> She obſerved to him, that to urge the death of CONSTANTIUS as an argument for her again coming under his diſpoſal, when at the ſame time he was in reality the guilty cauſe of it, did not carry any great matter of force with it, and that it was enough for him to deprive her of CONSTANTIUS, without adding a curſe of little leſs magnitude to her misfortune; for the joining her to <hi>Le Monte</hi> would add as much to her wretchedneſs as the depriving her of CONSTANTIUS.</p>
            <p>Her father, finding that expoſtulation had no kind of effect upon her, withdrew, to prepare for her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation; and the evening following forced her into a coach, which conveyed her in the courſe of the night to the wharf where lay the ſhip in which <hi>Le Monte</hi> was to return to France, waiting for her arrival. She was hurried on board—and the wind being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, they hoiſted ſail, and in a few hours loſt fight of the American ſnore. Grief, amazement and horror occupied the breaſt of PULCHERA, though <hi>Le Monte</hi> uſed every effort to recommend himſelf to her; but all to no purpoſe. She replied to him, that it was in vain for him to attempt what was totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible—that her averſion to him was ſo great, that time and circumſtances would never be able to efface it—that though he had the power over her body, yet her mind was, and ſhould continue, free—that ſhe never would give him her hand or heart, and that he might reſt aſſured he would never have the ſatisfaction of being her huſband—that even the crown of France
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028832_0014_0FDD5CD4D69AED20"/>
was too trifling a toy to have any effect on her mind. In diſcourſes like this they paſſed a tedious paſſage of thirty one days, when one morning the light preſented to their view three Britiſh ſhips at not more than half a league's diſtance, at the leeward of them: a flight was impoſſible, and in a few minutes the neareſt of the Britiſh ſhips fired a ſhot acroſs their bow. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the French ſhip called his officers together, and held a momentary council of war, the reſult of which was to ſtrike their colours, and yield themſelves priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of war; which was done immediately.</p>
            <p>The Captain and ſome of his principal officers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Le Monte</hi> and PULCHERA, were carried on board the Commandant's ſhip; but what was the ſurprize of PULCHERA, when on board of the captor ſhe beheld her loſt CONSTANTIUS! Nor were the ſenſations of CONSTANTIUS leſs nervous at behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his adorable PULCHERA —they both ſtood ſilent, ſwallowed up in extacy, while their expreſſive counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances declared the emotions of their hearts more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly than the moſt finiſhed compoſition of words is capable of doing.</p>
            <p>The Captain of the Britiſh ſhip, on obſerving what paſſed, took PULCHERA into his cabin, ſaying, "Fair lady, by the ſilent meſſages which have paſſed between you and CONSTANTIUS, a priſoner in my ſhip, I fancy you have had ſome former acquaintance with him, and that by ſome means he has been forced from you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your meeting appears to be unexpected to both; be ſo good as to inform me of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as far as may be proper: you are both in my power; I will ſee you have ample juſtice done you." PULCHERA then went on to inform him that ſhe was the only daughter of a rich farmer in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Philadelphia—that her father had paid every
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028832_0015_0FDD5CD5DFAA5E78"/>
attention to her education—that at the age of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen her father informed her that for three years paſt he had made it the whole of his ſtudy to deviſe means of recommending her to the only ſon of a wealthy merchant in the ſame neighbourhood, whoſe name he ſaid was CONSTANTIUS; and that CONSTANTIUS and his father had both agreed to the match, and that he hoped there would be no objections on her part— that with bluſhes ſhe told her father ſhe had no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to offer to ſuch a propoſal—that ſhe had long had a ſtrong prepoſſeſſion in favour of CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS; in fine, ſhe proceeded to give him a brief hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the tranſactions which we have before related, until the then preſent moment.</p>
            <p>The Captain, at the end of the narration, called CONSTANTIUS into the cabin, ſaying to him, "You have hitherto been a priſoner in my ſhip—you from this moment ceaſe to be one—you are henceforth at liberty, and have the freedom of the ſhip; I congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late you on your fortunate meeting with your admired PULCHERA—an elegant ſtateroom ſhall be allotted for your uſe—you and PULCHERA ſhall henceforth participate at my table, and when we arrive at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, I will take ſuitable care of you: you ſhall have a ſafe conveyance to Holland, from whence at your leiſure you may return to your native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try." CONSTANTIUS politely returned him his warmeſt thanks for his offered goodneſs, and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but harmony ſubſiſted in the cabin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Monte,</hi> who continued a priſoner on board the ſame ſhip, in a few days was informed of all that had taken place with regard to CONSTANTIUS and PULCHERA, and was ſtung with reſentment at the information, and ſwore revenge. The next day he ſent CONSTANTIUS a challenge to a duel, which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028832_0016_0FDD5CD9ED886328"/>
he accepted; and that night met for the purpoſe; in the iſſue of which <hi>Le Monte</hi> fell, and had to aſk his life of CONSTANTIUS, who magnanimouſly gave it to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Monte</hi> was ſo ſenſible of his obligation to CONSTANTIUS, that he roſe and expreſſed his warmeſt acknowledgments to him on the occaſion; adding, that after experiencing ſuch a favour from him, he had too much gratitude to do any thing which could in any degree prove diſagreeable to him:—"I therefore," ſaid he, "do relinquiſh every idea of any claim to the admirable PULCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA—I reſign her to you, ſir—your conduct has rendered you worthy of her who has not an equal on earth. May you long live mutual bleſſings to each other, and may a beneficent Providence grant that you may forever be ſharers of the beſt of bleſſings which heaven has reſerved in ſtore for its deareſt favourites; and may I hope, notwithſtanding all which has paſſed, that <hi>Le Monte</hi> will be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the number of your friends."</p>
            <p>Nothing could exceed the courteſy with which CONSTANTIUS and PULCHERA treated <hi>Le Monte</hi> on this occaſion; and the remainder of the voyage was ſpent in the moſt agreeable manner, until one night, after a moſt beautifully ſerene day, they ſaw a prodigiouſly black cloud make its appearance in the weſtern hemiſphere, which was ſo hurried on by a terrific gale, that in twenty minutes time it total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſcured the whole face of the heavens, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved them in one ſolid maſs of ſubſtantial dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while the wind continued to rage with the wild madneſs of the moſt violent hurricane, ſo that the greateſt ſkill and exertions of the officers and mariners became neceſſary to prevent their being
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028832_0017_0FDD5CDB206AC848"/>
totally ingulphed in the bottom of the great deep. What added to their frightful ſituation was, that after it had continued without any mitigation for the ſpace of about two hours, their ears were ſalut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſound of diſtant thunder, which every moment, with aſtoniſhing rapidity, approached nearer and nearer to their aſtoniſhed obſervation, until their ſhip, by the flaſhes of lightning, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be wrapped in ſheets of fire, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſuch dreadful peals of thunder as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated that the final diſſolution of univerſal nature was faſt approaching, while torrents of rain, as though the flood gates of heaven were unſtopped, fell upon them with ſuch impetuoſity as was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (one would have thought) to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them in inevitable deſtruction.</p>
            <p>While in this pitiable ſituation, being the ſport of the enraged elements, at one moment toſſed up to the clouds, at the next immerged into the bottom of the convulſed deep, expecting every moment to be the laſt; when nothing but fruitleſs cries and lamentations were to be heard between thoſe amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peals of thunder which kept almoſt conſtantly burſting over their devoted heads; in the tenth hour of this deſperate condition, they felt the ſhock of the veſſel's ſtriking on a bar. This was but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of their deſpair. The Captain, however, ordered the longboat to be thrown out, that any who choſe it might take their chance in it, as it was more than probable that the next ſea would beat the ſhip to pieces, and bury thoſe in the ſand who remained on board; neither was the proſpect of venturing in the boat any more favourable, as it was bordering hard on impoſſible for a boat to ſtand it for two minutes. It was at this time that CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIUS
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028832_0019_0FDEB3095E583FE0"/>
and PULCHERA, who till then had kept hold of each other's hands, by ſome means ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and in a few minutes PULCHERA diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through the medium of the lightning, that ſhe was the only perſon remaining on board. This circumſtance, diſtreſſing as it was, could add but little to her wretchedneſs, which before was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete; ſhe ſtood ſtill, and reſigned herſelf to fate. It was not long before ſhe perceived that the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeas had made a fatal inroad on the ſhip, which threatened every moment to come to pieces— which in about five or ſix hours took place.</p>
            <p>PULCHERA, who was almoſt in a ſuſpenſion of thought, found herſelf floating on one of the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, on which ſhe was ſoon waſhed upon the beach. The diſconſolate PULCHERA, with the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of ſtrength ſhe yet poſſeſſed, was juſt able to avoid the fury of the ſucceeding wave, which, if ſhe had not eſcaped, could not have failed of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fatal to her. When ſhe found herſelf beyond the reach of the boiſterous ſurges, ſhe reclined her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the declivity of a bank, where ſhe ſat to bemoan her diſaſterous fate: wearineſs overcame her, and ſhe fell into a ſleep. When ſhe awoke, ſhe found that the ſtorm had ſubſided, the boiſterous wind had ſunk into a perfect calm, the ſky was clear, the air was ſerene, the face of nature appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſmiling, the birds on the boughs filled the air with their melody, the ſun ſhone with peculiar luſtre, and every appearance ſeemed calculated to inſpire the boſom with pleaſing ſenſations; but all theſe circumſtances had no delights for PULCHERA —a fixed gloom occupied her countenance, and the moſt melancholy ſenſations rent her diſtreſſed breaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe wandered, making an uſeleſs moan to the heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028832_0018_0FDEB41AE0CE5C78"/>
flowers which decorated the wanton ſoil over which ſhe rambled. Hours after hours in ſucceſſion paſſed away, while ſhe traverſed the ſhore, where lay in forlorn ruins the ſhattered remains of the ſhip; but no ſigns of any of the people, dead or alive, were to be found.</p>
            <p>In unſucceſsful reſearches ſhe ſpent the day, in the courſe of which ſhe found ſhe was on a ſmall iſland, which, though under cultivation, was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of inhabitants. The night ſucceeded the day which ſhe paſſed in a manner not leſs joyleſs than the day before had been; but on the return of day, juſt after bright Phoebus had riſen from his orient bed, ſhe diſcovered a veſſel coming down from the northward. As good fortune would have it, ſhe came within call of the ſhore; ſhe therefore, with a voice as loud as her enfeebled ſituation would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, hailed them; and being aſked what ſhe deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe anſwered, that ſhe was the only ſurvivor from a ſhip lately caſt away there in a ſtorm, and wiſhed to come on board. The Captain ordered his boat to bring her on board his veſſel, which was done accordingly. This veſſel proved to be an American privateer, fitted out from a port in France, the Captain being M—, of New York, with whom PULCHERA had formerly had a ſlight acquaintance, and knowing him to be a gentleman of ſtrict honour, ſhe informed him of the whole of her adventure. Capt. M—was very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with her ſtory, but with no part of it more than with the hapleſs fate of his friend CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS, with whom he had been bread at ſchool, and for whom he entertained the greateſt regard; and nothing in Capt. M—'s power was left uneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to render PULCHERA happy; and ſhe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028832_0020_0FDEB31B71336DB0"/>
every mark of diſtinction, as well from all the officers as the Captain and ſeamen, which their ſituation would admit of.</p>
            <p>Capt. M— informed her that after a few days cruiſe in thoſe parts, they were bound to America, and on their arrival there it ſhould be ſome of his firſt buſineſs to ſee her conducted ſafely to her friends; and in a few days they ſat out to put this purpoſe into effect. Nothing material happened the firſt ten days—but on the eleventh day, they found they were chaſed by a veſſel of ſuperior force, and that ſhe gained conſiderably upon them—and it was ſoon made certain that ſhe was a veſſel of more than twice their force, conſequently a capture (extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries excepted) was unavoidable. Capt. M— adviſed PULCHERA, in order to eſcape any ill uſage from their captors, to diveſt herſelf of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's apparel, and attire herſelf in a ſuit of his, which ſhe accordingly did, putting on a neat ſuit of red regimentals, a gold laced hat, and a ſword by her ſide, and took upon her the character of a Lieutenant under the name of VALORUS. By this time their purſuer was within reach of them, which was announced by the diſcharge of one of her bow guns. Capt. M—, on a more particular inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his enemy, began to conceive ſome hope of being able to make good his defence againſt them: he accordingly made ready for an engagement, which ſoon commenced with great fury on both ſides. In a few moment the combatants were at not more than ſixty feet diſtance, while an inceſſant diſcharge of cannon, many of which were loaded with langrage and grape ſhot, was ſufficient to have effectually tried the fortitude of the oldeſt veterans; and for a very conſiderable time fortune
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028832_0021_0FDEB31D5118D4C0"/>
ſeemed undetermined in whoſe favour to decide, until a well directed fire from the Britiſh, cauſed Capt. M— to ſtrike his colours, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the action. The captor put a prize maſter on board of the prize, taking the officers (among whom was VALORUS, under the character of a lieutenant) into his own veſſel.</p>
            <p>The captor proved to be a ſloop of war from Portſmouth, bound to Quebeck. Capt. M— and his officers received as good treatment on board the ſloop as could reaſonably be expected from the hands of a captor; in particular the delicate appearance of VALORUS inſured to her an uncommon degree of reſpect from the under officers and men—ſhe kept her countenance as ſmooth as the unruffled ſea, tho' at the ſame time her recollection of CONSTANTIUS totally deſtroyed every agreeable idea which was about to riſe in her mind, though none but her pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was a witneſs to her immoderate grief on the occaſion.</p>
            <p>They purſued their voyage for Quebeck, where the priſoners had the promiſe of being liberated, they giving their parole not to enter into actual ſervice againſt the Britiſh, until regularly exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But how fickle is fortune! When they ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by their reckoning, they were near in with the land, a terrible ſtorm aſſailed them, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without intermiſſion day after day, the wind rather increaſing than diminiſhing, till on the night of the third day after the commencement of the ſtorm; when, about one o'clock, they were alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the breaking of the ſea but a very ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before them; a ſure indication that a bar, ſhoal, rocks, or land, was there, and ſo nigh was it, that all attempts to avoid it were made uſe of in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028832_0022_0FDEB33B8DA14DB8"/>
vain; they had ſcarcely time to realize their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before their veſſel was a ground—their fate was apparently fixed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their ſmall remains of hope ſeemed to be totally annihilated. But this ſuſpenſe laſted not long; the wind was ſo violent and the ſeas ſo enormous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the fourth ſea after ſhe firſt ſtruck, reduced her to a heap of ruins, and the hands, by the violence of the waves, were waſhed on the ſhore, which was but a few feet diſtant from the bow of the veſſel, and they had the ſurpriſing good fortune to eſcape a watery tomb, ſaving three only, who were drowned. They endeavoured to ſeek a ſhelter from the ſtorm by advancing up on the land; but all attempts of this nature were in vain; for, twenty feet from the water was the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt they could extend, by reaſon of a bank which aſcended nearly perpendicular, and the ſtate of the night was ſo dark that they could form no idea of its height; and as they traverſed to the right hand and the left, they found it was not to be avoided either way, as at a ſhort diſtance it butted down into the water, and they found they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves in that ſituation until morning; but they were overwhelmed by one very melancholy conſideration, viz. that they were ignorant of what time of tide it was; if it ſhould happen to be any thing near low water, they could not poſſibly avoid being ſwallowed up long before it was high water: however, it ſo happened that at the time of their being caſt aſhore, it was high water, and by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſtant obſervation they ſoon found that the tide was on the ebb, which ſoon eaſed them from their diſmal apprehenſions on that account. The night, however, paſſed away in a very joyleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. When the daylight appeared, the ſtorm ſtill
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028832_0023_0FDEB33FFA52ADE8"/>
continuing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very pleaſing proſpect preſented itſelf to their view.</p>
            <p>The beach on which they were, was about thirty rods in length, bounded by an inſurmountable ledge of rocks, to the height of one hundred and fifty feet, which butted at each extremity into the ſea, the ends of which they in vain attempted to double; their boats they found cruſhed in ruins with the remains of their ſhip.—Providentially, among the rubbiſh they found conſiderable quantities of proviſions: but, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, no kind of tools larger than a jack-knife could they obtain, though the moſt diligent ſearches were made therefore—They buſied themſelves in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their proviſion, by carrying it above the reach of the tide. They then ſecured a few barrels of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition which they found undamaged, and ſome fire arms. Fruitleſs attempts were then made to aſcend the precipice, until experience had taught them that nothing was to be expected from their moſt vigorous exertions.</p>
            <p>Having ſecured the whole of the proviſions they could find among the ruinous remains of their ſhip, they began to collect materials for building a raft, and immediately began to erect one, though this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs went on very ſlowly for the want of tools proper to execute it with—however, they did as well as they could, and in the courſe of two or three days, by their exertions, they had fabricated one ſufficient to float the whole of the unhappy ſufferers, on board of which the next morning they embarked with a part of their proviſions, their fire arms, and a quantity of ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; with this they puſhed off from the ſhore, the weather being very cold, and the heavens indicated the approach of a ſtorm.</p>
            <p>It was a queſtion at firſt which way they ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028832_0024_0FDEB3423B5E1AD8"/>
their courſe—at laſt it was agreed to cruiſe along ſhore, to the eaſtward. They proſecuted this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at about three, and ſometimes four rods diſtance from the ſhore, for five or ſix miles, while nothing appeared to them to favour their wiſhes—nothing but a perpendicular ledge of ragged rocks was to be ſeen; and by this time the ſnow began gently to deſcend.</p>
            <p>They kept a conſtant look out for a place where it was poſſible for them to run their raft aſhore, where they might encamp on dry land; but this they long ſought for in vain, till towards evening, when the ſnow had fallen to the depth of twelve or thirteen inches, they diſcovered a ſmall declivity in the bank, where they run their raft on ſhore. And through this declivity they aſcended the bank, which was about one hundred feet in length.</p>
            <p>When they had attained the ſummit, they had an extenſive uncultivated plain in purſuit, and not the leaſt ſign that any thing human was ever there before them.</p>
            <p>With ſome difficulty in collecting materials, they built them a comfortable fire, and frying a quantity of bread and meat, they ſoon ate a very hearty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; by this time it being dark, they made prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for taking ſome repoſe.</p>
            <p>In the morning they awoke and beheld a ſerene air, and a pleaſant ſky—they conſulted what courſe they ſhould then take, when it was agreed that they ſhould divide into a number of ſmall companies, each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to take a different route, taking a quantity of proviſions each, and if either party found any inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, to return to that place and wait for the return of the reſt.</p>
            <p>VALORUS, with two others, compoſed one of thoſe ſmall companies, each taking a gun, a quantity of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028832_0025_0FDEB345CE9D0B08"/>
ammunition and proviſions; they each took their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ſnow being about ſix inches deep. They employed themſelves, the firſt day, in exploring the inhoſpitable wilderneſs, without meeting with any thing worthy of remark.</p>
            <p>On the latter part of the ſecond day, they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken by a furious ſtorm of ſnow. They travelled till almoſt night, and ſeeing no kind of probability of finding any inhabitants, they concluded to ſtop under the leeward ſide of a large rock, and make as good preparations for the enſuing night as they could, which was only to tread down the ſnow, and collect ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el as they could, to ſupport a fire. The ſtorm contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to rage with uncommon fury during the whole of the night, and the ſucceeding day, during which time, it was with the greateſt difficulty they kept themſelves from freezing, their fuel being exhauſted, and it was with the greateſt difficulty that they procured a ſmall quantity more. They found, at the abatement of the ſnow, that it had fallen to the immoderate depth of four or five feet, and by reaſon of its not being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuſtaining half the weight of a man, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely impoſſible for them to proceed either backward or forward.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation, all they could do, was to make themſelves as comfortable as their dreary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would permit. The weather was ſo intenſely cold, that a large fire was indiſpenſably neceſſary; and though they were ſurrounded with timber, they lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the means of procuring it; however, they collected the ſmall remains of wood which they had, and after incredible pains, they beat a track to an old dry oak tree, at about a rod's diſtance from them, and kindled a fire in a fracture at the bottom thereof, by which means in leſs than two hours they burned it down,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028832_0026_0FDEB3476A20E980"/>
which providentially falling acroſs the rock, broke, and ſplit the main trunk to pieces; this was a very valuable acquiſition, making as much as two cords and a half of wood. This laſted them for better than three days, when their ſituation ſeemed to arrive at the height of wretchedneſs; the rigour of the weather not having in any degree abated, and the ſmall ſtore of proviſions they had brought with them being ſpent, there ſeemed nothing but inevitable death before their eyes; for although a ſecond attempt ſimilar to the firſt had furniſhed them with a conſiderable ſtock of wood, yet, with nothing elſe to ſuſtain nature, death could not appear at a very great diſtance from them, eſpecially, as their natural ſtrength, by exceſſive exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the inclemency of the weather, the ſevere hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and want of food, was greatly debilitated.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation they lived, or rather exiſted, for ſix days, having no kind of ſuſtenance, excepting the bark of trees, which, as it was frozen, they could get off only in ſmall pieces with their knives, and then, thawing it by the fire, chewed and ſwallowed it.</p>
            <p>At the commencement of the ſeventh day, when their ſufferings had reduced them to a ſurpriſing ſtate of weakneſs, and it was become certain that they could exiſt but a very little time longer, they began to wreck their invention to determine what they ſhould do next. In vain did they then lament that they had not, as ſoon as the ſtorm had abated, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have forced through the ſnow a way back to their rendezvous, though the proſpect was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing, it being, by the beſt of judgment, nearly fifty miles; but it was now too late to think of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt like that; and after mutually condoling each other on their deſperate ſituation, one of the party thus addreſſed his partners: <hi>Dear Fellow Sufferers,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028832_0027_0FDEB34F8B964F00"/>
In our ſad ſituation, a few hours more will cloſe our eyes, to be opened no more; we now ceaſe to be any advantage to each other; and though life is hard to part with, yet it is of little conſequence whether we die to day or to-morrow; and if <hi>one</hi> dying to day will eventually ſave the life of the <hi>two ſurvivors,</hi> one had better die alone for the other two to live, than for all three to die together. For my part, as one, I move that we caſt lots which of us ſhall die, to ſave the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er two ſuffering partners. The other two conſented to this propoſal; the lots were immediately prepared, and it was the fate of VALORUS to be the victim.</p>
            <p>VALORUS told them, if they would indulge him ſo far as to give him time to write a few lines to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he requeſted them to take the care of, and if ever an opportunity preſented, that they would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them to him, that he would then ſubmit to his fate—They granted his requeſt, and he wrote as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:028832_0029_0FDEB355DE738840"/>VALORUS had juſt finiſhed the letter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it, when one of his woful partners took up the fatal gun, well loaded, and had got it to his face, and was juſt pulling the trigger in order to lodge its contents in his head, when he chanced to raiſe his eye a little, and diſcovered a bear wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſnow, at about twenty yards diſtance— He exclaimed, "VALORUS! Thank God, you may yet live!" and diſcharged his piece at the bear, lodging two balls in his head, of which he died inſtantly.—If ever joy was to exceſs, it was then ſo amongſt this little unfortunate company—VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORUS, whom they both loved equal to themſelves, was ſtill alive—without going to their prey, they both fell upon him, embracing him as one from the dead, and the moſt tender, expreſſive congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paſſed on the occaſion—they all ſeemed loſt in extacy for ſome ſpace of time.</p>
            <p>After their effuſions of joy were in ſome meaſure abated, their ſmall remains of ſtrength were exerted in beating a road to their new acquired proviſion, which after having with difficulty accompliſhed, they made a ſmall repaſt upon. By this time it was night, and the heavens had gathered an unuſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of blackneſs, and very ſoon a torrent of rain began to deſcend.—They ſo fixed their bearſkin (which was a very large one) as to be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhelter to them from the rain, and kept them tolerably dry through the ſleepleſs night.— The light of day at laſt approached, after the moſt rainy night they had ever known, when ſoon the clouds broke away, the wind ſprung up at the northweſt, and a very ſevere cold day enſued. So much water was in the ſnow, and the cold ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, that by the middle of the day it was frozen
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028832_0030_0FDEB3585C81C290"/>
ſufficiently to bear them; which perceiving, they formed an idea of trying to regain their place of general rendezvous; but their enfeebled ſtate was ſuch, that they ſcarcely were determined whether to attempt it or not; but after mature deliberation, it was concluded to ſet out in the morning, which accordingly they put in practice, taking with them a quantity of meat, which they judged ſufficient for their uſe, till ſuch time as they ſhould arrive at their place of rendezvous.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to recount the weariſome ſteps which they experienced on their journey; ſuffice it to ſay, that on the fifth day, juſt before night, they arrived at the place exceedingly fatigued, which they found in the ſame ſituation they had left it, and no ſigns were to be diſcovered that intimated any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's having been there ſince their departure; but it was ſo near the windward ſide of the land, that the wind, in the time of the falling of the ſnow, had driven the ſnow quite off from that place.</p>
            <p>Fatigued as they were, they built a fire, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſome ſupper:—Here they found bread, pork, beef, tea, ſugar, and ſome cooking utenſils, which they had left there; and they prepared and ate a more comfortable meal than they had ſince their being caſt away. The next day they had recourſe to their raft, which they found incloſed with ice;— they then repaired on the ice to the place of their ſhipwreck, which they likewiſe found the ſnow drifted off from. Tired of any further reſearches, they conſulted which was the beſt place to fix their abode at; and when they had conſidered, that at this place was the greater part of the proviſions they had to depend on—that here, from the ruins of their ſhip, they could obtain materials for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028832_0031_0FDEB35DDF900C30"/>
them a ſhelter—and that likewiſe, here they could procure fuel from the ſame reſource—they unanimouſly agreed to make that the place of their reſidence, hoping they had proviſions enough to carry them through the winter, and that in the ſpring, Providence would find ſome way for their deliverance.</p>
            <p>Under the impreſſion of theſe ideas they went to work, and fabricated themſelves a hut, tolerably warm; and to add to their good fortune, amongſt the ruins of the ſhip they found a caſk of Jamaica Rum, and another of Brandy, and about eight thouſand nine hundred pounds in caſh, though <hi>that</hi> they looked on as a very ſmall acquiſition, but they ſecured it. In this ſituation they conſidered themſelves tolerably happy; but a misfortune now attacked them which they were in no meaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for. VALORUS and one of his companions were taken ſick of a pleuriſy; this deadly diſorder ſeized them ſo violently, that in three days both of their lives were deſpaired of by themſelves and their companion, who left nothing unattempted, which he had reaſon to hope would contribute to their recovery. There was nothing but what the unfortunate two underwent, both from the extreme raging of their diſtemper, and alſo from the forlorn ſituation which they were unfortunately in; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, contrary to their own and their companion's expectations, on the eighth day the fever broke, and by ſlow degrees they regained their wonted ſtrength, ſo that in about five weeks they were able to walk about, and were in a good meaſure able to do ſuch kind of buſineſs as their circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be done. They now paſſed their time as agreeably as could be expected for people in ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028832_0032_0FDEB362C6BDD480"/>
lonely circumſtances, ſaving only the diſconſolate VALORUS, who as her thoughts began to be leſs taken up on her own perſonal ſafety, the idea of her beloved CONSTANTIUS would keep continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſing in her diſtracted mind. The horrors of that dreadful night wherein they parted by ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, to meet no more, would keep continually harrowing up her mind, and depriving her of every ſpecies of comfort—her mind was diſtracted with terrific dreams, and her days ſpent in melancholy reflections. At times ſhe was half reſolved to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom herſelf to her comrades; but reaſons of policy forbid the meaſure.—They ſtill ſuppoſed VALORUS to be what he appeared to be—a man.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation they ſpent their time, until the return of ſpring, at which time their proviſion was nearly exhauſted; when one morning, to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible ſatisfaction, they eſpied a ſmall veſſel, not more than a league and an half from ſhore. They made uſe of every means in their power to give them notice of their ſituation, by firing guns of diſtreſs, which at laſt had the deſired effect, and the veſſel ſtood in for the ſhore, until they got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in call, when they hailed them, and aſked them what they wiſhed. They gave them a ſhort account of their diſaſter, and that in all probability they were the only ſurvivors of a large crew. The veſſel ſent their boat a ſhore and took them on board She proved to be a privateer from a port of Eſſex county, in Maſſachuſetts ſtate.—VALORUS did not think proper to make known his ſex, though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them he was an American, and that he was a priſoner when he had the misfortune to be ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked. The captain of the privateer told VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORUS, if he would enter on board voluntarily, he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028832_0033_0FDEB3644A2411C0"/>
ſhould be entitled out of the dead ſhares to a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's proportion of the prize money; the hands on board having agreed thereto, he accepted the appointment—as for the other two, it was agreed that they ſhould be ſet at liberty the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that preſented.</p>
            <p>They cruiſed on this coaſt about a week, when they fell in with and took a brigantine, from Briſtol bound to Quebec, with a very valuable cargo on board. The captain of the privateer put VALORUS on board prize maſter, with a ſufficiency of hands, and ordered her into Salem; but unfortunately the next day ſhe was captured by a forcible Britiſh cruiſer, and was carried into Halifax. VALORUS had, through unacquaintedneſs with this kind of buſineſs, left the papers which he had of the captain of the privateer; and when the captor demanded his papers, he had nothing to ſhew. In vain did VALORUS inform him of the whole tranſaction. The captain of the cruiſer ſaid any one might make as good a ſtory as that—he accordingly put VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORUS in irons, and when they arrived at Halifax (perceiving that the irons hurt his wriſts, they were taken off) he was put into the dungeon, and there kept in order for a trial for piracy.</p>
            <l>"Unhappy nymph, who thus art forc'd to roam,</l>
            <l>"Without a kind protector, friend or home."</l>
            <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with Halifax, know that the provoſt, under which the dungeon is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, ſtands on a riſing piece of ground, and that from a vault in the bottom of the dungeon there is a drain of about two feet ſquare, which leads from the ſaid vault out to the ſide of the hill on which the provoſt ſtands. After VALORUS had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028832_0034_0FDEB366F58C9670"/>
in this place about ten days (the eleventh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed for their trial) he got acquainted with this circumſtance of the drain; he therefore, in company with ſome others, determined to make their eſcape through that avenue: they therefore, one by one, let themſelves down into the vault, and crept out through the drain on their hands and knees, it being about half filled up with filth; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they lived through the operation, though it was nauſeous to the laſt degree; and they all got ſafely through, though they were all in a filthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; in order to diveſt themſelves of this, they had immediate recourſe to the water, where they found a ſmall ſhallop, on board of which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and under cover of the night got clear of the harbour: But their evil genius had not yet left them; for on the ſecond day after their eſcape they were taken up by a ſmall veſſel of force, bound from Penobſcot to London; ſo their pleaſing hopes of ſeeing home were once more brought to nothing.</p>
            <p>The captain of this little cutter, proved to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good natured ſort of a man, and VALORUS made it his buſineſs to enter as far into his good graces as poſſible, and he had every ſucceſs he could wiſh for, and on their arrival at London, he ſat VALORUS and the reſt of the priſoners at liberty.</p>
            <p>VALORUS now found the advantage of the money, which he had ſaved out of the wreck, he having about two hundred guineas in his pockets which his captors had not taken from him: he procured himſelf a couple of ſuits of genteel clothes, and in a few days had an opportunity to embark for Liſbon, and from thence in a few days more for France. When he arrived at France, his firſt inquiry was, if any Americans were in that place, or not. As it happened there was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028832_0035_0FDEB3EFF5C142D0"/>
a French officer, who underſtood the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage tolerably well, who informed him that at the next door but one, there lodged an American gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who he believed was of a very conſiderable rank in life.</p>
            <p>VALORUS ſtepped to the door, and aſked if he could have lodgings there, till an opportunity preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him to ſhip for America? He was anſwered in the affirmative, and entered the houſe; he was conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a parlour, where ſat a gentleman reading a manuſcript: the gentleman roſe to receive him, but how great was the aſtoniſhment of VALORUS, when in the face of the gentleman, he recognized every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the long (thought) loſt CONSTANTIUS. At firſt thought, VALORUS had like to have diſcovered his ſex and perſon, by the moſt pathetic acclamations; but a ſecond thought forbid any thing like that: "<hi>Time and abſence cure the fondeſt love</hi>:" ſo taking each other by the hand, they paſſed mutual and civil compliments, and each ſeated himſelf. CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS ordered a bottle of wine and ſome glaſſes to be brought to them, and after drinking to each other, CONSTANTIUS inquired what part of America VALORUS was from? He informed him, he belonged to a privateer from Salem, that he was captured and carried into Halifax, from whence he made his eſcape, was again taken and carried into England, where he was liberated, and came to this place in order to ſeek a paſſage home. Juſt as this diſcourſe happened, a French gentleman entered the parlour, whom VALO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUS, at firſt ſight, knew to be <hi>Le Monte,</hi> the firſt cauſe of all her trouble; mutual compliments paſſed between CONSTANTIUS and <hi>Le Monte,</hi> and a miſcellaneous diſcourſe paſſed away the time, until ſupper was ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; VALORUS then propoſed taking his lodging, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028832_0036_0FDEB3F1A4D54E58"/>
was conducted to his bed; CONSTANTIUS and <hi>Le Monte</hi> afterwards repaired to their lodging, which was ſeparated from that of VALORUS only by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Sleep had in a great meaſure departed from VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORUS. He attended to the diſcourſe of CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS and <hi>Le Monte,</hi> after they had taken their beds. He found that the moſt intimate friendſhip ſubſiſted between them, and that a purpoſe of marriage was on foot between CONSTANTIUS and the only ſiſter of <hi>Le Monte,</hi> and that ſhe would be in town on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from Paris, and that in a ſhort time the nuptials were to be celebrated. Confuſion now took full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the diſtreſſed heart of the feigned VALORUS. She viewed her CONSTANTIUS as totally loſt to her forever; now did ſhe curſe her unfortunate ſtars, and lamented the time ſhe eſcaped the gaping liquid grave, and all the horrors of the diſconſolate iſland on which ſhe had been ſhipwrecked; but moſt of all, the ill fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moment which again introduced her to the preſence of CONSTANTIUS.—Deſpair and anguiſh rent her heart through the tedious watches of the night, and her pillow was wet with the choiceſt tears that ever flowed within the realms of France.</p>
            <p>On the return of the morning, they all aroſe, and every preparation was making for the reception of the lady (<hi>Le Monte</hi>'s ſiſter.) Breakfaſt was at laſt bro't on the table; <hi>Le Monte,</hi> CONSTANTIUS and VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORUS ſat down. During breakfaſt time. VALORUS inquired of CONSTANTIUS what part of America he was from? He replied, from Philadelphia. Pray ſir, ſaid he, did you ever have any acquaintance with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by the name of—? Yes, replied he, with a very expreſſive countenance—Did you know a daughter of his by the name of PULCHERA? Yes,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028832_0037_0FDEB3F33422C570"/>
replied CONSTANTIUS, with a degree of melancholy viſibly blended in his once cheerful countenance. Why, continued CONSTANTIUS, was you ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her? Some years ago, replied VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORUS, I was very intimate in the family, and if I forget not, when I laſt knew the family, ſhe was the only ſurviving child which her father had. Can you inform me if ever ſhe married, and whether ſhe is yet alive or not? This queſtion brought tears into the eyes of CONSTANTIUS, who, with a voice which beſpoke the perturbation of his mind, replied—Poor PULCHERA, the ornament of her ſex, and the pride of human nature, is no more; ſome miſunderſtanding with her father, with regard to a propoſed marriage, cauſed her to leave her home and croſs the Atlantic, in which voyage the veſſel was wrecked, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy PULCHERA was the only perſon that was loſt! His tears prevented him from proceeding any further, and VALORUS's feelings were too ſenſible to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the inquiry.</p>
            <p>After breakfaſt, VALORUS aſked CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIUS to take a walk with him in the garden. CONSTANTIUS rather declined, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſhould be exceeding fond and proud of an interview, but it was abſolutely neceſſary for him to make all the preparation he could, to receive ſome company of rank which would attend on him in the afternoon, in conſequence of which, Sir, ſaid he, I dare ſay you will excuſe me. VALORUS replied, he had too much good nature to urge him to a meaſure that was diſagreeable to him, and retired to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and wrote a letter to CONSTANTIUS, then wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out to take a view of the town, giving the letter to a boy in the ſtreet, making a preſent to him of a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea to ſecure the delivery of it to the lady of the houſe where CONSTANTIUS boarded.</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:028832_0040_0FDEB3FD913AD3E0"/>CONSTANTIUS was thunderſtruck at reading theſe lines, viewing the writing, he would exclaim—"It muſt be ſo—I am too well acquainted with the hand, to be capable of being impoſed on. She is ſtill alive, and I am hers, and ſhe is mine. An indiſſoluble bond has united us together, which nothing but death is capable of diſſolving. O heavens! where is ſhe? I am on the <hi>rack</hi> till I behold her! Where is the poſt boy who delivered the letter?" &amp;c.</p>
            <p>CONSTANTIUS went on in ſuch like exclamations until <hi>Le Monte</hi> came in, to whom he read the letter. <hi>Le Monte</hi> was a little ſtruck at firſt hearing it, but on conſidering the ſubject, he told CONSTANTIUS it was impoſſible for it to be a reality, but it was a piece of impoſition, contrived by ſome ill minded perſon, in order to break off his propoſed marriage with his ſiſter; ſaying, you know, you poſitively know, my CONSTANTIUS, that it is beyond the reach of poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities for her to be alive. She did not leave the ſhip with us, and it is not in the power even of credulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs itſelf to form an idea of her eſcaping. CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIUS ſtood in amaze; at laſt he replied, "it muſt be, you are in the right; it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould be alive; ſhe has long ſince paid the debt of nature, and is no more."</p>
            <p>VALORUS continued to walk the ſtreets, wiſhing to know the effect which the letter had on the mind of CONSTANTIUS, not being able to form a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment how his affections ſtood towards PULCHERA; about noon he returns to the houſe, cloſely examining the looks of CONSTANTIUS, but could read nothing in his countenance for certain.—He then enters into a diſcourſe with him, in the courſe of which he inquires of him how long ſince he was in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia? He anſwered, about ſix or eight weeks.—
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028832_0041_0FDEB3FF1513C850"/>
Was the father of PULCHERA alive when you left the place? He was—Was he much affected at the loſs of his daughter? Exceedingly—it had like to have rained his ſenſes. I think, when I was there laſt, continued VALORUS, a certain gentleman by the name of CONSTANTIUS was paying his addreſſes to PULCHERA. Do you know any thing with regard to him? CONSTANTIUS, with ſome tender emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, replied, yes, I am the perſon. I was once happy in the love of the amiable PULCHERA; but cruel death, that interrupter of human felicity, forced her from me, and left me, inconſolably to bemoan her hapleſs fate.</p>
            <p>Shipwrecked on the coaſt of England, having but a moment to avail ourſelves of the boat (which was at beſt a <hi>forlorn hope</hi>) I, by ſome means, let go her hand, and in the confuſion I did not perceive it till after I was in the boat, and the faſt out from the veſſel. Diſtracted, I had like to have thrown myſelf from the boat into the water, and have attempted to have regained the veſſel, and mingled fates with her; but being fully ſenſible of the impracticability of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining the veſſel, I contented myſelf to live, though every moment expecting to be ſwallowed up in a gaping watery grave—however, we floated, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner truly miraculous, about four or five miles, when, providentially, we ſtruck on a ſmall uninhabited iſland, two days after which we were taken off by a pleaſure boat, who went with us to the iſland on which we ſuppoſed our veſſel was wrecked, which proved to be the ſame.</p>
            <p>Here was I in hopes of finding my PULCHERA, whether dead or alive, but my hopes were in vain, not a trace of her was to be found; a ſmall trunk of here I found waſhed up, which I took into poſſeſſion, out
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028832_0042_0FDEB40158E1ACB8"/>
of which I took this locket, having her picture ſet in gold—this I have ever worn on my breaſt, and never ſhall it be transferred to any other place.—O thou amiable PULCHERA! never will your image be eraſed from my memory—never ſhall I forget the time when we exchanged mutual vows, and gave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to each other, when joys extatic took full poſſeſſion of our enraptured breaſts at anticipating ſcenes of felicity, which we promiſed ourſelves, but which cruel fortune never deſigned we ſhould realize —here CONSTANTIUS's utterance failed him— here he gave himſelf up to a flood of immoderate grief, and VALORUS could ſcarcely contain himſelf—at length, in broken accents, he thus accoſted him:— "<hi>Dear Sir,</hi> I pray that you would moderate your grief, which can be of no ſervice to you—your ſorrows can never reanimate PULCHERA; when death ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates lovers, though it is impoſſible entirely to forget, yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> duty makes it neceſſary to baniſh every idea, as far as is practicable—you may no doubt find another to ſupply the place of PULCHERA." O! replied CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIUS, theſe are the reflections of a mind at eaſe— it is true I cannot reanimate the admirable PULCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA—ſhe has bid farewell to all ſublunary things, but my veneration for her will never ceaſe to exiſt, neither will it in any degree abate. It is true, I have ſought for relief in the arms of another, and ſoon, very ſoon are the nuptials to be celebrated; but there is nothing which can eraſe that ſupreme indiſſoluble affection which I have once for all placed on the inimitable PULCHERA: ſhe is no more!</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, replied VALORUS, your affections were very ſincere, and Providence will never admit of ſuch virtues going unrewarded—it muſt have in its ſtore of beneficence ſome peculiar bleſſing to beſtow upon
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028832_0043_0FDEB4081545BD60"/>
you, and though I am no prophet, I will venture to predict that your days of ſorrow are nearly at an end— ſomething you have no idea of at preſent, will ſoon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon you, which will inſpire you with ſuch ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations as you have a long time been a ſtranger to.— I pray you to diſmiſs the ſubject, and aſk me no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtions on this matter which intereſts me beyond your conception—whether ever you ſee me again or not, remember what I now ſay to you.—Saying this, he bid him adieu; and the moſt earneſt entreaties of CONSTANTIUS could not prevail on him to tarry any longer with him—he walked away into the city, leaving CONSTANTIUS in amazement.</p>
            <p>CONSTANTIUS employed his reaſoning powers to conclude what the ſequel of this matter ſhould be, and and from what VALORUS could obtain ſuch informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning him; various were his conjectures, although he could form no fixed idea in his own mind favouring the elucidation of this riddle which VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OROUS had put upon him—he walked into the houſe, where he ſat down and continued his rumination on this inexplicable adventure. While he was thus muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there came in a boy, and, delivering him a letter, he immediately retired—he opened the letter, and read the proceeding contents:

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:028832_0045_0FDEB40C521F9660"/>This ſtill ſerved to increaſe his wonder—but he conſidered it as rather an unfortunate appointment on one account, as that was the time appointed for the arrival of <hi>Le Monte's</hi> ſiſter, whom he wiſhed to receive with all the reſpect poſſible—he at one time would imagine it was a ſtratagem of ſome enemy of his, in order to introduce a friend between him and his propoſed bride, and then he would determine to pay no kind of attention to the meſſage; then again the anxiety of his mind would be ſuch, that he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let the event be what it would, he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſummons.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, at a little paſt four, he made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to go, and at twenty five minutes ſat out, but as he had left the door, he looked round and diſcovered his propoſed bride, approaching at ſome diſtance, attended with a very ſplendid retinue, the ſight of which ſtaggered his reſolution of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—it could not fail of ſtriking his mind moſt powerfully, that if he abſented himſelf at this time, the lady would conceive ſuch a diſlike, at this want of reſpect, that ſhe would abandon him forever, and that he ſhould draw upon himſelf the revenge of <hi>Le Monte,</hi> and all his connexions—however, his curioſity was ſo great, and his anxiety ſo irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that his determination to go overcame every conſideration to the contrary. He therefore turned his face towards the eagle, and ſuffered nothing to divert his ſteps—he arrived at 29 minutes paſt four; at the door he met a barber and a toilet woman going out. He aſked the hoſteſs if there were any commands there for him? She anſwered, that in the chamber parlour was a young gentleman waiting for you, if your name is CONSTANTIUS: That is my name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he—ſhe ſhewed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the way to the room,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028832_0046_0FDEB40E956C8EE0"/>
which he entered—but heavens, what a ſurpriſe was he ſeized with, when he, inſtead of a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, found his eyes fixed on his adorable PULCHERA; decked in all the magnificence which the city of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux could afford—ſhe roſe in the moſt graceful manner to receive him: ſuch a ſweetneſs was in her countenance, as could not fail of raviſhing the heart of the moſt ſtupid beholder—her eyes acquired addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional luſtre, as they met thoſe of her long wiſhed for CONSTANTIUS, whoſe ſurpriſe was ſo great, that his organs of ſpeech were totally incapable (for a while) to perform their functions, while PULCHERA thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him: <hi>Dear</hi> CONSTANTIUS, it is long ſince my heart has been totally in your poſſeſſion, and many and great have been the ſufferings which I have paſſed through for the ſake of him whom I have now the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of beholding; and you Sir, and you <hi>only</hi> know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ſufferings have been in vain or not—you Sir, know whether I am to be happy in your favour, or whether the ſiſter of <hi>Le Monte</hi> predominates in your affections. You, Sir, can decide on a queſtion which is of more conſequence to me, than the riches of both the Indies. My complete happineſs, and my inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable miſery, are now ſuſpended in the balance of your mind, and as one or the other ſcale preponderates, will my fate be happy or miſerable in the extreme—yet Sir do not miſunderſtand me, perhaps my language conveys ideas different from my intentions, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many terms I have made uſe of, I value your repoſe ſo highly, that I never can wiſh you to do a thing diſagreeable to yourſelf, in order to oblige me; and even an event like that, was I ſenſible of it, would only add to my torment—If Sir, I have poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your heart, I ſhall be thankful for your hand alſo; but to have the <hi>latter</hi> without the <hi>former,</hi> this
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028832_0047_0FDEB415729B7D78"/>
is ſo foreign from my wiſh, that it never can obtain my conſent. I plead no contract, but leave you to the free determination of your affections."</p>
            <p>CONSTANTIUS by this time had in ſome good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree recovered of his ſurpriſe: he encircled her in his arms, and in accents of rapture exclaimed, "O tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently propitious heaven! thrice bountiful, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible, magnificent Providence! inexpreſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent and ſuperlatively beneficent fates! the moſt exalted language is more than infinitely too inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to give an idea of the grateful ſenſations which occupy my breaſt, which is borne down with the grateful ſenſe which I have of your inconceivable benediction towards me! I am arrived at the ſummit of human gratification—I am loſt in extacy. O! ye powers Omniſcient, is this real, or the unſubſtantial fabrick of an empty viſion? O tranſcendently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent powers! 'tis no fiction, 'tis no reverie of an inſane mind, for I am above being impoſed on in this matter—I have her in my arms, the real, half adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble PULCHERA! propitious Providence has once more placed her in my embraces, and the freaks of wild fortune ſhall never more ſeparate me from the object of my delight. No, no, my adorable angel, my deareſt PULCHERA, you have the full poſſeſſion of a heart totally incapable of diſſimulation or change. No—ſooner than I could withdraw my ſupreme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from you, and place it on another, ſhall the courſe of nature receive a total revolution, the ſun ſhall ceaſe to communicate his light or heat, darkneſs ſhall become the medium of diſcerning objects—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, my deareſt PULCHERA, as ſoon as my ſmall affairs in France are ſettled, we will croſs the Atlantic, we will reviſit the land of freedom—we will ſolemnize the long wiſhed for marriage ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028832_0048_0FDEB417D2A82368"/>
and we will live the remainder of our days in that felicity which we have ſo long in vain ſought for."</p>
            <p>In this way they exchanged a variety of mutual expreſſions of the moſt fond affections, until time had inſenſibly introduced the ſhades of the evening, when CONSTANTIUS again began to think of his appointment with the ſiſter of <hi>Le Monte.</hi> He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to PULCHERA the overtures which he had made to <hi>Le Monte</hi>'s ſiſter, in conſequence of his totally deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ever ſeeing her again—that a ſenſe of honour made it neceſſary for him to repair to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to inform her of his ſituation, and to make as good terms with her as he could, and that he would ſpend as little time on this matter, as the nature of the thing would admit of.</p>
            <p>CONSTANTIUS then repaired to his place of abode, where he found <hi>Le Monte</hi> and his ſiſter waiting with anxiety for his return. On his arrival, joy ſeemed to ſparkle in their countenances, but rather decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they read in his viſage that every thing was not right in his mind. However, CONSTANTIUS went through the uſual formalities of welcoming the lady with a tolerable good grace, But he ſoon called <hi>Le Monte</hi> aſide, deſiring to ſpeak with him alone. "My dear friend, ſaid he, we have long been in ſtrict friendſhip together, which I zealouſly wiſh to cultivate and improve, and there is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which lays with peculiar weight on my mind, about which I wiſh to aſk your advice: I hope you will give me your ſentiments fully." "Speak on, quoth <hi>Le Monte</hi>; the beſt of my poor advice is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at your ſervice, and you cannot lay a greater obligation upon me, than to command my beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices." "For a conſiderable time (continued
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028832_0049_0FDEB4195AE694D8"/>
CONSTANTIUS) you have been acquainted with my affairs; you was no ſtranger to my trea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with PULCHERA, to the paſſion I had for her, and the ſolemn obligations I was under to her: ſince her exit you have been fully let into the particulars of my negociations with your amiable ſiſter, and the length to which we have carried the matter—now, Sir, ſuppoſing that PULCHERA ſhould prove to be ſtill alive, and ſhould inſiſt on my fulfilling my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what could you adviſe me to do, Sir? Pray, dear Sir, on the ſacred bonds of friendſhip, by which we are cemented, give me your impartial o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion on the matter."</p>
            <p>"What <hi>ſhould you do!</hi>" replied <hi>Le Monte,</hi> "can there remain a doubt in your mind with regard to what you ſhould do? I think it is impoſſible there ſhould—are you not a man of honour? Do not your engagements, your ſolemn promiſes, lay with ſome degree of weight on your mind? Can you harbour an idea that you are at liberty to break through the ſolemn and delicate obligations of a matrimonial contract? If you do, how can you anſwer it to your own conſcience, to the wronged lady who has plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much confidence in you? Can you have the moſt diſtant idea that you can make a ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of yourſelf to one woman before you are diſcharged from the other? Can you lawfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of any article, after you have conveyed away the whole of your title to it? If you cannot, I wiſh to be informed of the means by which you were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from your obligations to PULCHERA: Will you ſay, you ſuppoſed ſhe was dead? Is that ſufficient, think you? Can your own miſtake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of that right which ſhe had to you, in conſequence of your voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract?
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028832_0050_0FDEB3018021DBF8"/>
No—your good ſenſe will forbid your harbouring ſuch unworthy ideas. If PULCHERA is alive, in the name of common juſtice, marry her: your engagements to my ſiſter muſt, in the nature of things, be, on this implied condition that PULCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA is no more; it was totally out of your power to make any other contract with her, whether that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was <hi>expreſſed</hi> or not.'</p>
            <p>Well (ſaid CONSTANTIUS) ſtrange as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, PULCHERA is yet alive! I have ſeen her—ſhe is now at the ſign of the Eagle! <hi>Le Monte</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him, ſaying, "Then marry her, otherwiſe I ſhould eſteem you as totally unworthy of any ſhare in my friendſhip—you ſeem to heſitate: I will call in my ſiſter—I will inform her of the circumſtances; and then, if ſhe will conſent to marry you under this predicament, and rifle PULCHERA of that felicity which ſhe has hazarded her life to obtain, I ſhall bluſh when I reflect that I was ever allied to her, and from henceforth will forever diſown her as a relation of mine. I will call her in and inform her, as I ſee by your countenance that your ſentiments correſpond with mine."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Monte</hi> called in his ſiſter to them, and informed her of the whole affair; who, looking on CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS with a pleaſant and very wiſhful countenance, gave the following deciſion in favour of CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS—a proof of female generoſity and nobleneſs of mind.</p>
            <p>"Dear Sir, diſappointments were never agreeable to my nature, and I have often thought that I had the leaſt patience to bear with them of any mortal exiſting—and I have not a ſingle doubt but my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as ſtrong towards you as PULCHERA'S are; yet you are her's by right, and your after engagements
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028832_0051_0FDEB42436A5D288"/>
to me, under the miſtaken idea of her being dead, cannot make her claim to you invalid. Heſitate not, my dear CONSTANTIUS—fulfil your engagements to her; for you will totally forfeit every claim to my affections and eſteem, if you do not. You have my moſt fervent prayers that you may continue long and laſting bleſſings to each other in the connubial ſtate— ſhe will always be ſure of a peculiar place in my eſteem, for the good will I bear to you. I hope you will favour us by introducing her into our company this evening—it will afford me the moſt ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to be in any meaſure inſtrumental in conducing to her happineſs.</p>
            <p>CONSTANTIUS returned her a very polite compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for her candid and amiable overture; expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wiſhes, that providence would furniſh her with an huſband ſuitable to her rank in life, and one that would be much more worthy of her than he could have the arrogance to pretend to be. He then, in company with <hi>Le Monte,</hi> waited on PULCHERA from the ſign of the eagle, and introduced her to the ſiſter of <hi>Le Monte,</hi> where the remainder of the evening was ſpent in the greateſt conviviality, and nothing could exceed the pleaſing compliments which paſſed between thoſe two rival ladies.</p>
            <p>CONSTANTIUS and PULCHERA, after this, made the greateſt diſpatch poſſible in their preparations for returning home; and in about a week's time they embarked accordingly, taking an affectionate farewell of <hi>Le Monte</hi> and his ſiſter; and, after a ſhort and pleaſant paſſage, they arrived ſafely at Philadelphia, and on the ſame day repaired to her father's houſe. The ſhock was almoſt too great for her father's nerves—he embraced them both extatically, aſking a thouſand pardons for his miſconduct towards them,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028832_0052_0FDEB425D03AA9C0"/>
and with tears of joy promiſed to devote the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his days to the ſubſtantiating their happineſs.— About a week from this they joined their hands at the altar of Hymen, amidſt a croud of ſpectators, whoſe pleaſed countenances beſpoke the inward joy of their hearts: and they now live the greateſt ornaments of the married ſtate.</p>
