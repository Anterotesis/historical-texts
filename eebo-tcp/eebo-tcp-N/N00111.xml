            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Leaning upon her Beloved,</hi> What is the excellency of this Spouse? She is leaning upon her Beloved: The word (<hi>leaning</hi>) is derived from the Arabian tongue, from which word some conjecture that it should

                  <p n="1">1. Who is it but Jesus Christ, the Head and Husband of his Church, who is able to save to the uttermost <hi>all that come unto God by him,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. who is that firm Rock of Ages, that precious Corner Stone, <hi>that whosoever believeth on him shall never be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Who hath loved me, and given himself for me, these two, the alsufficiency of Christ, and his great and infinite love to her is ground sufficient to lean upon him in all conditions, as the Apostle saith, <hi>I know in whom I have believed, in him that is able to preserve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I have committed to him;</hi> In Christ are all things that make up a fulness of Faith, his Omniscience that knows all our needs and dangers, and how and when to supply, and his Omnipotency whereby he is able to do it.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Compassion, or bowels of infinite compassions, his Spouse is as <hi>the apple of his eye,</hi> therefore the Lord Jesus must needs be in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the most suitable object of Faith, being so all-sufficient, faithful, compassionate and loving, now then <hi>this is the beloved of the</hi> S<hi>pouse,</hi> she came leaning upon this her Beloved, whose first love did draw her heart to love him again with a most ardent love, as <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Many waters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> love, neither can the floods drown it,</hi> Psal. 119. 132. <hi>Look thou upon me and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do to them that love

                  <p>Doct. <hi>It is a matter of much Observation and Admiration, to see a Spouse of Christ coming out of a Wilderness condition, and leaning by Faith firmly upon Christ as her beloved;</hi>

                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>Instruction:</hi> Here we may observe, and see the manner of Gods dealing even with his most precious Churches and People, even with this <hi>Shulamite,</hi> he brings her out of the Wilderness, so the Lord did of old, when he brought his people out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> He brought them into the Wilderness, and the Lord saw the mixed multitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and that Generation must be all worn out before he brought them into the promised Land: In the Wilderness the Lord shewed his wonderful works, feeding them with <hi>Manna,</hi> and giving them water out of the Rock; there God proved them, to know what was in their hearts, and he found abundance of sin, and pride, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in them, and yet all was to do them good in the latter end: So when he brought them out of <hi>Babilon</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> we read in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> what afflictions and oppositions they met withal, of Blastings and Mildews, and disappointments in their Labours they were exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed withal, as may be seen in the Prophecy of <hi>Hagga<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>Instruction:</hi> We may here observe what it is that makes a Spouse of Christ, or any Soul, an object of enquiry and admiration: <hi>Her leaning on her Beloved by Faith and love,</hi> this is the Glory, Beauty, and Excellency of any Church, or Spouse of Christ, or Soul, to be much in the exercise of Faith and Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith is that which gives Glory to God; <hi>Abraham</hi> gave Glory to God by Believing, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 20. <hi>He stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in Faith giving Glory to God,</hi> That is therefore the eminency of any Church or Soul, to give Glory to God by Believing; thus <hi>Iob</hi> under all his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and temptations, could believe that his <hi>Redeemer did live,</hi> and that he should see him at the last day upon the Earth, which was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in him; it's therefore I say, the eminency of any Church or Soul, to be strong in Faith, it is a great dishonour to God, and to Jesus Christ, when Disciples that have been long in the School of Christ, yet have but little Faith, how oft did the Lord Jesus upbraid his Disciples with this, <hi>Oh ye of little Faith,</hi> and sometimes, <hi>how is it that you have no Faith?</hi> this is an eminency in a Christian, when he can give much Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God by Believing, Christ delighteth in this, and admires the Faith of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> Mat. 8. 10. <hi>When Jesus heard it he marvelled, and said,

is the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> the Attonement, the God of peace, all peace comes, from him, he it is that gives all manner of peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> He gives peace with God, you will say what manner of peace is that; the Apostle tells us, <hi>Phil</hi> 4. 7. <hi>The peace of God that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all understanding,</hi> unspeakable and unutterable, such a peace that even those that have it cannot conceive the excellency of it, much less can they express it; God is an Enemy against sin, and sinners and they are at enmity with God, and for a sinner that hath offended, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, and that therefore hath no hope in God, now for such a sinner to be at peace with God, who can conceive what it is, you may see the excellency of it if you consider the persons that are now at peace, for a poor, wretched, miserable, condemned sinner to be at peace with God, and that this should flow from the love of God, in pardoning all his sins, and to account him righteous in his sight; that he that was an enemy to the Great and Holy God, even in his minde by evil works, and had God himself, the Holy Just God an enemy to him, that will avenge himself on his enemies by Eternal punishment, yet now to be at peace with God, and that God will own him as a Friend, forgiving all his sins, accepting him as just &amp; righteous to eternal life, &amp; take him into his high savour, as a Son and Heir of Heaven, and all this through the Blood of his own Son, yea, by the blood of his Cross is this peace made, so justifying his Law and Justice, a great price must be payed to purchase it, and the tearms is free grace, in a covenant of grace to all that believe, it is free grace in God to accept of a satisfaction in Christ, he might have exacted it of the sinner himself, and the tearms of this free grace are only to believe and accept of it; the new Covenant is established upon better promises then the old, wherein God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to take away a hard and stony heart, and to give a heart of flesh; now for a sinner to be at peace with God, through the merit and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ, and upon the tearms of the covenant of grace, and what follows, God now takes them into the state of Sons, <hi>ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, faith the Lord God Almighty,</hi> and they are made Heirs of the Glory of Christ, for a sinner thus to be at peace with God, I say who can tell what it is to be Heirs of God, and co-heirs with Jesus Christ, this is Christs peace which he gives to his Disciples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This peace is the inward peace of a good Conscience, the sence of that peace which a Soul hath with God, through Jesus Christ, being sprinkled from an evil Conscience, we have boldness, and access
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000165_0018_0FA2B51B44836928"/>
with assurance of Faith unto the holiest of all, and confidence towards God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. God sending his Spirit the Comforter, to witness that we are at peace with God, yea, he sends his Spirit to seal up this peace with God, and this breeds joy unspeakable and full of glory, it fills the Soul with all joy in Believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15 13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost,</hi> so that we may boldly go to the Throne of grace, yea even to the holiest of all with confidence towards God, and have liberty before him, this is a singular part of this peace, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that we are at peace with God, and that we are the Children of God, and that we are partakers of all the priviledges of Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christs peace is a peace with men, and so usually taken in Scripture, and especially with the Saints, <hi>Ephes</hi> 12 14. <hi>For he is our peace who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us, that we may be all one in Iesus Christ, both? Ws and Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This peace comprehends peace with the Creature, even with the Beasts of the field, <hi>ob</hi> 5 23 <hi>For thou shalt be in league with the Stones of the field, and the Beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee:</hi> If we be at peace with the King, we are at peace with all his people, if we be at peace with the Commander of the field, we are at peace with all the Army; all creatures are at peace with the Saints, and serve all for their guard, yea this peace of Christ is protection from all evil, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 18 <hi>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work; and preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdome,</hi> Rom 8. 28. <hi>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, according to his purpose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this peace Christ promises, and this peace he gives, but not as the World giveth give I unto you, some may say, way? wherein is the difference? I shall briefly note the difference in two or three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The peace which the World gives, is more in words then in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is oft times only in words, <hi>Psal.</hi> 28. 3. <hi>Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of Iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbour, but mischief is in their heart,</hi> as we may see in the Example of <hi>Joah</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 27. If the Lord speaks peace, who shall speak trouble, and if the Lord speaks peace he speaks from the very heart to the heart, and not in words of course or complement as the Would use to do.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:000165_0019_0FA2B51B81A2A3E0"/>
2. The peace which the world gives, is peace outward to the outward man, they may give outward peace, and fill you with the good things of the world, but it reacheth not the principal part of the man, it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not the heart, but the peace which Christ gives, it reacheth the heart, it reacheth the soul, and the peace that reacheth the Soul reacheth the Body also; but the peace of the world reacheth the Body, but not the Soul; Christs peace secureth the Soul and inward man, it guards the heart, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>And the peace of God which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ,</hi> or as it is in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, <hi>shall guard your hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The peace of the World is very uncertain, and short, when they say peace, peace, then oft suddain destruction comes upon them, as the Example of <hi>Haman</hi> in his great Honour and suddain downfall doth prove, <hi>Esth.</hi> 5. 11. 12. <hi>And Haman told his friends, of his great and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour with the King and Queen,</hi> but the next day, Chap. 7. 10. <hi>He was hanged upon the Gallows he had prepared for Mordecai;</hi> and the strongest league of friendship amongst men of the World, is soon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when mens own interests suit another way, but the peace which Christ gives, in a firm, lasting, everlasting peace, Isai.9. 7. <hi>Of the increase of his Government and peace, there shall be no end;</hi> once at peace with God and ever at peace, God and that Soul will never fall out any more.</p>
                  <p>This being the fruit and effect of this peace, their hearts ought not to be troubled, let not your hearts be disquiet, let them not sink in any affliction that can befal you in this world; here is that peace that may bear up your hearts under any trouble or tryal that at any time you may meet withal, nor need they be afraid what ever tidings they hear, or whatever dangers approach as Christ had told his Disciples of many troubles, as wars and rumors of wars, yet saith Christ, be not afraid with such a fear as stands not with Faith and hope in God,: this peace that I leave with you, it is enough to defend your hearts from fear of any troubles whatsoever, as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>I will not be afraid though the mountains be removed and cast into the Sea,</hi> and therefore though others fear, yet be not you afraid, as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Isai.</hi> 8. 12,13. <hi>neither fear you therefore, nor be afraid, Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear &amp; dread,</hi> as if Christ should say, I give you that true peace that may quiet your hearts under any trouble or distress, or whatsoever you may meet withal in this World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:000165_0020_0FA2B51C3B48FC98"/>
The Doctrine from these words is, that</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That that peace which Jesus Christ hath purchased, and given to his true Disciples, is such as may strengthen them against all distracting troubles and fears in this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of this appears, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 11. <hi>But the meek shall inherit the Earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace,</hi> and ver. 37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> Psal. 119. 165. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall offend them,</hi> they do not stumble at any thing as other men do, Psal. 125. 1. <hi>They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</hi> ver: 2. <hi>As the Mountains are round about Ierusalem, so the Lord is round about his people, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth even for ever.</hi> Psal. 112. 7,8. <hi>Surely he shall not be moved for ever, he shall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord, his heart is established, be shall not be afraid:</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, &amp;c.</hi> they are out of all fear of Condemnation, Joh. 16. 33. <hi>These things have I spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace, in the World you shall have tribulation, but be of good chear I have overcome the World,</hi> Rom. 5. 1,2,3. <hi>Therefore being justified by Faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom also we have access by Faith to this grace wherein we stand, and rejoyce in hope of the glory of God:</hi> and not only so, but we glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations also, Phil 4. 7. <hi>And the peace of God, which passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, shall keep or guard your bearts and minds through Iesus Christ.</hi> Psal. 43. 5. <hi>Why art thou cast down Oh my Soul, and why art thou disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted within me, hope in God for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countinance and my God;</hi> the like see in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Act. 16,24,25. who sang praises unto God in Prison and in the Stocks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. From the unspeakable, unconceivable and excellent worth of this peace, it will out bid all other things in the world; Oh how this helps a man in all straits, what need he fear what man can do, what need he fear what devils can do; as <hi>David</hi> when in great trouble and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet <hi>Psal.</hi> 43. 5. <hi>It by art thou cast down on my Soul, and why art thou disquieted within me, hope in God for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000165_0021_0FA2B51D0B874B40"/>
he chides himself because he was now disquieted, so <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 5. 11. as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so elsewhere, <hi>The Lord is my light and my salvation, of whom then shall I be afraid; if an Host should compass me about, in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them,</hi> this peace with God takes away not only all fears and dangers of condemnation, as <hi>Rom. 8. 1.</hi> but also the sting of sin and death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. <hi>Oh 'Death where is thy sting, Oh Grave where is thy Victory?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because this peace is in the hand of Christ, who payed a great price for it, and he will maintain it, that although we sin yet he is our Advocate, and preserves our peace with God; this peace is the peace of Christ, he hath purchased it with his Blood, he freely giveth it, therefore surely he will maintain it, he will not take it away, as the World gives peace one day, and taketh it away another; this peace is an everlasting peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because this peace does not only set the Soul free from fear of wrath, but it makes every thing easie, and it takes away the poyson and venome of sin, and also the sting of death and hell is taken away, sin is a poyson in every cup &amp; poysons every thing, but this peace takes all away, and doth assure a Believer, that whatever he meets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in this World, shall be to his advantage, it makes prosperity to be safe and sweet to them, and makes all afflictions to work for their good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because all troubles and dangers shall not but this peace, but shall work together to the furtherance of their everlasting peace, for this peace is so far above all evils and fears that can befal such as have it that in comparison there of they are all light and momentany, not worthy to be compared with that glory to be revealed, their great hopes swallow up all their fears, <hi>Joh</hi> 19.25. <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth.</hi>

                  <p>Quest. 1. But here some may ask a Question; <hi>If Christ gives, such peace, how then comes it to pass that many a gracious Soul meet with so much trouble, and that not only trouble in the World, but trouble in spirit, that the Soul hath lost his peace and sense of the favour of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This Legacie was given more especially to the Apostles that were called to so great a work, and were to out face all the Tyrants in the World, and endure so great afflictions and persecutions, so that we may conceive it was alwayes constant and full with them; but ordinary Christians have not so full and constant peace in themselves their peace may be interrupted for a time, through sin, or through temptations, yet

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. Their dissertions and temptations are alwayes turned to their good, and their peace returned with advantage of greater peace and joy, <hi>their end is alwayes peace,</hi> though they should and may go out of the World in the want of the sense of it, yet God doth often return to the Soul at death.</p>

                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>Conviction:</hi> We may hence be convinced of the great folly of all such poor Souls as do rest in such a poor peace as the World gives, and look not after that true, most excellent and everlasting peace which the Lord Jesus Christ does freely offer and give; Alas how many Souls are there that rest themselves in that peace which the world can give, carnal peace, carnal mirth, it is a poor peace you can have from the world, you may have the worlds peace, and yet have a sad heart and conscience, that will tell you for all this you must come to Judgement, the very best peace the world can give, will leave the Soul in miserable fear and distress, in fear of the wrath of God, which will come upon the Sons of disobedience; in the midst of laughter the heart will be sad, all you that thus content your selves, do not your Consciences often tell you of your great and many sins, and woful state to Eternity? when <hi>Paul</hi> preached of righteousness, temporance and judgement to come, <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. that is a poor peace that the world giveth, that is only an outward peace but gives no inward peace and comfort to the Soul, when <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was in his greatest jollity, when he was drinking in his Cups, his mirth and joy was soon gone, and the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing upon the wall caused his knees to smite one against another, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 5,6. in that peace that the world gives, Conscience sometimes will fly in the face, and tells them of those things, sins that they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, and that God is angry with sinners every day, and that there is a Hell prepared for sinners; Oh the fearful expectation of wrath, and fiery indignation that oft seizeth upon the heart of such as are in the greatest peace and prosperity that the world can give; but now where the peace of Christ is, there is no fear of Hell, for there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to such a Soul now: Again this peace that the world doth give, how short and uncertain is it? it is <hi>but a short peace that the world giveth Solomon saith,</hi> if a sinner live an hundred years, and his dayes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, yet I know <hi>it shall go well with those that fear God,</hi> yea, that is the thing to know how it shall be with the Soul, <hi>Haman</hi> may go home and boast of his greatness, and of the favour he was in with the King, and that the Queen also suffered none but him to come in with the King to the Banquet; but poor man! he could not foresee that the next day he must be hanged upon the Gallows that he had prepared for <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai;</hi> and so it is many times, <hi>a man in favour to day, and utterly out of favour to norrow;</hi> although the peace of the world be but a slighty peace,

yet a man is not sure of it one day, when the world saies peace peace, then suddain destruction comes upon them as a Whirl-wind, were this well considered, would any man rest contented with that peace which the world can give; one would think they should not be contented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that true durable peace which Christ gives, and not with that poor peace which the world gives, which is so short and uncertain that lasts not, but those comforts they are gone as a Whirlwind, and their places know them no more, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, and will any rest in such a peace.</p>

                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>Tryal:</hi> This may put every one of us upon the tryal, how nearly doth it concern every Soul to consider and examine whether his peace be the peace of Christ, or of the world, truely, if the peace you have be the peace the world gives, it is not worth a rush; we are a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure people, and live in peace, but consider what true peace you have for your Soul to depend upon, and to this end consider:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a certain truth, <hi>That there is no peace to the wicked saith my God,</hi> Isai 57. 21. what peace can a Soul have that lives in a course of sin and enmity against God? as <hi>Iehu</hi> saith to King <hi>Ioram,</hi> what peace so long as the Whoredoms of thy mother <hi>Iezabel</hi> and her Witchcrafts are so many? so long as the Soul goes on in the wayes of any sin, loves it, and favours himself in it, it is impossible to have any peace with God, that infinitely hates all sin &amp; iniquity; the wicked must forsake his wayes and thoughts, repent and turn to the Lord, before he can be at peace with God; but now, that Soul that can truely say, <hi>that he hath turned from every known sin, &amp; he mourns for sin, it's his grief and burthen,</hi> it is a good sign that that Soul is at peace with God, but when we live in any way of sin, in a way of lying, or any other known sin, it is impossible that he should be at peace with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This peace is the gift of Christ, he only can make peace between God and sinners, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life;</hi> therefore make out your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Jesus Christ by Faith, without which you can have no true peace, but if you take up comfort and expect peace from any duties of your own, or any thing of your own, yea, if you take up comfort from the mercy of God, or from the promise, without Christ in the promise, if you take not hold of Christ in the promise, your comfort will not hold, because you lay hold of peace without true right to it, is Christ most precious and sin most hateful.</p>

3. Where Christ gives peace he gives grace; grace, mercy and peace goes together, Christ Jesus never justifieth but he also sanctifieth that Soul, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is now no condemnation to those that are in Jesus Christ,</hi> but who are they? <hi>those that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit,</hi> as also ver. 13. <hi>For if ye live after the flesh you shall dye, but if through the Spirit ye mortifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live:</hi> Oh where is your mortifying and purging out of sin by the Spirit? where is your delight in the wayes of Holiness and Sanctification? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. I might add also, that this peace that Christ gives, disposeth the heart to a peacable disposition, he will love to be at peace with others, as <hi>Isai.</hi> 11. 6,7. the Kingdome of Christ is thus discribed, <hi>the Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid, and the Calf, and the young Lion, and the fatling together, and a little Childe shall lead them,</hi> the wisdome that is from above is first pure, then peacable, and easie to be intreated; consider what love there is in you to peace, do you not delight, do you not love to be at distance from any of the Saints of God? but love-peace, seek peace and ensue it.</p>

                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>Exhortation:</hi> 1. To every Soul that yet hath not this peace which Christ gives, breathe after it, labour for it; Oh consider and look about you, and think whether it be not needful to get this peace which Christ gives; consider these following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The poor uncertain peace that you now have in the World, that the World can give, you have heard what it is, now will you content your selves with the Worlds peace? can you go from day to day with this peace? will you rise and go about your business with this peace? will you with the Drunkard sleep upon the top of a Mast? Oh awake, awake, and consider what a peace all your worldly peace is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider what a dreadful Enemy you have, whiles you have only that peace that the World can give, you have God for your Enemy,

the great and dreadful God, that will certainly be avenged of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 2. <hi>God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth and is furious, the Lord will take vengeance on his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and he reserveth wrath for his Enemies;</hi> Ye would tremble to fall into the hand of a cruel Enemy, much more into the hand of God, whom you have justly provoked to be your Enemy, what cannot he do, he hath prepared instruments of death; yea, <hi>Isai.</hi> 30. 33. <hi>Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the King it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord like a stream of Brimstone doth kindle it:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh Consider what God is, and what a state and condition every sinner is in that is an Enemy to God, and it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; if you were ready to fall into the hands of a cruel Nation, Oh what fear would there be! what care and endeavour to escape it, God is not cruel, but he is a just revenging God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider, how willing God is to be at peace, see how the Lord expresses himself, <hi>Isai.</hi> 27. 5. <hi>Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me, and he shall make peace with me:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many a poor Soul questions whether God be willing, they think it is in vain for them to go about to make peace with God; why do you say so? you hear the Lord here by the Prophet say, if he will make peace he shall make peace; the question therefore is not whether God be willing to be at peace with you, but whether you be willing to be at peace with him; the Lord hath given his Son to make peace, and sends the word of reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
