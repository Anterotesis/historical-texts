         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Then ſaid JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S unto the Twelve, Will Ye alſo go away?</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Simon Peter</hi> anſwered Him, <hi>LORD, TO WHOM SHALL WE GO</hi>? Thou haſt the Words of Eternal Life.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE find in the 66<hi>th.</hi> Verſe of this Chapter, That many of CHRIST's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers forſook him, and went away; they turn'd their backs upon him &amp; became Apoſtates; The occaſion thereof we find in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes; they ſtumbled at his Doctrine:
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002351_0003_0FDB2E9227D41738"/>
they were prejudiced at his Sermon: He had told them in the foregoing Verſes, that <hi>He was the Bread of life</hi>; and that unleſs <hi>they ate His Fleſh and drank His Blood, they had no life:</hi> That is, they neither had any Spiritual Life then, nor ſhould they have Eternal Life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. They taking theſe words to be meant Carnally &amp; Literally, not Spiritually, ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereat. And when Jeſus ſaw that ſome of His own Diſciples miſunderſtood him, He proceeds to Enlighten them, v. 61. telling 'em He meant eating of His Fleſh &amp; drinking of His Blood, to be after a <hi>Spiritual manner, Ver.</hi> 63. That it is <hi>the Spirit that quickneth</hi> and not the Fleſh; and His words were Spiritual, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be underſtood after a Spiritual manner. After which He told them he knew well that there were ſome that did not receive the Truth, and would not Believe, <hi>Ver.</hi> 64. And in <hi>Ver.</hi> 65. He gives one reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> It was not given them of the Father; telling them if the mighty Power of God did not Enlighten their Underſtanding, quicken their dead Souls, draw them with a ſweet, yet holy Violence (as it were) they would not, could not come unto the Son; which was farther offenſive ſtill, as the like Doctrine is to <hi>Arminians</hi> to this Day. Upon this they Revolted, and this was the occaſion of their Backſliding; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>From
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002351_0004_0FDB2E938C853728"/>
that time many of His Diſciples went back and walked no more with Him</hi>; forſook Him, and never returned to follow Him any more.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Lord JESUS took occaſion to ſpeak to His Diſciples, that is <hi>the Twelve</hi> (being full of Pity and Compaſſion,) He ſeeing many turn their backs, turned about to thoſe who remained; and in a very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Heart-affecting manner, ſaith, <hi>Will ye go away alſo</hi>? Ye that are my Diſciples! It is no great wonder to ſee ſuch and ſuch go away, but will YE alſo go away that have been ſo near and ſo dear to me? Will ye go away from Me that am your Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer? <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> partly being a forward man to ſpeak, partly becauſe the Lord's words reached &amp; deeply affected him, makes Reply, <hi>Lord, whither ſhall we go</hi>? The words note a Vehemency, and imply,
<list>
                  <item>(1) That <hi>they would not go.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>(2) That <hi>they had no where elſe to go.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As if they ſhould ſay; Lord, We have no where elſe to go; we cannot better &amp; mend our ſelves, therefore we will not go: Whither ſhall we poor needy Sinners go for help, if we ſhould leave and forſake Thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> That there is no help to be had for poor needy Sinners, but in JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Act 4.12.</hi> Salvation is to be had in no other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002351_0005_0FDB2E950C221058"/>There are Two PROPOSITIONS.</p>
            <p>PROP I. <hi>Sinners are Poor Needy Creatures.</hi> I intend Unconverted Sinners: All men are ſuch by Nature; the condition of all and every man by Nature is, POOR, MISERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE, BLIND, AND NAKED.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Men ſtand in need of Pardoning Mercy.</hi> They have need to have their Sins Pardoned. Sins are called <hi>Debts, Mat.</hi> 6.12. What <hi>Luke</hi> calls <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> or Sins, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls <hi>Debts</hi>; to note that Sin is a Debt. How many Sins a man is guilty of, ſo many are his Debts: and poor Man is miſerably Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and not able to pay ſo much as one of the leaſt of them! So likewiſe man is a poor guilty Criminal &amp; Malefactor, Condemned to die; Joh. 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already.</hi> And there is no way to eſcape but by Pardoning Mercy: They ſtand in need of Juſtifying Grace to Abſolve, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit and Diſcharge them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Men ſtand in need of Renewing &amp; Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace.</hi> Natural men are Carnal, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, Unholy ones, ſuch as God can have no pleaſure in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.4. Sin is abominable in the ſight of the Lord; God hates it, &amp; man becauſe of Sin is ſuch in the ſight of God too, Job 15.6. — <hi>Much more abominable is man.</hi> Hence they ſtand in need of Cleanſing and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002351_0006_0FDB2E97502ADAE0"/>
Purifying, which is done by Converting and Sanctifying Grace; which is wrought by the Operation of the Spirit &amp; Application of the Blood of Chriſt Therefore you read of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſhed in His Blood, Rev. 1.5 <hi>Unto Him that loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in His own Blood.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, 9. He not only <hi>Forgives,</hi> but <hi>Cleanſes from Sin.</hi> This is done by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God. Men ſtand in need of being Purified &amp; made Holy, without which they cannot enter into the Beatifick Preſence of God; Heb. 12.14. <hi>For without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> As it was of old, a man Ceremonially Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean might not enter into the Camp and Congregation of God's People, <hi>Deut</hi> 23.10. So men Spiritually Unclean cannot enter Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. No unclean thing enters there.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Sinners ſtand in need of Peace, true Peace &amp; Comfort.</hi> A Peace and Security many of them have; Amos 6.1. <hi>Sinners in Zion are at eaſe</hi>: they cry, <hi>Peace, peace to themſelves</hi>: but this is a Peace that they were better without than with: Tis a falſe Peace, a carnal Peace;</p>
            <p>Peace that muſt be broken and taken away from them, elſe <hi>Wo to them</hi>; Tis a Peace that's from a ſpirit of Self-flattery &amp; from Satan, (he blinds mens Eyes and keeps them under Deluſion) and not a Peace that comes
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002351_0007_0FDB2E98D30F8C10"/>
from God. GOD is <hi>angry with them,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11.) and ſaith, that <hi>there is no Peace for them,</hi> Iſa. 57 <hi>ult.</hi> There is no true Peace &amp; Comfort but what is from God, and is a fruit of the Spirit; Joh. 14.27 <hi>My Peace</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>I give you</hi>; who ſends the Comforter to ſpeak Peace. Chriſtleſs Souls can have no good well-grounded Peace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. Iſa.</hi> 57.19 God cauſes Peace, but God never ſpeaks Peace to ſuch who are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, Impenitent Unbelieving Sinners. Sinners, many of them don't need Eaſe and Security, but they need Peace: Peace they have, but then not a ſound, ſolid, durable &amp; laſting, Peace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Men ſtand in need of the Precious Indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preſence of the Spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>This is needful to Enlighten and Teach them the way they ſhould go.</hi> Men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Blind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. Full of Spiritual Darkneſs and Ignorance, Eph 4 18 <hi>Having their understandings darkned through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in them.</hi> Eph. 5.8. They are <hi>Darkneſs</hi> it ſelf, having no Spiritual light &amp; knowlege<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. They neither do no can diſcern <hi>Spiritual things,</hi> becauſe they <hi>are Carnal</hi>; nor do they underſtand the way to Jeſus Chriſt. When men fall under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and Awakenings, they are wont to calculate and lay out to themſelves the way
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002351_0008_0FDB2E9A497DA448"/>
to Converſion, the way to Peace with God; but they are at length made to ſee that their wiſdom is but fooliſhneſs. God is wont to let them try, &amp; they try one method &amp; find that fails them, &amp; another &amp; that fails; till at laſt the Soul comes to ſee it ſelf Loſt &amp; Bewildred: Oftentimes the Sinner is brought to a ſtand, he is non-pluſh'd, knows not whether to look or what to do! He finds the way quite contrary to what he expected, he finds 'tis not with him to <hi>direct his own ſteps.</hi> Much ſo is it with men after Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: they are many times ſenſible that they muſt ſink and periſh if God undertakes not for them; if they have no higher wiſdom than their own they ſhall ſurely fail of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, miſs the Harbour &amp; Haven of Reſt, and ſo Periſh for ever. Mans own wiſdom will not guide him aright one ſtep: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you read, Iſa. 42.16. GOD <hi>leads the blind in ways that they little thought of, makes darkneſs to become light, &amp;c.</hi> quite contrary to what they once expected. The Pſalmiſt was ſenſible of his own darkneſs &amp; want of wiſdom, which made him Pray, as in Pſal. 25.4, 5 <hi>Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, &amp; teach me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>They need the Spirit of God to quicken and ſtrengthen them unto Duty.</hi> Naturally men are <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> as well as light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.
