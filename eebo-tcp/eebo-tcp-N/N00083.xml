            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>GODS Terrible Voice in the City of London: By the late Judgement of the Plague.</head>
            <p>THE Plague so great, so lately, should not be forgotten; yet lest the Fire more lately, and proportionably more great, and the amazing fears, which since have risen within us, should shuffle former thoughts out of our mindes, and rase out the impressions, which by the Plague we had, and should labour to retain to our dying hour: Therefore I shall give a brief Narration of this sad Judgement, and some observations of mine own (who was here in the City from the beginning to the end of it) both to keep alive in my self and others, the memory of the Judgement, that we may be the better prepared for compliance with Gods design in sending the Plague amongst us.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>in the Year of our Lord</hi> 1665, that the Plague began in our City of <hi>London,</hi> after we were warned by the great Plague in <hi>Holland</hi> in the year 1664, and the beginning of it in some remote parts of our Land the same year; not to speak any thing whether there was any signification and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the <hi>Blazing-Star</hi> not long before, that appeared in the view of <hi>London,</hi> and struck some amazement upon the spirits of many. It was in the moneth of <hi>May</hi> that the Plague was first taken notice of, our Bills of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality did let us know but of three which died of the Disease in the whole year before; but in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> the Bill tells us of nine, which fell by the Plague, one just in the heart of the City, the other eight in the Suburbs. This was the first arrow of warning that was shot from Heaven amongst us, and fear quickly begins to creep upon peoples Hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000132_0004_0FA2605EE902EE90"/>
thoughts and discourse there is in Town about the Plague, and they cast in their mindes whither they should go if the Plague should increase. Yet when the next weeks Bill signifieth to them the decrease from 9 to 3, their mindes are something appeased; discourse of that subject cools; fears are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>usht, and hopes take place, that the black cloud did but threaten, and give a few drops, but the wind would drive it away. But when in the next Bill the number of the dead by the Plague is amounted from 3 to 14, and in the next to 17, and in the next to 43, and the disease begins so much to increase, and disperse:</p>
            <p>Now secure sinners begin to be startled, and those who would have slept at quiet still in their nests, are unwillingly awakened. Now a great conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation seizeth upon most persons, and fearful bodings of a desolating judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now guilty sinners begin to look about them, and think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into what corner of the Land they might fly to hide them. Now the prophane and sensual, if they have not remorse for their sins, yet dread and terrours, the effect of guilt, they could not drive from them; and if by company, and carousing, and soft pleasures, they do intoxicate and smoothen their spirits in the day; yet we may guess what dread doth return upon them, if they give but any room for retirement, and what hideous thoughts such persons have in the silent night, through fears of death which they are in danger of. Now those who did not believe an unseen God, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of unseen arrows; and those which slighted Gods threatnings of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgements, do tremble at the beginning of His execution of one, and not the greatest temporal judgement. Now those which had as it were challenged the God of Heaven, and defied Him by their horrid Oathes and Blasphemies, when He begins to appear, they retreat, yea fly away with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and amazement. The great Orbs begin first to move; the Lords and Gentry retire into their Countries; their remote Houses are prepared, goods removed, and <hi>London</hi> is quickly upon their backs: few ruffling Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants walk the streets; few spotted Ladies to be seen at windows: a great forsaking there was of the adjacent places where the Plague did first rage.</p>
            <p>In <hi>June</hi> the number increaseth from 43 to 112, the next week to 168, the next to 267, the next to 470, most of which increase was in the remote parts; few in this moneth within, or near the walls of the City; and few that had any note for goodness or profession, were visited at the first; God gave them warning to bethink and prepare themselves: yet some few that were choice, were visited pretty soon, that the best might not promise to themselves a supercedeas, or interpret any place of Scripture so literally, as
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000132_0005_0FA26060DF44B708"/>
if the Lord had promised an absolute general immunity and defence of his own people from this disease of the Plague.</p>
            <p>Now the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are put to a stop in the career of their trade; they begin to fear whom they converse withall, and deal withall, lest they should have come out of infected places. Now Roses and other sweet flowers wither in the Gardens, are disregarded in the Markets, and people dare not offer them to their noses, lest with their sweet savour, that which is infectious should be attracted: <hi>Rue</hi> and <hi>Wormwood</hi> is taken into the hand; <hi>Myrrhe</hi> and <hi>Zedoary</hi> into the mouth; and without some Antidote, few set abroad in the morning. Now many houses are shut up where the Plague comes, and the inhabitants shut in, lest coming abroad they should spread infection. It was very dismal to behold the Red Crosses, and reade in great letters. <hi>LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US,</hi> on the doors, and Watchmen standing before them with Halberts, and such a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude about those places, and people passing by them so gingerly, and with such fearful looks, as if they had been lined with enemies in ambush, that waited to destroy them.</p>
            <p>Now rich Tradesmen provide themselves to depart; if they have not Countrey-houses, they seek Lodgings abroad for themselves and Families, and the poorer Tradesmen, that they may imitate the rich in their fear, stretch themselves to take a Countrey-journey, though they have scarce wherewithall to bring them back again. The Ministers also (many of them) take occasion to go to their Countrey-places for the Summer-time; or (it may be) to finde out some few of their Parishioners that were gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, leaving the greatest part of the Flock without food or physick, in the time of their greatest need. (I don't speak of all Ministers, those which did stay out of choice and duty, deserve true honour) Possibly they might think God was now Preaching to the City, and what need their Preaching; or rather, did not the thunder of Gods Voice affrighten their guilty Consciences, and make them flie away, lest a bolt from Heaven should fall upon them, and spoil their Preaching for the future? and therefore they would reserve themselves till the people had less need of them. I do not blame many Citizens retiring, when there was so little Trading, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of all might have helped forward the increase and spreading of the infection: but how did guilt drive many away, where duty would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them to stay in the place? Now the High-wayes are thronged with Passengers and Goods, and <hi>London</hi> doth empty it self into the Countrey; great are the stirs and hurries in <hi>London</hi> by the removal of so many families;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000132_0006_0FA260615BA97390"/>
fear puts many thousands on the wing, and those think themselves most safe, that can she furthest off from the City.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> the Plague increaseth and prevaileth exceedingly, the number of 470, which died in one week by the Disease, ariseth to 725 the next week, to 1089 the next, to 1843 the next, to 2010 the next. Now the Plague com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth the Walls of the City like a flood, and poureth it upon it. Now most Parishes are infected both without and within; yea there are not so many Houses shut up by the Plague, as by the owners forsaking of them for fear of it; and though the Inhabitants be so exceedingly decreased by the departure of so many thousands, yet the number of dying persons increase fearfully. Now the Countries keep guards, lest infectious persons should from the City bring the Disease unto them; most of the rich are now gone, and the middle sort will not stay behinde; but the poor are forced (through poverty) to stay, and abide the storm. Now most faces gather paleness, and what dismal apprehensions do then fill their mindes, what dreadful fears do there possess the spirits, especially of those whose Consciences are full of guilt, and have not made their peace with God? The old Drunkards, and Swearers, and Unclean persons are brought into great straits; they look on the right hand, and on the left, and Death is marching towards them from every part, and they know not whither to flie that they may escape it. Now the Arrows begin to flie very thick about their ears, and they see many fellow-sinners fall before their faces, expecting every hour themselves to be smitten; and the very sinking fears they have had of the Plague, have brought the Plague and death upon many; some by the sight of a Coffin in the streets, have fallen into a shivering, and immediately the Disease hath assaulted them, &amp; Serjeant Death hath arrested them, and clapt too the doors of their Houses upon them, from whence they have come forth no more, till they have been brought forth to their graves. We may imagine the hideous thoughts, and horrid perplexity of minde, the tremblings, confusions and anguish of spirit, which some awakened sinners have had, when the Plague hath broke in upon their houses, and seized upon near Relations, whose dying groans sounding in their ears, have warned them to prepare; when their doors have been shut up, and fastned on the outside, with an Inscription, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> and none suffered to come in but a Nurse, whom they have been more afraid of, then the Plague it self; when Lovers and Friends, and Companions in sin have stood aloof, and not dared to come high the door of the house, lest death should issue forth from thence upon them, especially when the Disease hath invaded themselves, and first began with a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000132_0007_0FA26062E1A0D360"/>
pain and diziness in their head, then trembling in their other members; when they have felt Boils to arise under their arms, and in their groins, and seen Blains to come forth in other parts; when the Disease hath wrought in them to that height, as to send forth those Spots which (most think) are the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tokens of near-approaching Death; and now they have received the sentence of death within themselves, and have certainly concluded, that within a few hours they must go down into the dust, and their naked souls, without the case of their body, must make its passage into Eternity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the highest Majesty, to render their accounts, and receive their sentence: None can utter the horror which hath been upon the spirits of such, through the lashes and stings of their guilty Consciences, when they have called to minde a life of sensuality, and prophaneness, their uncleanness, drunkenness, injustice, oathes, curses, derision of Saints and Holiness, neglect of their own salvation; and when a thousand sins have been set in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, with another aspect then when they looked upon them in the temptation; and they finde God to be irreconcilably angry with them, and that the day of Grace is over, the door of Mercy shut, and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and salvation (which before they slighted) is now unattainable; that the Grave is now opening its mouth to receive their bodies, and Hell open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its mouth to receive their souls; and they apprehend that they are now just entring into a place of endless wo and torment, and they must now take up their Lodgings in the inferiour Regions of utter darkness, with Devils, and their fellow-damned sinners, and there abide for evermore in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of misery, without any hopes or possibility of a release; and that they have foolishly brought themselves into this condition, and been the cause of their own ruine; we may guess that the despairful agonies and anguish of such awakened sinners, hath been of all things the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable; except the very future miseries themselves, which they have been afraid of.</p>
            <p>In <hi>August</hi> how dreadful is the increase? from 2010, the number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts up to 2817 in one week; &amp; thence to 3880 the next; thence to 4237 the next; thence to 6102 the next: and all these of the Plague, besides other Diseases.</p>
            <p>Now the cloud is very black, and the storm comes down upon us very sharp. Now Death rides triumphantly upon his pale Horse through our streets, and breaks into every house almost, where any inhabitants are to be found. Now people fall as thick as leaves from the Trees in <hi>Autumn,</hi> when they are shaken by a mighty wind. Now there is a dismal solitude in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000132_0008_0FA2606410A638E8"/>
               <hi>London-streets,</hi> every day looks with the face of a Sabbath-day, observed with greater solemnity then it used to be in the City. Now shops are shut in, people rare and very few that walk about, insomuch that the grass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to spring up in some places, and a deep silence in every place, especially within the Walls; no ratling Coaches, no pransing Horses, no calling in Customers, nor offering Wares; no <hi>London-cries</hi> sounding in the ears; if any voice be heard, it is the groans of dying persons, breathing forth their last; and the Funeral-knells of them that are ready to be carried to their Graves. Now shutting up of Visited-houses (there being so many) is at an end, and most of the well are mingled among the sick, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would have got no help. Now in some places where the people did generally stay, not one house in an hundred but is infected; and in many houses half the Family is swept away; in some the whole, from the eldest to the youngest; few escape with the death of but one or two; never did so many Husbands and Wives die together; never did so many Parents carry their Children with them to the Grave, and go together into the same House under Earth, who had lived together in the same House upon it. Now the nights are too short to bury the dead, the whole day (though at so great a length) is hardly sufficient to light the dead that fall therein, into their Beds.</p>
            <p>Now we could hardly go forth, but we should meet with many Coffins, and see many with sores, and limping in the streets: amongst other fa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> spectacles, me-thought two were very affecting; one, of a woman coming alone, and weeping by the door where I lived (which was in the midst of the Infection) with a little Coffin under her arm, carrying it to the new Church-yard: I did judge that it was the <hi>Mother of the Childe,</hi> and that all the Family besides was dead, and she was forced to Coffin up, and bury with her own hands this her last dead Childe. Another, was of a man at the corner of the <hi>Artillery-wall,</hi> that as I judge through the diziness of his Head with the Disease, which seized upon him there, had dasht his face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wall; and when I came by, he lay hanging with his bloody face over the rails, and bleeding upon the ground; and as I came back, he was removed under a Tree in <hi>More-fields,</hi> and lay upon his back, I went and spake to him, he could give me no answer, but ratled in the throat, and as I was informed, within half an hour died in the place.</p>
            <p>It would be endless to speak what we have seen and heard of some in their frenzy, rising out of their beds, and leaping about their rooms; others crying and roaring at their windows; some coming forth almost naked, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000132_0009_0FA26064654AD830"/>
running into the streets; strange things have others spoken and done when the Disease was upon them: but it was very sad to hear of one, who being sick alone, and it is like frantick, burnt himself in his bed. Now the Plague had broken in much amongst my acquaintance; and of about sixteen or more those faces I used to see every day in our house, within a little while I could finde but four or six of them alive; scarcely a day past over my head for I think a moneth or more together, but I should hear of the death of some one or more that I knew. The first day that they were smitten, the next some hopes of recovery, and the third day that they were dead.</p>
            <p>The <hi>September,</hi> when we hoped for a decrease, because of the season, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the number gone, and the number already dead; yet it was not come to its height, but from 6102, which died by the Plague the last week of <hi>August,</hi> the number is augmented to 6988 the first week in <hi>September;</hi> and when we conceived some little hopes in the next weeks abatement to 6544, our hopes were quite dashed again, when the next week it did rise to 7165, which was the highest Bill; and a dreadful Bill it was! and of the 130 Parishes in and about the City, there were but four Parishes which were not infected; and in those, few people remaining that were not gone into the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Grave</hi> doth open its mouth without measure; Multitudes! Multitudes! in the valley of the shadow of Death, thronging daily into Eternity; the Church-yards are now stuft so full with dead Corpses, that they are in many places swell'd two or three foot higher then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and new ground is broken up to bury the dead.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Hell</hi> from beneath is moved at the number of the guests that are received into its Chambers; the number of the wicked which have died by the Plague, no doubt hath been far the greatest, as we may reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without breach of charity; and it is certain, that all the wicked which then died in sin, were turned into Hell: how then are the damned spirits now increased? Some were damning themselves a little before in their Oaths, and God is now damning their souls for it, and is passing the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versible sentence of Damnation upon them. Some were drinking Wine in Bowls a little before, and strong drink without measure; and now God hath put another Cup into their hands, a Cup of red Wine, even the Wine of the wrath and fierceness of the Almighty. Some were a little before, feasting their senses, pleasing their appetite, satisfying the desires of the flesh, and being past feeling, had given themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000132_0010_0FA260651CAE21F0"/>
with greediness; but now their laughter is turned into mourning and their joy into howling and wo: now they have recovered their feeling again, but instead of the pleasures which they felt, and their sensual delights, which took away the feeling of their Consciences, they are made to feel the heavy hand of God, and to endure such anguish and horrour, through the sense of Gods wrath, as no tongue can express. Now the <hi>Atheists</hi> believe there is a God, and the <hi>Anti-scripturists</hi> are convinced of the truth of Gods Word, by the execution of Gods Threatnings in the Word upon them. Now the <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>unjust,</hi> the <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> the <hi>scoffers</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,</hi> begin to suffer the vengeance of Eternal fire; and the ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the civil, who are unacquainted with Jesus Christ, are not excused; yea, the Hypocrites, with all impenitent and unbelieving persons, are sent down to the place of weeping; and surely Hell wonders to see so many come amongst them from such a City as <hi>London,</hi> where they have enjoyed such plenty of such powerfull means of Grace; and place is given to them, even the lowest and hottest, where <hi>Judas</hi> and others are of the chiefest note.</p>
            <p>Yet Hell doth not engross all that die by the Visitation; some there are, (though not the first or most) who have room made for them in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which are above; the Plague makes little difference between the righteous and the wicked, (except the Lord by a peculiar Providence do shelter some under his wing, and compass them with his favour, as with a shield, hereby keeping off the darts that are shot so thick about them) yet as there is little difference in the body of the righteous, and of others; so this Disease makes little discrimination, and not a few fearing God are cut off amongst the re<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; they die of the same distemper with the most prophane; they are buried in the same grave, and there sleep together ill the morning of the Resurrection: but as there is a difference in their spirits whil'st they live, so there is a difference, and the chiefest difference in their place and state after their separation from the body. <hi>Dives</hi> is carried to Hell, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> to <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, though he died with his body full of sores: Devils drag he souls of the wicked, after they have received their final doom at the Bar of God, into utter darkness, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; but Angels convey the souls of the righteous into the Heavenly Paradise, <hi>the New Jerusalem which is above,</hi> where God is in his glory, and the Lord Jesus Christ at his right hand, and thousand thousands stand before him, and ten thousand times ten thousand administer unto him, even an innumerable company of Angels, and where the spirits of all just
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000132_0011_0FA26065E0850AF0"/>
men and women made perfect, were before gathered; where there is fulness of joy, and rivers of Eternal pleasures running about the Throne of God, the streams of which do make glad all the Inhabitants of <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi> Now the weak prison-doors of the body are broken down, and the strong everlasting Gates of their Fathers Palace are lifted up, and the Saints are received with joy and triumph, into glory, and they come with singing into <hi>Zion,</hi> and everlasting joy in their hearts, and all sorrow and sighing doth flie away like a cloud, which never any more shall be seen. Now the <hi>vail is rent,</hi> and they enter the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> where God dwels, not in the <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a thick cloud,</hi> as in the <hi>Temple of old,</hi> but in the <hi>brightness</hi> of such marvellous <hi>light</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> as their eyes did never behold, neither could enter into their heart to conceive; there they have the vision of Gods face, without any eclipse upon the light of his countenance; there they have the treasures of Gods love opened, and his arms to receive them with dearest and sweetest embracements, which kindles in their hearts such a flame of love, so ravishing and delightful, as words cannot utter; there they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the Lord Jesus Christ, whom in the world they have served; and he that shewed them his grace, which they have wondred at when they were in the body, doth now shew them his glory, which they wonder at much more, there they are welcomed by Angels, who rejoice if at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, much more at their Coronation; there they sit down with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdome of their Father; there they finde <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> which have died before them, amongst whom they are numbred and placed, who rejoice in their increased society.</p>
            <p>And as there is a great difference between the condition of the souls of the righteous and the wicked, who died by the same Disease of the Plague, after their death and separation; so there is a great difference between the carriage of their spirits at their death, and upon their sick-bed. Some wicked men are stupid and sensless, and are given up to a judiciary hardness, and die in a sleep of carnal security, out of which they are not awakened, till they are awakened in the midst of flames: Others more sensible, and considering what hath been, and what is coming upon them, are filled with inexpressible terror, through the roarings and tearings of a guilty accusing Conscience, and the fore-thoughts of that horrible insupportable torment they are so near unto. Now scaring dreams do terrifie them, and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the bottomless Pit, and the burning Lake below, doth surprize them, and some breaking forth in the anguish of their despairing souls, <hi>Who can
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000132_0012_0FA260669CB28AD8"/>
dwell with devouring fire, who can inhabit everlasting burnings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and however jovial and full of pleasure their life hath been, yet at their latter end they are utterly consumed with terrours: <hi>But mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, the end of that man is peace,</hi> whatsoever storms they have had in their passage through a rough Sea, the wind blowing, and the waves roaring, and sometimes have been ready to sink through opposition and discouragement, sometimes have been overwhelmed with grief and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, sometimes have been dasht upon the Rocks of terror and perplexity; yet now they are come to the Haven of Death, the winds are husht and still, the waves are smooth and silent, the storm is over, and there is a great calm upon their spirits; they are past the Rocks, and are out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they feared, when they are in the greatest danger of approaching Death.</p>
            <p>It was generally observed amongst us, that Gods people who died by the Plague amongst the rest, died with such peace and comfort, as Christians do not ordinarily arrive unto, except when they are called forth to suffer Martyrdome for the Testimony of Jesus Christ. Some who have been full of doubts, and fears, and complaints whil'st they have lived and been well, have been fill'd with assurance, and comfort, and praise, and joyful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of glory, when they have lain on their Death-beds with this Disease. And not onely more grown Christians, who have been more ripe for glory, have had these comforts, but also some younger Christians, whose acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Lord hath been of no long standing.</p>
            <p>I can speak something of mine own knowledge concerning some of my Friends whom I have been withall: I shall instance only in the house where I lived; We were eight in family, three Men, three Youths, an old Woman, and a Maid, all which came to me, hearing of my stay in Town, some to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me, others to help me. It was the latter end of <hi>September</hi> before any of us were toucht; the young ones were not idle, but improved their time in praying and hearing, and were ready to receive instruction, and were strongly born up against the fears of the Disease and Death, every day so familar to the view. But at last we were visited, and the Plague came in dreadfully upon us, the Cup was put into our hand to drink, after a Neighbour-Family had tasted it, with whom we had much sweet society in this time of sorrow. And first our Maid was smitten, it began with a shivering and trembling in her flesh, and quickly seized on her spirits; it was a sad day, which I believe I shall never forget: I had been abroad to see a Friend in the City, whose Husband was newly dead of the Plague, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000132_0013_0FA26067641D4CE0"/>
she her self visited with it; I came back to see another whose Wife was dead of the Plague, and he himself under apprehensions that he should die within a few hours: I came home, and the Maid was on her Death-bed, and another crying out for help, being left alone in a swearing tainting Fit. What was an interest in Christ worth then? What a Priviledge to have a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
            <p>But I proceed. It was on the Monday when the Maid was smitten, on Thursday she died full of Tokens: On Friday one of the Youths had a swelling in his Groin; and on the Lords-day died with the marks of the distemper upon him. On the same day another Youth did sicken, and on the Wednesday following he died. On the Thursday-night his Master fell sick of the Disease, and within a day or two was full of Spots, but strangely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his own, and others expectations, recovered. Thus did the Plague follow us, and came upon us one by one, as <hi>Job'</hi>s Messengers came one upon the heels of another; so the Messengers of Death came so close one after another, in such dreadful manner, as if we must all follow one another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into the Pit: yet the Lord in mercy put a stop to it, &amp; the rest were preserved. But that which was very remarkable in this visitation, was the carriage especially of those Youths that died, who I believe were less troubled themselves, then others were troubled for them. The first Youth that was visited, being asked by his Father concerning the provision he had made for his death and eternity; told him, <hi>He hoped if he died he should go to Heaven;</hi> being asked the ground of his hopes, said, <hi>The Lord had enabled him to look beyond the world:</hi> and when he was drawing near to his end, boldly enquired <hi>whether the Tokens did yet appear;</hi> saying, <hi>that he was ready for them:</hi> and so a hopeful Bud was nipt. But let not the Father or the Mother weep, and be in sadness for him, he is, I don't doubt, with their Father, and his Heavenly Father, which may be their comfort. The other also was a very sweet hopeful Youth, so loving and towardly, that it could not but attract love from those that were acquainted with him, but the grace he had gotten in those years, being I suppose under seventeen, did above all beautifie him, and stand him in the greatest stead: in his sickness he had much quiet and serenity upon his spirit, and lay so unconcerned at the thoughts of approaching Death, that I confess I marvelled to see it; the sting and fear of Death were strangely taken out, through the hopes which he had of future glory: yet once he told his Mother <hi>he could desire to live a little longer, if it were the will of God:</hi> she asked him why he desired it? he told her, <hi>he desired to live till Fire and Faggot came, and above all he would
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000132_0014_0FA26069AE969320"/>
fain dye a Martyr:</hi> She said, if he died now, he should have a Crown: He answered, <hi>But if he died a Martyr, he should have a more glorious Crown:</hi> yet he was not unwilling to receive his Crown presently, and went away with great peace and sweetness in his looks, to his Fathers house; and I could not blame the Mothers grief for the loss of such an onely Son, but to be so immoderate, was not well: Now I am sure it is time to dry up tears, and lay aside sorrows for the loss of him who hath been so long filled with joyes in the Heavenly Mansions.</p>
            <p>I might speak of the carriage of the Master in his sickness, under the apprehensions of death: when the spots did appear on his body, he sent for me, and desired me to pray with him; told me he was now going home, desired me to write to his friends, and let them know, <hi>That it did not repent him of his stay in the City, though they had been so importunate with him to come away; but he had found so much of Gods presence in his abode here, that he had no reason to repent:</hi> He told me where he would be buried, and desired me to preach his Funeral Sermon on <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. In thy presence is fulness of joy, and at thy right hand there are pleasures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> But the Lord raised him again beyond the expectation of himself, Friends or Physician. Let him not forget Gods Mercies, and suffer too much worldly business to crowd in upon him, and choak the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and sense of Gods goodness so singular; but let him by his singularity in meekness, humility, self-deniall, and love, zeal, and holy walking, declare that the Lord hath been singularly gracious unto him. But when I speak of home-concernments, let me not forget to look abroad.</p>
            <p>The Plague now increaseth exceedingly, and fears there are amongst us, that within a while there will not be enough alive to bury the dead, and that the City of <hi>London</hi> will now be quite depopulated by this Plague.</p>
            <p>Now some Ministers, formerly put out of their places, who did abide in the City when most of Ministers in place were fled and gone from the people, as well as from the Disease, into the Countreys, seeing the people crowd so fast into the grave and eternity, who seemed to cry as they went, for Spiritual Physicians, and perceiving the Churches to be open, and Pulpits to be open, and finding Pamphlets flung about the streets, of <hi>Pulpits to be let,</hi> they judged that the Law of God and Nature did now dispense with, yea, command their Preaching in publick places, though the Law of man (it is to be supposed in ordinary cases) did forbid them
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000132_0015_0FA2606A625C10F8"/>
to do it. Surely if there had been a Law that none should practise Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick in the City, but such as were licensed by the Colledge of Physicians, and most of those, when there was the greatest need of them, should in the time of the Plague have retired into the Countrey, and other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians who had as good skill in Physick, and no License, should have staid amongst the sick, none would have judged it to have been breach of Law, in such an extraordinary case, to endeavour by their practice, though without a License, to save the lives of those who by good care and Physick were capable of a Cure; and they could hardly have freed themselves from the guilt of Murther of many bodies, if for Nicety of Law in such a case of necessity, they should have neglected to administer Physick. The case was the same with the Unlicensed Ministers which stayed, when so many of the Licensed ones were gone, and as the need of souls was greater then the need of bodies, the sickness of the one being more universal and dangerous then the sickness of the other; and the saving or losing of the soul, being so many degrees beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation or death of the body: so the obligation upon Ministers was stronger, and the motive to preach, greater; and for them to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the guilt of Soul-murther, by their neglect to administer Soul-physick, would have been more hainous and unanswerable; that they were called by the Lord into publick, I suppose that few of any serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will deny, when the Lord did so eminently own them, in giving many seals of their Ministry unto them.</p>
            <p>Now they are preaching, and every Sermon was unto them, as if they were preaching their last. <hi>Old Time</hi> seems now to stand at the head of the Pulpit, with its great <hi>Sythe,</hi> saying with a hoarse voice, <hi>Work while it is called to day, at night I will mow thee down. Grim Death</hi> seems to stand at the side of the Pulpit, with its sharp <hi>Arrow,</hi> saying, <hi>Do thou shoot Gods Arrows, and I will shoot mine.</hi> The <hi>Grave</hi> seems to lye open at the foot of the Pulpit, with dust in her bosome, saying,</p>
            <l>London thy Cry</l>
            <l>To God,</l>
            <l>To Men,</l>
            <l>And now fulfill thy Trust;</l>
            <l>Here thou must lye,</l>
            <l>Mouth stopt,</l>
            <l>Breath gone,</l>
            <l>And silent in the Dust.</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:000132_0016_0FA2606B84E4C6F0"/>
Ministers now had awakening calls to seriousness and fervour in their Ministerial Work; to preach on the side and brink of the Pit, into which Thousands were tumbling; to pray under such near views of Eternity, into which many passengers were daily entring, might be a means to stir up the spirit more then ordinary.</p>
            <p>Now there is such a vast concourse of people in the Churches where these Ministers are to be found, that they cannot many times come near the Pulpit-doors for the prease, but are forced to climb over the Pews to them: And such a face is now seen in the Assemblies, as seldom was seen before in <hi>London;</hi> such eager looks, such open ears, such greedy atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if every word would be eaten which dropt from the mouthes of the Ministers.</p>
            <p>If you ever saw a drowning man catch at a rope, you may guess how eagerly many people did catch at the Word, when they were ready to be overwhelmed by this over-flowing scourge, which was passing through the City; when Death was knocking at so many doors, and God was crying aloud by his Judgements; and Ministers were now sent to knock, cry aloud, and lift up their voice like a Trumpet: <hi>Then, then</hi> the people began to open the ear and the heart, which were fast shut and barred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; How did they then hearken as for their lives, as if every Sermon were their last; as if Death stood at the door of the Church, and would seize upon them so soon as they came forth; as if the Arrows which flew so thick in the City, would strike them before they could get to their Houses; as if they were immediately to appear before the Barre of that God, who by his Ministers was now speaking unto them. Great were the impressions which the Word then made upon many Hearts, beyond the power of man to effect, &amp; what the people before ever felt, as some of them have declar'd. When sin is ript up &amp; reprov'd, O the tears that slide down from the eyes! when the judgments of God are denounced, O the tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings which are upon the Conscience! when the Lord Jesus Christ is made known &amp; proffer'd, O the longing desires &amp; openings of heart unto him! when the riches of the Gospel are displayed, and the promises of the Covenant of Grace are set forth and applied, O the inward burnings and sweet flames which were on the affections! now the Net is cast, and many fishes are taken; the Pool is moved by the Angel, and many leprous spirits, and sin-sick-souls are cured; many were brought to the birth, and I hope not a few were born again, and brought forth: a strange moving there was upon the hearts of multitudes in the City; and I am perswaded
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000132_0017_0FA2606BE7D8BEA0"/>
that many were brought over effectually unto a closure with Jesus Christ, whereof some died by the Plague with willingness and peace; others remain stedfast in Gods wayes unto this day: but Convictions (I believe) many hundreds had, if not thousands, which I wish that none havest fled, and with the Dog returned to their vomit, and with the Sow, have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed again in the mire of their former sins. The work was the more great, because the Instruments which were made use of was more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and unlikely, whom the Lord did make choice of the rather, that the glory by Ministers and people might be ascrib'd in full unto himself.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of these Ministers preaching, especially after their first <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t together, the Lord begins to remit, and turn his hand, and cause some abatement of the Disease.</p>
            <p>From 7155 which died of the Plague in one week, there is a decrease to 5538 the next, which was at the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> the next week a farther decrease to 4929, the next to 4327, the next to 2665, the next to 1421, the next to 1031; then there was an increase the first week in <hi>November</hi> to 1414, but it fell the week after to 1050, and the week after to 652, and the week after that to 333; and so lessened more and more to the end of the year: when we had a Bill of 97306 which died of all Diseases, which was an increase of more then 79000, over what it was the year before; and the number of them which died by the Plague, was reckoned to be 68596 this year; when there were but 6 which the Bill speaks of who died the year before.</p>
            <p>Now the Citizens, who had dispers'd themselves abroad into the Countries, because of the Contagion, think of their old Houses and Trades, and begin to return, though with fearfulness and trembling, lest some of the after-drops of the storm should fall upon them: and Oh that many of them had not brought back their old hearts and sins, which they carried away with them! Oh that there had been a general repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation, and returning to the Lord that had smitten the City! The Lord gave them Leisure and Vacation from their Trades, for the one necessary thing, which had they improved, and generally mourned for sin, which brought the Plague upon the City, had they humbly and earnestly sought the Lord to turn from his fierce anger, which was kindled against <hi>London,</hi> it might have prevented the desolating Judgement by Fire: But alas! how many spent their time of leisure in toyes and trifles, at best about feeding and preserving their bodies, but no

time in serious minding the salvation of their souls; and if some were a little awakened with fear, whil'st the Plague raged so greatly, and they lookt upon themselves to be in such danger; yet when they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the danger to be over, they dropt asleep faster then before; still they are the same or worse then formerly: They that were drunken, are drunken still; they that were filthy, are filthy still; and they that were unjust and covetous, do still persevere in their sinful course; couzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lying, and swearing, and cursing, and Sabbath-breaking; and pride, and envy, and flesh-pleasing, and the like God-displeasing, and God-provoking sins, do abound in <hi>London,</hi> as if there were no significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods Judgments by the Plague. Some return to their houses, and follow their worldly business, and work as hard as they can to fetch up the time they have lost, without minding and labouring to improve by the Judgement, and Gods wonderful preservation of them; others return, and sin as hard as they can, having been taken off for a while, from these opportunities and free liberties for sin, which they had before, most <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <head>GODS Terrible Voice in the City of London: By the late Judgement of the Fire.</head>
            <p>I Proceed now to give a Narration of the Judgement of the <hi>Fire;</hi> in which I shall be more brief, it being dispatcht in fewer dayes, then the <hi>Plague</hi> was in moneths.</p>
            <p>It was the Second of <hi>September</hi> 1666, that the anger of the Lord was kindled against <hi>London,</hi> and the Fire began: It began in a Bakers house in <hi>Pudding-lane</hi> by <hi>Fish-street-hill:</hi> and now the Lord is making <hi>London like a fiery Oven in the time of his anger,</hi> Psal. 21.9. and in his wrath doth devour and swallow up our habitations. It was in the depth and dead of the night, when most doors and senses were lockt up in the City, that the Fire doth break forth and appear abroad, and like a mighty Giant refresht with wine, doth awake and arm it self, quickly gathers strength, when it had made havock of some Houses, rusheth down the Hill towards the <hi>Bridge,</hi> crosseth <hi>Thames-street,</hi> invadeth <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus-Church</hi> at the <hi>Bridge-foot,</hi> and though that Church were so great, yet it was not a sufficient Barracado against this Conquerour; but having scaled and taken this Fort, it shooteth flames with so much the greater advantage into all places round about: and a great building of Houses upon the <hi>Bridge</hi> is quickly thrown to the ground: Then the Conqueror being stayed in his course at the <hi>Bridge,</hi> marcheth back towards the City again, and runs along with great noise and violence through <hi>Thames-street</hi> Westward, where having such combustible matter it its teeth, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000132_0020_0FA2606FD090E010"/>
such a fierce Wind upon its back, it prevails with little resistance, unto the astonishment of the beholders.</p>
            <p>My business is not to speak of the hand of man, which was made use of in the beginning and carrying on of this Fire. The beginning of the Fire at such a time, when there had been so much hot weather, which had dried the houses, and made them the more fit for fuel; the beginning of it in such a place, where there were so many Timber-houses, and the shops filled with so much combustible matter; and the beginning of it just when the wind did blow so fiercely upon that corner towards the rest of the City, which then was like Tinder to the Sparks, this doth smell of a Popish Design, hatcht in the same place where the Gunpowder-Plot was contriv'd, only that this was more successful. The World sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows how correspondent this is to Popish Principles and Practises; those, who could intentionally blow up King and Parliament by Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, might (without any scruple of their kinds of Conscience) actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burn an Heretical City (as they count it) into ashes: for besides the Dispensations they can have from his Holiness, or rather his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Pope, for the most horrid Crimes of Murther, Incest, and the like; It is not unlikely, but they count such an action as this meritorious, (in their kinde of Merit) which, in the issue, they will finde to merit the flames of eternal fire, instead of a Crown of Glory, which I wonder that in their way they can have the least hopes of. I believe that the people will now take more heed of them and their wayes, and instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their cause, I hope that a contrary effect is produced; and that the before Indifferency of a generation more newly sprung up, who did not know them, is now turned into loathing and detestation of such a Religion, as can allow of such practises. My work is not to declare what hath been pr<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed against the Papists before the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament appointed to enquire into their Insolencies; and the Proofs which have been given in, concerning the Fire, and who have been accessary thereunto.</p>
            <p>No, I would rather endeavour to turn peoples eyes from men to God; for whoever were the Instruments, God was the Author of this evil, which hath come upon us; there being no evil in the City (that is, evil of punishment) which the Lord as a righteous and the supreme Judge, doth not inflict. And surely more of the extraordinary hand of God, then of any men, did appear in the burning of the City of <hi>London.</hi> God could have prevented men, by discovering their Plots (as he did that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000132_0021_0FA26071334CDFA0"/>
of the Gun-powder-treason) before they had taken effect. God could have directed and given a blessing unto means for the quenching of it when it was first kindled. God, who hath the Winds in his Fist, could have gathered in the Wind, and laid it asleep; or so turned it the other way, that it should have been a defence to the City: or God who hath the Clouds at his command, and the Bottles of Heaven in his hand, could have gathered his thick Clouds together, and squeez'd them; opened his Bottles, and poured down Rain in abundance upon the City; so that if the wind had blown as it did, it should have blown water upon the fire, which would quickly have put it out. But the Heavens at that time were Brass, no showering Clouds to be seen: the Fire begins, is quickly taken notice of, though in the midst of the night; <hi>Fire, Fire, Fire,</hi> doth resound the streets; many Citizens start out of their sleep, look out of their windows; some dress themselves and run to the place. The Lord Mayor of the City comes with the Officers; a confusion there is, counsel is taken away: and <hi>London,</hi> so famous for wisdom and dexterity, can now finde neither brains nor hands to prevent its ruine. The hand of God was in it: The Decree was come forth: <hi>London</hi> must now fall; and who could prevent it? No wonder, when so many Pillars are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, if the Building tumbles; the prayers, tears, and faith which sometimes <hi>London</hi> hath had, might have quenched the violence of the Fire; might have opened Heaven for rain, and driven back the wind: but now the Fire gets mastery, and burns dreadfully; and God with his great Bellows blew upon it, which makes it spread quickly, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with such force and rage, overturning all so furiously, that the whole City is brought into jeopardy of desolation. That night most of the Londoners had taken their last sleep in their houses; they little thought it would be so when they went into their beds; they did not in the least suspect, when the doors of their ears were unlockt, and the casements of their eyes were opened in the morning, to hear of such an Enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the City, and that they should see him, with such fury, enter the doors of their houses, break into every room, and look out of their casements with such a threatning countenance; As it is said, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>The Inhabitants would not have believed that the adversary should have entred the gates of Jerusalem:</hi> so the Inhabitants of the City, would not have believed that the Fire should have entred and prevailed to burn <hi>London</hi> to the ground.</p>
            <p>That which made the ruine the more dismal, was, that it was begun on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000132_0022_0FA26072C70370D0"/>
the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> morning: never was there the like Sabbath in <hi>London;</hi> Some Churches were in flames that day; and God seems to come down, and to preach himself in them, as he did in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when the Mount burned with Fire: Such warm preaching those Churches never had; such Lightning dreadful Sermons never were before delivered in <hi>London.</hi> In other Churches Ministers were preaching their Fare-well Sermons, and people were hearing with quaking and astonishment: Instead of a holy <hi>Rest</hi> which Christians have taken on this day, there is a tumultuous hurrying about the streets towards the place that burned, and more tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous hurrying upon the spirits of those that sate still, and had only the notice of the ear, of the quick and strange spreading of the Fire.</p>
            <p>Now the Train-bands are up in Arms, watching at every quarter for Outlandish-men, because of the general fears and jealousies, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that Fire-Balls were thrown into Houses by several of them, to help on and provoke the too furious flames. Now goods are hastily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the lower parts of the City; and the body of the people begin to retire, and draw upwards, as the people did from the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> when the earth did cleave asunder and swallow them up, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 27,31,32. or rather as <hi>Lot</hi> drew ont from his House in <hi>Sodom,</hi> before it was consumed by Fire from Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. Yet some hopes were retained on the Lords-day, that the Fire would be extinguished, especially by them who lived in the remote parts, they could scarcely imagine that the Fire a mile off should be able to reach their Houses.</p>
            <p>But the evening draws on, and now the Fire is more visible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: instead of the <hi>Black</hi> curtains of the night, which used to be spread over the City, now the curtains are <hi>Yellow;</hi> the smoke that arose from the burning parts, seemed like so much flame in the night, which being blown upon the other parts by the wind, the whole City at some distance seemed to be on fire. Now hopes begin to sink, and a general consternation seizeth upon the spirits of the people; little sleep is taken in <hi>London</hi> this night, the amazement which the eye and ear doth effect upon the spirit, doth either dry up, or drive away the vapour which used to binde up the senses: Some are at work to quench the Fire with water, others endeavour to stop its course, by pulling down of Houses; but all to no purpose: if it be a little allayed, or beaten down, or put to a stand in some places, it is but a very little while; it quickly recruits, and recovers its force; it leaps and mounts, and makes the more
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000132_0023_0FA260735EBD9930"/>
furious onset, drives back its opposites, snatcheth their weapons out of their hands, seizeth upon the Water-houses and Engines, burns them, spoils them, and makes them unfit for service. Some are upon their knees in the night, pouring out tears before the Lord, interceding for poor <hi>London,</hi> in the day of its calamity; but alas, I fear there are too few weeping <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> at the Throne of Grace; too few <hi>Moses's</hi> to stand in the Gap, too few <hi>Jacobs</hi> to wrestle with the Lord, and hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his arm. <hi>Londons</hi> sins were too great, and Gods anger against the City was too hot, so easily and presently to be quenched and allayed; and if by the intercession of some, a mitigation be obtained, so that the Lord doth not stir up all his 'wrath, utterly to destroy the place, as he did <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> yet none can prevail to call back that wrath, and reverse that decree which is gone forth against the City: The time of <hi>Londons</hi> fall is come; the Fire hath received its commission from God to burn down the City, and therefore all attempts to hinder it are in vain.</p>
            <p>On the Lords-day night the Fire had run as far as <hi>Garlick-hithe</hi> in <hi>Thames-street,</hi> and had crept up into <hi>Cannon-street,</hi> and levell'd it with the ground, and still is making forward by the water-side, and upward to the brow of the hill, on which the City was built.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday, Grace-Church-street</hi> is all in flames, with <hi>Lumbard-street</hi> on the left hand, and part of <hi>Fen-Church-street</hi> on the right, the Fire working (though not so fast) against the wind that way: before it were pleasant and stately houses, behind it ruinous and desolate heaps. The burning then was in fashion of a Bow a dreadful Bow, it was such as mine eyes never before had seen; a Bow which had Gods <hi>Arrow</hi> in it with a flaming point; it was a shining Bow; not like that in the Cloud, which brings water with it, and withall signified Gods Covenant, not to destroy the World any more with water: but it was a Bow which had Fire in it, which signified Gods anger, and his intention to destroy <hi>London</hi> with Fire.</p>
            <p>Now the flames break in upon <hi>Cornhill,</hi> that large and spacious street, and quickly cross the way by the train of Wood that lay in the streets untaken away, which had been pull'd down from the houses to prevent its spreading: and so they lick the whole street as they go; they mount up to the top of the highest houses; they descend down to the lowest vaults and Cellars; and march along on both sides of the way, with such a roaring noise, as never was heard in the City of <hi>London;</hi> no stately
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000132_0024_0FA260741B15B358"/>
building so great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to resist their fury: the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> it self, the glory of the Merchants, is now invaded with much violence; and when once the Fire was intred, how quickly did it run round the Galleries, filling them with flames, then came down stairs, compasseth the Walks, giving forth flaming volleys, and filleth the Court with sheets of Fire; by and by, down fall all the <hi>Kings</hi> upon their faces, and the greatest part of the stone-building after them, (the Founders statue only remaining) with such a noise, as was dreadful and astonishing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then, then</hi> the City did shake indeed, and the Inhabitants did tremble, and flew away in great amazement from their Houses, lest the flames should devour them; <hi>Rattle, rattle, rattle,</hi> was the noise which the Fire struck upon the ear round about, as if there had been a thousand Iron Chariots beating upon the stones; and if you opened your eye to the opening of the streets, where the Fire was come, you might see in some places whole streets at once in flames, that issued forth, as if they had been so many great Forges from the opposite windows, which folding together, were united into one great flame throughout the whole street; and then you might see the Houses <hi>tumble, tumble, tumble,</hi> from one end of the street to the other with a great crash, leaving the foundations open to the view of the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Now fearfulness and terrour doth surprize the Citizens of <hi>London;</hi> confusion and astonishment doth fall upon them at this unheard-of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought-of Judgement. It would have grieved the heart of an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd person, to see the ruful looks, the pale cheeks, the tears trickling down from the eyes, (where the greatness of sorrow and amazement could give leave for such a vent) the smiling of the breast, the wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the hands; to hear the sighs and groans, the doleful and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speeches of the distressed Citizens, when they were bringing forth their wives (some from their Child-bed) and their little ones (some from their sick-bed) out of their Houses, and sending them into the Countries, or some where into the Fields with their goods. Now the hopes of <hi>London</hi> are gone, their heart is sunk; now there is a general remove in the City, and that in a greater hurry then before the Plague; their goods being in greater danger by the Fire, then their persons were by the Sickness. Scarcely are some returned, but they must remove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and not as before, now without any more hopes of ever returning, and living in those houses any more.</p>
            <p>Now Carts, and Drayes, and Coaches, and Horses, as many as could
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000132_0025_0FA26074DC87E0F8"/>
have entrance into the City were loaden, and any money is given for help, 5 <hi>l..</hi> 10 <hi>l..</hi> 20 <hi>l..</hi> 30 <hi>l..</hi> for a Cart, to bear forth into the Fields some choice things, which were ready to be consumed; and some of the Countries had the Conscience to accept of the highest price, which the Citizens did then offer in their extremity: I am mistaken if such money do not burn worse, then the Fire out of which it was <hi>rak'd.</hi> Now Casks of Wine, and Oyl, and other Commodities are tumbled along, and the owners shove as much of their goods as they can towards the Gate: every one now becomes a Porter to himself, and scarcely a back either of Man or Woman that hath strength, but had a burden on it in the streets. It was very sad to see such throngs of poor Citizens coming in, and going forth from the unburnt parts, heavy loaden with some pieces of their goods, but more heavy loaden with weighty grief and sorrow of heart, so that it is wonderful they did not quite sink under these bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday night</hi> was a dreadful night, when the wings of the night had shadowed the light of the heavenly Bodies, there was no darkness of night in <hi>London,</hi> for the Fire shines now round about with a fearful <hi>Blaze,</hi> which yielded such light in the streets, as it had been the Sun at noon-day. Now the Fire having wrought backward strangely against the Wind to <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> &amp;c. along <hi>Thames-street</hi> Eastward, runs up the Hill to <hi>Toner-street,</hi> and having marched on from <hi>Grace-Church-street,</hi> maketh further progress in <hi>Fen-Church-street,</hi> and having spread its wing beyond <hi>Queen hithe</hi> in <hi>Thames-street</hi> Westward, mounts up from the Water-side through <hi>Dowgate,</hi> and <hi>Old Fish street,</hi> into <hi>Watling-street;</hi> but the great fury of the Fire was in the broader streets: in the midst of the night it was come down <hi>Cornhill,</hi> and laid it in the dust, and runs along by the <hi>Stocks,</hi> and there meets with another Fire, which came down <hi>Thredneedle-street,</hi> a little further with another, which came up from <hi>Wall-brook,</hi> a little further with another, which comes up from <hi>Bucklers-bury;</hi> and all these four joyning together, break into one great flame at the corner of <hi>Cheap-side</hi> with such a dazling light, and burning heat, and roaring noise by the fall of so many houses together, that was very amazing; and though it were something stopt in its swift course at <hi>Mercers Chappel,</hi> yet with great force in a while it conquers the place, and burns through it, and then with great rage proceedeth forward in <hi>Cheapside.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> was the Fire burning up the very bowels of <hi>London; Cheapside</hi> is all in a light fire in a few hours time: many Fires meeting
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000132_0026_0FA260759C2444F8"/>
there, as in the center; from <hi>Soper-lane, Bow-lane, Bread-street</hi> and <hi>Friday-street,</hi> and <hi>Old-change,</hi> the Fire comes up almost together, and breaks furiously into the Broad street, and most of that side of the way was together in flames, a <hi>dreadful spectacle!</hi> and then partly by the Fire which came down by <hi>Mercers Chappel,</hi> partly by the fall of the Houses cross the way, the other side is quickly kindled, and doth not stand long after it. Now the Fire gets into <hi>Black-fryers,</hi> and so continues its course by the water, and makes up towards <hi>Pauls Church,</hi> on that side, and <hi>Cheap-side</hi> Fire besets the great building on this side, and the Church though all of stone outward, though naked of houses about it, and though so high above all buildings in the City, yet within a while doth yield to the violent assaults of the conquering flames, and strangely takes Fire at the top; now the Lead melts and runs down, as if it had been snow before the Sun; and the great beams and massy stones, with a great noise fall on the Pavement, and break through into Faith-Church underneath; now great flakes of stone scale, and peel off strangely from the side of the Walls; the Conquer or having got this high Fort, darts its flames round about, now <hi>Pater-Noster-Row, Newgate-Market,</hi> the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and <hi>Ludgate-Hill</hi> have submitted themselves to the devouring Fire, which with wonderful speed rusheth down the Hill into <hi>Fleet-street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Cheap-side</hi> Fire marcheth along <hi>Ironmonger-lane, Old Jury, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence-lane, Milk-street, Wood-street, Gutter-lane, Foster-lane;</hi> now it runs along <hi>Lothbury, Cat-eaten-street, &amp;c.</hi> From <hi>New-gate-Market,</hi> it assaults <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and conquers that great building, and burns through <hi>Martins-lane</hi> towards <hi>Aldersgate,</hi> and all about so furiously, as if it would not leave a House standing upon the ground.</p>
            <p>Now horrible flakes of Fire mount up the sky, and the yellow smoke of <hi>London</hi> ascendeth up towards Heaven, like the smoke of a great Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; a smoak so great, as darkened the Sun at noon-day, (if at any time the Sun peeped forth, it looked red like blood) the Cloud of smoak was so great, that Travellers did ride at noon-day some miles together in the shadow thereof, though there were no other cloud beside to be seen in the sky.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Monday night</hi> was dreadful, <hi>Tuesday-night</hi> was more dreadful, when far the greatest part of the City was consumed: many thousands who on <hi>Saturday</hi> had Houses convenient in the City, both for themselves and to entertain others, now have not where to lay their head; and the fields are the only receptacle, which they can finde for themselves and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000132_0027_0FA2607699D75F28"/>
their goods; most of the late Inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> lye all night in the open Ayr, with no other canopy over them, but that of the Heavens: The Fire is still making towards them, and threatneth the <hi>Suburbs;</hi> it was amazing to see, how it had spread it self several miles in compass; and amongst other things that night, the sight of <hi>Guild-hall</hi> was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view, for several hours together, after the Fire had taken it, without flames, (I suppose because the timber was such solid Oak) in a bright shining coal, as if it had been a Pallace of Gold, or a great building of burnished Brass.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wednesday morning,</hi> when people expected that the Suburbs would be burnt, as well as the City, and with speed were preparing their flight, as well as they could, with their luggage into the Countries, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Villages. Then the Lord hath pity on poor <hi>London;</hi> his bowels begin to relent, his heart is turned within him, and he <hi>stayes his rough wind in the day of the East wind;</hi> his fury begins to be allayed; he hath a <hi>remnant of People in London,</hi> and there shall a <hi>remnant of houses escape;</hi> the wind now is husht; the Commission of the Fire is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, and it burns so gently, even where it meets with no opposition, that it was not hard to be quenched, in many places with a few hands: now the Citizens begin to gather a little heart, and encouragement in their endeavours to quench the Fire. A check it had at <hi>Leaden-hall;</hi> by that great building; a stop it had in <hi>Bishops-gate-street, Fen-Church-street, Lime-street, Mark-lane,</hi> and towards the <hi>Tower;</hi> one means under God, was the blowing up of houses with Gun-powder. Now it is stayed in <hi>Lothbury, Broad-street, Coleman-street;</hi> towards the Gates it burnt, but not with any great violence; at the <hi>Temple</hi> also it is stayed, and in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> where it had got no great footing; and when once the Fire was got under, it was kept under, and on <hi>Thursday</hi> the flames were extinguished.</p>
            <p>But on <hi>Wednesday-night,</hi> when the people late of <hi>London,</hi> now of the fields, hoped to get a little rest on the ground, where they had spread their beds, a more dreadful fear fell upon them then they had before, through a rumour that the <hi>French</hi> were coming armed against them to cut their throats, and spoil them of what they had saved out of the Fire; they were now naked and weak, and in ill condition to defend themselves, and the hearts, especially of the females, do quake and tremble, and are ready to dye within them; yet many Citizens having lost their houses, and almost all that they had, are fired with rage and fury; and they begin
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000132_0028_0FA260771BD77CB8"/>
to stir up themselves like Lyons, or like Bears bereaved of their whelps, and now <hi>Arm, Arm, Arm,</hi> doth resound the Fields and Suburbs with a dreadful voice. We may guess at the distress and perplexity of the people this night, which was something aleviated when the falseness of the Alarm was perceived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus fell great London,</hi> that ancient City! that populous City! <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which was the Queen City of the Land, and as famous as most Cities in the World; none so famous for the Gospel and zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the reformed Religion. And yet how is <hi>London</hi> departed like smoak, and her glory laid in the dust? how is her destruction come, which no man thought of, and her desolation in a moment? how do the Nations about gaze and wonder? how doth the whole Land tremble at the noise of her fall? how do her Citizens droop and hang down their heads? her Women and Virgins weep, and sit in the dust? Oh the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that now sits upon the cheeks! the astonishment and confusion that covers the face, the dismal apprehensions that arise in the minds of most concerning the dreadful consequences which are likely to be of this fall of <hi>London?</hi> How is the pride of <hi>London</hi> stained, and beauty spoiled! her arm broken and strength departed? her riches almost gone, and treasures so much consumed? The head now is sick, and the whole body faint; the heart is wounded, and every other part is sensible of its stroke; never was <hi>England</hi> in greater danger of being made a prey to a forreign power, then since the firing and fall of this City, which had the strength and treasure of the Nation in it. How is <hi>London</hi> ceased, that rich City! that joyous City! one corner indeed is left, but more then as many houses as were within the walls, are turned into ashes.</p>
