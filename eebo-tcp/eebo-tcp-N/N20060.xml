            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MR. PERCIVAL opened the pleadings on the part of the Crown. He ſaid, this was an information againſt Thomas Paine, for that he being a perſon of a wicked, malicious, and ſeditious diſpoſition; and wiſhing to introduce diſorder and confuſion; and to cauſe it to be believed, that the Crown of this kingdom was contrary to the rights of the inhabitants of this kingdom; and to cauſe it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved alſo, that the Bill of rights was a Bill of Wrongs and Inſults; all tending to bring the Government of this country into contempt; and endeavouring to cauſe it to be believed, that the Parliament of this country was openly corrupt in the face of day; and in order to withdraw the affections of the people of this kingdom, againſt: the Law and Conſtitution of this country, that he THOMAS PAINE,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026280_0003_0FCF5113AEE77DF8"/>
wiſhing and intending this miſchief, did, on the 16th of February, 1791, wickedly, falſely, maliciouſly, ſcandalouſly, and ſeditiouſly publiſh a certain book, called the Second Part of Rights of Man, ſigned THOMAS PAINE, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many falſe, wicked, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſeditious aſſertions, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which he would not trouble the Jury, as they would have them from the Attorney General. The Defendant had pleaded Not Guilty, upon which iſſue was joined.</p>
            <p>The ATTORNEY GENERAL ſaid, the Jury would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to ſtate, in this ſtage of the proceeding, that in his mind, a cauſe which brought its own merit with it, a cauſe more plain, more clear, more certain, and indiſputable, never came before a Court. Was it not that certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rcumſtances had happened, and contributed to make the book in queſtion an object of conſiderable magnitude, and rendered it important, he ſhould at once propoſe reading the pages of the book, as they were included in the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the Jury, and then have left the caſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by their good ſenſe; but the particular miſchief that naturally ſlowed from this wicked publication, had rendered it neceſſary for him to open the caſe in a fuller way than uſual upon ſuch occaſions. To ſpeak of himſelf was what he had no delight in, and what could not be entertaining to the Jury; but as circumſtances made it neceſſary, he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jury would forgive it. A rumour had been ſpread that this proſecution did not correſpond with his private judgment. To this he anſwered, that if he did not think this a fit object for proſecution, he ſhould think ſuch an opinion diſqualified him from holding the office he now filled; he would be degraded in the eſtimation of every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional man, and he ought to be deſpiſed if he felt any unwillingneſs to bring this enormous caſe before a Jury of this country.</p>
            <p>This was not the firſt of the kind which this Defendant had thought fit to publiſh againſt Government. He was not, perhaps, warranted in not bringing the firſt before the Gentlemen of the jury. He paſſed it by, however, as it was uſhered into the world in that ſhape, that it was likely to fall only into the hands of tolerably informed perſons, who would have the ſenſe to ſee the poiſon, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026280_0004_0FD01B50682C35D0"/>
would be able to apply the antidote, and refute it as they went along: But when another appeared in a ſmaller ſize, printed on white brown paper, and thruſt into the hands of all perſons, of all ages, ſexes, and conditions: They were even wrapped up with ſweet meats for children. Such were the ſteps that had been taken to forward this publication, and he did what his duty demanded of him, he filed an information againſt the Defendant the firſt day of the ſucceeding term, putting the queſtion upon record, which they, the Jury, had to try.</p>
            <p>What it was that was the intention of this man by theſe publications, would not be matter of difficulty for the Jury to diſcover; it was manifeſted by every teſt that could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the explanation of a man's intention, and the Jury would have to ſay, whether they were not ſatisfied that the whole of the book in queſtion did not deſerve the blame which had been imputed to it by the information. It was written with a view to villify, degrade, and to bring into ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and contempt all the eſtabliſhments of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in all the departments of the ſtate. The whole of the book, the Jury would ſee, was artfully written for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which it was intended, namely, to make the lower orders of ſociety diſaffected to Government, and it was the moſt groſs artifice that ever impoſed upon the credulous part of mankind. It was all written in the dogmatical manner. It conſiſted of ſo many ready made propoſitions, without regard to truth, and without the leaſt application to circumſtances, and alſo without the leaſt reaſoning or deduction whatever; addreſſed to men who were very properly anxious about their rights, but who, from too little knowledge of our Conſtitution, and from being too little habituated to reflection, were eaſily impoſed upon by ſhallow artifice; and when theſe honeſt, but deluded men, came to be perſuaded that they were deprived, by the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potick temper of Government, of rights to which they were clearly entitled, it was a matter of no wonder they ſhould manifeſt an abhorrence of the whole fabrick. He defied any man to ſhew a ſyſtem capable of creating more miſchief than this book. It ſtated that the regular ſyſtem of our legiſlation was inherently corrupt, and that the whole formed a maſs of abominable tyranny. Secondly,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026280_0005_0FD01B521B482568"/>
that the Legiſlature altogether was, without a ſingle excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, grounded upon uſurpation; that this uſurped author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity framed what was called law, but that in reality there was ſcarcely ſuch a thing as law in the country. Thus ten or twelve millions of people were told they were gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by uſurpation, and that of courſe, as there was no ſuch thing as law, each individual would be left to govern all his actions by his own partial notions of moral duty. Were we, indeed, to follow theſe doctrines?—Were we to fall into a lawleſs banditti? Were we to be reduced back again into a ſavage ſtate of nature, where man was the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of man, where all his faculties were uſeleſs, except ſtrength and cunning?—Were we to return to this ſtate? —The Jury knew what the anſwer was to theſe queſtions. What was to be ſaid to a man who would thus, with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſweep, take away all law, or the force of all law, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that all laws which had been hitherto made, are null and void; this ſort of artifice was very groſs, it was true, but it did not appear ſo to thoſe who could not detect the artifice. Objections too were ſtarted in this book to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy,</hi> in general terms, without one word being ſaid of its <hi>advantages.</hi> The power of the <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> was objected to, but not a word was ſaid about the <hi>Democratick</hi> part of our Conſtitution. It was well known that England had a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Democracy; but not a word of that, becauſe it would not make the lower claſſes of the people diſcontented; this was the common artifice; an artifice ſo very ſhallow, that ſome people might wonder perhaps at the ſucceſs of it: But to whom were theſe things addreſſed? To the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the credulous, and the deſperate—the latter were nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally the enemies of all government, order, or regularity; every reſtraint was irkſome to them, and nothing was ſo plauſible or convincing to them, even upon the point of propriety, as to inform them we ſhall have no government at all: The others were eaſily to be impoſed upon, and made the dupes of the crafty and deſigning, who might chooſe to deceive them.</p>
            <p>The Jury, in order to judge accurately of the merits of this political performance, would take into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the phraſes and manner in which the author was pleaſed to expreſs his thoughts in this publication:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026280_0006_0FD01B5371E76BD0"/>
The manner was ſneering and contemptuous; and, as to the matter, he called it an utter defiance to all law, moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and religion. The indecency with which Monarchy was treated was quite ſhocking, and the concluſions in that work, upon that topick, diſcovered that the author was deſtitute of knowledge, as to the various proviſions, and wiſe ones too, which the law made in that particular.— Here the learned gentleman entered into an hiſtorical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the various permanent Council for Minor Kings, Regents, hereditary and official Adviſers, &amp;c. of the Throne, in various caſes of neceſſity; ſo that the proviſions by law were ſuch, that no material inconvenience could be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the publick on account of the monarchical ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem—a ſyſtem which Mr. Paine had been pleaſed to ſay was ſuch, that a caſe might occur where there would be a complete chaſm in that branch of our form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The truth was, that our Conſtitution was the beſt upon earth, and that for the plaineſt and cleareſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it had had longer time for melioration than that of any other in the world. Seven hundred years ago free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was its baſis. From the days of Julius Caeſar it had from age to age been improved, until it was completed at the revolution.</p>
            <p>He apprehended it to be no difficult operation of the human mind, to diſtinguiſh reaſoning from a deliberate deſign to withdraw men's minds from the Conſtitution; it was done by the operation of good ſenſe, and not difficult for a Jury of the city of London. They would obſerve, whether the whole of the book was not calculated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the ſober part of mankind, or to produce diſaffection, to inflame paſſions, inſtead of reaſoning with the mind. He knew of no circumſtance that could leave a doubt in the mind of the Jury as to what was paſſing in the heart of the Defendant, at the time he penned this publication.</p>
            <p>He had thought it more becoming, as well as beneficial to the publick, to ſelect out of this wicked work ſix or ſeven paſſages, than to encumber the record with too many recit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. He would now take them in their order:</p>
            <p>The firſt paſſage is to be found in page 21, large edition, and is in theſe words:</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026280_0007_0FCF511514408A30"/>"All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. An heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name ſuch things may be called, have no other ſignificant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</p>
            <p>Now what was the tendency of this? To deſtroy all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and ſubmiſſion to the law. It was neither more nor leſs than this; to hold out to the people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that they were ſlaves; this was one of theſe ſhort ready made propoſitions, which, if a man believes, he muſt ſay, I can bear this no longer. As to the King's inheriting the people, that was a piece of ſophiſtry; he had no inheritance in the people, his inheritance was his office, and that was an office under the law.</p>
            <p>The next paſſage is in page 47.</p>
            <p>"This Convention met at Philadelphia, in May, 1787, of which General Waſhington was elected Preſident. He was not at that time connected with any of the State gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, or with Congreſs. He delivered up his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion when the war ended, and ſince then had lived as a private citizen.</p>
            <p>"The Convention went deeply into all ſubjects; and having, after a variety of debate and inveſtigation, agreed among themſelves upon the ſeveral parts of a federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; the next queſtion was the manner of giving it authority and practice.</p>
            <p>"For this purpoſe, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, ſend for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector, but they referred the whole matter to the ſenſe and intereſt of the country."</p>
            <p>What was this? Why the whole was written for the ſake of introducing a ſneer againſt a Dutch Stadtholder and German Elector: This diſcovered the temper of the man; but it was another dogma or ready made propoſition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt deduction.</p>
            <p>Another paſſage was to be found in page 52.</p>
            <p>"The hiſtory of the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026280_0008_0FD01B54F56138E0"/>
which the nation had reſtricted it. The Stuarts endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to paſs thoſe limits, and their fate is well known. In all thoſe inſtances we hear nothing of a conſtitution, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of reſtrictions on aſſumed power.</p>
            <p>After this, another William, deſcended from the ſame ſtock, and claiming from the ſame origin, gained poſſeſſion; and of the two evils, James and William, the nation prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what it thought the leaſt, ſince, from circumſtances, it muſt take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view. What is it but a bargain, which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits and privileges? You ſhall have ſo much, and I will have the reſt; and with reſpect to the nation, it ſaid, for <hi>your ſhare,</hi> YOU <hi>ſhall have the right of petitioning.</hi> This being the caſe, the Bill of Rights is more properly a Bill of Wrongs, and of Inſults. As to what is called the Convention Parliament, it was a thing that made itſelf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few perſons got together, and called themſelves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpoſe."</p>
            <p>"From the time of William, a ſpecies of government aroſe, iſſuing out of this coalition bill of rights; and more ſo, ſince the corruption introduced at the Hanover ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by the agency of Walpole; that can be deſcribed by no other name than a deſpotick legiſlation. Though the parts may embarraſs each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges out of itſelf, is the right of petitioning. Where then is the Conſtitution, either that gives, or that reſtrained power?"</p>
            <p>"It is not becauſe a part of the government is elective, that makes it leſs a deſpotiſm, if the perſons ſo elected poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs afterwards, as a Parliament, unlimited powers. Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this caſe, becomes ſeparated from repreſentation, and the candidates are candidates for deſpotiſm."</p>
            <p>Thus this author would have us believe, that, from the days of the Edwards and the Henries, up to the Stuarts, we had nothing but tyranny; and the Bill of Rights, it ſeemed, was a bill of wrongs and inſults. Who was ſo infatuated as to believe all this? Who among us was ignorant of the character of that great founder of our juriſprudence, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Third. And as to the Bill of Rights, ſtrangely
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026280_0009_0FD01B566AC48450"/>
muſt that heart be conſtituted, which had not a grateful reverence for the memory of thoſe who procured it. But as eulogium would be loſt on that bill, let it ſpeak for itſelf. Here he recited almoſt the whole of the Bill of Rights. Such was the bill of wrongs and inſults—he would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it by a comment.</p>
            <p>The next paſſage was in page 56.</p>
            <p>"The attention of the government of England (for I rather chooſe to call it by this name than the Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) appears, ſince its political connexion with Germany, to have been ſo completely engroſſed and abſorbed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign affairs, and the means of raiſing taxes, that it ſeems to exiſt for no other purpoſes. Domeſtick concerns are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, with reſpect to regular law, there is ſcarcely ſuch a thing."</p>
            <p>Here was a reflection of the moſt wicked ſort on the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of this country, and an invitation to the people to rebel, by telling them there was ſcarcely ſuch a thing as law in England.</p>
            <p>The next paſſage was a note in page 63.</p>
            <p>"With reſpect to the two houſes, of which the Engliſh Parliament is compoſed, they appear to be effectually influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced into one, and, as a legiſlature, to have no temper of its own. The Miniſter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it ſleeps obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence."</p>
            <p>"But if we look at the diſtinct abilities of the two houſes, the difference will appear ſo great, as to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of placing power where there can be no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the judgment to uſe it. Wretched as the ſtate of rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Houſe of Lords; and ſo little is this nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named houſe regarded, that the people ſcarcely inquire at any time what is doing. It appears alſo to be moſt under influence, and the fartheſt removed from the general inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the nation."</p>
            <p>There was no occaſion to defend the Houſe; it always had and has at this moment ſome of the moſt illuſtrious men in Europe.</p>
            <p>The next paſſge was in pages 107 and 108.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:026280_0010_0FCF5118A44A4880"/>"Having thus glanced at ſome of the defects of the two Houſes at Parliament, I proceed to what is called the Crown, upon which I ſhall be very conciſe."</p>
            <p>"It ſignifies a nominal office of a million ſterling a year, the buſineſs of which conſiſt in receiving the money.

            <p>"The hazard to which this office is expoſed in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation—the danger of its coming to its ſenſes."</p>
            <p>So that if the people of this country come into their ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we ſhall have no Crown. We had been out of our ſenſes for centuries, if this was the caſe; and all he could wiſh was that we might remain lunaticks forever.</p>

            <p>"I happened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of 1688.

            <p>Mr. Attorney General, after commenting ably on the various paſſages adverted to, made ſeveral obſervations on the great advantages derived from an hereditary when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an elective Monarchy. This was manifeſted in the conſtitution of Poland, which obliged a great, a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and a worthy Prince to abdicate his throne. He then called the attention of the Jury to arguments that had been urged againſt Mr. Paine's Rights of Man, by an American gentleman of the name of Adams. He read ſeveral extracts out of this book, and ſaid, theſe arguments ſeemed to him to be complete anſwers to the Rights of Man. Having finiſhed his obſervations, he thought it unneceſſary to trouble the Gentlemen of the Jury further in this ſtage of the buſineſs. According as they ſhould or ſhould not be of opinion that this book had a dangerous tendency, would be their verdict. He had done his duty by bringing an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of this ſort before the Gentlemen of the Jury, and thereby putting the publick under the ſhield of their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Haynes</hi> was the firſt witneſs called on the part of the proſecution; who ſaid he had bought the Second Part
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026280_0012_0FD01B5FE037A288"/>
of the Rights of Man on the 20th of February laſt, at the ſhop of Mr. Jordan, No. 166, Fleet ſtreet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Chapman</hi> ſaid he was a printer, and knew the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant Thomas Paine. He was introduced as a printer, to print ſome books. In the year 1791 he printed the Firſt Part of the Rights of Man; he alſo printed part of the Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond Part of the Rights of Man, to wit, to page 112, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature <hi>H.</hi> He had the manuſcript in his poſſeſſion to page 146, and had compoſed as far as 14O. But when ſheet <hi>I</hi> came into his hands, upon examining it, part of it appeared to have a dangerous tendency. He then determined in his own mind not to proceed with the work. He wrote a ſhort note to Mr. Paine for that purpoſe, and it was with a degree of reluctance that he did it, owing to the civilities he had received from Mr. Paine. An accident, however, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, which made this buſineſs eaſy. About the 16th of January, Mr. Paine called on him, and was rather intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with liquor. He had been dining at Mr. Johnſon's, in St. Paul's Church yard. Mr. Paine introduced a ſubject upon which they had often differed—that of religion, which was a favourite topick when he was intoxicated. The ſubject of debate running very high, Mr. Paine at laſt came to perſonal abuſe. An obſervation was made by Mrs. Chapman, at which Mr. Paine was greatly offended, and ſaid he had not been ſo much affronted in the whole courſe of his life. He roſe in a great paſſion, declaring that as the witneſs was a diſſenter, he had a bad opinion of him, as they were a ſet of hypocrites. Mr. Paine told the witneſs he wiſhed to ſettle with him. He called on the witneſs the next morning, and made many apologies for what he had ſaid; that it was the effect of liquor, and wiſhed him to go on with the work. But the witneſs would not, as he thought a part of it had an evil tendency. He made three ſeparate propoſals to Mr. Paine, during the publication of this work; firſt, he offered him 100 guineas for the copy; ſecondly, he offered him 500 l. and thirdly, he offered him 1000 guineas. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, as he intended to publiſh a ſmall edition of the work, that he wiſhed to reſerve it in his own hands.</p>
            <p>The witneſs ſaid he had ſeen Paine write, and thought he ſhould know his hand writing. He looked at ſeveral
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026280_0013_0FD01B61AE225938"/>
letters ſigned Thomas Paine, and believed they were the hand writing of the defendant. One of theſe letters em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered Mr. Jordan, of Fleet ſtreet, who was the publiſher of this work, to declare that if any perſon inquired who was the author of the work, to ſay, that he, Paine, was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Others of theſe letters were orders to Mr. Chapman to deliver copies of the Rights of Man to Mr. Jordan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Perdue</hi> ſaid, he was formerly acquainted with Mr. Paine when he was in the Exciſe, and before he went to America. A letter was ſhewn him, which Paine wrote to Archibald M'Donald, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Majeſty's Attorney Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The witneſs ſaid, he believed it was the hand writing of Mr. Paine. This letter was dated Paris, Nov. 11th, firſt year of the Republick. There were paſſages in this letter, reflecting on the Royal Family of England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Erſkine</hi> objected to this letter being read in evidence, as it was not relevant to the ſubject of the preſent trial. My Lord, ſaid he, the Attorney General ſtates, that it contains a libel of the moſt atrocious kind againſt his Majeſty, and his illuſtrious progeny; if ſo, let him be proſecuted by another information.</p>
            <p>It cannot prove any thing contained in the Second Part of the Rights of Man, nor will be evidence, whether any thing therein contained be libellous or not. The preſent information charges nothing reſpecting this letter, and Mr. Attorney General may as well read any other work of Mr. Paine as this pretended letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Kenyon</hi> ſaid, he felt the force of Mr. Erſkine's objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the light which he put it, and he ſhould certainly reject the letter, if the Attorney General had attempted to introduce it either as matter of aggravation or inducement to the Jury to find the Defendant guilty on the preſent charge. But the letter contained an avowal that Mr. Paine was the author of the book which is the ſubject of this trial; and as the Attorney General offered it only to prove this fact, he could not reſiſt its being read.</p>
            <p>The Attorney General then ſtated the ſubſtance of the letter; which was, that he wrote to the Attorney General as a friend; that he had nothing to do with the trial him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Whatever was the event, it could affect him in no other way than the increaſe of his reputation; that it was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026280_0014_0FCF511A61332928"/>
not his trial, but a trial of the Engliſh government with the people of England; that getting a verdict againſt him (which however would be difficult except by a packed jury,) was the ſame as a verdict againſt the man in the moon; that had he time when he was in England, he would have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the information, with remarks upon it, but that now he would wait until the trial was over, and then he ſhould have ſome obſervations. It ſtated, that it was poſſible for him to believe that Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate ſons, had not capacity to govern a nation. In ſtating this part, the Attorney General felt great emotion; he made ſeveral ſuitable comments on it. The letter then went on, ſtating ſeveral other particulars, together with a requeſt that it might be read by the Attorney General to the Jury at the trial.</p>
            <p>Several other letters were produced, all of which were proved to be the hand writing of Mr. Paine. In ſhort, there was no occaſion for all theſe proofs, as nothing was denied upon the facts on the part of Mr. Paine by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, except the letter to the Attorney General.</p>
            <p>The proſecution being thus cloſed, <hi>Mr. Erſkine</hi> addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Court as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that part of the Attorney General's addreſs in which he commented on the ſubject of a letter ſtated to have been received from France, he did not appear to me to play the actor, when he exhibited ſigns of emotion proceeding from feelings that did honour to his nature—from feelings which, animated by his duty, muſt make him eager to expreſs his abhorrence of the direct and ſcandalous attack upon the honour of his Royal Maſter, and upon the character of his family. If his embarraſſment was ſo great, and if his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſo deeply wounded, he will do me the juſtice, that mine muſt be equally, if not more deeply affected. In the high office which he holds, he muſt feel the ſtrongeſt ſenſe of duty in correcting every imputation that may be thrown on the auguſt perſonage whom he ſerves; but that high perſonage is too far removed, too elevated above ſociety, for the learned gentleman to enter into thoſe habits which beget the nicer ſenſibilities of the heart. I ſtand in the ſame ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with the Attorney General, in reſpect of another au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026280_0015_0FD01B63517FDFA8"/>
and illuſtrious perſon, implicated in the moſt improper manner in the forged letter which he has read; and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to my official ſituation, he has had the condeſcenſion to admit me to the honour of his friendſhip, and therefore I owe him, I feel for him, all the duty of a graceful ſervant to an indulgent maſter, and all the affection which man can owe to man. What then muſt be my embarraſſment this day! I muſt be without feelings and without affections, if I did not experience at this moment, the moſt afflicting emotions. But great though they are, they have not been able to detach me from the duty which I owe to my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to juſtice, to honour, and to my country. Gentlemen, it is the firſt and deareſt benefit of an Engliſhman, that he is entitled to an impartial trial. The author of the Rights of Man would have had ample ground of detraction, if there appeared the ſmalleſt tincture of partiality in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of this Court. If the man whom he had choſen to defend him, had been intimidated by threats—had been reduced by prejudice—had been prevailed upon in any way to abandon the cauſe, he might have had occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. It would, indeed, be a blur and a blot on our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, if a man could ſay that the ſlighteſt impediment was thrown in the way of juſtice. I lament, therefore, that the Attorney General thought it neceſſary to read that forged letter: If he knew it to be genuine and authentick, it was his duty to make it the ſubject of a diſtinct proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It has nothing to do with the preſent trial. I feel the impreſſion it has made on your minds. I feel the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion it has made on my own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I ſtand here as the advocate of Thomas Paine for the book that is the ſubject of the information, and knowing how eſſential it is to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Britiſh juſtice that the bar ſhould be free, I will ſtill maintain what I conceive to be my profeſſional duty as far as nature can ſtruggle. That forged letter was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only under the pretext of its ſerving to decypher the <hi>quo animo</hi> of the author in writing the book. Granting even that it be a genuine letter, which I expreſsly deny, it has not the ſmalleſt tendency to eſtabliſh that fact. It was written months after the publication: Nay, after the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had withdrawn from his country; after a time when, from the treatment he received at Dover, he might conſider
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026280_0016_0FD01B65A6747F68"/>
himſelf as one expelled from his country. Granting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the letter were genuine, it is immaterial; it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign to the preſent trial; and the Attorney General has ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly failed in that which I contend to be eſſential to a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, in producing evidence of the evil mind with which the author wrote his book. No one fact, previous to the publication, has he ſtated. Nothing to delineate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, the wicked deſign, the ſeditious ſpirit, with which the author propagated his doctrines; nothing has he brought forward but this forged letter, written ſo many months after, and in ſuch circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The Attorney General has ſaid, that a rumour has gone abroad that the preſent proſecution has been carried on without his approbation; and he has thought it neceſſary to do away this impreſſion by ſtating his direct concurrence. No one can be more ready than myſelf to do liberal juſtice to the candour, impartiality, and fairneſs of the learned gentleman. I have no doubt of the integrity with which he has brought even the preſent action; but if he felt himſelf a little embarraſſed by theſe rumours, which at beſt muſt have been heard only in a narrow circle, what muſt be my ſituation this day! ſtanding up as I do againſt prejudices that have been openly, widely, generally circulated—againſt imputations of the groſſeſt and the moſt affecting kind. Gentlemen, you cannot be ignorant of the diſgraceful means that have been taken, not merely to inflame the publick mind againſt the defendant, but to ſtamp and brand every man with the mark and reproach of diſaffection to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and conſtitution, who ſhall venture to hazard the ſlighteſt approbation of his doctrines. Can you go into any places of publick reſort, either for pleaſure or buſineſs, without hearing the cry againſt this man—without hearing every deſcription of perſons who may be inclined to wiſh for the reform of certain abuſes in the adminiſtration of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, confounded into one band of deſperate deſtroyers of the conſtitution? Can you go into any of theſe places without ſeeing the newſpapers filled with the moſt direct at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks upon my character, for having undertaken his defence, as if it were not the bounden duty of a profeſſional man to exerciſe his faculties in the cauſe of juſtice, impartially? Without making myſelf a party to the cauſe of my client,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026280_0017_0FCF511CAD609F78"/>
I hold myſelf bound to ſtand up in his defence, and to take care that whatever be the offence alleged againſt him, he ſhall have all the benefits to be derived from the law, and from the pure adminiſtration of it. I ſay, gentlemen, that the conſtitution would be gone indeed, if the feelings, the foibles, the virtues, the caprices of Barriſters were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, in the cauſes in which they take a part. What would be the conſequence of giving them an election? What would be the conſequence if it were to be permitted to a man high in his profeſſion to exerciſe his diſcretion in ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what cauſes he would appear in, and in what not? Would it not be giving a previous judgment in the caſe? Would it not be arrogating to himſelf the province of the Judge, and giving a colour and prejudice to the caſe? I am ſure the noble Lord will tell you, that it is inconſiſtent with the pure adminiſtration of juſtice, that perſonal feelings ſhould be permitted to weigh againſt publick duty. I do not affect to hold myſelf out as a perſon ſo high in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as that weight ſhould be given to the authority of my example; but yet from my ſtation at this bar, I may ſay, without the imputation of vanity, that it would be a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant breach of the integrity of the practice, detrimental and injurious to the character of the bar, if I could be induced, by any conſiderations, to forego the defence of a client. I have, therefore, gentlemen, treated with the contempt that they merited, all the ſarcaſms, all the calumnies, with which the converſation of companies, and the columns of newſpapers have been loaded. Regardleſs of all that folly, and of all that malice can utter, I ſhall maintain until I die, the equal right of every man of this kingdom to a fair trial; and on this ground I ſtand up to defend this book, and this author, as by the law of England, he and it can be defended. It is my duty, gentlemen, to ſtate the queſtion of this day. The queſtion is not whether the Engliſh conſtitution be prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of America, or that of France, for the common ſenſe of the mos;t uniformed perſon muſt revolt at ſuch an idea; for how can a Court, conſtituted by Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Engliſh law, give a deciſion againſt that which creates its authority, and conſtitutes its juriſdiction! It is not, therefore, the queſtion this day, to try whether the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of this author are congenial with the conſtitution of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026280_0018_0FD01B66EA716310"/>
England; nor whether they are doctrines oppoſite to, and in hoſtility with, the conſtitution of England; but whether the book has been written and publiſhed agreeable to, and in conformity with, the law of the land.</p>
            <p>I will make myſelf clearly underſtood. Suppoſe, then, that the doctrines of Thomas Paine were doctrines, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of which every one of you approved, and that I were now addreſſing myſelf to a Jury of republicans—I ſay that you would not be authorized to give a verdict for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, if it ſhould be made manifeſt to you, by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he wrote theſe doctrines, and publiſhed them for the malignant purpoſe of promoting an inſurrection in the country, thereby offending againſt the laws of the land. You have no juriſdiction and authority but from law; you have no right to give a verdict in favour of a man offending againſt the law, becauſe you may happen to entertain opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of the ſame kind which produced this breach of the law. This the noble Lord will tell you from the bench, and it is material for you to reflect upon this clear deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your duty; for it matters not how perfectly conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with your opinions the doctrines might be; if they are contrary to the ſpirit and letter of the law, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. Were I therefore, as I ſay, addreſſing a body of men who lived upon this book, or whom it was the ſoul, who doated on it, as on an angel from heaven, I would ſay, gentlemen, you cannot acquit this man, if he has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an offence againſt the law. It is not whether his opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion be yours; you are not to try his opinions, for the law has nothing to do with opinions; the law binds only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, it leaves opinion open. You muſt ſee, therefore, what his conduct has been, and ſuffer not the congeniality of your opinions to blind and influence your judgment. This may be conſidered as a large conceſſion, by ſome, as an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manoeuvre by others; but I aſſert, that it is a clear, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct deſcription of the office of the Jury; for, on the other hand, if you ſhall diſapprove of the doctrines of Thomas Paine, if you ſhall think that the government of England has not the infirmities he imputes to it, nay, that the paſſages of the book related by the Attorney General tend to injure that conſtitution, and to alienate the minds of the people of this country from the love of it; I ſay, that you cannot convict
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026280_0019_0FD01B69E9472380"/>
this man, unleſs you ſhall be convinced that he has overſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the freedom of the preſs; for, gentlemen, you muſt look at the mind, you muſt inquire whether he has written this book with an honeſt intention, from the genuine ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his heart, and from a pure conviction that he was thereby promoting diſcuſſions for the benefit of his fellow citizens; and this is to be collected from the matter on the record. If a man is to be judged on extrinſick matter, that matter muſt be brought into connexion, and put upon the record, that the Jury may be able to judge of it, and that the defendant may have all the benefits of the law. What crime then is charged upon this man? That he has written and publiſhed this book, and that this book is hoſtile to the conſtitution of England?—No. The law of England knows no ſuch crime. It muſt be proved, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute his guilt, not whether the Attorney General approves the book—not whether you approve the book—but wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Paine did not ſit down and write a book againſt a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which he admired and loved, with the diabolical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of provoking diſcord and ſedition in the country. If this were proved, Thomas Paine could not be defended; but if he thinks, what I and you do not think, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of England is not the beſt calculated to promote the happineſs of the people of this country, he is not guilty of any offence againſt the law, though his opinions may be inconſiſtent with the principles of the conſtitution. Every man is protected in his opinions, it is only conduct that makes guilt.</p>
            <p>I hold it, gentlemen, to be the duty of an advocate, if he ſhould happen to have ſentiments different from his client, that he is bound to conceal them. I hold him equally bound to diſcloſe his opinions, if they ſhould happen to be favourable to him; for he is bound to exert his whole faculties in ſupport of its client. I am ſure that it will be of little weight, what may be my opinions upon thoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines; but I am ready to give my client all the benefit that he can derive from the declaration of my s;entiments. I profeſs myſelf then to love the genuine principles of the Britiſh conſtitution; and I ſolemnly believe, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as adminiſtered by King, Lords, and Commons, is the beſt calculated to ſecure the happineſs of the people
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026280_0020_0FCF511E170BDB48"/>
of this country, of any frame of government ever conceived by man. I think it is neceſſary thus to preface my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinions, that you, gentlemen, may ſee that they come from no ſuſpected quarter; that we are in uniſon with each other; and that in ſtriving to aſcertain the truth, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the happineſs of this country, we are animated by a common principle. I proceed, therefore, to ſay, and this propoſition I pledge myſelf to maintain, from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of civil ſociety and government, as well as from the theory and practice of the Engliſh law, that unleſs it can be proved, which I contend it has not been, that he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to excite individuals to rebellion againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional will, from an evil mind, you cannot convict him of a libel on the record. Though you and I may think dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, that is no object. There would be an end of the liberty of Engliſhmen, if they could not write and ſpeculate freely upon the principles of government. The freedom of the preſs of England, gentlemen, conſiſts in this, that a man muſt not addreſs to individuals, upon the ſpur of ſome occaſion, opinions that ſhall provoke them to ſedition, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and tumult; but he may freely addreſs to the univerſal reaſon of a whole nation, principles of government congenial with, or hoſtile to, the form of government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he lives. He may canvaſs the forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, or he may diſcuſs thoſe of his own in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; he may take them to pieces; he may ſcrutinize them with the greateſt rigour; he may ſtate what he thinks to be wrong in the original conception; he may trace the gradual progreſs of decay, or of corruption; he may point out the conſequences; he may dwell on their enormity, he may warn the people of their fate; and, in all this, he is not the ſubject of a criminal proſecution. He is not criminal, unleſs he did it, not contemplating the hope of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap>rating the condition of the people, but feaſting on the miſery, with the proſpect of which he indulged a diabolical nature. The liberty of the preſs conſiſts in this, that any individual may teach his fellow citizens doctrines in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to thoſe under which they live; he may exerciſe his own faculties; he may provoke them to the exerciſe of theirs; he may perſuade the whole people to agree with him in theſe doctrines, and he is not guilty: But if he ſhall teach
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026280_0021_0FD01B7019041938"/>
it as a doctrine, that any individual may oppoſe the law of the land, may reſiſt the legal authority, and may, himſelf, by or in conjunction with others, not merely diſobey, but thwart and impede the ſettled order of ſociety, he would be guilty of a libel upon the record. Shew me an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion like theſe in the books of Thomas Paine; ſhew me, from any part of the evidence which the Attorney General has brought forward, any thing to prove the evil mind of the author. The Attorney General has brought forward a ſet of paſſages, but he knows that paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are not to be taken without the context. You muſt diſcover the mind of Thomas Paine in his book, and as you muſt take his book out of Court with you, it will be your duty to read it carefully. What will you ſay, gentlemen, when you find, in the very preface to his book, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentiments? Every one knows, that the very end of a preface is to announce to the reader the intention and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the following tract; and here you will find, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, in the very outſet of this dangerous and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal performance, an antidote to the very poiſon which it is ſtated to diſſeminate.</p>
            <p>"If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppoſe the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expoſe its errors, to reaſon on its defects, and to ſhew cauſe why it ſhould be repealed, or why another ought to be ſubſtituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it alſo my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making uſe, at the ſame time, of every argument to ſhew its errors, and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it: Becauſe the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force, and lead to diſcretionary violations of thoſe which are good.<note n="*" place="bottom">The caſe is the ſame with reſpect to principles and forms of government, or to what are called conſtitutions, and the parts of which they are compoſed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or aggrandizement of particular individuals, that government ought to be eſtabliſhed, and that mankind are at the expenſe of ſupporting it. The defects of every gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026280_0022_0FCF511FA54006A8"/>
and conſtitution, both as to principle and form, muſt, on a parity of reaſoning, be as open to diſcuſſion as the defects of a law; and it is a duty which every man owes to ſociety to point them out. When theſe defects, and the means of remedying them are generally ſeen by a nation, that nation will reform its government or its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the one caſe, as the government repealed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the law in the other. The operations of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are reſtricted to the making and the adminiſtering of laws; but it is to a nation that the right of forming or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, generating or regenerating conſtitutions and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, belong; and conſequently thoſe ſubjects, as ſubjects of inveſtigation, are always before a country as a matter of right, and cannot, without invading the general right of that country, be made ſubjects for proſecution."</p>
            <p>Theſe, gentlemen, are the Rights of Man: For no man can, without rebellion, withdraw his obedience; nothing ſhort of the will of the whole can alter the conſtitution of a country, but every individual of that country may publiſh his opinions, may give his advice, and may endeavour to bring over other people to his ſentiments. If a man taught that his fellow citizens might act at their diſcretion, if he were to ſay that their natural rights freed them from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and that they were to form to themſelves the rule of their own conduct, in direct oppoſition to the exiſting law, he could not be acquitted by a tribunal of Engliſh juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; but if a man teaches the wiſdom of reviſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the duty of meliorating our condition to the uttermoſt, or even the advantages that would flow, in his opinion, from a complete alteration of the form of our government, he acts upon the known, acknowledged, valuable privileges of an Engliſhman. Thanks be to God, and to the wiſdom of our anceſtors, ſuch has ever been our advantageous liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with ſome ſlight and melancholy interruption, which I ſhall bye and bye ſtate to you. If no man could have gone before the day in which he lived, and pointed out, from the force of ſuperiour intellect, improvements in our ſocial ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, how could government have paſſed on from ſtage to ſtage, from ſtate to hate, until at laſt it has acquired the beautiful ſhape and proſperous eſtabliſhment, which the Attorney General thinks it would be profanation to touch,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026280_0023_0FD01B7251B278C8"/>
and to ſuch a ſtate of perfection as to make it a vain hope to look for any further melioration?</p>
            <p>What is the faireſt fruits of the Engliſh Tree of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? The ſecurity of our rights and of the law, and that no man ſhall be brought to trial where there is prejudice exiſting againſt him. If any thing appears that can infect the minds of the Jury, the Court upon motion will poſtpone the trial. The noble Lord will recollect, that upon this principle the trial of the Dean of St. Aſaph was poſtponed; for it was ſtated in the Court, that a number of extracts from ancient books, aſſerting the rights of Jurors, had been circulated; and the noble Lord put off the trial. If ſuch was the caſe upon the mere circulation of a ſet of extracts from a ſet of writers of high authority, what muſt be the ſituation of my client? This book, and this defendant, have been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of every ſort of imputation. Pending the trial, even a ſet of aſſociators, who know ſo little of the conſtitution of England, as to interfere with the courſe of juſtice, circulate an anſwer to this very pamphlet. It is given away at turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes, thrown down our areas, thruſt into every man's hand. The coffee houſes, the newſpapers, are full of it—nay, that high tribunal, which is the guardian and the repreſentative of the popular branch of England, has been inſulted with anathemas againſt this man, and againſt this book. What is the reſult of all this? That the cauſe is prejudged—that the mind of no man within the ſweep of this torrent can be free; and that if I had made a motion in the Court, I am confident that the juſtice of the noble Lord would have poſtponed the trial. What is the conſequence of all this? You, Gentlemen, muſt guard your minds againſt the approach of this phrenſy; you muſt collect firmneſs with conſcience, and elevate yourſelves above the feebleneſs of human weakneſs. You muſt diſcover his mind in his book, not in the rage nor in the cant of the times. You muſt throw away every thing but the book—the forged letter that has been read to you, you muſt equally reject. I heard of this ſame forged letter, and I have reaſon to believe it to be a foul forgery, brought forward at this moment, not merely to embarraſs me, but to embarraſs you; but you muſt prove that you are not men whoſe underſtandings are to be tortured by ſuch appeals. You will prove, by your
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026280_0024_0FCF5122F8ABE388"/>
verdict, that you will deal by this man as you would wiſh to be dealt with in a ſimilar ſituation. Remember this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Engliſhmen, that <hi>opinion is free.</hi> If I were to move an amendment in any part of the exiſting laws of the land, would it be right, would it be reaſonable, that you ſhould convict me of a libel, becauſe you differed from me in opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion? It is the opinion of this author, that it is the duty of citizens to obey a law while it exiſts. "When a nation," ſays he, "changes its opinions and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be governed as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force, what ought to be accompliſhed by reaſon. Rebellion conſiſts in forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly oppoſing the general will of a nation, whether by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or by individuals." Such is the doctrine of Thomas Paine; and I aſſert this to be the true law of England; and I ſay, that I give the beſt proof of my attachment to the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious family upon the throne, when I maintain theſe doctrines; and when I aſſert, that they are the ſafeſt for their deſirable intereſts, and for their honour. The Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General, in his obſervation upon the infamous aſperſion' on the royal family, ſpeaks of the heir apparent of the crown from hope—I ſpeak from knowledge. Without detaining you for one moment, to animadvert on what I think the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency of the tameneſs with which imputations on the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al progeny have been ſuffered of late, of the apparent diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to proſecute what tends to break the beſt hopes of Engliſhmen, and wound the fondeſt feelings of the royal boſom, while there is an eagerneſs to proſecute the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of popular opinions, I believe, and I know, that if ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there was a man more firmly attached than another to the pure principles of the Britiſh conſtitution, to thoſe rights of the people, the exerciſe of which ſeated the preſent family upon the throne, it is the heir apparent of the crown of theſe realms. If there ſhall come a time that, by the courſe of nature, (and God forbid that it ſhould ever happen otherwiſe than by the courſe of nature) he ſhould ſucceed to the throne of his anceſtors, I have the firmeſt confidence that he will make the conſtitution the rule of his conduct. I know that theſe ſentiments are congenial to his breaſt. I had the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in my place in the houſe of Commons, when I believe that auguſt perſon was preſent, to pronounce my opinion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026280_0025_0FD01B73AC451D58"/>
on political doctrines, and to put the title of the King's majeſty upon the right which the people have to chooſe their chief magiſtrate—the only right upon which, in my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, the title can be truly ſafe.</p>
            <p>In endeavouring to find the true ſpirit with which this book was written, you muſt go back to the train of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which have formed the habits and opinions of the author. You cannot have forgotten that calamitous era in our hiſtory, to which no man can look back without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror—the era of the American war. This man performed a conſiderable part on that memorable theatre; and of his conduct there, Mr. Burke, that celebrated character, of whom I cannot ſpeak otherwiſe than with great veneration, however he may affect to treat me with contempt, has ſpoken of the conduct of Thomas Paine with high reſpect.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. Erſkine read ſome quotations from his <hi>Thoughts on the Cauſes of the preſent Dlſcontent,</hi> and other works in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Thomas Paine, and he ſaid that theſe two perſons uſed to be of the ſame mind, though they now dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Paine might be right, but Mr. Burke could not be right, for Mr. Paine had been conſiſtent with himſelf, but Mr. Burke had contradicted every former opinion. Paine, ſeeing the conſequences of the conduct of Britain with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to America, had attacked the Engliſh conſtitution; for, Mr. Erſkine ſaid, he does attack the Engliſh conſtitution— I do not affect to deny it. He ſpeaks againſt the original frame of our conſtitution, what I think is only applicable to its decay, and what, (for I will not mince the matter) proceeds from corruptions which would bring on the ruin of us all, if I did not know and believe that the conſtitution contains the ſeeds of its own reform. Is it libellous in him, however, to ſay what he has ſaid againſt the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent branches of our conſtitution?—the grandeſt authorities of England have done the ſame. Mr. Erſkine quoted a paſſage of a letter from Sir George Savile to his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents—[Vide Annual Regiſter for 1780, p. 400.]—"I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to you," ſays Sir George, "baffled and diſpirited, and, I am ſorry that truth obliges me to add, with hardly a ray of hope, of ſeeing any change in the miſerable courſe of publick calamities." And of Sir George Savile, Mr. Erſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kine gave the admirable character as drawn by Mr. Burke.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026280_0026_0FD01B752C3FDD98"/>
At this time Mr. Paine and Mr. Burke fought in the ſame field—Mr. Burke ſpoke to Parliament, Mr. Paine to the people. Mr. Paine has only been a plagiary from himſelf; he has been drawn on in the ſame train of thinking; and, therefore, I aſſert that his book is the product of his real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, the genuine efforts of a mind ſtruggling for what he conceives to be the intereſts of humanity. The cauſe is potent; it produced the revolution in America; it produced the revolution in France, where a government, incurable from its corruption and profligacy, was totally overthrown: But can the ſame doctrines affect the conſtitution of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? No. His doctrines had no effect, nor could there have occurred a period when the publick mind could have been excited by any ſuch doctrines, if it had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly provoked by the indammatory, the ill judged, and the exaſperating doctrines of Mr. Burke. He it was who led the van in all this war of ſedition. Let us go back for a moment to this origin. When the people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſaw the deſpicable government of France demoliſhed— that government which had been the ſcourge of England— they rejoiced in the happineſs of ſo many millions. A rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erend divine, now no more, made it the ſubject of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the pulpit. A ſociety of gentlemen met to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate it, and Mr. Burke was rouſed by this into the fever of oppoſition. Though he repreſented them as an inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant body of obſcure individuals, he attacked the whole ſyſtem of England with ſuch bitterneſs of invective, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the moſt eſtabliſhed doctrines with ſuch vehemence of diſſent, that from that day till this the flame of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has not ceaſed to rage. What was the principle of this work? That the people of England had no right, no power, to change a tittle of their conſtitution; that it was an indiſſoluble compact, which at no time, on no ground, for no reaſon, could be broken: So that neither reaſon nor revelation, however they might point out to the people of England a better form of government, wiſer inſtitutes of peace, ſtronger baſes of liberty, they durſt not ſtrive to attain them. If it be ſo, for God's ſake, let policy and diſcretion ſtrive to conceal the afflicting truth, for it will ſurely lead to the convulſion which he affects to deprecate. Rather put Paine into the hands of every man, make the loweſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026280_0027_0FD01B779BE74F80"/>
ignorance acquainted with his doctrines, and chaſe away, if it be poſſible, the impreſſions which Mr. Burke has made. How different is the doctrine of truth and of peace! How different is the doctrine of the revolution! Look at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſay the friends of liberty, it is your own treaſure. Will you keep it as it is, or will you change it at the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of every theoriſt? Your own happineſs is at ſtake; but remember the happineſs that it has produced you. Will they not be likely to touch with awe a conſtitution which comes thus recommended to them by parental ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? and will they not protect it with parental authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Look now at the addreſs of Mr. Burke. Here is your conſtitution, which we have made for you, and for your poſterity forever. We buckle it on your backs, for you are beaſts of burden. You muſt not dare to touch it— you have entered into a compact which is indiſſoluble. Are ſuch doctrines the legitimate way of endearing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to the people? And I mention all this in order to ſhew you what the book of Mr. Paine is; for Paine's book is an anſwer to thoſe doctrines of Mr. Burke—doctrines more injurious than any that could be aſſerted by republicans and levellers!</p>
            <p>Mr. Erſkine then cited ſeveral of our moſt eminent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh writers, whoſe ſentiments are congenial with thoſe of Mr. Paine on the ſubject of government. He firſt quoted Mr. Paley on the Principles of Moral and Political Philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophy, page 426.</p>
            <p n="5">V. "No uſage, law, or authority whatever is ſo binding, that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be changed with advantage to the community. The family of the Prince, the order of ſucceſſion, the prerogative of the crown, the form and parts of the legiſlature, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſpective powers, office, duration, and mutual dependency of the ſeveral parts, are all only ſo many <hi>laws,</hi> mutable like other laws, whenever expediency requires, either by the ordinary act of the legiſlature, <hi>or, if the occaſion deſerve it, by the interpoſition of the people.</hi> Theſe points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe; they are repreſented to the mind as principles of the conſtitution ſettled by our anceſtors; and, being ſettled, to be no more committed to innovation or debate; as foundations never
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026280_0028_0FD01B79514C3CE8"/>
to be ſtirred; as the terms and conditions of the ſocial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, to which every citizen of the ſtate has engaged his fidelity, by virtue of a promiſe, which he cannot now recall. Such ſeaſons have no place in our ſyſtem! To us, if there be any good reaſon for treating theſe with more deference and reſpect than other laws, it is either the advantage of the preſent conſtitution of government (which reaſon muſt be of different force in different countries) or becauſe, in all countries, it is of importance, that the form and uſage of governing be acknowledged and underſtood, as well by the governors as the governed, and becauſe the ſeldomer it is changed, the more it will be reſpected by both ſides."</p>
            <p>Mr. Erſkine then introduced Hume's Hiſtory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, vol. II. p. 88.</p>
            <p>"It muſt be confeſſed that the former articles of the great character contain ſuch mitigations and explanations of the feodal law as are reaſonable and equitable; and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a loyal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and provide for the equal diſtribution of juſtice, and free enjoyment of property; the great object for which political ſociety was at firſt founded by men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor ſtatute, nor poſitive inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermoſt in their thoughts and attention."</p>
            <p>The next writer was the immortal Locke; and he cited the following paſſages from his Treatiſe on Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p. 268, 270, 309, 313.</p>
            <p>"<hi>All men, ſay they, are born under government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is born a ſubject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the perpetual tie of ſubjection and allegiance.</hi> It is plain mankind never owed nor conſidered any ſuch natural <hi>ſubjection that they were born in,</hi> to one or to the other, that tied them, without their own conſents, to a ſubjection to them and their heirs."</p>
            <p>"Thoſe who would perſuade us, that by <hi>being born under any government we are naturally ſubjects to it,</hi> and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have no other reaſon (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026280_0029_0FCF512478DF72C0"/>
becauſe our fathers or progenitors paſſed away their natural liberty, and thereby bound up themſelves and their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a perpetual ſubjection to the government which they themſelves ſubmitted to. It is true that whatever engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or promiſes any one has made for himſelf, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obligation of them, but <hi>cannot, by any compact what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, bind his children or poſterity;</hi> for his ſon, when a man, being altogether as free as the father, any <hi>act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the ſon,</hi> than it can of any body elſe."</p>
            <p>"And therefore they have a very wrong notion of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, who ſay, that the people have encroached upon the prerogative, when they have got any part of it to be defined by poſitive laws; for in ſo doing, they have not pulled from the prince any thing that of right belonged to him, but only declared that that power which they indefinitely left in his or his anceſtor's hands to be exerciſed for their good; was not a thing which they intended him when he uſed it otherwiſe; for the end of government being the good of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whatſoever alterations are made in it, tending to that end, cannot be an encroachment upon any body, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body in government can have a right tending to any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end: And thoſe only are encroachments which prejudice or hinder the publick good. Thoſe who ſay otherwiſe, ſpeak as if the prince had a diſtinct and ſeparate intereſt from the good of the community, and was not made for it; the root and ſource from which ſpring almoſt all thoſe evils and diſorders which happen in Kingly governments. And indeed, if that be ſo, the people under his government are not a ſociety of rational creatures, entered into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity for their mutual good; they are not ſuch as have ſet rulers over themſelves, to guard and promote that good; but are to be looked on as an herd of inferiour creatures, under the dominion of a maſter, who keeps them and works them for his own pleaſure or profit. If men were ſo void of reaſon, and brutiſh, as to enter into ſociety upon ſuch terms, prerogative might indeed be, what ſome men have would it, an arbitary power to do things hurtful to the people.</p>
            <p>"And, therefore, though the people cannot be judge, ſo as to have, by the conſtitution of that ſociety, any ſuperiour
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026280_0030_0FD01B7CD1A2C540"/>
power, to determine and give effective ſentence in the caſe; yet they have, by a law antecedent and paramount to all poſitive laws of men, reſerved that ultimate determination to themſelves which belongs to all mankind; God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never allowing a man ſo to abandon himſelf, as to neglect his own preſervation; and ſince he cannot take away his own life, neither can he give another power to take it. Nor let any one think this lays a perpetual foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for diſorder; for this operates not till the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency is ſo great, that the majority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a neceſſity to have it amended. But this the executive power or wiſe princes never need come in the danger of; and it is the thing, of all others, they have moſt need to avoid, as of all others the moſt perilous."</p>
            <p>"Whenſoever, therefore, the legiſlative ſhall tranſgreſs this fundamental will of ſociety, and either by ambition, fear, folly, or corruption, endeavour to graſp themſelves, or put into the hands of any other, an abſolute power over the lives, liberties, and eſtates of the people; by this breach of truth they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to reſume their original liberty, and, by the eſtabliſhment of a new legiſlative, (ſuch as they ſhall think fit) provide for their own ſafety and ſecurity, which is the end for which they are in ſociety. What I have ſaid here, concerning the legiſlative in general, holds true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſupreme executor, who, having a double truſt put in him, both to have a part in the legiſlative, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme execution of the law, acts againſt both, when he goes about to ſet up his own arbitary will as the law of the ſociety. He acts alſo contrary to his truſt, when he either employs the force, treaſure, and officers of the ſociety, to corrupt the repreſentatives, and gain them to his purpoſes; or openly preengages the electors, and preſcribes to their choice ſuch, whom he has by ſolicitations, threats, promiſes, or otherwise, won to his deſigns; and employs them to bring in ſuch, who have promiſed beforehand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate candidates and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and new model the ways of election, what is it but to cut up the government by the roots, and poiſon the very fountain of publick ſecurity? For the people having reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026280_0031_0FCF51284D381820"/>
to themſelves the choice of their repreſentatives, as the fence to their properties, could do it for no other end, but that they may always be freely choſen, and ſo choſen, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act and adviſe, as the neceſſity of the commonwealth, and the publick good, ſhould, upon examination, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture debate, be judged to require. This thoſe who give their votes before they hear the debate, and have weighed the reaſons on all ſides, are not capable of doing. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſuch an aſſembly as this, and endeavour to ſet up the declared abettors of his own will, for the true repreſentatives of the people, and the law makers of the ſociety, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as great a breach of truſt, and as perfect a declaration of a deſign to ſubvert the government, as is poſſible to be met with. To which, if one ſhall add rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, viſibly employed to the ſame end, and all the arts of perverted law made uſe of to take off and deſtroy all that ſtand in the way of ſuch a deſign, and will not comply and conſent to betray the liberties of their country, it will be paſt doubt what is doing. What power they ought to have in the ſociety, who thus employ it contrary to the truſt which went along with it in its firſt inſtitution, it is eaſy to determine; and one cannot but ſee, that he who has once attempted any ſuch thing as this, cannot any longer be truſted."</p>
            <p>"But it will be ſaid, this hypotheſis lays a ferment for frequent rebellion. To which I anſwer—</p>
            <p>"Firſt, no more than any other hypotheſis: For when the people are made miſerable, and find themſelves expoſed to the ill uſage of arbitrary power, cry up their governors as much as you will, for ſons of Jupiter; let them be ſacred and divine, deſcended or authorised from heaven; give them out for whom or what you pleaſe—the ſame will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. The people generally ill treated, and contrary to right, will be ready upon any occaſion to eaſe themſelves of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that ſits heavy upon them. They will wiſh and ſeek for the opportunity, which in the change, weakneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of human affairs, ſeldom delays long to offer it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He muſt have lived but a little while in the world, who has not ſeen examples of this in his time; and he muſt have read very little, who cannot produce examples of it in all ſorts of government in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:026280_0032_0FD01B81AFAA3988"/>"Secondly, I anſwer ſuch revolutions happen not upon every little miſmanagement in publick affairs. Great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, and all the ſlips of human frailty, will be borne by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without mutiny or murmur. If a long train of abuſes, prevarications and artifices, all tending the ſame way, make the deſign viſible to the people, and they cannot but feel what they lie under, and ſee whither they are going; it is not to be wondered at, that they ſhould then rouſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and endeavour to put the rule into ſuch hands as may ſecure to them the ends for which government was at firſt erected; and without which, ancient names, and ſpecious forms are ſo far from being better, that they are much worſe, than the ſtate of nature, or pure anarchy; the inconveniences being all as great, and as near, but the remedy farther off, and more difficult.</p>
            <p>"Thirdly, I anſwer, that this doctrine of a power in the people of providing for their ſafety anew, by a new legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when their legiſlators have acted contrary to their truſt, by invading their property, is the beſt fence againſt rebellion, and the probableſt means to hinder it; for rebellion being an oppoſition, not to perſons, but authority, which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in the conſtitutions and laws of the government; thoſe, whoever they be, who by force break through, and by force juſtify their violation of them, are truly and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly rebels: For when men, by entering into ſociety and civil government, have excluded force, and introduced laws for the preſervation of property, peace and unity amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thoſe who ſet up force again in oppoſition to the laws, do <hi>rebellare,</hi> that is, bring back again the ſtate of war, and are properly rebels; which they who are in power, (by the pretence they have to authority, the temptation of force they have in their hands, and the flattery of thoſe about them) being likelieſt to do; the propereſt way to prevent the evil, is to ſhew them the danger and injuſtice of it, who are under the greateſt temptation to run into it.</p>
            <p>"Nor let any one ſay, that miſchief can ariſe from hence, as often as it ſhall pleaſe a bufy head or turbulent ſpirit to deſire the alteration of the government. It is true, ſuch men may ſtir whenever they pleaſe, but it will be only to their own juſt ruin and perdition; for, until the miſchief be

grown general, and the ill deſigns of the rulers become viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or their attempts ſenſible to the greater part—the people, who are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, than right themſelves by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, are not apt to ſtir. The examples of particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, or oppreſſion of here aod there an unfortunate man, moves them not. But if they univerſally have a perſuaſion grounded upon manifeſt evidence, that deſigns are carrying on againſt their liberties, and the general courſe and tendency of things cannot but give them ſtrong ſuſpicions of the evil inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their governours, who is to be blamed for it? Who can help it, if they who might avoid it, bring themſelves into this ſuſpicion? Are the people to be blamed, if they have the ſenſe of rational creatures, and can think of things no otherwiſe than as they find and feel them? And is it not rather their fault who put things into ſuch a poſture, that they would not have them thought to be as they are? I grant that the pride, ambition, and turbulency of private men, have ſometimes cauſed great diſorders commonwealths, and factions have been fatal to ſtates and kingdoms. But whether the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief hath oftener begun in the people's wantonneſs, and a deſire to caſt off the lawful authority of their rulers, or in the rulers' inſolence, and endeavours to get and exerciſe an arbitrary power over their people; whether oppreſſion or diſobedience gave the firſt riſe to the diſorder, I leave it to impartial hiſtory to determine."</p>
            <p>Mr. Burke's letter to the ſheriffs of Briſtol was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and Mr. Erſkine read the following paſſages from p. 55, 57, 58.</p>
            <p>"If there be one fact in the world perfectly clear, it is this, 'that the diſpoſition of the people of America is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly averſe to any other than a free government;31y' and this is indication enough to any honeſt ſtateſman, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands, to their caſe. If any aſk me what a free government is, I anſwer, that, for any practical purpoſe, it is what the people think ſo; and that they, and not I, are the natural, lawful, and competent judges of this matter. If they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is conſiſtent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for ſo great a truſt and not to endeavour to prove from thence that they have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

by analogy they muſt hereafter have no enjoyment but my pleaſure.</p>
            <p>"Civil freedom, gentlemen, is not, as many have endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to perſuade you, a thing that lies hid in the depth of abſtruſe ſcience; but it is a bleſſing, and a benefit, not an abſtract ſpeculation; and all the juſt reaſoning that can be upon it, is of ſo coarſe a texture, as perfectly to ſuit the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary capacities of thoſe who are to enjoy and to defend it.</p>
            <p>"For liberty is a good to be improved, and not an evil to be leſſened. It is not only a private bleſſing of the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the vital ſpring and energy of the ſtate itſelf, which has juſt ſo much life and vigour as there is liberty in it. But whether liberty be advantageous or not, (for I know it is a faſhion to decry the very principle) none will diſpute that peace is a bleſſing; and peace muſt, in the courſe of human affairs, be frequently bought by ſome indulgence and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at leaſt of liberty. For as the Sabbath (though of divine inſtitution) was made for man, not man for the Sabbath, government, which can claim no higher origin or authority, in its exerciſe at leaſt, ought to conform to the exigencies of the times, and the temper and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the people with whom it is concerned, and not always to attempt, violently, to bend the people to their the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories of ſubjection. The bulk of mankind, on their part, are not exceſſively curious concerning any theories, while they are really happy; and one ſure ſymptom of an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted ſtate, is the propenſity of the people to reſort to them."</p>
            <p>Do not let us be raſh, gentlemen, in deciding upon this great queſtion. Before we condemn this author by bell, book, and candle, let us reflect a little on the progreſs of the principles of freedom. It is but one year ago, that I could have an opportunity of addreſſing to you ſuch an argument. Gentlemen, your authority to judge of a libel is but a year old. It is but ſeven or eight years ago, when I ſtood upon a queſtion like the preſent, upon very different grounds; when I had leſs to ſupport me againſt the embarraſſments with which I was ſurrounded in the preſence of an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened profeſſion, and holding a doctrine that was ſcouted. The Earl of Mansfield, who, though he could not treat me with unkindneſs, for it was not in his nature, laughed at me
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026280_0035_0FD01B8732A827A8"/>
as you laugh at the prattle of a child; and I was deſired to go to ſchool with my new fangled doctrines, to learn the law of the land. Here is an argument againſt raſhneſs. I have lived to ſee the parliament of England unanimouſly declare that I was in the right. Knowing, then, that it has been by ſlow and gradual degrees, that the conſtitution of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has grown to what it is, for God's ſake let us be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to ſtifle the voice of reaſon by a raſh and haſty deciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. If Mr. Burke's doctrine be right, no opinions upon government can be publiſhed, for the people have no juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. If the people have not the power to alter and amend, advice is not merely impertinent, it is dangerous. A juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to be competent, muſt have power; and when, therefore, he aſſerts that the people of this country are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and forever deprived of the power of changing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, he pronounces a prohibition upon all reaſoning, upon all opinion, upon all diſcuſſion. What has been the courſe of man? That he has been led by awful authorities, ſtep by ſtep, from his ſavage ſtate in the woods, to our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bleſſed condition of light, of knowledge, and of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We ſhould ſtill be ſavages, we ſhould yet be in the woods, if this prohibition had exiſted; and to what muſt we return, if every man is to be condemned, who ſhall now promulgate the opinions that he entertains upon the nature of government?</p>
            <p>Of all the attainments of a people, the liberty of the preſs has been uniformly the laſt—Uniformly deſpotiſm has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the propagation of truth. All other conceſſions pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has been willing to make, but againſt the truths of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—againſt the light of knowledge, it has maintained an eternal war. Let us recollect the courſe of the world, the univerſal God of nature, the Saviour of mankind, the fountain of all light, who came to ſave man from eternal darkneſs, expired on a croſs—the object of infidel ſcorn— of impious incredulity, becauſe they raſhly oppoſed the meek and mild propagation of the truths that were to point to peace and happineſs in the world. His bleſſed followers fell victims to the ſame horrid ſpirit. The Saviour might have come, inveſted with eternal power, and compelled the inſtantaneous acceptance of his doctrines: But he came to confound the pride of worldly power. He came clothed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026280_0036_0FCF512D278927A0"/>
in meekneſs, in benevolence, in humility, and he preached his conſolations to the poor; in this way did political pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continue to exerciſe its tyranny, until religion had ariſen to ſuch a ſtandard as to make it formidable; and then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical power took eccleſiaſtical power into partnerſhip, when they exerted their combined efforts at once againſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the conſcience of man. Thus, upon the revival of letters, was ſuperſtition made the inſtrument of political tyranny; but at length the inquiſitive ſpirit of Engliſhmen burſt the chains, and the liberty of the preſs had its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It was free until, (in 1637) the Star Chamber was erected—Mark the conſequence! the people ſuffered under reſtraint indeed; but in eleven years Charles I. periſhed on a ſcaffold. Gentlemen, the human mind cannot live under reſtraint. Let men communicate their thoughts with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and their indignation fly off like a fire ſpread on the ſurface; like gunpowder ſcattered they kindle, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; but the exploſion is neither loud nor dangerous: Keep them under reſtraint, it is a ſubterraneous fire, whoſe agitation is unſeen until it burſts into earthquake or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano. Such was the whole effect of the reſtraints in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Cromwell ſuffered almoſt all his misfortunes from this cauſe; and the vigour of his government could not ſave it againſt the conſequences of his attack on the liberty of the preſs The reſtraint continued under Charles II. and the emotions that it produced, happily for England and for man, ended in the revolution. All the licenſes were done away, the preſs was made free, and the conſtitution has already endured a century. Thus, gentlemen, our gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment has been ſafe in proportion to the freedom of writing.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. Erſkine produced ſome of the fineſt author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of England. The glorious Milton led the van: His memorable paſſage, that in former times the iſſue of the brain was no more ſtifled than the iſſue of the womb, and his fine illuſtration of the conſequences of ſuppreſſing truth, in the fate of Galileo, were dexterouſly uſed by Mr. Erſkine. He periſhed in a priſon, becauſe he ventured to think, from obſerving the phraſes of Venus, that the ſun was that centre of our ſyſtem, and yet, ſaid he, we know that the ſun is in that centre, and by our knowledge, we are enabled to puſh our navigation to the extreme limits of the

world, and, by line and rule, to make our way through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions the moſt unknown.</p>
            <p>He then cited the following paſſage from Milton's Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagatica, p. 58.</p>
            <p>"If it be deſired to know the immediate cauſe of all this free writing, and free ſpeaking, there cannot be aſſigned a truer than your own mild, and free, and humane govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is the liberty, Lords and Commons, which your own valorous and happy counſels have purchaſed us; lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, which is the nurſe of all great wits; this is that which hath ratified and enlightened our ſpirits like the influence of heaven; this is that which hath enfranchiſed, enlarged, and lifted up our apprehenſions degrees above themſelves. Ye cannot make us now leſs capable, leſs knowing, leſs eagerly purſuing of the truth, unleſs ye firſt make yourſelves, that made us ſo, leſs the lovers, leſs the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ignorant again, brutiſh, formal, and ſlaviſh, as ye found us; but you then muſt firſt become that which ye cannot be, oppreſſive, arbitrary, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as they were from whom ye have freed us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts now more erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſearch and expectation of the greateſt and exacteſt things, is the iſſue of your own virtue propagated in us; ye cannot ſuppreſs that, unleſs ye reinforce an abrogated and mercileſs law, that fathers may diſpatch at will their own children.

The temple of Janus, with his two controverſial faces, might now not inſignificantly be ſet open; and although all the winds of doctrine were let looſe to play upon the earth, ſo truth be in the field, we do injurious by licenſing and prohibiting to miſdoubt her ſtrength—let her and falſehood grapple; whoever knew truth put to the worſe in a free and open en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter? her confuting is the beſt and ſureſt ſuppreſſing. When a man hath been labouring the hardeſt labour in the deep mines of knowledge; hath furniſhed out his findings in all their equipage; drawn forth his reaſon as it were a battle ranged; ſcattered and defeated all objections in his way; calls out his adverſary into the plain; offers him all the advantage of wind and ſea, if he pleaſe, that he may try the matter by dint of argument—for his opponents then to ſculk, to lay ambuſhments, to keep a narrow bridge of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing where the challenger ſhould paſs, though it be val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our enough in ſoldierſhip, is but weakneſs and cowardice in the wars of truth; for who knows not that truth, like the Almighty, is ſtrong; ſhe needs no policies nor ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems" (he might have added proſecutions) "to make her victorious."</p>
            <p>There is ſuch a connexion between licentiouſneſs and liberty, that it is not eaſy to correct the one, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounding the other; it is extremely hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the true limit between them: Like a changeable ſilk, we can eaſily ſee there are two different colours, but we cannot eaſily diſcover where the one ends, or where the other begins.</p>
            <p>The Attorney General had given no principles to draw the line by which we were to know where the liberty of the preſs ended, and the licentiouſneſs began. He applied lord Loughborough's memorable obſervation of the application. "To your tents, O Iſrael," as a pregnant inſtance of what would be ſeditious. Earl Stanhope had, with great ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ridiculed this ſort of liberty of the preſs, which was to be all on one ſide—a liberty to praiſe miniſters. This is a ſort of liberty that even the empreſs of Ruſſia would give you, and it may be called the Ruſſian liberty of the preſs. To make the work of the author appear ſeditious, the doctrine
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026280_0039_0FD01B927502E088"/>
of lord Loughborough muſt be proved. It muſt be ſhewn that his doctrine was coupled with circumſtances, or with expreſſions, tending dearly to provoke tumult; ſuch as, "We ſhall ſee how this will work—this will bring on a new revolution—we ſhall have French inſurrections." But, ſaid Mr. Erſkine, no ſuch thing: If one ſuch expreſſion had been proved, I would have thrown up my brief—as they are not, I ſtand up to give him the benefits of a fair trial, and I am not to be ſlandered with the charge of diſaffection for exerciſing my faculties in his defence. When my lord and I were engaged together as counſel for lord George Gordon, as well might we have been ſuſpected of favouring tumult and diſorder, as that I now ſhould be of ſedition and diſaffection.</p>
            <p>Mr. Erſkine then cited a paſſage from lord Stanhope's Rights of Juries Defended, as follows, page 142, 143, 144.</p>
            <p>"The thing that is illegal, <hi>is the exciting any one to ſedition, or to a breach of the peace.</hi> The queſtion, therefore, upon a libel is, whether the paper publiſhed <hi>did thus excite and was ſo intended.</hi> Conſequently mere <hi>ſpeculative</hi> writings on the <hi>conſtitution</hi> are <hi>not libels,</hi> however <hi>abſurd</hi> they may be. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for inſtance, that a man were to write a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> work, to prove that a trial by a ſingle judge would be far preferable to the trial by jury; or that a parliament, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed only of a king, and houſe of peers, would be beyond compariſon better than a legiſlature of king, lords, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. No man could poſſibly reprobate ſuch a work more than I ſhould: but if the work did not excite the people to ſedition, ſuch a <hi>ſpeculative publication</hi> could certainly never be deemed a <hi>libel;</hi> for <hi>abſurdity</hi> is no part of the <hi>definition of a libel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"If our <hi>boaſted</hi> liberty of the preſs were to conſiſt only in the liberty to write <hi>in praiſe</hi> of the conſtitution, <hi>that</hi> is a lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty enjoyed under many an <hi>arbitrary</hi> government, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it would not be deemed quite an <hi>unpardonable</hi> offence, even by the <hi>empreſs of Ruſſia,</hi> if any man were to take it into his head to write a panegyric upon the <hi>Ruſſian farm of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</hi> Such a liberty as <hi>that</hi> might therefore properly be termed the <hi>Ruſſian liberty of the preſs.</hi> But the <hi>Engliſh liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the pres;s</hi> is of a very different deſcription; for, by the law of England, it is <hi>not</hi> prohibited to publiſh <hi>ſpeculative</hi> works upon the conſtitution, whether they contain praiſe or cenſure."</p>

            <p>Mr. Erſkine came now to examine the paſſages ſet forth in the information. We have already gone at ſo much, length into his general argument, as to be unable to follow him in the ingenuity of his obſervations on his extract. As to the firſt, that all hereditary government was a tyranny, he deſired the Jury to look at the context. I deny, ſays Paine, that hereditary monarchy is the conſtitution. He does not inherit us like flocks, for the people may confer it; they have conferred it. This is his argument. The ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond was an extraordinary ſelection—it would be no attack upon the revolution, if it had been accompliſhed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Do we love the reformation leſs for being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by one of the moſt profligate of our kings? No mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the revolution was brought about by intrigue; that it was the work of a coalition. It is not by whom, but what it is, that the people will inquire. He contended, that the people had, by the freedom of opinion, obtained every thing from Magna Charta downwards. The third quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we had hardly any law in England, was no libel; for he did not arraign the adminiſtration of law, and many of our beſt writers had aſſerted, that there was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, much difficulty, much to be mended in our juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence. With regard to the paſſages on the two houſes of parliament, it was ſtrange that Mr. Burke ſhould accuſe him; he who had ſo ſeverely, ſo outrageouſly impeached both houſes in their turn: And here he quoted ſome of the memorable paſſages of Mr. Burke, of the lords' voting themſelves uſeleſs, and of an addreſſing houſe of commons, when there was a petitioning people. He quoted alſo the memorable proclamation of Mr. Pitt and the duke of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, from the thatched houſe tavern. On the celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſage of Mr. Burke, that kings were naturally fond of low company, and that lords were only low buffoons, he
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026280_0041_0FD01B956F082170"/>
made a ſevere comment. It was a ſcandalous aſperſion on the king, and on the nobility; but theſe aſſociators might write, though they would ſuffer no one to write but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and yet, forſooth, theſe aſſociators called themſelves lawyers, though ſo ignorant of the character and delicacy or the law, as to propagate every ſpecies of prejudice againſt this man, and to create ſuch a hue and cry againſt him, that if he had been ſtained with blood inſtead of ink—if he had been degraded by the crimes that make humanity abhorrent, ought not to have been raiſed againſt him in the moment of his trial—ſuch a clamour, that even he was almoſt beat down and abaſhed by the roar. Even in the houſe of parliament he was ſtigmatized by name, but he delivered his opinion with the ſpirit of independence that became a profeſſional man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to ſhrink from his duty, whatever might be the hazard. Theſe aſſociators had, with equal ignorance, ſaid, that the great Harrington was as great a thief, and as obſcure a ruffian, even as Paine. Who was Harrington? It might have ſatisfied them to have read his pedigree; he was deſcended from eight dukes, three marquiſſes, ſeventy earls, twenty ſeven viſcounts, and thirty ſix barons, of which number ſixteen were knights of the garter. Will not this do, ſaid Mr. Erſkine, even for this time? In a court of Germany it would be deciſive; but what was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his deſcent was his conduct. He was the faithful ſervant of his maſter Charles; he was a man of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted honour, that he avowed his republican principles, yet retained the confidence and affection of his maſter. I know not," ſays Toland, "which moſt to commend, the king for truſting an honeſt man, though of republican prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or Harrington for owning his principles while he ſerved a king." How did he ſerve him? He ſtaid in the Iſle of Wight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to watch the fortune of his royal maſter; he came up by ſtealth, concealed in the boot of a coach, to take his laſt farewell of him; he fell into his arms, and fainted at his feet on the ſcaffold. After Charles's death, he wrote the famous Oceana, and in the work pays a tribute of truth to the virtues of his unfortunate ſovereign, and aſcribes his misfortunes to the feeble nature of a monarchy. Mr. Erſkine ſtated the intereſting anecdote, by which he recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered his Oceana from the gripe of Cromwell. He applied
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026280_0042_0FD01B97280E0358"/>
to his favourite daughter, and ſeeing her infant at her ſide he ſnatched it up in his arms, and ran away. Alarmed for its fate, the mother followed him. "I have ſeized your child," ſaid Harrington, "your father has ſeized mine. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to you your child—ſupplicate your father to reſtore my child." The daughter ſupplicated, and Cromwell yielded. If my government," ſaid Cromwell, "be made to ſtand, it will not be battered down by paper ſhot." After various other quotations from Monteſquieu, Milton, and other claſſicks, he made a warm and affecting conclusion. "Do not think that Engliſhmen are to be bent to your purpoſe by this forward courſe."</p>
            <q>
               <l>Be to their faults a little blind—</l>
               <l>Be to their virtues very kind—</l>
               <l>Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd,</l>
               <l>And clap your padlock on the mind."</l>
            </q>
            <p>Engage them by their affections—convince their reaſon, and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty ſincere, vigorous, or rational—a conviction that it is their trueſt intereſt, and that their form of government is for their common good. Conſtraint is the natural parent of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and this is no new doctrine. In all times where one ſide has been tyrannical, the other has been refractory. You muſt all remember, gentlemen, Lucian's pleaſant ſtory— Jupiter and a countryman were walking together, converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great freedom and familiarity upon the ſubjects of heaven and earth. The countryman liſtened with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and acquieſcence, while Jupiter ſtrove only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him; but happening to hint a doubt, Jupiter turned haſtily round, and threatened him with his thunder. "Ah! ah!" ſaid the countryman, "now, Jupiter, I know that you are wrong; you are always wrong, when you appeal to your thunder."</p>
            <p>The Attorney General roſe to reply; but Mr. Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, the Foreman of the Jury, ſaid he was inſtructed by his brother Jurors to ſay that he might ſave himſelf the trouble of any obſervations, unleſs he thought otherwiſe himſelf, for that they were ſatisfied. The Attorney General ſat down, and the Jury immediately gave a verdict of <hi>Guilty.</hi>
