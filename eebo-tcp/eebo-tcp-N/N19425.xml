            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FROM</hi> the time of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to the preſent, the ſubject of government has employed the pens of ſome of the firſt philoſophers of every age. Much is due to the labors of thoſe ſages, eſpecially to ſome of the Moderns. They have taught the world, that the ſcience of government does not conſiſt in an aſſumption of principles, merely arbitrary, or in the reveries of metaphyſics. And yet, I do not know, that any writer, ancient or modern, has attempted to analyze the ſocial nature of man, and from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thence reſulting, to derive the principles, which ought to be purſued in civil inſtitutions. It will, I believe, however, be readily perceiv'd, that this is the only certain ground of inveſtigation, the only mode, in which any general, conſiſtent, practicable principles in the ſcience of government can be eſtabliſhed. This mode of inveſtigation has been attempted in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſketches. How far I have ſucceeded, how far I have been able to diſcover any new principles, or more clearly to illuſtrate ſuch as had been already diſcovered, I ſubmit to the candor of the public.</p>
            <p>I have endeavored at the inveſtigation of natural principles, and to purſue truth wherever it led, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the weight of authority on the one hand, or a ſpirit of oppoſition on the other. I have ſeveral times, in the courſe of the following work, been induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to differ from the opinions of ſome writers of the firſt abilities and reputation. Though I have exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined theſe opinions with the freedom of philoſophical diſcuſſion, I have all along aimed to treat the writers with that decent reſpect, which they merit from every lover of ſcience.</p>

I have attempted only <hi>SKETCHES</hi> of the <hi>PRINCIPLES</hi> of <hi>GOVERNMENT.</hi> I have choſen this title, as moſt expreſſive of the limits of the deſign, as well as of the manner of execution.</p>

                  </note> of no ſmall note, that the firſt rude ſtate of ſociety, which, among civilized nations, is uſually denominated the ſavage ſtate, is the only natural ſtate of man; that, in this ſtate alone, he is capable of attaining the achme of perfection in virtue and happineſs. They have ſuppoſed, that, what are generally called ſocial improvements, ſerve only to deprave, and either inevitably generate a wicked diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in man, or, at leaſt, invigorate an original propenſity to vice, which lay dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, in what they ſo emphatically ſtile, the ſtate of nature. They have further ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that from this wicked diſpoſition, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come predominant, and from various claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſts, unknown in the ſtate of nature, ariſes a war of all againſt all; that civil laws and government are an invention of man, to reſtrain theſe evils. Hence they derive the neceſſity of government, ultimately, from the original or adventitious wickedneſs of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:025297_0013_0FCCF37F19180E98"/>Others have eſpouſed an opinion, that true virtue, genuine benevolence, in man, would, in every ſtage of ſociety, ſuperſede the neceſſity of municipal laws, and civil ſubordination. With the former, they hold, that wickedneſs, alone, has impoſed the neceſſity of civil governments. Both appear to imagine, that civil polity is not to be derived from the nature of man; but that it is a ſyſtem of rules, contrived to meet his wicked diſpoſition, and to reſtrain the violence of individuals, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of laws. According to them, it was not ſo much deſigned, by the author of our nature, to lead men to happineſs, in ſociety, as to prevent the miſery, which they are ever ready to inflict on each other; in ſhort, that man has a neceſſity for civil government, but not an adaptation of his nature to that ſtate.</p>
               <p>Some political writers, of great eminence, <note n="*" place="bottom">Locke, Beccaria, and many others.</note> have admitted, that man was originally deſigned for civil government, and that he is under a certain neceſſity of nature to adopt it. At the ſame time, they have maintained, that on entering into civil ſociety, he, of neceſſity, gives up a certain ſhare of his natural liberty, of his natural rights. By theſe expreſſions of natural liberty, and natural rights, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="15"
                      facs="unknown:025297_0014_0FCCF380B39959C0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
that liberty, and thoſe rights, to which man is entitled by the laws of his nature, as conſtituted by the Author of his being. This implies, that man, by the laws of his nature, is but partially ſitted for ſociety. Impelled, however, to adopt that ſtate, from a neceſſity, which is admitted to ariſe from ſome part of his nature, he ſacrifices a part of his natural rights, to ſecure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and even to acquire thoſe, to which, by the laws of his nature, he was not originally entitled.</p>
               <p>I propoſe, in the following SKETCHES, to enquire, How far MAN, by the laws of his nature, is fitted for ſociety and civil government—Whether his happineſs does not require ſocial improvement, and laws, which are the reſult of his whole nature, lead to civil government—Or whether he is compelled to adopt the latter, by a ſingle, and that a vicious principle in his nature, in oppoſition to others—Whether, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a phyſical and moral being, the laws of his nature have indulged him any liberty, which he may not enjoy under civil laws and government.</p>
               <p>The principal view in theſe enquiries, will be to endeavor to find the leading Principles of Government, in the laws of ſocial nature, and to trace them into exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, in the eſtabliſhment of civil inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:025297_0015_0FCCF382107F6B50"/>In the United States of America, political opinions, though conſidered as merely theoretical, cannot be wholly inconſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. In theſe States, government is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly, founded in the rights of man. It derives all its energy in the prevention of evil, all its efficacy in the production of happineſs, from the ſentiments of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The opinions entertained of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the neceſſity of laws, of the end to be attained by them, and the means of attaining that end, will have an influence on the ſentiments of the people, and the reaſonings of the legiſlator. They will, in ſome meaſure, form the features of the government, and give a complexion to its laws.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Of the ſenſe in which, Principle, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government, are uſed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Sketches.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEFORE I proceed to the ſubject pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, I ſhall take the liberty to premiſe a few obſervations on the uſe of theſe terms, as they occur frequently in the following work.—From Monteſquieu, the term <hi>principles,</hi> when applied to government, has
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025297_0016_0FCCF3851B511A60"/>
been uſed in a more appropriate ſenſe, than in other ſciences. In other ſciences, it always ſignifies ſomething fundamental, ſome leading rule, law, or maxim. Thus we ſpeak of the principles, on which any thing is conſtructed, as a watch. The term <hi>principles</hi> here, comprehends, not only the laws of mechanics, but thoſe rules, by which the relative proportions of the ſeveral parts are determined, to direct the motions to a certain end. Theſe are properly called the principles of conſtruction.</p>
               <p>There are alſo rules, by which the moving force is applied, and made to operate on the machine, with a view to the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Theſe we call the principles of operation.</p>
               <p>The term is frequently uſed to ſignify a mere paſſive power; that power, by which a ſubject is fitted to exhibit, in conſequence of the operation of particular agents upon it, certain effects, agreeably to certain laws. Thus we ſpeak of the principle of fluidity, the inflamable principle, the principle of malleability; and thus we ſay of man, that the principles of ſociety and government are implanted in his nature; by which we mean, that he is ſitted for that ſtate, or, at leaſt, that his nature requires it.</p>
               <p>In the ſcience of government, there are the principles of conſtruction, by which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025297_0017_0FCCF38695735D10"/>
government is conſtituted and organized— the operative principles, by which its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and efficiency are produced and directed —the paſſive principles—or the paſſive powers of man, to which the operative principles are adapted, to produce the end intended, obedience to the laws. The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and paſſive principles, in any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are determined by the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principles employed, or the nature of the conſtitution. They will, therefore, be different, according to the different conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of government. Theſe, which I have called the operative and paſſive prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Monteſquieu, with a view chiefly to the latter, has, by way of eminence, called the principles of government. He ſeems to be too fond of ſimplifying, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>The principles of a government are not capable of being perfectly ſimplified, much leſs of being reduced to a ſingle principle. Far from it, they are often very complex, and ſubject to a great variety of modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the admiſſion of different, and ſometimes oppoſite principles. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, however, in each kind of government, their general and predominant character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtics. The ſame may be ſaid of all the principles of government, as well as thoſe of Monteſquieu. He has defined the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025297_0018_0FCCF38841A036C8"/>
of government to be the human paſſions, which ſet it in motion. It would, perhaps, have been more accurate to have ſaid, that the human paſſions are the paſſive powers of man, by which he is prepared to be operated upon, and to be put in motion to various ends, and in various modes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the choice, application, and direction of the means, or of the operative principles.</p>
               <p>He has introduced three different prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which he tells us are peculiar to the three principal forms of government; the Deſpotic, Monarchical, and Republican. Fear, he tells us, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the principle of a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic government. This, in his ſenſe of the term, is undoubtedly juſt. The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of deſpotiſm, are a military force at the beck of the Sovereign, which, by the terror of puniſhments, or rather of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſecures obedience to his mandates. Inveterate habits of ſuperſtition, frequently, come in aid of the military force, and clothe the meſſenger of the Prince with the power of armies.</p>
               <p>Fear is that paſſion of human nature, to which the meaſures of this government are, principally, addreſſed, and without which the deſpot could procured obedience, only by the conſtant and preſent applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of force, in each particular caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:025297_0019_0FCCF38D36714180"/>Honor, he tells us, is the principle of a monarchy. This, taken in his own ſenſe, is very deficient. That paſſion of emu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a deſire of excellence, which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to man, and which, by cultivation, is capable of an infinity of directions, good and evil, is, with the higher orders in monarchy, modified into what is called the principle of honor. But its direct effect in ſecuring obedience to the ſovereign, is confined, principally, to thoſe orders. The multitude are under a complicated deſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm. The nobles, in conjunction with the military order, are the inſtruments em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to awe the people to obedience. Religion, transformed into a gloomy ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, is, uſually, employed to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>The principle of a Republic, or rather a Democratic Republic, he calls virtue.— We are liable to be miſſed by the uſe of this term, in a ſenſe ſo different from that, in which it is commonly received. He defines it to be a mere ſenſation, a faculty of the mind, a love of the laws and our country. In analogy to his other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I have ventured to call it a ſentiment of attachment to the community, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and laws. I will not take upon me to ſay, that this is altogether juſt, or that it is ſufficiently comprehenſive. It
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025297_0020_0FCCF38E1AFE2FD0"/>
is, however, juſt to the principal purpoſe, for which it is intended. In a democratic republic, the law is, or ought to be, an expreſſion of the will of the ſociety, being the aggregate of the individual wills. Now, if the will of the aggregate coincide pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, in all caſes, with each individual will, an obſervance of the law muſt be as neceſſary as the power of willing. But this, perhaps, can, in no inſtance, be the caſe. The will of the whole, that is the law, is the reſult of mutual conceſſions, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe of the individual wills. Hence a neceſſity, not only of a general approbation of the reſult, but an attachment to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of the community, as conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under government and laws, to ſecure the obedience of each individual member. In this kind of government, no force can be applied, in the execution of the laws, but what depends on this principle. It cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is no more entitled to be called vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than any of the ſocial paſſions common to man; but it has this preeminence over the other principles mentioned above, that it is, when rightly informed, perfectly in harmony with all the moral and ſocial vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and is beſt promoted by them.</p>
               <p>In the following Sketches, the term <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Principles of Government,</hi> is ſometimes uſed in the appropriate ſenſe

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Of the firſt rude ſtate—Whether this is to <hi>MAN</hi> the ſcene of virtue and happineſs, in preference to a ſtate of improvement.</head>
               <p>THAT the ſavage ſtate is a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to man, cannot, with truth, be denied. There is not, at this day, a people on earth, who may not trace their origin to a race of ſavages; ſome, indeed, more, and ſome leſs rude. The Jews, as the writings of Moſes and their ſubſequent hiſtorians prove, are far from being an exception. The queſtion is not, whether a rude, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed ſtate, be ever a natural ſtate to man; but whether, in the original conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his nature, he is ſo formed for happineſs in this ſtate, as to exclude any general benefit to be derived from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive improvement. We are at a loſs
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025297_0022_0FCCF39266AA4120"/>
at what period, in the progreſs of ſociety, to fix the preciſe ſtate of nature which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Shall we go back to the rude ſtate of the inhabitants of New-Holland, who have learnt to draw no part of their ſubſiſtence from the earth, by cultivation? Or ſhall we chuſe the ſtill more rude ſtate of the inhabitants of Terra-del-Fugo, whoſe ſole dependence for food is on the ſhell fiſh found in the ſands, at the ebb of the tide? Neither of whom have any notion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, or the rights of property, beyond the circle of their ſeveral tribes.—Shall we make a little farther advance, and place it among the ſavages of North-America? They are ſimple, they are honeſt, as far as the circle of their ſeveral tribes. They take their food from the river or the foreſt, furniſhed by the hand of nature. The little deficiencies are ſupplied from the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of the earth. The ſkins of the chace furniſh them with coarſe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable clothes, or are exchanged for the product of European looms. They are not goaded by ambition, to attempt the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of power, which, when acquired, has generally proved the ſcourge of the human race. They are content, or reſigned to the preſent, and are little anxious about the future. All this is true of the North-American natives, and yet it gives us hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025297_0023_0FCCF393C4269B58"/>
a glimpſe of their character. The ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of America, like other men, have their predominant paſſions. They eſteem war and hunting almoſt the only purſuits worthy of a man. Addreſs in theſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes their higheſt point of honor. Every other labor of life is relegated to their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are little better than ſlaves. Hence they derive an exceſſive ferocity of manners. Their reſentment is keen, and revenge their moſt darling gratification. This ariſes from their ſtate of ſociety, in which every man is left to judge in his own cauſe, and to avenge his own wrongs. As they never forget a favor, ſo they never forgive an injury.</p>
               <p>Among their different tribes, the injuries of an individual are reſented as national. The poſſeſſion of a hunting ground is, to them, the poſſeſſion of an empire. Theſe are ſources of frequent wars, waged with the moſt ſavage ferocity. The butchering and ſcalping of old men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the torturing and burning of priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in cold blood, with the moſt ſhocking circumſtances of cruelty, are among their paſtimes. Theſe are not ſecret acts of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. They are by none conſidered as wrong. They are public tranſactions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, under what is, to them, the law of nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:025297_0024_0FCCF394D281A7D8"/>As they are not anxious about the future, they are, for the ſame reaſon, almoſt wholly improvident. When not engaged in their favorite purſuits of war, or hunting, they are too indolent to think of making an adequate proviſion againſt the inclemency of the ſeaſon, or, indeed, againſt any future want. As they have fewer vices, ſo they have fewer virtues than more civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and both are more prominent, more diſtinctly marked. This ariſes from the paucity of the objects, with which they are converſant. With them, numerous paſſions, correcting and reſtraining each other, are not, as in a ſtate of civilization, equally excited by a multiplicity of objects. When any object rouſes their attention, the whole force of the mind, the whole vigor of the ſoul, is collected, and exerted upon one point.</p>
               <p>Hoſpitality is a virtue, almoſt peculiar to a ſavage people, and the ſineſt trait in their character. When we contemplate this virtue, among ſuch a people, it ſtrikes the mind with all the advantage of vivid ſentiment, ſingularity of impreſſion, and contraſt of manners. Every recollection is accompanied with an enthuſiaſtic admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that makes us regret the loſs of thoſe manners, which were alone capable of this ſublime virtue. Will it ſtill be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025297_0025_0FCCF39665080E88"/>
thought ſtrange to aſſert, that this virtue derives its origin, and takes its principal luſtre from the barbarous manners of the age? And yet ſo is the fact. It does not, however, conſiſt with the rudeſt ſtate of ſociety and of manners. Some advance in civilization, ſome progreſs in the arts of life, is neceſſary to give a reliſh for hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, and to ſupply the means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging it. Among a people in the hunter ſtate, it makes but little figure. Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the fortune of the chaſe, or the gleanings of the foreſt, they find but a ſcanty, and precarious ſubſiſtence. With neither the foreſight, nor the means, of making a ſecure proviſion for the future, they are frequently in want of neceſſary ſuſtenance. Among ſuch a people, the preſſing demands of nature leave little of their ſcanty ſtores for the uſes of hoſpitality. They have little curioſity, and no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any knowlege, which can be of uſe, beyond that of forming the bow, or ſome inſtrument of the chace. In this ſituation, what can, with them, compenſate for an additional tax upon their already half famiſhed appetites? The North-American natives have never been equally noted for the practice of this virtue, with the ancient Germans, or the more ancient inhabitants of Greece. They draw but a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025297_0026_0FCCF3984732DD70"/>
ſmall ſhare of their ſubſiſtence from the earth. All the care of their tillage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in that of maize, beans, and ſome few edible roots, is left to the women. The labor of theſe, ſpared from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the men in the chace, and other drudgeries of a domeſtic nature, without the aſſiſtance of domeſtic animals, and with ſuch rude implements as they can either form or procure, muſt yield a very ſcanty ſupply, for one part of the year; the other is, for the moſt part, as ſcantily ſupplied, by the fortune of the chace. They appear to have little reliſh for any new arts of life, unleſs they have ſome relation to their principal occupations of war and hunting; and very little curioſity for any information to be derived from an intercourſe with ſtrangers. Inſtances, however, are not wanting, in which they have diſcovered all that fidelity to their gueſts, all that warmth of attachment, which gives ſuch a charm to the patriarchal times. Although the inſtances are leſs frequent, they bear the ſame genuine character of heroic integrity.</p>
               <p>The ſhepherd ſtate ſecures a more ready and abundant ſupply of food and domeſtic conveniences. Men more at eaſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation begins to acquire a charm. More arts become neceſſary. The uſeful, and convenient engage the attention. New
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025297_0027_0FCCF3994FC8E8A8"/>
objects afford gratification to an awakened curioſity. Still they are generally divided into ſmall tribes. Their domeſtic manners are ſincere, but rough. To foreigneſs they are fierce, cruel, and faithleſs. So univerſal is the ſtate of war among ſuch a people, that in almoſt every language, the ſame word, originally, ſignified both foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and enemy. Diſputed boundaries are often the occaſion of wars. They are often waged to avenge a private quarrel. To ſurpriſe and plunder the neighboring tribes of their herds, is the principal object of their hoſtile enterpriſes. Their whole hiſtory is a continued ſcene of war, pillage, and repriſal. So frequent were theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory expeditions among the petty tribes of ancient Greece, that they were early honored with a particular appellation. <note n="*" place="bottom">

Theſe are, uſually, bulky, and unfit to attend the perſon of the owner, to anſwer his occaſions in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling; nor could they attend him, with any degree of ſecurity, among a people, who reckon the plundering of foreigners a lawful mean of acquiſition. Inns for the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025297_0028_0FCCF39AD55EB7E8"/>
accommodation of travellers are unknown. Were it not for the hoſpitality of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, there could be no paſſing from one country to another. There is ſomething in the practice very congenial to the frank, rough, and generous manners of a rude people. Their generoſity, however, in this favorite inſtance, riſes, as it were, through a cloud. We find by Homer, that ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, uſually, applied to their intended hoſts, in the poſture of ſuppliants, and intreated the rights of hoſpitality, as for their lives. His inſtances may, indeed, be conſidered as poetic fictions; but they were, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, relative to the manner of the age. To grant the rights of hoſpitality, was, to grant protection. The hoſt, or patron, was conſidered as the protector of his gueſt. This office ſuited with a martial ſpirit. It gave the hoſt conſequence in his own eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and in the eſtimation of others. The practice of this virtue, among rude nations, affords not only a gratification to curioſity, but an opportunity of indulging in the exerciſe of humanity to a ſtranger, without incuring the imputation of a want of attachment to the tribe. The advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are national and reciprocal. In no other way can they acquire a knowlege of foreign nations, their arts and manners. Like the ſafety of heralds, it paſſes into
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025297_0029_0FCCF39E5D4944C8"/>
their law of nations. In ancient writers, we frequently read of the rights of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, of the laws of hoſpitality, and of wars to avenge the violations of thoſe rights. Indeed, it is rather to be conſidered as a national, than a private virtue. In the preſent ſtate of improvement, among civilized nations, almoſt every reaſon, which concurred, among ſavages, to the eſtabliſhment of hoſpitality, has ceaſed, and the practice has ceaſed of courſe. The arts of writing and printing have furniſhed almoſt innumerable vehicles of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, always at command. Knowlege of all the arts of life is diffuſed, with facility, ſafety, and accuracy, as far as the uſe of letters is known. The cultivation of the gentle paſſions, an improved ſenſe of the duties of humanity, a knowlege of its rights, and the protection afforded to thoſe rights by the law of nations, and by the civil laws of moſt countries, have ſuperſeded the neceſſity of individual protection. Public accommodations have become much more convenient for travellers, than private hoſpitality. The univerſal intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and currency of money, has given men the command of a kind of property, which may, with eaſe and ſafety, attend their perſons, and provide for them, in all their peregrinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:025297_0030_0FCCF3A042B8EA28"/>Moſt men who travel, at this day, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in purſuits of intereſt, or gratifications of a private nature. In this ſtate of things, hoſpitality, in the ancient practice, would be unneceſſary, unjuſt, and intolerably burdenſome. And why ſhould we regret its loſs? Let thoſe who entertain ſuch an enthuſiaſtic veneration for hoſpitality, and other ancient virtues of the ſame origin, reflect, that they cannot have the effect without the cauſe; and that thoſe precious gems of ſavage virtue would loſe their luſtre and eſtimation, without the foil of ſavage vices.</p>
               <p>This ſhort ſketch is ſufficient to prove, that the firſt rude ſtate of man, or, if we chuſe the expreſſion, the firſt ſimple ſtate of ſociety, does not moſt abound in virtue and happineſs. I have given, indeed, a ſhort, but, I believe, a true ſketch of every equally uncivilized tribe on earth. Shall I be forgiven the cenſure, if I ſay, this opinion of a preference of the ſavage to a civilized ſtate of ſociety, has been propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, by the glowing pens of ſome writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whoſe love of virtue exceeded their information? Had they attended to the ſcience of human nature, the developement of the human mind, the powers, faculties, paſſions, and appetites of man; had they ſtudied, attentively, the hiſtory, not of battles
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025297_0031_0FCCF3A25C9EB8A0"/>
and ſieges only, the intrigues of ſtateſmen, and the revolutions of empires; but the hiſtory of man in ſociety, the natural hiſtory of the human mind, they would have found reaſon for correcting their opinion.</p>
               <p>This ſcience, ſo important to man, has, till very lately, been hardly attempted by any writer. In the firſt ages of ſociety, none are capable of making or recording proper obſervations. One half of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs has, generally, paſſed unnoticed. In following ages, hiſtorians, hurried away by the more ſplendid events of hiſtory, have moſtly neglected thoſe facts, which ſerve to mark the progreſſive improvement of the mind; and readers have been, equally, inattentive to the few, which have been recorded. In America, the beſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which ever preſented, for ſupplying theſe deficiencies, by obſervations on real life and manners, has been ſuffered to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, with very little improvement.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Of the appetite for ſociety—The hoarding appetite—The appetite which leads to the propagation of the ſpecies—Ambition— Sympathy.</head>
               <p>WE will now briefly enquire, how far man, without any conſideration of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wants, or a neceſſity of mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ariſing from a ſenſe of weakneſs, or wickedneſs, is fitted for ſociety. That ſurely is his natural ſtate, to which the laws of his nature, general and particular, all tend. Here let me premiſe, that with man, a ſtate of improvement is not oppoſed to a ſtate of nature. Perhaps as good a definition as any, which has been given of man, in this view, is, that he is a being capable of improvement, in a progreſſion, of which he knows not the limits. Deity has implanted, in his nature, the ſeeds of improvement, furniſhed him with powers and faculties for the cultivation, and to theſe, ſuperadded a ſenſe, that the cultivation is a duty.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing which ſtrikes the mind, in the courſe of our enquiry, is an appetite for ſociety. Man deſires to aſſociate with man, and feels a pleaſure at the approach of his kind. The appetite is ſo univerſally
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025297_0033_0FCCF3A6DD65E4E8"/>
prevalent, that it can not well be denied to be the work of nature. The ſame appetite, under the name of inſtinct, produces all thoſe aſſociations, which are found to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among all gregarious animals of the brute creation. With them, it is allowed to be natural. Why not allow it to be ſo with man, to whom it is ſo much more extenſively neceſſary and uſeful?</p>
               <p>It has been made a queſtion, whether the ſocial appetite be limited, in the number of its objects? I think this queſtion will admit, though not of a preciſe, yet of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory anſwer. It is adapted to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the powers and faculties of man, and admits of an equal extention by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement: Accordingly, in the early and unimproved ſtages of ſociety, while the powers and faculties of the human mind were in their infancy, we have every where ſeen men aſſociating in ſmall, independent tribes. If at any time, larger aſſociations have been formed, in that ſtate, like ſome of the great empires of antiquity, they were not the effect of choice, but of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior force. Agreeably to this opinion, we find, that the parts were very looſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and every where crumbled in piec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as ſoon as that force was removed.</p>
               <p>As mankind increaſe in knowlege, as their powers and faculties are extended,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025297_0034_0FCCF3A85BE18708"/>
and the comprehenſion of the mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, they, voluntarily, extend their aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations. To determine, therefore, the limits of the ſocial appetite, we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the limits of ſocial improvements.</p>
               <p>This appetite is accompanied with other appetites, with paſſions and inſtincts, which have no uſe, no gratification, no object, but in ſociety. Hardly can we find one, which terminates wholly in ſelf, not one, which ſtands oppoſed to ſociety. Of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, ſympathy, and all the train of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent paſſions and emotions, ſociety is, clearly, the ultimate object. Others tend to the preſervation of the ſpecies, or of the individuals. Such is the hoarding appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and the paſſion for riches, to which it gives riſe; the appetite, which leads to the propagation of the ſpecies, and its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent paſſions—even theſe are not ſolitary. They do not terminate, wholly, in ſelf.— No, not the hoarding appetite, which, if any, might be thought an exception. Here ſelf often predominates; but in general, the paſſion for riches, ſtript of every view to ſociety, becomes very faint, if not totally extinct.</p>
               <p>The man who is intent upon gain, has ſome connection, ſome friend, whom he wiſhes to benefit by his acquiſitions. He views the acquiſition of riches as a mean,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025297_0035_0FCCF3A9D44846A8"/>
not an end; a mean of future ſupport and perſonal indulgence, it is true; but, at the ſame time, a mean of benefiting ſome, and of acquiring eſteem, confidence, and influence among all. Some inſtances have indeed been known of ſolitary miſers, who have made the amaſſing of riches the ſole end of their purſuits. Some indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals have, likewiſe, conceived an averſion to man, and have ſecluded themſelves from ſociety. Theſe are conſidered as deviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the common ſenſe of their ſpecies, the common ſtandard of man. They are inſtances of the abuſe of natural paſſions; or they are anomalies of the race. There are other anomalies; but from ſuch we do not take the common nature of man.</p>
               <p>The appetite, which leads to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſpecies, is, perhaps, in its origin, a vague, indeterminate impulſe to gratification. The principal end of this appetite, doubtleſs, is the continuation of the ſpecies, by a perpetual re-production. In this view it is the conſtant revivifying principle of ſociety; but the author of our being, whoſe all-comprehenſive plan is adjuſted, in the moſt perfect harmony, has made it further ſubſervient to the purpoſes of ſocial happineſs. Nature, by making it the ſource of a ſpecific paſſion, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſentiments of delicacy and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025297_0036_0FCCF3ABAB57F280"/>
corrects the vagueneſs of the appetite. This forms one of the ſtrongeſt bonds of ſociety, and gives the moſt enchanting ſoftneſs to the <hi>tout enſemble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ambition, when in balance with other paſſions and appetites, is far from being oppoſed to ſociety. Far from being detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, it is highly uſeful to man. By this paſſion, many actions, the nobleſt and moſt beneficial to ſociety, are produced. It is only in the extreme, that the paſſion becomes hurtful; when the acquiſition of power or influence is no longer conſidered as a mean of doing good; when the paſſion aims, ſolely, or principally at its own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. But this is doing violence to the laws of nature, which reſult from the whole nature of man. It is a ſacrifice of one part of his nature to another.</p>
               <p>The paſſions of hatred, revenge, and ſome other paſſions, and emotions, the effects of which, are, not unfrequently, very pernicious in ſociety, will be reſerved for another ſection. In the remainder of this ſection, we will attend to ſome emotions, purely of a ſocial tendency.</p>
               <p>Sympathy is an ingredient in the ſocial nature of man, deſerving of very particular attention. The <hi>modus agendi,</hi> or how the emotion of ſympathy is produced; whether it be wholly mental; the reflection of a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025297_0037_0FCCF3AE67EE36B8"/>
ſentiment; or whether it be partly organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical, partly mental, is, perhaps, one of the ſecrets of nature; but the effect is evident, and the final cauſe illuſtrious. It is one of thoſe nice adjuſtments in the nature of man, which give us the moſt exalted idea of the wiſdom and benevolence of its author. In the ſmaller circles of life, its influence is more immediate, more direct; but its influence extends to whole nations and empires.— Sympathy is produced thro' the medium of an organic impreſſion. We perceive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the countenance, the movement, the whole figure of the perſon, which we take for the expreſſion of a ſentiment, or a particular ſtate of mind in that perſon. We inſtantaneouſly, ſeemingly by a direct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, without time for reflection, find excited in ourſelves a correſponding tone of mind, correſponding ſentiments, producing ſimilar expreſſions. The emotion, though we have a ſenſe of pain and diſtreſs in the object, is not repulſive. On the contrary, we feel a powerful attraction to objects of diſtreſs. Thus man is ſweetly prepared, by nature, to mourn with thoſe who mourn, and rejoice with thoſe who rejoice. The emotion of ſympathy, not only prevents a thouſand diſcords, but produces, in ſociety, a kind of inſtinctive harmony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:025297_0038_0FCCF3B0B43887C0"/>There is another impreſſion of ſympathy, which ſeems to be moſtly organic, or an effect on the nerves only. One perſon yawning in company, will produce a ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous yawn in all preſent, at leaſt, in all who ſee him in the act. When we ſee a perſon ſuddenly hurt, or hear of one being wounded in any particular part, or of the amputation of a limb, we feel a particular affection of the nerves in that part, which thence thrills through the whole frame, conveying, at once, to the heart, a ſenſe of the pains ſuppoſed to be endured by the patient. This may be a reaſon, why when we hear of a perſon being wounded, we are anxious to learn the manner, and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place of the wound. While our information is general, the affection is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. We endure ſomething like a ſtate of ſuſpenſe. This is a ſitation of, apparently, greater uneaſineſs, than when the ſenſation is reduced to the correſponding part.</p>
               <p>Lord Kaims has beautifully unfolded the ſympathetic emotion of virtue, <note n="*" place="bottom">Elements of Criticiſm, v. 1. ch. ii. p. 1. ſec. 4.</note> but it ought not to be omitted here. When we are witneſſes, or hear of the performance of any great, noble, and benevolent action, we find, excited in ourſelves, a ſtrong diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to perform the ſame kind of action. The mind ſwells with an ardent deſire to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025297_0039_0FCCF3B22BD1BE30"/>
find a proper opportunity, or a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Theſe emotions of ſympathy, are not the effect of reaſoning: they rather reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtinctive impulſes. Sympathy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of words, blends the thoughts, the ſentiments, and even the virtuous diſpoſition of individuals. It dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes joys of the heart, from countenance to countenance, commands relief in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and conſolation in affliction. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſquieu alludes to this principle in human nature, when he obſerves, that, "people are, generally, able to communicate their ideas to their children; but they are ſtill better able to tranſmit their paſſions." This diſpoſition to ſympathy well accounts for all that ſimilarity of ſentiments, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and even of features, which is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in families, ſocieties, and nations; the leſs perfect, indeed, the more extenſive the connection.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> Of Hatred and Revenge—Of Envy, Malice, and ſome other diſſocial Paſſions.</head>
               <p>THE paſſions of Hatred and Revenge, are not, in their nature, oppoſed to ſociety, though, from abuſe, they become, at times, very pernicious. On a candid enquiry, it will be found, that thoſe paſſions do not ariſe from any malignity in the nature of man. They are given for wiſe and good purpoſes. They are neceſſary to a being capable of right and wrong in his actions; capable of injuring as well as benefiting others, and liable to be, himſelf, the ſubject of injuries from thoſe of his own ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Men are intuitively conſcious of a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of action, of a choice in what they do. We know, at the ſame time, that man is not a perfect being. He has many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. There fall in his way motives to action infinitely various. Sometimes his choice is influenced by ignorance, by error, by the prevalence of particular paſſions, or appetites, a preſent deſire of gratification. Sometimes, he is confounded with an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate combination of circumſtances, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of which, he wants the power, or the patience to evolve. He is frequently tempted to a deviation from juſtice, by an
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025297_0041_0FCCF3B827DD42E0"/>
oppoſition of intereſts, originating, not in a direct intention of the parties, but the want of an early foreſight in each of the other's intended purſuits. To a being thus circumſtanced, powerful moral reſtraints are neceſſary. Such reſtraints are provided for man, which come in aid of the moral ſenſe, and are made to ariſe from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his actions. It is evidently a conſtitution of Providence, that <hi>vice</hi> ſhall produce <hi>miſery,</hi> to the agent, and that <hi>virtue</hi> ſhall produce <hi>happineſs,</hi> as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, connected in both, by the relation of cauſe and effect. The paſſions of hatred and revenge will be found to accord with this conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The more fully to inveſtigate this ſubject, it will be neceſſary to take a nearer view of human nature. Man, in an unimproved ſtate, is very little acquainted with the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his own mind, the extent of his powers and faculties, and the reſult of their various combinations. For their develope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is furniſhed with ſenſes, internal and external, accompanied with the powers of reaſon and inveſtigation. It is here, as in phyſics, no reliance can be had on rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, <hi>a priori.</hi> Experience alone can decide. Man, therefore, fully to diſcover the direction and extent of his powers and faculties, and the right tendency of his
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025297_0042_0FCCF3B9A3E32DF8"/>
whole nature, muſt, with ſufficient atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſence of mind, to mark the reſult, paſs through ſuch a variety of ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, as will bring all into exerciſe, and put all to the teſt, in every variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination. It is a matter of great difficulty, to make juſt and accurate obſervations on a ſubject, ſo evaneſcent, as are the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, and always <hi>in tranſitu.</hi> They are paſt, ere there is time for reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the moſt important occaſions, the whole mind is wrapped in attention to ſome external object. Add to this, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as man is, though for wiſe purpoſes, to the influence of habit, his obſervations will be, frequently, partial, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions warped by ſome preſent prevailing bias. It is evident, therefore, that, farther than the direct perception of the moral ſenſe, in its moſt ſimple ſtate, the progreſs of knowlege, in moral and ſocial combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, will be ſlow; how ſlow, a ſlight attention to the hiſtory of the human mind, will evince. We are taught, by reaſon and experience, that the leſs man is able to diſcern agreements and tendencies, the more liable he is to do wrong; the more liable, from partial views, inſtead of ſeeking a compromiſe, to ſacrifice to his own, the intereſt of others; at the ſame time he is leſs able to deviſe and enforce thoſe ſocial rules, which might remedy the evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:025297_0043_0FCCF3BB1BF5DA28"/>In the firſt rude ſtages of ſociety, men have no idea of general rules, or public puniſhments, for the prevention of private injuries. They are unable to connect pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate injuries with the common concerns of the nation. The redreſs and prevention of theſe, are left to the care of each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual. In a ſituation like this, hatred and revenge are the only poſſible external checks. Theſe paſſions go to the nature of each individual. Hatred is a rooted aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one man to another, on account of a real, or ſuppoſed, fixed and intentional oppoſition to his intereſt, or happineſs. Revenge, is a deſire in one perſon, to inflict an evil on another, for a real, or ſuppoſed injury received. Hatred dictates the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of its object, as diſagreeable or nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious. Revenge purſues its object, and is gratified, only with retaliating the injury. Such conduct is dictated by the law of ſelf-preſervation, and is the more neceſſary, as there is no other external reſtraint, no other mean of eſcaping, or preventing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture injuries. Thus limited and directed, they are both neceſſary for the prevention of a licentiouſneſs in injuries, unreſtrained by any fear of the conſequences.</p>
               <p>In the progreſs of improvement, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of ſocial intercourſe, the invention of arts, the change of manners, the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025297_0044_0FCCF3BEBA05CE38"/>
of property, the multiplication of deſires, and objects of gratification, form a ſcene too intricate, a combination of intereſts too complicated for the former ſimple mode of ſociety. Liability to injuries is increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in proportion. The paſſion of revenge, almoſt conſtantly in exerciſe, would, in this ſtate, if laid under no reſtraint, become a moſt cruel ſcourge. Nature is always equal to her occaſions.

They are led, by degrees, in ſome meaſure, to comprehend their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to evolve the combination of their various intereſts; to form thoſe laws, which may have a tendency to prevent a direct oppoſition; to provide a reparation for injuries, and puniſhments for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of wanton violence. Still, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is ſlow. It is long before men can be perſuaded to accept only a reparation for injuries, and ſubmit to ſociety, the ſole right of puniſhing for prevention, which comes in the place of revenge.</p>
               <p>The right to revenge private injuries, in the moſt improved ſtate of ſociety, in the higheſt refinement of manners, never wholly ceaſes. Nor is it demanded.— There will exiſt many little oppoſitions,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025297_0045_0FCCF3C024EBB0D0"/>
many little injuries, to which the law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſcend, and which, if neglected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſource of greater violences. The exerciſe of hatred and revenge, by the party injured, is ſtill the only reſtraint, in theſe caſes. In a ſtate of refinement, however, theſe paſſions are ſtript of their violence. An avoidance in company, a look of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, a ſilent glance of indignation, may prove a ſufficient reſtraint to a perſon, at all ſuſceptible of the nicer feelings. In this ſtate, they are hardly known for the ſame paſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Still, they are the ſame, only chaſtiſed and accommodated to a more improved ſtate of ſociety. Before, they acted a primary p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as ſovereign in the diſtribution of puniſhments. Now they act a ſubordinate part, coming in aid of the law, in matters of ſmaller moment. They are, indeed, liable to great abuſes; and what is exempt from abuſe, in the hands of a fallible being? We ſhould be but ill fitted for ſociety, in any ſtate, without them. In an improved and well regulated ſociety, the abuſe can never be very extenſive, in its conſequences. Let us not raſhly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to correct the wiſdom of Deity. Much better is it for us, that we ſuffer the abuſe of them, than the total extinction.</p>
               <p>Envy, malice, and avarice, have been accounted inſtances of natural paſſions,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025297_0046_0FCCF3C111EB5760"/>
which are diſſocial, and tend to prove, that man is little fitted for happineſs in ſociety. I will not contend about the term, <hi>natural.</hi> It is true, that man is capable of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and of many other vicious paſſions and habits. A little reflection, however, will diſcover, that theſe are not original in his nature. They have their origin in the abuſe of thoſe natural paſſions, which are neceſſary to his happineſs, both as a ſocial being, and as an individual.</p>
               <p>Envy is generally ſaid to be Emulation carried to exceſs. This is undoubtedly true; but, in exerciſe, it certainly partakes of the paſſion of Revenge. Emulation is a deſire to excel others, in the public eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The paſſion is not, directly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſocial or diſſocial, but is, in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, frequently, very beneficial to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. While a perſon ſtrives, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſuperior excellence, to deſerve a preference, in the public opinion, it may be, emphatically, called the ſtrife of virtue. The happineſs of ſociety is intereſted in the conteſt. When a perſon deſerts the prime object, the acquiſition of real excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſtrives, by the depreſſion of a competitor, to enjoy the public eſtimation unrivalled, it has degenerated into envy. It is now the conteſt of vice. A perſon, under the dominion of this paſſion, is prone
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025297_0047_0FCCF3C3DB5A3668"/>
to exaggerate every little fault, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, and to convert, even his virtuous actions into vices, by attributing them to corrupt motives. Every excellence, in a rival, is viewed, as hoſtile; every advance, a perſonal injury. To complete the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude of the paſſion, and fill up the meaſure of vice, the paſſion of revenge is called in to its aid.</p>
               <p>Malice is a diſpoſition to inflict evil on others, without juſt cauſe. The diſpoſition is inflamed into a paſſion, whenever a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object is preſented. It may be called a perpetual anger. It is equally irrational with that paſſion. Some perſons appear to derive, from their organization, an irrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of mind, which eaſily admits this diſpoſition. In general, malice prevails moſt among a people of fierce and rough manners, where the common tone of the mind borders upon anger. It is more rare in an improved ſtate of ſociety and manners, and where it is diſcovered, may, generally, be traced to its ſource, in a ſeries of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, inſults, and hard uſage, which have habituated the mind to a ſtate of irrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. In all theſe caſes, it is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that a malicious diſpoſition, is, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, no part of the common nature of man. It is wholly adventitious. It is a vicious habit of mind admitted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025297_0048_0FCCF3C5D3E6E4F8"/>
by a too eaſy indulgence of the irritable feelings.</p>
               <p>Avarice is the exceſs of that paſſion, which accompanies the hoarding appetite, as mentioned, in a former ſection; the paſſion, which prompts man to provide for his future neceſſity, or conveniences. It is the foundation of all his providence. He could not even ſubſiſt without it. Like other paſſions, it is liable to abuſe; to be converted into avarice, and become, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, an incentive to the moſt horrid vices.</p>
               <p>There are paſſions, which originate in habit. Every habit gives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe to an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant paſſion, which impels to the indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the habit. vicious habits are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with vicious paſſions, many of which have the moſt pernicious conſequences in ſociety. Such paſſions have no pretence of being natural, or, original in the mind of man. The habits, from which they are derived, are formed in the mind, through the neglect, or abuſe of ſome natural power, faculty, or propenſity. They may, like every vice, be admitted or excluded, at the election of the mind. They may, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with exact propriety, be denominated artificial.</p>
               <p>That any of the paſſions, faculties, or propenſities of man may be abuſed, proves only, that he is a moral agent, capable, in
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025297_0049_0FCCF3C7469D5C00"/>
his actions, of chuſing between good and evil; or that he is imperfect, and liable to deception, and ſometimes aberrations from virtue, without deſigning the conſequences. Were it an objection to any paſſion, propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, power, or faculty, that it might be ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon a candid view of the ſubject, I think we may fairly conclude, that man is, by the laws of his common nature, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the author of his being, fitted for a ſtate of ſociety, and of ſocial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; that his happineſs depends on the right uſe of his paſſions, appetites, powers, and faculties, agreeably to the laws of ſocial nature; that, as a moral being, capable of vicious, as well as virtuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he may deviate from his deſtination, violate the laws of his nature, and diſturb his own happineſs, and the happineſs of ſociety.</p>

               <p>IN the preceding ſketch we have ſeen that Man, as far as depends on his natural paſſions, appetites, and inſtinctive emotions, is fitted and intended for the ſocial ſtate. We ſhall now enquire how far he is, by his nature, ſitted for government: for civil inſtitutions and laws.</p>
               <p>Man is furniſhed with a moral ſenſe, <note n="*" place="bottom">By the Moral ſenſe is not to be underſtood any thing like a moral inſtinct. It is uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that mental faculty, by which we perceive moral relations, comprehending the feelings, which, in the mind, accompany the perception. The ſame may be ſaid of the ſenſe of accountability, and of all the internal ſenſes. They are faculties of perceiving certain relations. They are called ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, from a ſuppoſed analogy to the external ſenſes. It has been uſual to conſider them, as exiſting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, in the mind. But I think this is not juſt. The diſtinction, from which they have derived their different denominations, is, probably, to be found in the objects of perception only, not in the mind itſelf. Be that as it may, whether they exiſt, diſtinctly, in the mind, or are denominated from the different objects of perception, the diſtinction will be equally neceſſary, and the concluſion, to all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </note> by which he perceives the right, and the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025297_0051_0FCCF3CBE8BCDD10"/>
wrong of his actions. This ſenſe is faint and limited at firſt; but is invigorated, and extended, in the courſe of ſocial improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is the final arbiter of juſtice, vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and all the moral virtues, of all the moral actions of the man, whether ſocial, or ſelfiſh. When he perceives his actions to be right, or productive of good, agreeably to the order of his nature, he is conſcious of a virtuous approbation; when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them to be wrong, he ſuffers the painful emotion of diſapprobation. Hence ariſes his love of juſtice, veracity, and all the ſocial, all the moral virtues. What he is conſcious of in himſelf, he expects to find in others. This is the foundation of his confidence in the juſtice of others, and his reliance on human teſtimony. That he ſometimes violates thoſe virtues, is no proof, that he does not love, and admire them. Juſtice, for inſtance, is the reſult of action, of moral action; or rather, it is the reſult
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025297_0052_0FCCF3CD0F575670"/>
of certain reciprocal relations between the action, the agent, and the object. It is often, therefore, not a little complex. A little more, or leſs comprehenſion of theſe relations, may, wholly, vary the reſult, as to the moral quality of the action. View<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things through the medium of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or of ſome predominant paſſion, or appetite, man is liable to err, as well in the aſſociation, as in the application; and while he loves virtue, in general, to admit vice in particulars.</p>
               <p>Conſidered as to his mind, man has act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive as well as paſſive powers. He is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of deliberation and choice. He is, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, capable of various impreſſions from external objects. Theſe impreſſions intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a change in the mind, which is the ſubject. A difference in the ſubject, gives a difference to the effects produced by the ſame cauſe. Hence it is, that, not only different men, but frequently the ſame man, at different times, may be very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently affected by the ſame object, and the ſame motive have a different influence. Hence comes a fluctuation of choice. This fluctuation is corrected by the moral ſenſe, by the force of habit and of reaſon, which place a choice of objects, or the admiſſion of the cauſes of ſuch impreſſions, in the power of the mind. Were man unaſſaila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025297_0053_0FCCF3CEA4C77760"/>
by external impulſes; were the influence of motives excluded, did his nature admit one line of conduct, only, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, he would be, wholly, unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating, a being wholly unaccountable. Laws might as well be promulgated to a machine. Sanctions and puniſhments could add no inducement to the obſervance. To an omniſcient and all-perfect being, this might, perhaps, be a deſirable ſtate; but it is ill ſuited to the imperfections of man.</p>
               <p>Thus, by a little attention, we diſcover, that the very conſtitution, which on a curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory view, ſeemed hardly to admit of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and laws, is nevertheleſs, well adapted to that ſtate. It is no objection to ſay, man is imperfect; it is only to ſay, he is man. His imperfections, to a certain degree, fit him to be a ſubject of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We ſhall ſee, hereafter, that they render it indiſpenſibly neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Man has, likewiſe, an appetite for the approbation of others, which contributes not a little to his ſenſe of accountability. The ſenſe of accountability is a very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ingredient in the moral nature of man. When he has done well, he is conſcious that he is deſerving of approbation; when ill, of puniſhment. In the ſame manner, he judges of the actions of others.<note n="*" place="bottom">See more upon this ſubject in ſec. 4 of this ſketch.</note> Thus
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025297_0054_0FCCF3D024442E00"/>
he is made to perceive the juſtice of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the moral neceſſity of ſubmiting to laws, which comport with his moral nature.</p>
               <p>There is one ſenſe, which I will venture to call the ſocial ſenſe. Though its effects have been often noticed, I do not recollect, that it has been diſtinctly handled by any writer on ſociety. When a man conſiders himſelf, as connected with any ſociety, he is, if I may uſe the expreſſion, perceptively conſcious of a kind of individuality of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the aggregate. The perception is more, or leſs diſtinct, as the connection is more, or leſs intimate. This ſenſe, if it be not the germ of every ſocial attachment, certainly, gives ſtrength to the attachment, and vigor to patriotiſm itſelf. It is a very neceſſary part of the ſocial nature of man, and of great importance to government. It is not only the ſoul of individuality to the whole government, but, as there will be numerous ſubordinate connections in the ſame government, it makes all the individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals of the ſame connection, in ſome meaſure ſponſors for the actions of each. They perceptively enjoy the virtues, both of the individuals of the connection, and of the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate. Each feels, as of right, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the other's crimes, and the juſtice of their puniſhment. I think the exiſtence
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025297_0055_0FCCF3D1918AE3F8"/>
of the ſocial ſenſe will not be doubted by any, who will carefully attend to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own minds.</p>
               <p>The perceptions of this ſenſe have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, given riſe to a principle, which has been groſly abuſed to the oppreſſion of mankind. In many governments, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid practice has prevailed of involving, in the puniſhment of offenders, all of the ſame family and connection, however remote. It has prevailed, moſtly, in deſpotic ſtates. It, there, coincides with the principles of the government, which make it a crime for a man to be placed, even by nature herſelf, in a ſituation, in which he might dare to think himſelf injured, by the actions of the Prince. The principle, by no means juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the practice; but it, in ſome meaſure, accounts for its origin. It, likewiſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for the practice of retaliation, repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and many other practices, adopted in the law of nations. And, here, humanity might vindicate her rights, and aſſert, that the practice is, too often, carried further than the principle will warrant.</p>
               <p>Patriotiſm, or love of country, makes an illuſtrious figure in civil inſtitutions. It is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to any degree of ſecurity, or proſperity in a nation. The whole community is the object of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In its effects, it unites the individual
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025297_0056_0FCCF3D768BDAC18"/>
members, in the purſuit of public meaſures, and on neceſſary occaſions, gives a common preference of public to private good. To the common intereſt, in the defence and proſperity of the nation, it adds an affection, great as the object, on which it is exerted.</p>
               <p>It has been made a queſtion by ſome, whether this paſſion be among the natural paſſions of man. The Abbe Raynal has aſſerted the contrary. Speaking of the inhabitants of Brazil, he ſays, "They ſhew no paticular attachment to their native place. The love of country, which is a ruling paſſion in civilized ſtates; which, in good governments, riſes to enthuſiaſm, and in bad ones, grows habitual; <hi>this love of our country</hi> is but a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctitious ſentiment ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſociety; but unknown in a ſtate of nature."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the Indies.</note> Let us carefully examine this opinion. At this day, facts, and not names, give a currency to opinions.</p>
               <p>Though in ſpeaking of the Brazillians, the Abbe mentions only their want of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their native ſoil; yet, in his general poſition, he comprehends all the moſt diſtinctive properties of that love of country, which is, generally, denominated patriotiſm. In this ſenſe, the love of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is the love of the community. An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the ſoil collects, limits, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025297_0057_0FCCF3D867C31B90"/>
fixes the paſſion, and gives a locality to its object; but is not neceſſary to its exiſtence. Take from the country the community, all its inhabitants, the object ceaſes.</p>
               <p>Were this paſſion not diſcovered, in the firſt rude ſtate of ſociety, no concluſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument could, in this point, be drawn from that circumſtance. Moſt, or all the paſſions of man, are, originally, capacities only. Capacities may, and do exiſt, antecedent to the objects, to which they are adapted. They can be diſcovered in exerciſe only, and they cannot be exhibited in exerciſe, until they meet a proper ſubject for their exertion. Many of them are like plants in the germ. They exhibit not their ſpecies, until they are expanded by a proper cultivation. Shall we ſay, the oak is not a tree of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in its firſt ſtate, it is but a germ in the acorn? Shall we ſay, the appetite, which leads to the propagation of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and its conſequenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l paſſions, are not natural, becauſe they are not diſcovered in the infant of a day?</p>
               <p>If we rely on facts, hiſtory has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, or modern reſearches diſcovered, a ſingle people, in this ſtate of nature, a ſtate, in which the love of country, an attachment to the community, does not make a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous figure. The ancient barbarians of the north, from whom the modern inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025297_0058_0FCCF3D9EE4BFD60"/>
of Europe are, moſtly, deſcended, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, every where, proofs of the exiſtence of this paſſion; of vigorous national attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is true, that their attachment to the ſoil was not ſo ſtrong. This attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is fixed, principally, by the cultivation of the earth for ſubſiſtence, which collects the intereſt and attention to one ſpot, and gives a locality to conveniences.</p>
               <p>It is not, however, true, that ſavages have, in general, but feeble attachments to the ſoil of their country. On the contrary, in this reſpect, they are, in a great meaſure, capable of the ſame habits, paſſions, and ſentiments, as the man of civilization. They occupy, with their habitations, but a ſmall part of what they call their country. The greater part is reſerved for paſture, or for hunting ground. It is the great farm of the tribe. They readily remove from one part of this to another; but war, fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, or ſome more powerful cauſe, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to compel them to a total emigration.</p>
               <p>The ancient Scythians, from whom the modern Tartars are deſcended, were a nation of herdſmen. Their riches conſiſted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in horſes, which ſupplied them with both food and carriage. Their habitations were booths, or tents of eaſy conſtruction. In a country of great extent, they prefered only thoſe places, which afforded the greateſt
<pb n="60"
                      facs="unknown:025297_0059_0FCCF3DB6ACBEAD8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
plenty of freſh paſtures. In ſearch of theſe, they made frequent and diſtant removals.</p>
               <p>We find, that among this people, as early as the reign of Darius, the ſon of Hyſtaſpes, the love of country was a vigorous paſſion. Their national attachments were ſtrong, and they were attached to the ſoil of their country, not ſo much becauſe it afforded them ſubſiſtence by cultivation, as becauſe it contained the tombs of their anceſtors. According to Herodotus, Indathyrſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, who was a prince, or a head warrior in that country, ſent the following meſſage to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, then attempting the conqueſt of Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia: —"If I fly before the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Prince of the Perſians, it is not becauſe I fear thee. What I do now, I am uſed to do in times of peace. We Scythians have neither houſes nor lands to defend, if thou haſt a mind to force us to come to an engagement, come and attack the tombs of our fathers, and then thou ſhalt find what manner of men we are." Such a people could be no ſtrangers to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm.</p>
               <p>The ſavages of North-America are a living inſtance of the vigor of this paſſion among a rude, uncultivated people. The European writers have been greatly abuſed in their information concerning the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can natives. Buffon has aſſerted, that, "Among them, paternal love, and filial
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025297_0060_0FCCF3DDA7493870"/>
affection are very faint. The moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connection, that of family, has but feeble ties. There is no ſociety between one family and another; of courſe there is no national union, no republic, no ſocial ſtate."<note n="*" place="bottom">— ils aiment foiblement leurs peres &amp; leurs enfans; la ſociete la plus, intime de toutes, cele de la meme famille, n'a donc chez eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>The Abbe Raynal, in his obſervations on America, has copied many things from Buffon, and probably, here, he found that ſtate of nature, to which he alludes in the paſſage above recited. Happily, ſuch a ſtate of nature does not exiſt. In the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the inhabitants of Brazil, the Abbe ſpeaks of their ancient mode of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in that country. What but an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſoil could have been the cauſe of the continuance of this people, in the ſame country, thro' a ſucceſſion of ages? to what but a national attachment ſhall we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their national manners, and the national reſentment of which he there ſpeaks?</p>
               <p>In another place he gives an inſtance, which contradicts every part of the ſocial character given of the American natives, by Buffon, and militates, ſtrongly, againſt his
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025297_0061_0FCCF3DF5C74D5F8"/>
own opinion, that in what he calls a ſtate of nature, the love of country is unknown. The French wanted to perſuade ſome of the ſavages of Canada to remove to a diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from their native ſoil. On this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, one of their Chiefs made the following ſpeech: "We were born (ſaid he) on this ground. Our fathers lie buried in it. Shall we ſay to the bones of our fathers, Ariſe, and come with us into a foreign land?" Is this the language of a people, who are almoſt void of parental and filial affection? who have no national attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? no republic? no ſocial ſtate?</p>

The reader will not be diſpleaſed to ſee the whole of this beautiful paſſage. It is equal to volumes on the character of that people. "I appeal to any white man," ſays he, "to ſay, if ever he came to Logan's cabin, hungry, and he gave him not meat; if he ever came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During the courſe of the laſt, long, and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen pointed as they went, and ſaid, <hi>Logan is the friend of white men.</hi> I had

I have fully glutted my vengeance. <hi>For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace:</hi>—But do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear.

               </head>
               <p>THE rights of property make ſo great a figure in the laws of every government, it may not be amiſs to give a little attention to man, in relation to thoſe rights. Much has been ſaid, by writers on law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, concerning the origin of the right of property, and many enquiries have been made, whence man comes by the idea of that right, ſo univerſally prevalent. I have met with but one opinion, which can give any ſatisfaction on the ſubject. Lord Kaims has employed ſeveral eſſays in its illuſtration. <note n="†" place="bottom">Eſſays on Morality and Natural Religion. 66. Sketches of the Hiſtory of Man. Book I. Sk. 3.</note> The reader will readily diſcern, how far I am indebted to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent author, for ſome of the following obſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:025297_0064_0FCCF3E4B72059B8"/>It is now, I believe pretty generally agreed, that man is furniſhed with internal, as well as external ſenſes. The objects of the internal ſenſes are, moſtly, moral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Among theſe, is a ſenſe of property; a ſenſe, by which the mind perceives, intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itively, without the intervention of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a right of property. Whether it be a diſtinct ſenſe, or a branch of the moral ſenſe, is not material to enquire. This is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the perception is only of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from which reſults the right of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As a diſtinct ſenſe, it does not extend to the modes of acquiſition, but leaves them to the cognizance of the moral ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The relation, in which conſiſts the right of property, ſeems not to be a moral relation, nor wholly a corporal relation, as of parts. The relation between me and the table, on which I write at preſent, by which it is mine, ſeems to have nothing of a moral quality in it, without the intervening rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome other perſon. It is, doubtleſs, very ſimple. It has never yet been defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, otherwiſe, than by the mode of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; as, this piece of land is A's. He purchaſed it. It was given to him. It came to him by deſcent. Indeed, to ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple objects of perception, whether ſubſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or relations, names are neceſſary, but definitions are uſeleſs, and impract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cable.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025297_0065_0FCCF3E5DB728128"/>
Nature has denied them, in every inſtance. The diſcovery, therefore, of ſimple objects, or ſimple relations, is not from reaſon, but intuition. This ſenſe, though limited, at firſt, and, like the other faculties, ſubjected to a courſe of improvement, is diſcoverable in the early ſtages of life. The infant has, clearly, a ſenſe of the right of property, though not of the modes of acquiſition. He ſeems, before he is capable of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential reaſoning, as clearly to diſcern his right to his rattle-box, as the adult to his horſe, purchaſed with his money, or his labor, and vindicates his property with as much apparent conſciouſneſs of that right. The perception extends, however, little farther than his own right; it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to extend to the rights of others.</p>
               <p>Many brute animals, to whom we have denied the powers of reaſon and inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appear, evidently, to have a ſenſe of property. Give a bone to a dog, he takes it boldly as his own. Let another attempt to rob him of it, he ſtands boldly in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, with a ſeeming conſciouſneſs of his right of property; while the aggreſſor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches with an apparent conſciouſneſs of guilt. The ox claims a right to his ſtall, and the dog, again, to his wonted corner. Inſtances have been given of a ſenſe of this right in the ape, the beaver, the ſtork, and

ſome other animals, which have not fallen under my obſervation. I, therefore, omit them. It would be ſtrange if Providence had been leſs kind to man, than to the brute creation—man, to whom property is ſo extenſively uſeful, and which, in a ſtate of ſociety, becomes the object or the inſtrument of moſt of his moral actions.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved above, that the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only of the right, or of the relation, which conſtitutes property, but extends not to the modes of acquiſition. Theſe modes, according to the ſtate of ſociety, may be very various. In the early ſtages of ſociety, or, what is frequently called a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the objects of property, are almoſt as few, and the modes of acquiſition nearly as ſimple, as among many tribes of the brute creation. The objects of property are only thoſe things, which are barely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport exiſtence. The modes of acquiſition are, moſtly, confined to prime occupancy, and ſome trifling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions by labor. The ſimple modes of gift and exchange are ſoon added. In the progreſs of ſociety, men learn to apply to their uſe, either for their neceſſities, or their pleaſure, moſt of the numerous productions of nature. By the aſſiſtance of art, as the powers of the mind expand, they vary, and multiply theſe, without end. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025297_0067_0FCCF3ED9BC0B4B0"/>
as men enlarge their views of what is uſeful or agreeable, the hoarding appetite gains ſtrength. They become eager of the preſent, and provident of the future. The objects of property become equally numerous with the objects of deſire. In ſuch a ſtate, the modes of acquiſition are greatly diverſified, and are made the ſubject of a great variety of laws and regulations. The whole buſineſs of property now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be an artificial ſyſtem; but the modes of acquiſition only are the ſubjects of artificial regulations. The right itſelf, of property, is ſubſtantially founded in the relations of nature, and is diſcovered by a natural ſenſe, an intuitive perception. The buſineſs of acquiſition, ſerves only to bring the ſubjects of property within the compaſs of thoſe relations.</p>
               <p>Here let me obſerve, that from this view of the right of property, we clearly diſcover, that it is not, as many writers have aſſerted, the creature of the civil law only. The conſequences, therefore, which they have drawn from this poſition, "that on a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of government, all property is annihilated; and that every revolution of government, or radical reformation, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the right itſelf of property," are by no means juſt. Civil protection only is loſt. The ſecurity of enjoyment

is endangered. The right itſelf, founded in the primary relations of nature, remains unchanged. But to return.</p>
               <p>Without this perception, the right of property could be but weakly guarded by the moral ſenſe. Were it a diſcovery of reaſon, a concluſion to convenience only, it muſt wait a conſiderable maturity of the reaſoning powers. It muſt be wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attainable to children; and, certainly, no perſons, until they had, in one way or other, attained the perception, could feel any obligation of reſtraint. Force alone could prevent a conſtant violation of the rights of property. Prohibitory laws would be conſidered as ſo many arbitrary impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. How much better is the plan of Providence! Who can forbear to admire the wiſdom and goodneſs diſplayed by the Author of our being, in thus adjuſting the nature of man to that ſocial and civil ſtate, which he has ever found neceſſary, not only to his happineſs, but to any tolerable exiſtence in life? Deity has implanted in the nature of man, the germ of every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification, and left to him the cultivation. More, it is probable, could not be indulged to a moral agent.</p>

               <p>THAT Man, on entering into civil ſociety, of neceſſity, ſacrifices a part of his natural liberty, has been pretty univerſally taken for granted by writers on govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They ſeem, in general, not to have admitted a doubt of the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. One feels as though it was tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on forbidden ground, to attempt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of what has been advanced by a Locke,<note n="*" place="bottom">Looke on Civ. Gov. 221. 245.</note> a Beccari,<note n="†" place="bottom">Bec. on Crimes and Puniſhments. Ch. 1. &amp; 8.</note> and ſome other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent writers and ſtateſmen.<note n="‡" place="bottom">"Individuals entering into ſociety, muſt give up a ſhare of liberty to preſerve the reſt. The magnitude of the ſacrifice muſt depend, as well on ſituation and circumſtances, as on the object to be obtained.

ſhall do them no injuſtice to ſuppoſe, that, in ſo vaſt a field of enquiry, they may have left ſome part not ſufficiently explored. The revolution in America has opened new avenues to the ſcience of government.</p>
               <p>We have already ſeen, that the laws of nature, as they relate to man, are the laws of ſocial nature; and that they have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation to the civil ſtate. Indeed, it would be ſtrange to ſuppoſe, that the God of all order, had, in the very nature of man, implanted the ſeeds of incongruity and contradiction. That from an undue culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is the work of man, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities and contradictions ſhould ariſe, is not a ſubject of wonder.

                     </gap>.</note> have aſſerted, that man, on entering into ſociety, ſacrifices a part of his natural rights, a part of his natural liberty, the better to ſecure the remainder. They ſpeak of it as ariſing from the original laws of his nature, and the neceſſary nature of civil inſtitutions. The poſition ſounds very harſh, that, to the enjoyment of civil ſociety, man muſt give up a part of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty; but it is always cloſed with this conſolation, that, he, thereby, gains a greater ſecurity for the remainder, and is, in point of happineſs, a great gainer by the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025297_0071_0FCCF3F36D72CFB8"/>
exchange. The purſuit and attainment of happineſs, is agreeable to the laws of man's nature, and dictated by them. If this be true, is it not ſufficient to ſuggeſt a doubt, whether the ſtate, in which that end is moſt perfectly anſwered, be not the true ſtate of nature? Whether thoſe natural rights, which are ſaid to be given up, the principal of which, are, the right of judging in his own cauſe, and of taking ſatisfaction, or rather revenge, at his pleaſure, are rights, which any man is qualified to exerciſe, in all caſes, conſiſtently with his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or that of others? Whether, in an unimproved ſtate of ſociety, the infancy of the human powers and faculties, an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of developing the whole laws of his nature, and conſequently, of carrying them into full effect, theſe rights are not given to man, as a temporary proviſion of neceſſity? And that, when he is arrived at a maturity to be capable of civil combinations, and a better proviſion for carrying into effect the laws of his ſocial nature, as far as ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion can be made, they ceaſe to the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of courſe?<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſubject is farther examined in the firſt Section of Sketch IV.</note> It ſurely affords a much more agreeable reflection to ſuppoſe, that, ariſing from human nature, taking in a capacity for improvement, which makes
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025297_0072_0FCCF3F4CD63F2B0"/>
a part of the conſtitution, there is no ſuch oppoſition between natural and civil rights. That, in ſome governments, men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their natural rights, is true; but it is equally true, and equally comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to ſay, they are deprived of their civil rights. Such governments, either in their conſtitution, or adminiſtration; from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the one ſide, corruption or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the other, have deviated from the true principles of nature.</p>
               <p>The Americans ſhould know, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that little more is neceſſary to the diſcovery of the coincidence of natural and civil rights, than the removal of ancient prejudices, or to their reconcilement in practice, than the removal of powers and biaſſes not warranted by the laws of nature. From the progreſs, which has already been made, they have good reaſon to believe, that the weakneſſes only, which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to human nature, not any oppoſition of principles, prevent the attainment of this end in the higheſt perfection.</p>
               <p>The Marquis Beccari ſpeaks of a ſacrifice of that univerſal liberty of action, common to all ſenſible beings, and limited only by our natural powers.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on Crimes and Puniſhments. Ch. 8.</note> May not this liberty be as well predicated of a machine? When we ſpeak of the liberty common to man,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025297_0073_0FCCF3F8900C6DD0"/>
liberty, and a right to act, are convertible terms. Man has a natural, that is, a mere phyſical power, to injure both himſelf and others. But is a liberty to do this accorded to him by the laws of his nature? that is, a right to do wrong. Power, and liberty, are not of equal extent in ſignification. Power is, in a ſtrict ſenſe, that, by which we are enabled to exerciſe our liberty; not the liberty itſelf, when conſidered as a right. In a larger ſenſe, it comprehends, both the right, and the power. Civil liberty is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally taken in this ſenſe. It will not be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that liberty and moral obligation are at variance. I think, therefore, it will be more juſt to ſay, that, liberty of action, common to ſenſible beings, is limited by their natural powers, by the obligations of morality, in a word, by the laws of their whole nature. To give up the performance of any action, which is forbidden by the laws of moral and ſocial nature, cannot be deemed a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that all men have a right, individually, to purſue their own intereſt and happineſs; and that, in the commerce of civil ſociety, there will ariſe oppoſitions, which will, frequently, oblige one to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his intereſt, or happineſs, to that of an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther. I anſwer, 1. The more men are found in a ſtate of individual independence, and the leſs they direct their conduct by
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025297_0074_0FCCF3FA538DA550"/>
mutual laws, the more frequently, will ſuch oppoſitions ariſe, and ſacrifices neceſſarily be made, and that under circumſtances of violence.—2. Man, as a being, ſociable by the laws of his nature, has no right to purſue his own intereſt, or happineſs, to the excluſion of that of his fellow men.— 3. The laws reſulting from the reciprocal ſocial relations of men, dictate, that, when, from a want of foreſight, or from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the objects of purſuit, an oppoſition ariſes, there ſhould be an amicable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe. Beyond this, nature may have given power, but ſhe has accorded no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, no right to man.</p>
               <p>This is the true principle of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and exchange amongſt men; of the accommodation of all civil claims and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and the mutual ſubmiſſion of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion to public ſentiment. It is true, that men, in their private intercourſe, often loſe ſight of this principle, and that, in public bodies, it is too much neglected. The intereſts of the minority, which, upon a right of mutual compromiſe, are entitled to a proportionable regard, are too often neglected, or wholly ſacrificed to the more powerful intereſts of the majority. Still, the principle, however neglected, exiſts in the immutable relations of nature. If the neglect, or violation of any rule, natural,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025297_0075_0FCCF3FBEE9A34D0"/>
political, or revealed, were ſufficient to prove, that it was not binding, that it was inapplicable, or that it was abrogated, what one rule would have remained for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of man?</p>
               <p>Monteſquieu, in treating of a ſubject, which led him to make a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſtate of independence, the ſuppoſed ſtate of nature, and a ſtate of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſays, "Liberty conſiſts in not being forced to do a thing, which the laws do not oblige. People are, in this ſtate, only as they are governed by civil laws; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are governed by civil laws, they are free. It follows from hence, that Princes, who live not among themſelves under civil laws, are not free; they may continually force or be forced."<note n="*" place="bottom">Sp. L. B. 26. Ch. 20.</note> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes are, in reſpect to each other, in what is called a ſtate of natural inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. In another place he obſerves, "As men have given up their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, to live under political laws, they have given up the natural community of goods, to live under civil laws; by the firſt they acquired liberty, by the ſecond, property."<note n="†" place="bottom">B. 26. Ch. 15.</note> However defective the above definition of liberty may be, it appears from theſe paſſages, that Monteſquieu differed from
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025297_0076_0FCCF3FD1C839368"/>
other writers, in his opinion of the liberty enjoyed in the two ſtates. He clearly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that man, on entering into ſociety, makes an acquiſition of liberty, without any ſacrifice; or rather, that he thereby ſecures, to himſelf, free from the danger of deprivation, by force, the common rights of his nature. If I am not deceived, what has been ſaid in this ſection, proves the opinion to be well founded, and that all the rights of man are relative to his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They exiſt only in a coincidence with the rights of the whole, in a well ordered ſtate of ſociety and civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>When, therefore, we find an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the natural rights, or liberties of the people patronized by the conſtitution of the ſtate, or admitted in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ought not to excuſe ourſelves from ſearching the cauſe, and applying a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, under a perſuaſion, that the people, from a certain neceſſity of nature, conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in their civil compact, to ſacrifice a part of their natural rights, the better to ſecure the remainder. At the ſame time, we ought to be cautious, how we diſturb the happineſs of the community, by an attempt to exerciſe thoſe rights, which, in the infancy of ſociety, an incapacity to diſcover, arrange, and give effect to the

               <p>THE queſtion, whether Man be origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally depraved—whether a diſpoſition to evil, a reliſh for vice, as ſuch, be a part of his nature, in the preſent ſtate, I leave to be diſcuſſed by the moraliſt, and the divine. I am, here, to conſider his natural powers, his diſpoſition and actions, as they relate ſolely to his political ſtate. Moral writers have gone upon different, and oppoſite ſyſtems, reſpecting the origin of moral evil, and the natural diſpoſition of man, as affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to virtue and vice. Political writers have, uniformly, agreed. From Machiavel to Dr. Price, all have affected, that, in a political character, when entruſted with power, man is totally depraved, wicked, and corrupt; that the utmoſt perverſeneſs, in power, is inherent in his very nature; that he is never good, but through neceſſity.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025297_0078_0FCCF40044D9E5C8"/>
Hence mutual checks, reſtraints, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of powers are found neceſſary to guard againſt the oppreſſion of rulers.</p>
               <p>This, if true, militates directly againſt, what I have all along been endeavoring to eſtabliſh; that man, by the original conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his nature, is fitted for civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or, as I have elſewhere expreſſed it, that Deity has implanted in him the germ of every neceſſary qualification, for that ſtate. Little, however, is man fitted for civil government, if no one is fit to be entruſted with the execution of its powers. Before we admit an opinion, which ſo much vilifies the nature of man, and would, if believed, almoſt tempt one to call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the goodneſs of its author, let us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly conſider the reaſons, upon which the opinion is founded.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, and truly, that every page of hiſtory is pregnant with inſtances of the abuſe of power. The long line of Roman Emperors, with very few exceptions, were ſcourges of the earth.

                     <p>The late King of Pruſſia, was undoubtedly one of the beſt of modern abſolute Monarchs. He was a man of letters and philoſophy.

Yet he was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the moſt flagrant abuſes.

The money was either ſilver bearing the impreſſion of Poland, and worth exactly one third of its nominal value; or ducats, ſtruck in imitation of Dutch ducats, ſeventeen per cent. inferior to the real ducats of Holland. With this baſe money he bought up corn and forage enough, not only to ſupply his army for two whole years, but to ſtock magazines in the country itſelf, where the inhabitants were forced to come and repurchaſe corn, for their daily ſubſiſtence, at an advanced price, and with good money, his Commiſſaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to take the ſame coin they had paid. <hi>By this honeſt and maſterly manoeuvre,</hi> it is ſaid he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the loweſt calculation, <hi>ſeven millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars!!!</hi>"—A crime much leſs mean and baſe, would have gibbeted one of his ſubjects.</p>

their own right, without controul. An effect ſo univerſal, it is ſaid, muſt have a univerſal cauſe in the nature of man. All this is true; and yet I will venture, at the hazard of being thought ſingular, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the common opinion, reſpecting the real cauſe. I apprehend the effect is not ſo generally produced, by any maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, any culpable diſpoſition in the nature of man; but that it is moſtly the effect of ſituation. I do not doubt the univerſality of the effect, or rather, if you pleaſe, of the event, of a conſtant abuſe of power, in certain ſituations. I doubt only of the cauſe. I think the cauſe is of a nature ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from that, which has uſually been aſſigned. I ſuſpect, that it is a little more complex, and, that it is the effect of other cauſes; ſome exiſting in the nature of man, others ariſing from the nature of the power, and the uſual mode of betruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It will, perhaps, be thought, if the effect, in all the extent and uniformity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, be allowed, it is of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to the ſcience of government, what the particular cauſes are. The ſame checks, the ſame oppoſition of powers, will be neceſſary, to guard againſt the abuſe. But let it be remembered, that, in applying a remedy to an evil, little ſucceſs can be expected, if the cauſe of the evil be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025297_0081_0FCCF40A2913FDC0"/>
or miſtaken. It is much more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, where there is a poſſibility, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or prevent the cauſe, than to be obliged to maintain a conſtant ſtruggle againſt the effect, or to be perpetually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in palliating, or diverting its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. According to our different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the cauſe, the remedy applied will be different, and the event more or leſs ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>It muſt be remembered, that man is a complex being. He is by nature conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted with a great variety of paſſions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, powers, and faculties; ſenſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal, adapted to the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of objects, and relations, phyſical and moral. Some of theſe have a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate relation to his individual being and happineſs; yet not ſo as to ſtand oppoſed to ſociety. Others have a more immediate relation to ſociety; yet not to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſelf. He was not made for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence but for mutual connexion, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dependence, and to this, every thing in his nature is, more or leſs relative. On the right diſcernment of moral relations, either ſingly, or in their various combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ariſing from objects, ſituation, and circumſtances, depends the juſtneſs of his moral perceptions; on marking the reſult with preciſion, depends the knowlege of his
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025297_0082_0FCCF40B54909A48"/>
duty, a knowlege of the laws of his nature. He is, from the conſtitution of his nature, capable of impreſſions from an infinite variety of objects, both external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. For the opperations of the mind, by reflection, become objects, and again have their impreſſions. Theſe impreſſions give an equal variety to the modifications of his paſſions, appetites, powers, and faculties, not only ſingly, but in all their various combinations. The reſult of all theſe, conſtitutes the temper, diſpoſition, and character of the man; and from the various modifications, ariſes, in ſome meaſure, the various influence of motives. Were man left in this ſituation, he would be the ſport of blind impulſes. There ſeems to be a neceſſity for a balance, as well as ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of moral action. The power of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, by which he combines, compares, diſtinguiſhes, and marks the reſult, has, by ſome ethical writers, been conſidered as being to man, the balance of his moral powers, and the arbiter of his actions. I think this is not the office of reaſon. Reaſon is rather the hand that adjuſts the balance, limits and extends it, than the balance itſelf. However nice and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical this diſtinction may ſeem, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that it will lead to ſome important conſequences in the economy of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:025297_0083_0FCCF40CCEDE07C0"/>It may be aſked, What is, to man, the arbiter of his actions? What the balance of his moral powers? I anſwer, The moral ſenſe is, in all caſes, the arbiter of moral action. Reaſon is an advocate, to argue, compare, and inform; but to conſcience, or the moral ſenſe, is left the ultimate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. I believe every one will be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of this diſtinction. The remaining part of the ſubject is, indeed, a little intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. I do not deſpair, however of making it intelligible to thoſe, who will attend to what paſſes in their own minds.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved above, that man is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtituted with a great variety of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, faculties, paſſions, and appetites. Theſe are capable, from various impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which the mind is ſubjected, of an almoſt endleſs variety of modifications and combinations, which furniſh to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, different directions, and different degrees of force. To a being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, ſome balance, to prevent the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt capriciouſneſs of conduct, and give him a command of any choice in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome conſtant regulator is neceſſary. A little attention to thoſe faculties of the mind, which conſtitute the reaſoning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; to their operations; to the manner in which they are affected, influenced, and biaſſed, by external impulſes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025297_0084_0FCCDA314A871D38"/>
combinations, will diſcover, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, inſtead of being qualified to ſerve as a balance, has, itſelf, need of a balance, a ſteady principal for its regulation. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, always equal to her wants, has provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch a principle. This is a ſenſe of accountability found in the breaſt of every rational being. Mention was made of this ſenſe, in a former ſection; but I find it neceſſary to examine it with a little more attention.</p>
               <p>Whether the ſenſe of accountability be a diſtinct ſenſe, a branch of the moral ſenſe, or a certain ſtate of the mind, produced by the moral ſenſe, in a perception of certain moral relations, and in a view of certain objects, is not eaſy to determine. I am, however, inclined to believe the latter. In examining this principle of our nature, it will be neceſſary to keep in view the moral ſenſe; the ſenſe, by which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern moral relations.</p>
               <p>Man has, as was obſerved in a former ſection, a paſſion, a deſire, an appetite, call it by what name we pleaſe, for the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of others. He extends it to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent beings, whom he conceives to be, in any way, conuſant of his actions; and its force is increaſed, or diminiſhed, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the relation, or connection, in which he conceives himſelf placed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025297_0085_0FCCF40FD05A0900"/>
to ſuch beings. In the ſame extent, and in the ſame proportion he dreads their diſapprobation, or cenſure. When the moral ſenſe informs him, that his actions are right, he is conſcious, that he deſerves their approbation. On the contrary, when he has done wrong, he is conſcious, that he is deſerving of their cenſure. He is conſcious to himſelf of a feeling of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and diſapprobation of the conduct of others, as he views it to be right, or wrong. Judging from his own feelings, and the expreſſions he meets in others, he rightly expects to find the ſame ſentiments in all. Thus man finds himſelf bound to his duty by a three fold cord of accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,—to God—to himſelf—and to his fellow men. Thus the moral ſenſe, and the ſenſe of accountability, conſtantly operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though not exempt from the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions incident to the nature of man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the balance of his moral powers, and a ſteady principle for the regulation of his actions. Reaſon, by comparing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, marking the reſult, and detecting the impoſitions, to which all the ſenſes, as well external, as internal, are, more or leſs liable, is qualified to adjuſt the balance. Here we may again obſerve, that neither the moral ſenſe, the ſenſe of accountability, or the reaſoning powers, are given in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025297_0086_0FCCF4117B510730"/>
to man. They are but plants in the germ, the growth and improvement of which is to be expected only from a proper cultivation.</p>
               <p>I cannot but flatter myſelf, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, which I have endeavored to make, are intelligible, and the principles fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained. By the aſſiſtance of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, we may, perhaps, be able to throw ſome light on the queſtion concerning the origin of ſo univerſal an abuſe of power.</p>
               <p>The propriety of a man's conduct, will depend, principally, on a juſt diſcernment of moral relations, an accurate perception of what is right and what is wrong in moral action; on the means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſtrength of his reaſoning powers, and a full ſenſe of his accountability, to his Maker, to himſelf, and to his fellow men. In proportion as there is a deficiency in one, or all of theſe, he will be expoſed to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conduct. Every deviation from right, by changing the force of habit to the weaker ſide, ſtrengthens and confirms the bias. He, therefore, who, in life and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would perſevere in virtue, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, how he indulges any deception upon the moral ſenſe, any bias, upon his reaſon, or a relaxation of his ſenſe of accountability. Free a man from his ſenſe of accountabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only, he is left to the dominion of the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025297_0087_0FCCF4142CAFF4E8"/>
paſſions and appetites, and driven precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately into vice; as if, from a watch in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you were ſuddenly to detach the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. That branch of the ſenſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countability, by which man perceives his actions, of right, ſubjected to the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or cenſure of his fellow men, is not the leaſt efficacious in preſerving the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his moral powers. Yet this ſenſe, ſo neceſſary to the moral being, may, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards mankind, be wholly ſuppreſſed, merely by the ſituation of the man. Place a man either above, or below the regard of mankind, and he will no longer feel himſelf accountable to them for his actions. He, who, in ſuch a ſituation, can maintain the guard of his virtue, and ſucceſsfully reſiſt the ſolicitations of his paſſions and appetites; the covert approaches, and the open attacks of vice, is ſomething more than human Such is the original adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of human nature, its parts, connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and dependencies, mutually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and ſupported, from which reſult the laws of moral action, that not a pin can be looſened, without endangering a derang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole ſtructure.</p>
               <p>That political ſituation, which places a man, in any degree of independence on thoſe, over whom he exerciſes a power, in the ſame degree cheriſhes the emotions of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:025297_0088_0FCCF415BA2383B0"/>
pride. It transforms that, which, before, was only a laudable contempt of what is low, mean, and unworthy the man, into haughtineſs, under the name of grandeur. It excites a contempt for men, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes thoſe ſentiments, which ſubjected him to their approbation, or cenſure. Such has been, more or leſs, the ſituation of all hereditary Monarchs on the globe; of all ariſtocrats, and ariſtocratical bodies; of all men in power, who have had, or conceived themſelves to have the ability of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their power, independent of thoſe, over whom it was exerciſed; in a word, of all thoſe, who hold their power in contempt of the people. A ſituation, not indulged to man, by the laws of his nature, and which Providence has, often, hitherto with little effect, warned him, by the pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, not to entruſt to any one of the race. The wonder is, not, that men, in ſuch a ſituation, ſhould have been guilty of ſo many vices, but that they ſhould have exhibited even a few virtues. Could we ſtrip the actions of Princes and Nobles, of the eclat of character, how few have been theſe virtues, we ſhould be informed, in every page of their hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Inſtances of conſtant and flagrant abuſe of power, by men, thus ſituated, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrably prove, that it is dangerous to exceed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025297_0089_0FCCF418121D63E0"/>
the limits of our nature, to ſtep beyond the reach of its laws; but they prove no ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal malignity in man. In a different ſituation, within the limits aſſigned by the laws of human nature, men have adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the powers of government, with the greateſt abilities, and the moſt exalted vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, for the ſole good of the community. May we not inſtance more than one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the United States of America? In ſituations, in which rulers have held themſelves fully accountable to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people, for the exerciſe of the powers, with which they were entruſted, they have conducted with as much integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and virtue as have been exhibited in the more private ſcenes of life. It muſt be allowed, indeed, that few ſuch ſituations have yet been deviſed by political wiſdom. When a people are capable of forming a conſtitution of government upon natural principles, and eſtabliſhing a power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration within the limits aſſigned to man by the laws of his nature, they will be ſecure againſt the danger of any exorbitant abuſe. Care muſt always be taken to guard againſt all independence in the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, on the ſentiments of the people, and to provide, that they ſhall adminiſter, not their own power, but the powers of government.</p>
               <p>If theſe obſervations be juſt, whatever
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025297_0090_0FCCF41A14C31FE0"/>
human inſtitutions may have done, nature has not diſqualified man for any of the functions of civil government.</p>

               <p>AGREEABLY to the plan of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sketch, one queſtion only remains for diſcuſſion. Whence ariſes the neceſſity upon man of adopting civil laws and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment?—As was before obſerved, ſome have thought, that the neceſſity aroſe from the perverſeneſs ſolely of human nature. They aſſert, that men have, inherent in their nature, a reliſh for vice, an original propenſity to evil; to reſtrain the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which, they were laid under a neceſſity of civil government; that true virtue, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine benevolence, would have led them, happily, through the moſt complicated ſcenes, which could have fallen to their lot in ſociety. How the account ſtands between them and their Maker, it is not my preſent purpoſe to enquire. I ſhall only obſerve, that their civil and political
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:025297_0091_0FCCF41B52998920"/>
conduct, does not avow a conſciouſneſs of ſuch depravity of nature. They appear, in all caſes, where no particular bias of paſſion or intereſt is diſcoverable, to have full reliance on the juſtice, integrity, and veracity of each other.</p>
               <p>Some, who have had leſs gloomy views of human nature, have holden, that the neceſſity ariſes from the weakneſs, only, of individuals, requiring mutual aid, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their mutual wants. This would, however, lead no farther, than the ſocial ſtate. It would not, alone, induce the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of civil government. We have ſeen, that man, by his natural conſtitution, was intended for the latter ſtate. We ſhall now find, ariſing from his nature, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for adopting it; but a neceſſity of a very different kind from any thing, which has been ſuggeſted.</p>
               <p>Men have a reliſh for ſociety. It is the ſcene of their improvements, and the great ſource of their happineſs. Still no goodneſs of heart can enable them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy its benefits, without an eſtabliſhment of laws.</p>
               <p>Perception, conciouſneſs, and volition, or thoſe powers, which originate, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect external action in men, belong to them, individually. A ſociety conſiſting of any number of individuals, can have no
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025297_0092_0FCCF41D599C03D8"/>
common united perception, conſciouſneſs, or volition. Could this be the caſe, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety might will, and with a ſingle act of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, direct, and controul the actions of all, and every member, with the ſame eaſe and regularity, with which an individual directs, and controuls the motions of his own body, and its members. But this is denied to man in the aggregate, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very combination of ſociety. The will of a ſociety is made up of the individual wills of its members.</p>
               <p>Had man been formed with faculties, which might have enabled him, with an intuitive glance, to penetrate, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend as they ariſe, the individual wills of all the members of the ſociety, and of all, whoſe conduct, might in any way affect it; to penetrate and comprehend the paſſions, appetites, and purſuits, of every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; in a word, to comprehend all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by which God governs the actions of moral agents; were he endued with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſufficient to arrange the whole, ſo as to prevent any individual interference; goodneſs of heart and firmneſs of mind, to enable him to purſue the arrangement; in ſuch a ſtate, both of knowlege and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he would ſtand in no need of civil laws, or rules preſcribed by common conſent, for the regulation of ſocial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025297_0093_0FCCF41ED520B4E8"/>
But ſuch a ſtate falls not to the lot of any finite being.</p>
               <p>Our poſitive knowlege is, only partial, of the preſent and paſt, depending on act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and accurate obſervation. There is, however, given us ſome clue to the future. We are able to perceive certain relations of cauſe and effect. As far as experience leads, we find a uniformity in the courſe of nature. We diſcover ſome of the cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſome of the laws, by which phyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical effects are produced in a regular chain. Of others, we are wholly ignorant, or have, at beſt, but an imperfect glimpſe. Much more imperfect is our knowlege of the cauſes, which produce and vary human ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſubjected to the influence of motives, to the choice of the agent, and to thoſe laws, by which they are governed in a train. In an extenſive ſociety, individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als can have but a limited knowlege, even of the preſent actions of the whole. Their knowlege of the intentions and cauſes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the future actions depend, is much more limited. We are able to gain ſome knowlege of the leading principles of actions, of the motives which generally prevail, and the ſpecies of action, which they will produce, in certain characters, and in certain ſituations. To deſcend to every ſituation, every character, and thence
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025297_0094_0FCCF420F77868B0"/>
to learn fully, the particular influence of motives and the individual actions, which will follow, in each, is beyond the reach of human ſagacity. In a ſociety compoſed of any conſiderable number of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and in a ſtate of any conſiderable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, there will be many, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſituations. The influence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives upon individuals, will be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. They will have a variety of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct intereſts, and purſuits, and thoſe, not at all, or very imperfectly known to each other in their origin. However innocent and right, thoſe intereſts and purſuits may be, when conſidered ſeparately, they will, by frequent, though unintentional inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and oppoſitions, form a ſcene too intricate for the powers of the human mind to evolve. Could we ſuppoſe every perſon in the ſociety to be actuated, by principles of the moſt diſintereſted benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and the moſt accommodating ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the whole time muſt be conſumed in compromiſe. None could be left for action.</p>
               <p>Without a ſocial perception, conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and volition, with any goodneſs, and with any wiſdom, ſhort of infinite, the ſtate of ſociety would, at beſt, be a ſcene of inextricable confuſion. To Remedy this confuſion, nature has pointed out to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025297_0095_0FCCF421D8E02618"/>
man, the neceſſity of civil eſtabliſhments, and the promulgation of laws. Here is a proviſion analagous to his nature. By the eſtabliſhent of laws, which the individuals of the community have ſubmitted to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as the rules of their future conduct, they are enabled, with a ſufficient degree of certainty, to foreſee the future intereſts and purſuits of each. By following the line preſcribed, they can avoid every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable interference, or by applying the rule, may remedy the inconvenience. In no other way, is it poſſible to connect a community, either in ſentiments, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts; to unite the public force; to direct it to the attainment of any common good, or to the avoiding or repelling of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon evil. In no other way is it poſſible to give any ſecurity to public or private rights.</p>
               <p>Still men are imperfect. They will be guilty of deviations from the rule, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the law, and infringements of each other's rights. This will happen, ſome times, thro' ignorance of the law, or of the right; an ignorance, which ariſes from weakneſs in judging, or inattention in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining. Sometimes, it will happen thro' the prevalence of intereſt, or the violence of paſſion. Therefore, to give the laws a compulſory force, and to ſecure a general
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025297_0096_0FCCF423B8C20B68"/>
obſervance, they muſt be ſo calculated, that every member of the community ſhall find a convenience, in the obſervance, and a certain inconvenience, in the neglect or violation. Hence ariſes the neceſſity of penalties. Theſe penalties are, from the weakneſs of men in diſcerning tendencies, and their conſequent liability to vice, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enhanced. Hence alſo ariſes the neceſſity of ſubordination, and of civil rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to give activity and efficiency to the laws. In a ſtate of greater perfection, than is to be found, in the preſent ſtate of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a greater perfection of knowlege and virtue, penalties may make a leſs formidable appearance; but, in every ſtate, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of penalties will equally exiſt.</p>
               <p>In a community compoſed of a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, in a ſimple ſtate of manners, and of property, the motives to action are few; conſequently, there is little activity of individuals. A few ſimple rules, moſtly adopted and ſupported by cuſtom, and frequent conſultations, upon preſent emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, ſupply the place of a more regular polity. They are the firſt rude eſſays in civil inſtitutions. Still, in every ſtate of morals and manners, a neceſſity of known and eſtabliſhed rules equally exiſts. On the whole, we may ſafely conclude, that no order of beings, ſhort of infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025297_0097_0FCCF424E4E61738"/>
in wiſdom, as well as goodneſs, can ſubſiſt in ſociety, without an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of government and laws.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025297_0098_0FCCF42733C9F328"/>
before they were able to diſcover, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range thoſe laws of their nature, which lead to a ſafe and happy eſtabliſhment, upon natural principles. It has paſſed into a proverb, that any government is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anarchy—a ſtate of individual inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</p>
               <p>The general circumſtances and manners of the age have prevailed to general eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, in forms of government. The general circumſtances and manners of a people, have prevailed to particular eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments. In the very early ſtages of ſociety, while ſimplicity in manners, in knowlege, in wants, and in means, prevails, there is, always, a great degree of equality among men. The paſſions, which, in ſome of the following ſtages, lead to inequality, rarely exerted, hold, nearly an equal tenor. Every thing is enjoyed in common. This ſtate is a kind of natural republic, ſuited to the infant ſtate of humanity. It has been obſerved, that this is a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but the nature of man points him to improvement. A perpetual continuance of a nation in this ſtate, would be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, as perpetual infancy to an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.</p>
               <p>In the progreſs towards maturity, the avenues to knowlege are diſcovered, by circumſtances, accidental to man. He
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025297_0099_0FCCF4C8B73623D8"/>
cannot, from the limitation of his powers and faculties, proceed on generals. His progreſs is in particulars. One diſcovery opens an unexpected avenue to others. Proceeding thus by particulars, it is clear, that the progreſs of knowlege muſt be ſlow, and the views exhibited to the mind neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily partial. Objects, in the progreſs, ariſing ſingly, and ſurpriſing by their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, have a powerful effect upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improved mind. Accordingly the few paſſions, which they are calculated to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, are powerfully inflamed. The moral ſenſe, and the reaſoning powers can never be in advance. They, neceſſarily, purſue at a diſtance. Such is the progreſs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; ſuch the boiſterous youth of humanity; ſuch the difficult paſſage from ignorance to the knowlege of truth, through a wilderneſs of errors. Hence the moral balance is, frequently loſt, and a violent ſtate of the paſſions, which gives a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity to the manner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ſucceeds. Both the vices and the virtues are more prominent. There happens a frequent change of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but ſeldom for the better. The change ariſes from the prevalence of one kind of paſſion or appetite, and a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of different objects of gratification. It is a change from one mode of violence to another. Violence is ſtill the great
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025297_0100_0FCCDA398B4F2FF8"/>
characteriſtic. Hence, we find a reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of monarchy and ariſtocracy, in the paſſions. In this ſtate of ſociety, men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unavoidably, fall into a monarchy, or an ariſtocracy in government; inſtitutions of violence, for the reſtraint of violent paſſions.</p>
               <p>Men proceeding, gradually, in improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though, with frequent digreſſions, and retrogradations, to what may be called a ſtate of ſocial manhood, the natural paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, from a more general acquaintance of the mind with objects, are brought more equally into exerciſe, and form a mutual check on the violence of each other. The reaſoning powers, by conſtant and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive employment, acquire acuteneſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and ſtrength. The moral ſenſe, and the ſenſe of accountability, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater degree of aſcendency. It is perceived, that happineſs conſiſts, not in exceſs, but in equable enjoyment; and, that the violent indulgence of one paſſion, excludes the gratification of the reſt. Hence proceeds a moderation. In this ſtate, there is more gratification, and leſs violence. The happineſs, which men experience, in ſocial intercourſe; a more extenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the original conſtitution, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their being, and the harmony of general laws, thence reſulting, open a new

ſcene in ſociety, and prepare them, in a good meaſure, to rejoice in a reciprocation of rights, and a mutual compromiſe of intereſts.</p>
               <p>Such a ſtate of ſociety and manners, gives a more general operation to the laws of ſocial nature, which I have endeavored to elucidate, and ſuggeſts the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of government upon the ſure baſis of natural principles.</p>
               <p>Is it not probable, that certain degrees of improvement, in ſcience, in morals, in manners, and ſentiments, will tend to an abolition of every other form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to the eſtabliſhment of Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic Republics,<note n="*" place="bottom">By <hi>Democratic Republic,</hi> in theſe Sketches, is, generally, meant, a Repreſentative Democracy.</note> in which alone, we have reaſon to believe, from the obſervations made above, natural principles can have any general operation? Not, indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a ſtate will directly ſuggeſt theſe principles; but it will lead the people to a diſcovery of their rights as men, and the abuſes, which they have ſuffered from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and tyrannical impoſitions, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from inſtitutions, which were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of neceſſity during their pupilage. Such a diſcovery will lead them to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of original principles, and ſuggeſt, as the only means of ſecuring a free and

equal enjoyment of their rights, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of placing the exerciſe of the powers of government, within the limits, which the God of nature has preſcribed.</p>
               <p>In a different ſtate of ſociety, before men had arrived at theſe general and equal improvements, an impatience under all reſtraints, added to frequent oppreſſions, has ſuggeſted a wiſh for popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but whenever, in this ſtate, it has been introduced, the violence of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, manners and ſentiments, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the government violent, fluctuating, and almoſt conſtantly tending to its own diſſolution.</p>
               <p>By tracing into exerciſe, in governmental eſtabliſhments, thoſe principles, which have been diſcuſſed in the preceeding Sketches, and marking their operations, we ſhall be able to diſcover their coincidence with the rights of man. We may, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, be able to diſcover and prevent the admiſſion of principles, which are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the conſtitution of nature, but have their origin, in adventitious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; in ignorance, violence, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>The ſcience of government has ſhared the ſame miſsfortune, which has ſo much perplexed the ſcience of divinity, and the ſcience of morals. Men have generally began the two latter, where they ſhould

For them they aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all power, all right, and transferred all duty to the part of the ſubject. Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their doctrines, every enjoyment on the part of the ſubject, was an indulgence flowing from the clemency of the Prince. They have conſidered, that he was the ſource, the ſole proprietor of all right, of all honor, of all juſtice; and dealt them out to the ſubject at his ſovereign pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The revolutions, which have happened, among the nations of the earth, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and in government, have, by degrees, opened the eyes of mankind. They have, in ſome inſtances, learnt, and have even dared to aſſert, that all legitimate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is founded in the rights of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that it is an inſtitution for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and happineſs; that the ruler has no right as a man, beyond that of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery individual; and that the power, which he exerciſes, is not his power, but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and right of the people, entruſted for their benefit. A ruler may be a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man. He may diſcover his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in the exerciſe of the power, with which he is intruſted. It may give a luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre to his character, a facility to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and render him more worthy
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025297_0105_0FCCF42D73228F98"/>
of the truſt. But he can never indulge to the people a right, of which they are not the original proprietors. The time ſeems to be at hand, when, among many nations, the clemency of the Prince will become as contemptible, as the diſpenſing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope, and will be deemed equally an inſult on the common ſenſe of mankind.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to treat of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of government, it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take a ſummary view of thoſe rights of man, to ſecure the free, equal, and legitimate enjoyment of which, is the principal object of civil inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take the liberty to uſe the words of Mr. Paine, to which I ſhall add a ſhort comment of my own:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Natural rights are thoſe, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to man in right of his exiſtence. Of this kind are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind. And alſo all thoſe rights of acting as an individual for his own comfort and happineſs, which are not injurious to the natural rights of others. Civil rights are thoſe, which appertain to man in right of his being a member of ſociety. Every civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il right has ſome natural right preexiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the individual; but to which his individual power is not, in all caſes,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025297_0106_0FCCF42E944CABA8"/>
ſufficiently competent. Of this kind are all thoſe, which relate to ſecurity and protection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He then goes on to diſtinguiſh between the natural rights, which man retains, after entering into ſociety, and thoſe, which he depoſits, according to his view, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtock, as a member of the ſociety.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The natural rights, which he retains, are all thoſe, in which the power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute is as perfect in the individual as the right itſelf: Among this claſs are, as is before mentioned, all intellectual rights, or rights of the mind; conſequently, Religion is one of thoſe rights. The natural rights, which are not retained, are all thoſe, which, though they are perfect in the individual, the power to execute them is defective. They anſwer not his purpoſe. A man has a natural right to judge in his own cauſe; and ſo far as the right of the mind is concerned, he never ſurrenders it. But what avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it him to judge, if he hath not the power to redreſs? He therefore depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits this right in the common ſtock of ſociety, and takes the arm of ſociety, of which he is a part, in preference and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his own arm. Society grants him nothing. Every man is a proprietor in ſociety, and draws on the capital, as a matter of right.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:025297_0107_0FCCF431296D2210"/>Theſe obſervations are, in a general view, excellent. They are not, however, in every point, juſt. Mr. Paine's genius does not, always, admit of accurate reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either in diſcovering principles, or in tracing conſequences. But what is often of more value, he ſeizes his object by an intuitive glance, and is generally happy in exhibiting it to others in a ſtriking point of light.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of judging is relative to the rights of juſtice, and comes in for the ſake of thoſe rights. Men have, reciprocally, a right to demand juſtice of each other, and are reciprocally bound, in duty, to make an adequate ſatisfaction for injuries. The right of judging amounts to a right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding, what is juſt between one individual and another; a right of determining, what ſatisfaction ought to be made for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and in what manner. The judge is equally bound to judge juſtly. But, ſuch we know, for a general rule, is the nature of man, that he is incapable of judging juſtly, that is, impartially, in his own cauſe. In all matters, which depend on a right of mutual compromiſe, he is the only judge of his own intereſt, and an actor in his own cauſe. In repelling preſent injuries, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent invaſion of his own rights, he has a right to judge, both of the means, and the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:025297_0108_0FCCF4325DA03E68"/>
meaſure of defence; and this from neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But he muſt judge rightly, that is, agreeably to the occaſion, at the peril of becoming an aggreſſor. The right is not independent, and without appeal.</p>
               <p>There is, therefore, a deficiency in point of capacity to judge, as well as in point of power to execute. From a little conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, it will be evident, that this right of judging in his own cauſe, is a temporary right, entruſted to man from neceſſity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, until he ſhall have arrived at a maturity to be capable of comprehending and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into full operation that law of his nature, which makes him accountable to the judgment of others, and which dictates, in all controverſies, a ſubmiſſion to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judge. Every one, as well the party injuring, as the party injured, has a right to an impartial and juſt deciſion; and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has pointed out the means of obtaining it. The right of juſtice is perpetual. The right of judging, with a view of compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſatisfaction, is only incidental, and comes in, leſt there ſhould be a failure of the former. When men become capable of providing for a regular adminiſtration of juſtice in government, that right, which was deſigned to be temporary, ſo far as ſuch proviſion is made, ceaſes of courſe. It cannot be ſaid, with propriety, to be
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025297_0109_0FCCF434F7235370"/>
given up, by any act of the individual, or thrown into the common ſtock of ſociety. Such rights may, as it reſpects ſociety, be well denominated juvenile rights. In the progreſs of ſociety towards maturity, the ſame thing happens to theſe rights, which happens to the juvenile paſſions and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of an individual. Many little paſſions and appetites exiſt in infancy, and in early youth, which, though proper and neceſſary to that ſtate, are nevertheleſs unbecoming the ſtate of manhood. They are never given up, by any ſpecific act of the mind, but agreeably to the conſtitution of nature, they give place, in the progreſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, to paſſions and appetites proper and neceſſary to an advanced ſtate, and one after another become extinct.</p>
               <p>I am apprehenſive that the legal notion of the neceſſity of a conſideration to the validity of a contract, firſt introduced, or at leaſt, has ſupported the opinion, that men, on entering into ſociety, give up a part of their rights, as a conſideration for the ſecurity of the remainder. Writers on government have been anxious, on the part of the people, to diſcover a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given for the right of protection, and the right of juſtice. While government was ſuppoſed to depend on a compact, not between the individuals of a people, but
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:025297_0110_0FCCF43564EBFB08"/>
between the people and the rulers, this was a point of great conſequence. But it can be of no conſequence, when it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that government is produced by the individuals entering into a compact among themſelves for that purpoſe. We have no occaſion to look for any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the duty of obedience to the laws, on the one ſide, or, an equal and juſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, on the other, but the inviolable obligation ariſing from the laws of ſocial nature.</p>
               <p>Nature has pointed out civil government as a mean, not an end; a mean of ſecuring the greateſt quantity of happineſs to all, with the leaſt poſſible inconvenience to individuals. Formed as man is by nature, for ſociety and civil government, he is in a ſolitary ſtate, or a ſtate of independence, too emphatically, called the ſtate of nature, excluded the benefit of moſt of the laws of his nature; the free enjoyment of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole of his natural rights, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe, which are connected with his individual exiſtence.</p>
               <p>The greater part of his rights are not excluſively, and independently, in himſelf. They ariſe in ſociety, and are relative to it. Antecedently to that ſtate, they could exiſt only potentially. The rights of all have a reciprocal relation to the rights of each,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025297_0111_0FCCF439281D0718"/>
and can never be rightly apprehended, diſtinct from that relation. Thoſe rights, which Mr. Paine calls the natural rights of man, are more independent, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately united to his being, like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of his individual exiſtence. — Thoſe, which he calls the civil rights of man, are the children of his nature, the iſſue of the ſocial union, to which he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, invited, and impelled, by the laws of his creation. Both are natural rights, and equally guaranteed to him by the laws of his nature. The difference is, that thoſe which he calls natural rights, are independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently perfect, and the enjoyment full in the individual. Thoſe, which he calls civil rights, are relative. They ariſe from the union of men in ſociety. The more perfect the union, the more legitimately natural are thoſe rights, and the more full the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.</p>
               <p>That ſociety, in the adminiſtration of right, grants nothing to any of its members; that every man is a proprietor, and draws on the capital, as a matter of right, is one of thoſe high and immutable truths, which are allowed to be taught, in their full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, only in a democratic republic. In a monarchical, or ariſtocratical government, the very thought would be deemed a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of treaſon.</p>

               <p>FEW governments, ancient or modern, have been conſtituted by an actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact among the people. The powers of government, have, in moſt inſtances, been blindly conferred upon one, or a few indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. They have been aſſumed by fraud, or violence; or through a ſucceſſion of ages, have been ſuffered to accumulate in certain families, and become ſacred in their hands. Thus the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came to be conſidered, as the right and privilege of the rulers, inherent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and paramount to the rights of the people. Men have conducted as though whatever of right, whatever of good was enjoyed, by the ſubject, was to be derived from the condeſcenſion of rulers, a mere conceſſion of clemency. Doctrines like theſe have, in all ages, by the intereſted po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the ambiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us few, been artfully, and but too ſucceſsfully inculcated on the people. From this ſource has been deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025297_0113_0FCCF43C43E88CA0"/>
the doctrine, of the preſent perfection of government, the infallibility of rulers, and the divine right of Kings.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the people, from a dread of the horrid oppreſſion, which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, accompanies ſuch abſurd concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of power, have, at times, plunged into the extremes of anarchy and popular violence. They have been driven to a feeling, rather than a rational inveſtigation of their rights. They have found it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to diſtinguiſh clearly, in the exerciſe of power, between a perſonal right, and a mere betruſtment. They have found it ſtill more difficult to eſtabliſh any laws of accountability, which might operate to prevent a conſtant abuſe, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſort to violent meaſures. Thus embarraſſed, they have frequently balanced between the horrors of tyranny, and the licentiouſneſs of faction. Hence were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, at Athens, at Rome, and in many other governments, perpetual vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the violence of the rulers and the violence of the people.</p>
               <p>Neither the Greeks nor the Romans had any accurate notions of liberty, and the natural rights of man; of thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from which reſult the ſacred laws of his nature. From the ignorance of their lawgivers in theſe points, which was, indeed,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025297_0114_0FCCF43D9669E658"/>
the ignorance of the age, there were always radical defects in their governments. In all their ſyſtems, they made little or no diſtinction, between the laws of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by which the ſtate is organized, and its efficient powers directed and limited, and the laws of property and perſonal rights. And yet, without a nice attention to this diſtinction, liberty can never be permanently ſecured.</p>
               <p>An examination of the various conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of government, which have exiſted, or ſtill do exiſt in the world, falls not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly within my preſent plan. My deſign is to attempt a ſketch, only, of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional principles of government; as founded in the principles of natural law, in the moral and ſocial nature of man; and to point out the general operation and tendency of theſe principles in exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Whenever men happen in ſociety, they, naturally, and from an unavoidable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, the nature of which has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, fall into ſome kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nature, however, produces few things in perfection to man. Much is left to his choice, and the improvement of his rational powers. Whatever may have been the mode of originating and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing government, in the infancy of ſocieties, and of knowlege, it is now, in every free &amp;
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:025297_0115_0FCCF43F1A1FA328"/>
enlightened nation, admitted as fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that all legitimate government origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates in the free conſent of the people; that to produce a rightful government, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, among themſelves, muſt enter into a mutual compact for that end. Not that we are to ſuppoſe it neceſſary to its validity, that each individual, in the propoſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, ſhould conſent to every article of the compact. Men are by nature ſocial beings. In determining the mode, in which any people ſhall enjoy the benefits of their ſocial nature, it is clearly a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of natural law, that, upon a fair diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the minority, if they chooſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue within the limits of the ſociety, ſhall be bound by the deciſions of the majority.</p>
               <p>In the exerciſe of this right of free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by the people, agreeably to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples now laid down, conſtitutions of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment are formed. The conſtitution is no other than the fundamental laws made and ratified by ſuch compact, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of organizing the government, and eſtabliſhing the neceſſary powers. The intent of theſe laws is to direct, in what manner, and to what end, the conſtituted powers ſhall be exerciſed; how thoſe, to whom the exerciſe is entruſted, ſhall be holden accountable; and to limit thoſe powers, by preciſely marking the rights,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025297_0116_0FCCF4429ACCEA88"/>
which are inherent, and unalienable in the ſocial nature of man, the mutual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exerciſe of which does not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with individual rights, or obſtruct the due exerciſe of the powers of government, for the common good. This has been found neceſſary, not becauſe the people are preſumed to have ſubmitted to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted powers every right, not expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but becauſe it has been found diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, if not impoſſible, to mark the powers themſelves, with preciſe, unequivocal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>
               <p>The laws of the conſtitution, as Mr. Paine has juſtly obſerved, are to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what the laws made by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is the civil laws, are to a court of judicature. A court of judicature is bound by the laws, but has not the power, either to make or alter them. In like manner, the government, that is, thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized bodies, who are entruſted with the powers of government, are bound by the conſtitution, but have no power, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make, alter, or control, any of its laws.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of laws, for the happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of ſocial and civil intercourſe, has already been obſerved. In a ſcene, where there is a complication of rights, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and ſecured, a great variety of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025297_0117_0FCCF44616A1D6A8"/>
paſſions, to to be reſtrained and directed, the neceſſity of conſtitutional laws, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to which the powers of government ſhall be exerciſed, are no leſs obviouſly neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The conſtitutional laws ought to have a certain relation to the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to be founded in principles deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſolely from thoſe laws. From the ſame ſource are to be derived the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principles, of the conſtituted powers, and thoſe principles, by which they are limited, reſtrained, and directed to the ends of their inſtitution. To give activity to theſe powers, the conſtitution ought to deſignate, not the perſons, who ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the exerciſe, but the mode of their appointment, and in what manner they ſhall be amenable for their conduct in the adminiſtration. From the manner in which the conſtituted powers are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and the immediate objects of their exertion, naturally ariſes a diviſion into a legiſlative, executive, and judiciary. It is the buſineſs of the legiſlative to form ſuch laws as may, in a due proportion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the actions of the whole, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of public meaſures, and intereſts; as may unite the forces of the community, and direct them to the attainment of thoſe important objects of public utility, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025297_0118_0FCCF449EBE0D960"/>
neceſſity, to which the united force of the whole is alone adequate. It is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to enact ſuch laws, for the regulation of individual conduct, as may prevent an interference of individual claims and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and ſecure right and juſtice to the citizens in their private intercourſe. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame head comes a proviſion, for the aſcertainment and reparation of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whether public or private, and for ſecuring a general obſervance of the laws, by adequate ſanctions, by penalties to be inflicted for every neglect or violation.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of the judiciary is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide on the laws, by interpreting, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them to particular caſes, and to give preciſe information, upon whom, in what degree and manner, and to what purpoſes the executive power ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, either for the reparation of injuries, or the puniſhment of offenders.</p>
               <p>It is the buſineſs of the executive to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into effect, the deciſions of the judiciary, in the manner preſcribed by the legiſlature, and the conſtitutional laws. To this branch it belongs, in like manner, to carry into effect many regulations, both of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature and of the conſtitution; and to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent the individuality of the community in public tranſactions.</p>

                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:025297_0119_0FCCF44B4D0505E8"/>There are very obvious reaſons, why theſe powers ſhould be committed to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate departments in the ſtate, and not be entruſted unitedly to one man, or body of men. Different abilities are neceſſary for the making, judging, and executing of laws. They require the exerciſe of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent powers, faculties, and knowlege. No one man ever had a ſufficient extent of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, or verſatility of genius, to attend to the duties of all, at one time, or in a quick ſucceſſion. Such a union muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſion a confuſion of principles, and remedileſs violation of rights. To commit their exerciſe to a ſingle man, or body of men, eſſentially conſtitutes a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, or ariſtocracy, for the time being. By giving them the power of avoiding all conſtitutional enquiry, it places them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a ſenſe of accountability for their conduct. They have it in their power, eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſituation itſelf ſuggeſts to them, views and intereſts, different from thoſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and leaves no common judge between them. It places them, in reſpect to the people, in that ſtate of independence, which is often called a ſtate of nature. In

ſuch caſe, the people, hopeleſs under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſink into a ſtate of abject ſlavery, or rouſed to a ſenſe of their injuries, aſſume their natural right, in ſuch ſituation, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe violence to violence, and take exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary vengeance of their oppreſſors. In a government ſo conſtituted, the frequency of elections, can only aggravate the evil. The rulers, with all the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their hands, will find every inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of corruption and factious violence devoted to their ſervice. They will always have a hope of continuing themſelves in adminiſtration. Should there happen a change of men, a change of meaſures, if attempted, would be of ſhort continuance; the ſame ſituation, and the ſame motives, would, ſooner or later, produce the ſame fatal effects.</p>
               <p>To enter on a public inveſtigation of the conduct of their predeceſſors, would be to ſet an example againſt themſelves.<note n="*" place="bottom">The hiſtory of the revolutions in the Britiſh Miniſtry, who, in this reſpect, are in nearly the ſome ſituation, confirms the truth of theſe remarks</note> In ſuch a confuſion of powers, ſhould any regular attempt be made to call the rulers to account, the immediate agents, and the immediate cauſes of the evils, would prove of difficult inveſtigation.

generally divert the enquiry from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects, and devote only the innocent or the feeble to the vengeance of the law.</p>
               <p>A ſeparation and preciſe limitation of the legiſlative, judiciary, and executive powers, with frequent, free, and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted elections, is the only remedy for theſe evils. Thoſe who exerciſe the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power, muſt be ſubjected to their own laws, and amenable for a violation, equally with the plaineſt citizen. They muſt, by the expreſs proviſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, be confined to the conſideration of general laws, and forever excluded the right of enacting particular penalties, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, or exemptions. Such partial laws are the firſt beginnings of an attack on the equal rights of man, and a violation of the laws of nature. This proviſion, however, ſhould not extend to prevent the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of companies, by act of legiſlation, for the purpoſe of tranſacting certain buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or of proſecuting certain enterpriſes, to which the powers of individuals, from the nature of the thing, are incompetent. In the eſtabliſhment of companies for ſuch purpoſes only, a new power is created, but the right of no individual is infringed. Neither ſhould it extend to a prohibition of forming laws for the encouragement of uſeful knowlege. Authors of books, by
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025297_0122_0FCCF450A35E1B90"/>
which uſeful knowlege is diſſeminated, and of thoſe inventions, which facilitate the labors of life, are entitled to the fruit of their own induſtry, and of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their powers, equally, with other citizens. But ſuch is the nature of their productions, that, without a legiſlative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference in their favor, they muſt remain wholly at the mercy of others.</p>
               <p>The legiſlature may proceed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of tyrannical laws; the judiciary to the pronouncing of unjuſt deciſions; the executive furniſhes the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of tyranny and injuſtice. The executive is, in all caſes, the ultimately efficient power. It is, therefore, very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the executive ſhould be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with as much preciſion, as the nature of the power will permit, and the acts of all its miniſters, rendered as conſpicuous, as may poſſibly be, or, at leaſt, of eaſy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, and the miniſters themſelves made amenable to the ordinary, or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional tribunals, for every abuſe.</p>
               <p>To prevent both legiſlative and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive abuſes, the intervention of an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent judiciary is of no ſmall importance.

All will be equally expoſed by the ſame unjuſt laws, or amenable for an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary execution. The members of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, cannot, from the nature of their functions, be amenable, in their legiſlative character, to any tribunal, but that of public ſentiment. The caſe is different with the members of the executive and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary. They may, with propriety, be ſubjected to trial, for a violation of their truſt, at the bar of a conſtitutional tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved, that a ſeparation, and preciſe limitation of the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſimplifies the duties of its miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. All their acts are, thereby, rendered diſtinct. Enquiry is facilitated, and abuſes readily traced to their criminal cauſes, the particular agents. In addition to this, it gives a degree of energy to the public ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent. Public approbation and cenſure. when directed to a number of men, of whom ſome are known to have acted well, or ill, but the particular agents are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, loſe much of their force. The
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025297_0124_0FCCF455A7F37678"/>
guilty hide their bluſhes in the crowd. Guilt, or rather the ſenſe of guilt, is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in proportion to the number of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates.</p>
               <p>The better to ſecure the accountability of the individuals in the great departments of the government, not only ought the powers of the ſeveral departments to be, preciſely, and diſtinctly, limited; but the ſeveral members ought to be incapable of holding a place in more than one of the departments, at the ſame time. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one department may be eligible to a place in another; but the acceptance of the latter ought to vacate the former. A ſeparation into diſtinct bodies, will be of little avai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the above obſervations are well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the executive branch ought not to have a negative, or any directing power, in the act of paſſing laws. The executive may, however, within certain limits, well have a deliberative voice. Thoſe, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the execution of the laws, will be the centre of information upon that ſubject. They will, more readily than

others, foreſee any difficulty, which may ariſe in the execution. Of ſuch informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the legiſlature ought to be availed.</p>
               <p>The ſame obſervations, nearly, will hold true of the judiciary. The judges, from the nature of their official employment, are informed of the difficulties, which ariſe in the interpretation of the laws, and of thoſe caſes, in which they prove deficient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, or unjuſt in their operation. Such information is highly neceſſary to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative body. The principal members of the judiciary, may, when the particular duties of their office will permit, be, with propriety, united with the head of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive department, to form a council of reviſion upon all laws propoſed to be paſſed by the legiſlature. The buſineſs of this council ſhould be confined, ſolely, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. It ſhould be their duty to give information of all difficulties, which they foreſee will ariſe, either in the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the application, or the execution of the law; and to notice all inconſiſtencies, either in the laws themſelves, or as they relate to the principles of the conſtitution. They ſhould be allowed, in no inſtance, to propoſe any amendments, or to make any leading propoſitions, in the enacting of laws; but ſimply to ſtate to the legiſlature, ſuch objections, as they find to any law, with their reaſons in writing.</p>

               <p>MOST of the political writers of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times, who have had any idea of a free government, have contended for a diviſion of the legiſlative power. They would have, in the legiſlature, one body of men, repreſenting the commonalty; a ſenate, repreſenting the wealthy and more honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the community, and the head of the executive, whether King, Preſident, or Governor, repreſenting the individuality or ſovereignty of the ſtate. Theſe bodies,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025297_0127_0FCCF45B47010B88"/>
for the purpoſe of maintaining an exact balance of the ſeveral intereſts in the ſtate, are to have a mutual negative in paſſing all laws. The balance is to be ſupported, and the happineſs of the people ſecured, by a mutual oppoſition of rights, intereſts, and powers.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to the head of <hi>Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> let us attend, carefully, to examine this point.</p>
               <p>To admit the neceſſity of ſuch a balance, is to admit, that the laws of nature have indulged to certain claſſes of men different rights, and given them diſtinct intereſts in thoſe rights, and that the maintenance of ſuch rights, and intereſts, diſtinct, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to the happineſs of the whole. This poſition is, upon our principles, wholly inadmiſſible. There are, indeed, inequalities among men. Some are ſtronger than others. Some have greater powers of mind. Hence proceeds an inequality of acquiſitions, both in power, and in property. The ſtrong have it in their power to trample on the weak; the cunning, to circumvent the ſimple. But will any one pretend that they have a right to do this? The rights of acquiſition are equal and common to all. The laws of natural juſtice have laid it under this reſtri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion, ſo uſe your own

If the law ſhould give him a monopoly of riches, of power, of honor, and ſecure them to him in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, againſt my claims of juſtice and of merit, it would be a diminution, an unjuſt violation of my right. Theſe are the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling principles of monarchy and ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Men are capable of theſe principles. They are capable of many vices. The former contribute no more to perfection in government, than the latter in moral conduct. It is, ſurely, much better, in the formation of a government, to prevent their very germination, than to maintain a conſtant ſtruggle againſt their evil tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</p>
               <p>In Great-Britain, the balance of power, in three branches, preſerves, what of liberty is to be found among the people. That government conſiſts of a monarchy, an ariſtocracy, and a democracy: that is, two powers, with diſtinct, and excluſive rights. Theſe rights, as far as they are claimed to extend, place the claimants beyond the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025297_0129_0FCCF45FA95DC090"/>
reach of one branch of the laws of nature, the law of accountability to man. If theſe orders have been eſtabliſhed in a ſtate, and are to be ſupported, they muſt be placed in an equal balance. Power muſt be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to power; authority to equal author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, as a mean of ſelf-defence in each. The prerogative of the crown, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the nobles, are ingroſſments on the rights of the people. They are heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and deemed to be inherent in the very blood. Their honors, their privileges, and their crimes, as rulers, and as men, are held to be above the judgment of the people. The powers of the monarch, and of the nobles, which are exerciſed upon the ſame ſubject, the people, often interfere. The reſtraint of one, is the enlargement of the other. Both are equally out of nature. It is rightly conſidered as a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to the people, who has the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Their claims of right and of power are placed in oppoſition; and mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is the natural conſequence. Every compromiſe of their intereſts, every tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary union of their powers, is a conſpiracy againſt the people; who, at times, are juſtly provoked to aſſert their injured rights, againſt the uſurpations of both. As the rights of the monarch, and of the nobles, are hoſtile to the rights of the people, the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025297_0130_0FCCF4619CEF2A60"/>
people are naturally and juſtly enemies to both<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thus there is conſtituted in the government, a perpetual war of each againſt the other, or at leaſt, an armed truce; a truce attended with conſtant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations and ſhifting combinations, to prevent mutual deſtruction. Each party, in rotation, unites with its enemy, for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual defence againſt a more powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>The hiſtory of the Engliſh government, from William the Conqueror, down to the preſent time, is an inconteſtible proof of theſe truths. It is little more than the hiſtory of the uſurpation of the king, and the nobles, upon the rights of the people; ſtruggles between the king and the nobles, for the greateſt ſhare in the uſurpation, and the oppoſition of the people to both. What a ſcene of treachery, faction, and all the horrors of civil war, the legitimate off-ſpring of ſuch a government, does their hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory conſtantly exhibit to our view! From the improvement of the ſocial virtues, theſe conteſts have, indeed, loſt much of their ferocity. They have aſſumed a milder tone. What was formerly attempted by open violence, is now effected by the more ſilent, though not leſs fatal means of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. It is, as the peſtilence that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in darkneſs ſucceeding to the deſtruction which waſteth at noonday.</p>

                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:025297_0131_0FCCF4630B143268"/>The democratic branch, the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people, are the depoſitory, and from their intereſt, the ſole guardians of the rights of the people. But with theſe, from a fatality attending the nature of the government, and the frailty of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, temptations to betray their truſt, and to deſert to the enemies of the people, too often prevail. Falſe notions of greatneſs, univerſally adopted; hope of riſing to the higher orders; and the deſire of riches, which are the neceſſary ſcaffolding of falſe greatneſs, open wide the door to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence means are found to ſilence the boldeſt champion for liberty, and to lay proſtrate the ſtubborn virtues of the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot. Why ſhould the people go ſo miſerably out of the way, to erect powers hoſtile to each other? which cannot ſubſiſt with the common liberty, and which are dangerous to virtue itſelf?</p>
               <p>It has long been a ſubject of wonder to the philoſopher, and a matter of triumph to the friends of deſpotiſm, that thoſe writers, who have gone fartheſt in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches into the nature of man, and in diſcovering the true principles of civil and religious liberty, have found their theories incapable of being reduced to practice, in new eſtabliſhments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:025297_0132_0FCCF465805989E0"/>Locke, who was one of the firſt philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers of his age, and the champion of liberty, was employed by the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of Carolina, to form the plan of a conſtitution for their government. Though the friend of liberty, and of mankind, he had conceived no idea of any other ſecurity to the enjoyment of liberty, than what was to be found in the conſtitution of England. He ſeems not to have reflected, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary prejudices, in favor of ancient cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and even of ancient names: a habit of thinking and acting in a certain train, in meaſures, to which men are familiariſed, render thoſe things eaſy, in an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, venerable for its antiquity, which are utterly impracticable in new inſtitutions. He, therefore, with a view of eſtabliſhing and ſecuring that liberty, which he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt happineſs of a government, created an oppoſition of powers and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts under names and titles, different from thoſe, to which the people had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed in England. The Lords Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were the Sovereign; the newly creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nobility conſtituted an hereditary Houſe of Peers, and the people had their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in a Houſe of Commons.</p>
               <p>The exotic and unaccuſtomed names of Landgrave and Cacique, conferred on the Nobility, inſtead of Earl and Baron, to
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025297_0133_0FCCF46762B596F0"/>
which habit had annexed a degree of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, had an influence to prevent their attaining any portion of that dignity, which the Peerage, under the ſhadow of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, enjoy in England. In this new ſituation, the oppoſition of intereſt, which had been eſtabliſhed, inſtead of proving a ſecurity to liberty, produced nothing but violent animoſity among the contending parties, and a grievous oppreſſion of the people. The event ſoon diſcovered the ſyſtem to be out of nature, and wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable in its operation. Had Locke been fully acquainted with the laws of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countability, and the means of giving them effect in the adminiſtration of government, would he have fallen into ſuch impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abſurdities, in his conſtitution of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina? It is poſſible, however, that he might have been embarraſſed by the particular views of his employers, the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.</p>
               <p>In the difficult paſſage from error to truth, perhaps, the ſtate, which ſucceeds the almoſt total ignorance of ſavages, and which precedes a more general knowlege of the relations of nature; a ſtate, in which the infant and feeble voice of the moral ſenſe, is frequently loſt amid the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of contending paſſions and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, may require, at leaſt, it may endure
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025297_0134_0FCCF46853371CF8"/>
a government founded in violence, and ſupported by oppoſition. The hiſtory of Athens, of Sparta, of Rome, and of many of the more modern ſtates, exhibits the bulk of mankind in this character. A few men have ariſen in every nation, great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their age, the inſtruments of Provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the improvement of the world. To theſe, modern times are indebted for the firſt dawnings of ſcience. As the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors of mankind, their names will be had in perpetual remembrance; but the hiſtory of their times informs us, that they were able to communicate little of their knowlege to the body of the people; to moderate the paſſions, or to influence, in any conſiderable degree, the general ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The governments of thoſe times were as ill balanced, as the paſſions of the people, and for the ſame reaſon. People, in ſuch a ſtate, are keenly ſenſible of the preſent. They are, in general, little capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of adjuſting combinations, or of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering any, but the moſt obvious relations and tendencies. From the character of thoſe times, we have reaſon to conclude, that the violence of government, and the violence of the people, who often deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one ſet of tyrants, to make room for another, and were often guilty of greater abuſes, than thoſe, which they attempted
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025297_0135_0FCCF469FAD3FF60"/>
to reform, did not proceed from the want of a balance in government. It proceeded from a want of knowlege, from the violence of the paſſions and appetites, the weakneſs of the moral ſenſe, and conſequently the ſenſe of accountability, which rendered it difficult, if not impoſſible, to fix any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient barrier againſt the tyranny of rulers, or the licentiouſneſs of the people. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, arguments, drawn from ſuch a ſtate of ſociety, and of manners, in favor of a balance, conſtituted by an oppoſition of powers and intereſts, ought, with caution, to be applied to the preſent ſtate; which is, in ſo many reſpects, very widely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>At this day, great improvements in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in manners, and in morals, have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en place. The art of Printing has rendered the means of diffuſing knowlege, almoſt univerſal. Science is no longer confined to the recluſe. Uſeful knowlege, and uſeful ſcience, are attainable by the maſs of the people. Improvements have litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally begotten improvements. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of many things, which, in former times, was the fruit of long and laborious application, is now imbibed almoſt with the milk in infancy. Many an ancient ſage, in the warmth of his philanthropy, would have exulted, could he have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025297_0136_0FCCF46B64B1A188"/>
that in America, and in many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, the plain huſbandman would, at this day, poſſeſs more knowlege, applicable in human life, more uſeful ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than was to be found in all the ſchools of antiquity.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of imperfection, the abuſe of power will never be wholly prevented; but, when the idea of inherent powers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive rights, and ſeparate intereſts, ſhall, in the mode of betruſtment, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct required of rulers, be no longer ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to their minds, temptations to abuſe will be, in a great meaſure, removed.</p>
               <p>A frequent rotation in all the offices of government, has, by ſome ſtateſmen, of no inconſiderable authority, been eſteemed one of the moſt effectual proviſions againſt an abuſe of power. The advocates for this inſtitution urge, that a rotation in offices has a powerful tendency to prevent the danger, which conſtantly ariſes from an inveterate habit in the exerciſe of power, in any man, family, or ſet of men, on the one hand, and the habit, which the people, on the other, are too prone to acquire, of directing their obedience to particular men or families, rather than to the laws and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of government; that theſe habits become inveterate, in any way, are not ſufficiently checked by the frequency of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025297_0137_0FCCF46D91DE0538"/>
elections, and always counteract the true principles of a repreſentative republic. The experiment, though often made in the republics of ancient Greece, and of modern Italy, has never ſucceeded in preventing the abuſe of power. On the contrary, an eſtabliſhed rotation of offices has ſerved rather to increaſe the rapacity of rulers, and to render the government but the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. The reaſons of this effect, I think, are obvious. Where a rotation is eſtabliſhed, there frequently will, in thoſe, who are brought forward to office, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the want of a thorough knowlege of the buſineſs of their truſt, and a want of dexterity, which is unavoidable to perſons in new employments. But this is of leſs importance.</p>
               <p>An intereſt in the approbation of the people, and a ſtrong ſenſe of accountability to them, in all official conduct is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or rather, the only effectual ſecurity againſt abuſes in thoſe, who exerciſe the powers of government. An inſtitution, agreeably to which the greateſt wiſdom, the moſt diſtinguiſhed patriotiſm, the higheſt integrity of conduct in a ruler, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to the proper reward of his virtue, an expreſſion of the approbation of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, in his re-election to office, diminiſhes the moſt flattering intereſt, which
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025297_0138_0FCCF47010C47718"/>
he ought to have in their favor, and in the ſame degree relaxes his ſenſe of accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the tribunal of public ſentiment. His intereſt is ſeen diverted into another channel. He no longer looks for a public reward, but hopes, either, that his crimes may eſcape detection, or that his rapacity and acts of oppreſſion will furniſh the means of ſtifling future enquiry. An enquiry will ſoon be found to be purſued with leſs zeal, among a ſet of people, who, while they ſucceed to the ſame offices, ſucceed to the ſame views, and the ſame intereſts. In a repreſentative republic, every inſtitution ought to be avoided, which has a tendency to deprive the citizens of a right of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at their election, except in caſes of preſent incompatibility, in offices, men of known abilities, and experienced integrity, or which tends to diminiſh in the rulers, a ſtrong ſenſe of accountability, a perpetual intereſt in the approbation of the people.</p>
               <p>Truth is but one. Errors are infinite. The knowlege of truth tends to unanimity of ſentiment. Errors tend to endleſs divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and factions. Baniſh myſtery from politics; open every channel of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; call for inveſtigation; tempt a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of meaſures, and the public ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be the beſt criterion of what is right, and what is wrong in government.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025297_0139_0FCCF473CC6FEA08"/>
Make the members, both of the legiſlative and executive amenable to this tribunal. Subject them, by elections, as frequently as the nature of the caſe will permit, to the approbation or cenſure of the people. It will then be found unneceſſary to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a rotation of offices, or to create hoſtile powers and intereſts among the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that the people may watch in quiet, while their Lords are contending for the prize.</p>
               <p>Although an oppoſition of powers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts ſeems not to be admiſſible, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rational ground; yet that there ſhould be a diviſion of the Legiſlature, into a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and houſe of Repreſentatives, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly an excellent proviſion.

That man, or body of men, who have formed any plan, are, in ſome meaſure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of correcting the errors, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, which may, at firſt, have interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Their ideas, when arranged, flow ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and almoſt unavoidably in the ſame channel. Thoſe errors and miſtakes, will be much more readily detected by others. This I apprehend to be a very important conſideration, in the legiſlative inſtitution. Still the negative power between the two Houſes, is not to be eſteemed a direct pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of controul, for the purpoſes of mutual defence. It is deſigned to produce ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable diſcuſion, and a more thorough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of public meaſures, and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral accommodation of the laws, to the manners, ſentiments, and intereſts of the people. It is claimed by the citizens, to be interpoſed for their ſake only, not for the ſake of the rulers. It is neceſſary, that each body be ſatisfied of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a meaſure, before it be adopted. If either be diſſatisfied, it is to be no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſued.</p>
               <p>This is the natural conſequence, when two bodies have equal powers. Whenev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they diſagree, there muſt be a mutual

negative. If one can finally determine a meaſure, againſt the opinion of the other, their powers are no longer equal. Their deliberations will not be mutual, nor will they long continue to be amicable. The ſuperior body will bear a difference of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, with a degree of impatience. <hi>Sic volo,</hi>

               <p>THE exerciſe of the legiſlative power by repreſentation, is an improvement of modern times. In all the republics of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greece, and in Rome itſelf, where the citizens had a ſhare in legiſlation, every freeman was a member of the legiſlature, &amp; gave his ſuffrage perſonally, in the great aſſemblies of the people. This brought together a body too unwieldy, even in the ſmalleſt ſtates. In ſtates of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:025297_0142_0FCCF478FA445DD8"/>
where the citizens were almoſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, with the peculiar manners, the limited knowlege, and partial views of their times, they formed a heterogeneous aſſemblage of ſentiments, paſſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, which bade defiance to all hope of compromiſe, by means of rational diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who are little converſant in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, are yet capable of feeling. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we find, in the public har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues of their moſt celebrated orators, and ſtateſmen, very little attention to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation. All their powers of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, were directed to the paſſions, and ſentiments of the audience. The whole vigor of the ſoul was collected to this point. The inſtructions contained in their public orations, ſerves principally to mark the ſtate of knowlege, the manners, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſentiments of the times. The glow of imagination, which they diſcover; the propriety and irreſiſtable force of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expreſſion, which wraps the whole ſoul in attention, have juſtly rendered them the admiration of ſucceeding ages. All this well accounts for the fluctuation of meaſures, in ancient popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They have often, and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, been compared to fluctuations of the boiſterous element. A republican
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:025297_0143_0FCCF47A5DB79AE0"/>
government upon this model, muſt, in a large ſtate, be very inconvenient, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to perpetual revolutions.</p>
               <p>It has been the opinion of many writers, that a democracy can be adequate only to the government of a ſmall territory. They have held, that in this ſpecies of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, population muſt be ſtinted, or the number of citizens, who have the right of ſuffrage, limitted. The firſt is a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging conſideration to ſociety. The latter conſtitutes a more or leſs numerous ariſtocracy. Monteſquieu has adopted this opinion. He ſeems not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that a government purely demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic, could act wholly by repreſentation. In his time, I believe an inſtance of this kind had not exiſted in any independent ſtate. <note n="*" place="bottom">The colonial governments of Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland, before the late revolution, were, in their internal adminiſtration, pure repreſentative democracies.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Speaking of the conſtitution of England, the ſame author obſerves, "The great advantage of repreſentatives, is, their being capable of diſcuſſing affairs. For this, the people at large are very unfit, which is one of the greateſt inconveniencies of a democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy." Repreſentatives, choſen from the various parts of the community, agreeably to a juſt apportionment, are, not only, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025297_0144_0FCCF47BCE3DEB78"/>
of diſcuſſing the affairs of the nation, be it ever ſo extenſive or numerous, but they bring to the diſcuſſion more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the general and particular manners, intereſts, and ſentiments of the people, whoſe happineſs is alone concerned in their deliberations, and diſpoſitions more conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to thoſe manners, intereſts and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than can be found in any other body of men.</p>
               <p>The rights and intereſts of monarchy and ariſtocracy, ever excluſive of the rights and intereſts of the people, ever in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not leſs ſo in a large, than in a ſmall ſtate. In a large ſtate, the objects of their oppreſſions and exactions are more numerous, and may, ſometimes, by dividing, leſſen the burden. But whether the ſtate be great or ſmall, the ſame excluſive rights, the ſame oppoſition of intereſts, the ſame oppreſſions, and exactions, exiſt in kind.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered, in forming a legiſlative body, is the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of electors, and the number and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of repreſentatives. Theſe are not points of eaſy diſcuſſion. They have never been preciſely determined. Some have inſiſted on a qualification in property. Others have extended the right of ſuffrage and of eligibility, to every acknowleged citizen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:025297_0145_0FCCF47E34EEB090"/>In a democratic republic, in which every thing ought to tend to a certain kind of equality, property ſeems not to be a juſt criterion. The individual and ſocial rights of man, are the ſubjects of legiſlative diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, and to theſe, the intereſts of the community are to be referred. The right of property is one of thoſe rights, and gives riſe to a very extenſive intereſt among men. It is a right, however, which, if it meet a too partial indulgence, tends to a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inequality of influence, and with the power and intereſt, ſuggeſts to the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the idea of infringing the rights of others with impunity. The intereſt of ſcience, of induſtry, of commerce, and of the mechanic arts, have an equal claim on ſociety. The proper encouragement of theſe, tends to a more equal diſtribution of the goods of fortune, and to correct the unequal influence of wealth. In a ſtate where, through the prevalence of corrupt principles, the whole property is accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and perpetuated in the hands of a few; where the great maſs of the people are reduced to a ſtate of dependence, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and meanneſs, from which they can never hope to emerge, but by the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their oppreſſors, a general right of ſuffrage, would be dangerous to the few, and for a time, even to the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025297_0146_0FCCF480D609A1D0"/>
In moſt, if not all the governments of the United States of America, where the law equally regards the rights of the rich and the poor; where few are to be found without property, and fewer ſtill without a well grounded hope of obtaining it; where induſtry and economy rarely fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l to procure a competence, and often lead to opulence, no ill conſequences are to be feared from a general right of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage.</p>
               <p>Diſqualifications will, however, in ſome caſes, be found neceſſary. It will, at leaſt, be found expedient to exclude, both from the right of ſuffrage, and eligibility, thoſe, who, for want of age, may be ſuppoſed to be wanting in diſcretion. Certainly the intereſts of virtue and of the public require, that thoſe ſhould be excluded, who, by their crimes, have manifeſted a diſpoſition totally corrupt, and by their conduct declared to the world, that they are no longer to be truſted.</p>
               <p>I am unable to perſuade myſelf, that any diſtinction, in point of qualifications, ought to be made, between electors and candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates. I ſay in general, for a diſtinction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge, which to abilities adds experience and maturity of judgment, may well be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is nothing invidious in the diſtinction. It is an honor yielded by
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:025297_0147_0FCCF48241E54A60"/>
mankind, to a certain degree, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious approbation of virtue. Other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications are moſtly invidious. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, in ſome meaſure, a diſtinction of claſſes. They excite a degree of haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the candidates. The electors feel themſelves degraded, and that their claſs, notwithſtanding their right of ſuffrage, is unrepreſented. If a character for integrity and abilities are the only qualifications for a candidate, they will be more affiduouſly cultivated. Theſe are qualifications, which alone are uſeful to the people, and of theſe the people are the only competent judges. The choice of a worthy character, reflects honor upon themſelves, which they enjoy with the more ſatisfaction, as they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of no reſtraint or limitation in their choice. From theſe conſiderations, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that the right of ſuffrage and of eligibility ought to be the ſame, and limited by no qualification but that of age. If, in any ſtate, other qualifications ſhall be found neceſſary in either, the neceſſity muſt have ariſen from ſome antecedent defect in the conſtitution and laws.</p>
               <p>The number of repreſentatives ſeems leſs capable of a preciſe limitation. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes are very diſcernible, but they are very diſtant. Too numerous a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion verges towards the inconvenience of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025297_0148_0FCCF48367DCBA28"/>
an aſſembly of the people. It incumbers diſcuſſion, and gives an aſcendency to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paſſions, which often, in a numerous aſſembly, through a ſympathetic impulſe, pervade the whole body, like a ſhock of electricity, and irreſiſtably influence the deciſions of the moment. On the other hand, if the repreſentative body are too few in number, their meaſures are liable to be dictated by limitted views and partial inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. Poſſibly we can go no farther than to ſay, that it ought to be ſufficiently nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to probably comprehend all the paſſions, ſentiments, and intereſts, which have a national influence.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations apply equally to the Houſe of Repreſentatives and the Senate. The better to equalize the repreſentation for the Houſe, the State ought to be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into as many diſtricts as there are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives to be choſen. Where no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or more powerful reaſon oppoſes ſuch diviſion, the diſtricts ſhould be apportioned by the number of inhabitants. This will, in general, give the moſt equal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of intereſts. The voters too will act underſtandingly, and with a perſonal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the candidates. Where a number of repreſentatives are aſſigned to a diſtrict of greater extent, every engine of intrigue is commonly put in motion and the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:025297_0149_0FCCF487D5A6E478"/>
are choſen, by the prevailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the diſtrict, to the excluſion of every other intereſt. The mode of election propoſed for the Houſe of Repreſentatives, gives opportunity for an advantageous modification in the election of a Senate. The Senators are to be repreſentatives of the people, no leſs, in fact, than the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the other houſe. It is a very good idea, that the Senate ſhall be conſidered as a national council. This ſuggeſts a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of age, to give maturity to their deliberations. Public meaſures, before they are adopted, ought to be conſidered in every point of light, in which they can affect the paſſions, the morals, ſentiments, and intereſts of the community, both gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and particular. While they provide for preſent accommodation, they ought not to loſe ſight of future improvements. To ſecure a more deliberate diſcuſſion, and a more calm inveſtigation, not only ought the warmth and inexperience of youth to be excluded from the Senate, but the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould be fewer in number, than thoſe of the Houſe of Repreſentatives.

by the firm compoſure of the Senate. In proportion as they are fewer in number, they will be choſen by larger diſtricts. This will produce a different combination of the intereſts, which they repreſent, and exhibit a different and more collected view of the objects of legiſlation.</p>
               <p>To prevent, in the members of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, every idea of an independent power, or of property in their appointments, they muſt be choſen for a limited time. A pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod muſt be fixed, when their exerciſe of power ſhall ceaſe, and leave them only that pre-eminence above their fellow-citizens, which they derive from the public appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. The period muſt be ſufficiently long for completing the ordinary rotine of buſineſs. A year may, in general, be the moſt convenient time. Perhaps, in larger ſtates, the nature of the ordinary buſineſs, the magnitude of the objects which demand the attention of the legiſlatures, and the ſubjects to be diſcuſſed, may require a longer period. Reaſons may likewiſe exiſt for fixing different periods for the members of the Senate, and the members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives. In each, ſome period ought to be fixed, beyond the power of the Legiſlature to alter. Such a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will, on every occaſion, recall their attention to the intereſts and happineſs of the

people. It will place their accountability, conſtantly, in view. It will fix them in a dread of the cenſure, and give them a moſt flattering intereſt in the approbation of the people.</p>
               <p>To render the public ſentiment a more rational, and a more powerful check upon every department of government, it is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, that there be, in the conſtitution of every free ſtate, an effectual proviſion for the diſſemination of uſeful knowlege. No knowlege can be more uſeful to a people, than that, which enables them to manage, or, at leaſt, to judge, with propriety, of their own and the public intereſts. "Let liberty be attended with knowlege." It removes the temptation to abuſe, by taking away the hope of ſucceſsful impoſition. To this end, common ſchools, as well as public ſeminaries, ſhould be conſidered as an important object of legiſlative attention. Let it alſo be a ſacred ſtipulation, that all debates in the Legiſlature ſhall be open. Let effectual meaſures be taken to facilitate their publication in courſe, and to procure them a ſpeedy circulation among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Let there be no reſtraint upon the liberty of the Preſs, no check upon public or private diſcuſſion, but what is impoſed by the manners, morals, taſte, and good ſenſe of the age.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION V.</hi> Of the appointment and accountability of the Executive and Judiciary.</head>
               <p>THE executive is the ultimately effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power in government. For the ſake of diſpatch, of unity of action, and of rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſenting the individuality of the ſtate, in tranſactions with other nations, this power ought to be veſted in one perſon, whom, for diſtinction, we will call the Preſident.</p>
               <p>Some have thought, that the election of the Preſident might, with the greateſt ſafety, be entruſted to the Legiſlature. Others have held, that it ſhould be the ſacred right of the people. There are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable objections to the exerciſe of this right by the Legiſlature. It gives an idea of dependence of the Preſident on the Legiſlature, and intercepts his account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to the people. All elections by the repreſentative body, are liable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and coalitions, which greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence public meaſures. This evil is encreaſed, in proportion to the importance of the election.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="unknown:025297_0153_0FCCF49031D29F98"/>An upright diſcharge of the duties of the executive, is the moſt honorable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the ſtate; an abuſe the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and in none, are the temptations ſo powerful. It ought, therefore, to be guarded againſt with every rational check. At the ſame time, it muſt not be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered as to clogg its neceſſary activity. The good or bad conduct of the executive is, in moſt inſtances of internal adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, immediately felt by the people. To prevent any hurtful coalition, between the executive and the legiſlative body, and to ſubject the Preſident to the controul of public ſentiment, his appointment ſhould be by periodical elections of the people. In more extenſive and complicated gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments ſuch as that of the United States, this mode of electing the Preſident, may be inconvenient, or even impracticable. When this ſhall appear, ſome other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion muſt be made; but care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to prevent all legiſlative interference, in the appointments, unleſs, which will ſometimes happen, no choice ſhall have been made, in the mode preſcribed, and to make it depend as much as poſſible, on the ſentiments of the people.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of the executive, is too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and various to be performed by one man. Many of its duties muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:025297_0154_0FCCF491AFB63FA8"/>
by ſubordinate Miniſters, who are to be conſidered as aſſiſtants to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The appointment of theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls within his province. He will be reſponſible to the public, for their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and abilities, though not for their crimes. He ought, therefore, ordinarily, to be entruſted with their removal.</p>
               <p>Beſides the duties of the executive, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, there are other duties, very neceſſary to an orderly and economi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal arrangement of public meaſures. It will, at all times, be the duty of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident, to inform the Legiſlature of the ſituation of public affairs, of the event of meaſures, which have been adopted, and to recommend to their conſideration thoſe ſubjects, which demand their more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, or more particular attention.</p>
               <p>According to the ordinary rotine of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial buſineſs, it will be the duty of the ſubordinate Miniſters of the executive, when required by the Legiſlature, to give a clear and juſt account of the affairs of their ſeveral departments, to make proper arrangements in thoſe matters, which are committed to their charge, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them with all the neceſſary informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may aſſiſt that body to adopt and purſue a regular ſyſtem, in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal economy, and to conduct with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:025297_0155_0FCCF493F640DEC8"/>
and good faith, as well toward indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual citizens, as in their intercourſe with foreign powers.</p>
               <p>Happily for mankind, it has been found that the exerciſe of the executive power, is ſufficiently capable of preciſe limitation, by known and eſtabliſhed laws. Its Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters may, therefore, be ſubjected to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, before a conſtituent tribunal, to remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and puniſhment, for male-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Impunity ſhould, on no account, be annexed to office or dignity, So far from conſiſting with the good of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it is directly oppoſed to its intereſt and ſafety. A ſtrict adherence to theſe principles, in the conſtitution and admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration of government, will ſecure as great a check upon the abuſe of power, as the imperfection of human inſtitutions will admit. It cannot be too often inculcated, that, to indulge, or rather to create an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of intereſts, on which to found an oppoſition of powers, will, if we may rely on the experience of the preſent and paſt ages, always prove ineffectual to the end of reſtraint, and in a greater or leſs degree, ſuberſive of the rights and liberties of the people.</p>
               <p>An executive council, whoſe advice may aſſiſt the Preſident, in matters of general importance, or doubtful iſſue, appears to
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:025297_0156_0FCCF495531A80C0"/>
be a wiſe and neceſſary inſtitution. From this council, the members of the judiciary are carefully to be excluded. For this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion there are two ſubſtantial reaſons. The firſt has already been mentioned; the neceſſity of a ſeparation between the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative, executive, and judiciary, that each may be rendered diſtinctly accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ſecond is, that their advice will pre-occupy queſtions concerning the legal and conſtitutional rights of the citizens, in which the adminiſtration of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may be involved, and of which, in their official capacity, they are the only proper judges for redreſs.</p>
               <p>There are nearly ſimilar reaſons againſt the admiſſion of either branch, or any member of the Legiſlature, to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. The objections are, that it blends thoſe powers, which, as we have ſeen, ought to be kept diſtinctly ſeparate. It ſhifts the reſponſibility from one to the other, and leaves it leſs clear, who is to be accountable. It is of importance, that there ſhould be an enquiry into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of public officers; that proſecutions ſhould be brought forward againſt the guilty; and that there ſhould, ſomewhere, exiſt a conſtitutional court for their trial. The enquiry, proſecution, and trial, ought, from their importance to the community,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:025297_0157_0FCCF496D88177D0"/>
and the character and ſituation of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be more public and ſolemn, than thoſe, which are eſtabliſhed in the caſe of common offenders. The National Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives have been thought the moſt proper board to inſtitute ſuch enquiry, and to bring forward the accuſations of the public; and the Senate the moſt proper court for the trial of ſuch accuſations. Though this appears not perfectly conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; yet probably no better proviſion can be made. The introduction of an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent tribunal, for the trial of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would have greater inconveniences, and lead to endleſs conſequences. If ſuch be the proviſion for the accuſation and trial of executive officers, certainly it is not very conſiſtent, that the ſame men, or the ſame body of men, ſhould adviſe, and afterwards, on trial, decide upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which had been adopted and purſued in conſequence of their advice. It will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be proper for the Legiſlature to adviſe and direct the Executive to the purſuit of ſome national meaſures, which may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or expedient. Their previous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation may give weight to the meaſures, and a facility to the execution. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, however, ſhould be general, or, in matters, which are conſidered as diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, with the Executive. It ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:025297_0158_0FCCF49B9E977F48"/>
extend to thoſe particular inſtances of conduct, which may become the ground of an impeachment. Upon theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, would it not, if an Executive Council be neceſſary, be more conſiſtent, that it ſhould be compoſed of a diſtinct bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, elected in the ſame manner as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and in like manner amenable for their conduct?</p>
               <p>The ſituation of the Judges, or Miniſters of the Judiciary department, is ſomewhat different from that of the others. The integrity of their conduct has a great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon government. It is indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary to an impartial adminiſtration of law, and the ſecurity of public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate rights. Their deciſions are, moſtly, local, and of individual rights; but the precedents eſtabliſhed by their deciſions, become general rules for the interpretation and application of the laws, which follow the principles of the government. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican governments, the law is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, with a ſpirit of equity, impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and moderation.</p>
               <p>In the mode of performing the duties of the Legiſlative and Judiciary, there is a very material difference. In making laws, a great regard muſt be had to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, manners, and ſentiments of the people, as well as to the principles of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:025297_0159_0FCCF49D86CCA578"/>
The laws muſt be the beſt, which the people can bear. In judging, whether between individuals of the people, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween private perſons and public officers, a ſtrict regard is to be had to the very right and juſtice of the caſe, agreeably to the principles of the conſtitution, and the laws of the land. The Judges ought not to ſtand in awe of the frowns of power, or to be influenced by temporary ſmiles of popular favor. The abilities, integrity, and independence of the Judges, is a ſhield, both to the rulers, and to the people. They give a ſteady nerve to the mild ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of government, and ultimate ſecurity to private rights. That kind of accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, therefore, which is ſupported by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular elections, and which is proper for the members of the Legiſlature, is not proper for a Judge. From the intereſt, which men of property and influence might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in future deciſions, the people would, in the choice, be liable to be miſlead in their judgment of characters. The ſame obſervations will hold of a legiſlative ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in addition to what was above obſerved of elections, in general, by the Legiſlature, that they give riſe to intrigues and coalitions hurtful to public meaſures. In popular appointments, no one holds himſelf reſponſible for the character of the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:025297_0160_0FCCF49EF1742418"/>
perſon appointed. In the Legiſlature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility is, in a great degree, loſt among numbers.</p>
               <p>The appointment, or at leaſt the public nomination, of the Judges, ought to be entruſted to the Preſident, or the head of the executive. His conduct is conſtantly, and ſingly, expoſed to the public view. He will hold himſelf fully reſponſible for the character and abilities of thoſe, whom he appoints to office.</p>
               <p>To ſecure them in that degree of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which ſhall place them above the temptation of a bias, they ſhould hold their office during good behaviour. Their ſalaries ſhould be fixed beyond the power of the Legiſlature to alter, at leaſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, during their continuance in office. For corruption, or male-adminiſtration in office, let them be liable to removal by impeachment in a conſtitutional way.</p>
               <p>There may, however, be ſome things, in the conduct of a Judge, which go to his character, and deſtroy that reſpect and public confidence ſo neceſſary in ſecuring a ready acquieſcence in the deciſion of the Judiciary, and a prompt obedience to the laws. They may, nevertheleſs, be of ſuch a nature, that they cannot be made the ſubject of an impeachment. To remedy this evil, which is, ſometimes, a matter of
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:025297_0161_0FCCF49FD1FC10A0"/>
great conſequence in government, and to impreſs on the minds of the Judges, a ſenſe of the neceſſity of an unblemiſhed integrity of conduct, they might be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on an addreſs to the Executive, from both branches of the legiſlature. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the effect of envy, of intrigues, and the popular frenzy of the moment, it ſhould be made a matter of deliberation. Let it be neceſſary, that two thirds, at leaſt, of each branch concur in the addreſs. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, I apprehend, will hold the Judges ſufficiently accountable. As was hinted above, their ſituation, different from that of other rulers, does not require, or even admit, of the ſame kind of accountability. Their unjuſt deciſions may render them odious, may ſubject them to trial, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and removal; but can add very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to their own emolument or power.</p>

All citizens of Athens had a right, on taking the oath preſcribed, to judge in theſe courts and the number of judges in a cauſe, ſometimes amounted to 500.</note> of the Greeks, had in ſeveral reſpects, a near reſemblance to modern juries. They ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in one form or another, among all the northern nations of Europe, and were by them introduced into all the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments of their conqueſts. They have, however, been preſerved in very few. They are a powerful ſupport of civil lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, and cannot long exiſt in a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wholly arbitrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:025297_0163_0FCCF4A68FA6A720"/>Among the Engliſh, their hiſtory does not reach the antiquity of the inſtitution. It has there been improved, and with the democratic branch of the government, continues the grand paladium of their lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties. From them it is derived to the federal Americans, and makes an import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant part of their civil conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>In mixed governments, like that of Great Britain, the intervention of juries, both in the proſecution of crimes, and in deciſion of private rights, is a principal ſecurity to the ſubject, againſt the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power and influence of the monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and ariſtocratic branches. It is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary in a republic, but for reaſons ſomewhat different.</p>
               <p>In a republic, the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are ſupported, not by force, but by the ſentiments of the people. It is neceſſary to cultivate a ſentimental attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the government. The powers of government are viſible only in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. The mode, in which they are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, either invigorates or weakens the ſentiment. The exerciſe of power is not, in general, directly agreeable to thoſe, who are the ſubjects of it. The adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice, without a view to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, is rather auſtere and forbidding,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:025297_0164_0FCCF4A80DD536C8"/>
than amitable and attractive. <note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtice, when conſidered as a private virtue, that is, the rendering to every one his honeſt due, is directly amitable; when conſidered in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of puniſhments, it is not ſo. The mind is reconciled to it, and acquieſces in it, from a view of the conſequences merely, unleſs, when the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of revenge excites a deſire of retaliation.</note> As more men are capable of feeling, than reaſoning, and all feel before they reaſon, the firſt view is rather unamitable. The Miniſters of juſtice are the objects of theſe feelings. The ideas of unamitable ſeverity daily impreſſed on the minds of the people, are not eaſily corrected by reaſoning on the conſequences. <note n="†" place="bottom">Hangmen and public executioners are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally deteſted. The firſt impreſſions, which their actions make on the mind, impreſſions of inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and cruelty, are never effaced by reaſoning on the juſtice of their actions, or their neceſſity to ſociety.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Juſtice is adminiſtered for the redreſs of ſome evil, either public, or private. The evil is paſt, and ſometimes uncertain, or at leaſt of difficult inveſtigation. The evil, which is inflicted by the ſentence of the Miniſters of the law, is preſent and certain. The people cannot, conſiſtent with an impartial adminiſtration, have a direct controul over them. Theſe conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations have, more, or leſs, a tendency to diminiſh that ſentiment of attachment,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:025297_0165_0FCCF4A99289C9E0"/>
which is ſo neceſſary in a republic. The inſtitution of juries provides an adequate remedy. In this inſtitution, I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend both the grand jury, who are to paſs on the accuſation, and find it ſupported, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any perſon accuſed, can be put on his trial, and the petit jury, who paſs on the final trial, all queſtions, civil and crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal.</p>
               <p>In the adminiſtration of criminal law, the inſtitution of a grand jury has a very leading influence, in a free government.<note n="†" place="bottom">I do not recollect any inſtitution among the ancients, ſimilar to that of a grand jury; nor do I recollect to have met with it in any of the mode<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> To guard the innocent from the infamy and oppreſſion of a public accuſation; and without partiality, without favor, to bring forward the guilty to trial for their crimes, conſtitutes the principal duty of a grand jury. Taken from the body of the people, and having, in the proſecution of offences, no intereſts but the peace and welfare of the community, as far as they are ſecured by the prevention of crimes, they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as a ſhield between the accuſed, and the intereſted paſſions, or malicious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of private proſecutors.

of the law, who, from the nature of their office, may, ſometimes, be ſuſpected of intereſted views, or at leaſt of a want of feeling, gives a facility to the execution of criminal law, and reconciles to the ſentiments of the people, the neceſſary puniſhment of offenders. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the guilty, if, from an oppreſſive partiality in the proſecution, or an undue rigor in the execution, it meets not the acquieſcence of the people, can have no ſalutary effect in ſociety.</p>
               <p>It may be made a queſtion, how far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons injured, ought to be admitted to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute for the end of puniſhing. I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, this will depend much on the ſtate of manners, and the principles of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. In a government, ſupported, in a great meaſure, by force, and in a ſtate of manners, in which the mind is highly inflamed by private injuries, and the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of revenge, is ſatisfied with nothing ſhort of perſonal retaliation, it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to permit the perſon injured to proſecute his revenge, at law, to prevent the fatal conſequences of private malice. To reſtrain perſonal revenge, and ſubject it to general laws, is a great point in the progreſs of ſociety. Still, as proſecutions for the end of puniſhment, by the party injured, have a direct tendency to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

a reſentment of injuries, and to make the law inſtrumental in the exerciſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal enmity, the practice, by no means agrees with a general refinement of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <note n="*" place="bottom">By refinement of manners, is not meant the etiquette of politeneſs merely, which may conſiſt with many traits of barbarous manners.

We ought rather to place a refinement of manners in the ſentiments of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and a general ſpirit of accommodation.</note> or the humane principle of a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic republic. Perſons injured ought to reſt ſatisfied with a full ſecurity in the right of reparation. The right of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be exerciſed ſolely for the prevention of crimes, and to be permitted to thoſe only, who are appointed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by law for that purpoſe, and who are ſuppoſed to be capable of candor and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in their proceedings. The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of admitting common informers, who are to receive a ſhare of the penalty, as a reward for proſecuting, is ſtill leſs to be juſtified. The practice can never be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in any ſtate of manners. In this caſe, the plea of preventing a greater evil by the admiſſion of a leſs, wholly fails. It often ſerves the purpoſe of private malice; always to cultivate a ſpirit of revenge, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminate
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:025297_0168_0FCCF4AEF22E09F0"/>
jealouſies, and private animoſities among the citizens. It is calculated for thoſe governments only, in which the rulers foreſee the puniſhment of their own crimes in the unanimity of the people. Can we then heſitate to pronounce, that in the United States of America, the inſtitution of criminal proſecutions, in the name, and under the direction of private perſons, is contrary to the preſent ſtate of manners, and the principles of their governments? And that the intervention of a grand jury ought to be ſecured in every conſtitution, as the ſacred right of the people, in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for crimes?</p>
               <p>The obſervations made on the inſtitution of grand juries, who, by their intervention between the miniſters of the law, and the people, and their approbation of proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, remove the odium of ſeverity, and reconcile the execution of criminal law, to the ſentiments of the people, apply with more force to petit juries, in proportion as the condemnation is of more conſequence than the accuſation. This is not all. The inſtitution is the beſt which has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, and probably, which can be deviſed by human wiſdom, for obtaining ſubſtantial juſtice, in trials, both criminal and civil.</p>
               <p>The particular province of a jury is to weigh evidence, and to decide upon facts.
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:025297_0169_0FCCF4B04B5A7E80"/>
It is true, that, in every queſtion, juſtice reſults from a combination of law and facts. It is true, alſo, that in a complicated ſtate of ſociety, the law may become intricate, and its application not a little difficult. This, however, can happen, in queſtions only of a civil nature. No crimes are to be made out by a conſtruction of dubious facts, or a doubtful application of law. It is the province of the Judges to explain and apply the law, when it is ſubmitted to them, by the Jury, on a ſtatement of facts. To ſuch ſtatement the Jury are fully competent.</p>
               <p>Will it be thought ſtrange to aſſert, that profeſſional and ſyſtematic knowlege is leſs competent to judge of proofs of fact, than plain ſenſe, converſant only in the common buſineſs of life, and the common characters of men? And yet, to the mortification of the great and the learned, experience has eſtabliſhed this to be generally true. It is not without reaſon, that men acquieſce more readily in the verdict of a Jury, than in the opinion of the Judges, in matters of fact. At the ſame time, there is another conſideration of nearly equal weight. The Judges are viewed as a diſtinct claſs, placed above the common intereſt and common feelings of the citizens. Hence ariſes an idea, though often ill founded, of a diſtinct
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:025297_0170_0FCCF4B274A53410"/>
intereſt, and a general bias upon certain queſtions. Juries are, or ought to be, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the ſubſtantial claſs of citizens. Effectual proviſion ſhould be made to guard againſt every inlet to the corruption of Juries, and againſt the admiſſion of thoſe on trial, who may be ſubject to prejudice, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted views in their deciſions. With theſe precautions, the juſtice of their deciſions will be attributed to the excellence of the adminiſtration. If, at any time, they ſhoud prove unjuſt, it will be attributed to the imperfections of humanity. It will be viewed as a temporary inconvenience, for which the laws are not anſwerable; while unjuſt deciſions made by the Judges, are conſidered as dictated by ſtanding, official prejudices, by intereſt, or ſecret corruption, which, however dangerous, are not eaſily removed.</p>
               <p>From this brief view, it appears, that the inſtitution, in which I comprehend both Grand and Petit Juries, is intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the principles of a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It ſufficiently obviates any danger, which might be ſuppoſed to ariſe from the independence of the Judges, and ſecures the adminiſtration of juſtice, in the ſpirit of impartiality and moderation, the true ſpirit of a free government.</p>

               <p>IT has been ſaid, and juſtly, that there are natural inequalities among men. Some are ſtronger, others are weaker. They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no leſs in their mental powers. Theſe differences frequently depend on the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and organization of the body, and ariſe from cauſes, which began their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration antecedent to the birth. They are, ſometimes, derived through a long line of anceſtors. Men therefore, are not born equal. There are, likewiſe, adventitious inequalities. The ſame object, whether
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:025297_0172_0FCCF4B64DEF8910"/>
phyſical or moral, cannot be exhibited to every one, at all times, in the ſame point of view. The minds of all are not alike ſuſceptible of impreſſions from the ſame object.</p>
               <p>Nature has opened a great variety of purſuits, which are lawful, and which are, more, or leſs, neceſſary to men. Different men are neceſſitated to different purſuits. No one man is equal to the taſk of all, nor do his occaſions require it. The conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all, mutual intereſt, and mutual accommodation, dictate to each, a certain degree of limitation in his purſuits. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purſuits require different degrees of exerciſe, which produce different degrees of bodily ſtrength. The different objects, exhibited in the variety of purſuits, produce different degrees of knowlege. Theſe cauſes, ſometimes, correct, but more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, increaſe the original inequalities, both of body and mind.</p>
               <p>When therefore, it is ſaid, that men are born equal, it cannot be underſtood, that they are born with equal powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or an equal facility of improvement; or that the laws of their nature admit, in practice, of equal acquiſitions. Can it mean any thing more than, that all men are born equally free, and have an equal right to follow the laws of their nature, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending

all its relations? So far men are equal in rights. Power and right are not convertible terms. Rights are the reſult of certain relations. They do not, for their exiſtence, eſſentially, or principally depend on power. Power is neceſſary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exerciſe only, to the full enjoyment. They are ſanctioned by the laws of our nature, and are as immutable as the laws themſelves. A man may, by force, be deprived of the preſent exerciſe and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his rights; but he is not, therefore, deprived of the rights themſelves. Are the laws of nature, are civil laws deſtroyed, becauſe they are violated? Certainly they are not.</p>
               <p>Rights may be divided into general, or primary, and particular, or ſecondary rights. General rights are, firſt, thoſe which are purely the rghts of the mind, or intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rights. Theſe can never juſtly be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to civil regulations, or to the control of external power. Secondly, a right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The exerciſe of this right, therefore, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to particular modifications. Particular rights are found in certain relations to ſomething external. They are the title, which a man derives from the exerciſe of his powers and faculties, in any juſt and lawful mode of appropriation, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive enjoyment of thoſe things, which he has brought within his general right of acquiſition. The general right of acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the foundation of particular rights. The latter are derived from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. They do not ſtand in oppoſition, but in perfect harmony. Without the particular right, by which men are ſecured in the enjoyment of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſeveral acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a general right to acquire would be of no avail. The general rights, however a part of them, to render them univerſally reciprocal in ſociety, may be ſubjected to certain modifications, can never juſtly be abridged, or ſuffer any dim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nution, either directly or by conſequence. Particular rights exiſt in certain relations between a man and particular ſubjects. Theſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

are liable to various alterations and modifications. The man may ceaſe, and with him all his rights. The ſubject may ceaſe. The right to the ſubject may be forfeited by the laws of ſociety. It may be transferred, enlarged, or diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>Of property it is univerſally true, that he, who has the full right of enjoyment, has likewiſe the right of diſpoſal. The right of diſpoſal is co-extenſive with the right of acquiſition. Although one may have a preſent, excluſive right of property in a certain ſubject, it is nevertheleſs open to another's right of acquiſition, by mutual compromiſe. In this conſiſts the harmony and reciprocity of the general right of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition with the general rights of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Different powers may give, greater or leſs extent to particular rights, or to the ſubject of thoſe rights. The greater the powers and faculties of an individual, the more things he may bring within his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rights. The reſult of all this is, that general rights alone are permanent, are equally and fully attendant upon every individual. So far all are equal in rights. Particular rights are, for the mutual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and happineſs of men, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to their occaſions and neceſſities.

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Of the Nature of Equality in Republics.</head>
               <p>SOME of the moſt eminent writers on government, have ſuppoſed an equality of property, as well as of rights to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a republic. They have, therefore, preſcribed limits to individual acquiſition. The Reaſon given is, that riches give power to thoſe who poſſeſs them, and that thoſe who poſſeſs power, will always abuſe it to the oppreſſion of others. If this be a good reaſon for limiting the acquiſition of riches, there is equal reaſon for limiting the improvement of bodily ſtrength and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal abilities. Such a ſtep would be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the primary rights of man, and counteract almoſt all the laws of his nature. It would, perhaps, could it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practice, place the whole human race in a ſtate of fearleſs quietude; but it would be a ſtate of taſteleſs enjoyment, of ſtupid inactivity, not to be envied by the loweſt tribes of the animal creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:025297_0177_0FCCF4BE92A6B438"/>If ſuch be the principles of a republican government, it is a government out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thoſe have made a wiſer choice, who have ſubmitted to the leſs tyranical principles of abſolute monarchy. Theſe are not the principles of a republic. They are the principles of anarchy, and of pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular tyranny.</p>
               <p>We have juſt now enquired into the nature of equality among men, and have ſeen in what it conſiſts; a free and equal enjoyment of the primary rights, which are, the intellectual rights, and the right which men have of uſing their powers and faculties, under certain reciprocal modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, for their own convenience and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The equality neceſſary in a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, requires nothing more, than this equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of primary rights. I ſhall here inſtance in the right of acquiſition only, as being ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To the ſecurity of this right, certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, as to the modes and conditions of enjoying the ſecondary rights, or in oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er words, of holding property, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Not, indeed, as to the quantity, but the freedom of acquiſition, uſe, and diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. To give to any individual, or claſs of men, a monopoly, an excluſive right of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition in thoſe things, which nature has made the ſubjects of property, to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025297_0178_0FCCF4C015D0E660"/>
and render them unalienable in their hands, is an excluſion of the rights of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It is a violation of the equal rights of man. Of this nature are all excluſive priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileges; all perpetuities of riches and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and all the pretended rights of primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture. Inequality of property, in the poſſeſſion of individuals, is not directly, nor by inevitable conſequence, ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of genuine liberty. Thoſe laws are, indeed, ſubverſive of liberty, which, by eſtabliſhing perpetuities, deprive the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a right of diſpoſal, and others, ſo far as they extend, of the right of acquiſition; which annex privileges to property, and by making it a qualification in government, create a powerful ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>Riches are the fruit of induſtry. Honor the fruit of merit. Both ought, as to their continuance, and the influence which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them, to be leſt to the conduct of the poſſeſſor. If a man, who, by induſtry and economy, has acquired riches, become indolent, or profligate, let him ſink into poverty. Let thoſe who are ſtill induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and economical, ſucceed to his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to their juſt reward. If a man, who, by noble and virtuous actions, has acquired honor, the eſteem of mankind, will behave infamouſly, let him ſink into contempt. To exclude the meritorious
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:025297_0179_0FCCF4C190D11D60"/>
from riches and honors, and to perpetuate either to the undeſerving, are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the rights of man in ſociety. In both it is to counteract the laws of nature, which have, by the connection of cauſe and effect, annexed the proper rewards and puniſhments to the actions of men. Wealth, or at leaſt, a competency, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, provided by the laws of nature, for prudent induſtry; want, the puniſhment of idleneſs and profligacy.</p>
               <p>If we make equality of property neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in a ſociety, we muſt employ force, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both the induſtrious and the indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. On the one hand, the induſtrious muſt be reſtrained, from every exertion, which may exceed the power, or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of common capacities; on the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand, the indolent muſt be forcibly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated to common exertions. This would be acting the fable of Procruſtes who, by ſtretching, or lopping to his iron bedſtead, would reduce every man to his own ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard length.</p>
               <p>If this method ſhould be deemed ineli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, the only alternative will be, either by open violence, or the ſecret fraud of the law, to turn a certain portion of the well-earned acquiſitions of the vigilant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, to the uſe of the indolent and neglectful.</p>

               <p>IN every nation, among whom property, as a proviſion for the future, has become an object of purſuit, except under the moſt arbitrary governments, the right of children to inherit the eſtates and intereſts of their parents, has been adopted in their civil inſtitutions. It has been a queſtion, whether this be a dictate of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or whether it be a regulation of civil policy merely.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who maintain, that private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is a creature of municipal law only, and that its right originates in civil inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, do well to ſuppoſe, that every
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:025297_0182_0FCCF4CA40886210"/>
rightful mode of acquiſition and diſpoſal, the transfer of the right, and every mode, by which it can paſs from one to another, originate in the ſame inſtitutions. If, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the right of property, as, I think, has been, clearly, ſhewn, be an eſtabliſhment of natural law; if it reſult from certain relations of nature, and be diſcovered by an internal ſenſe, an intuitive perception, it will be but a reaſonable concluſion, that the laws of nature, likewiſe, reach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition and diſpoſal. Such laws there undoubtedly are; and I am perſuaded, it will, on enquiry, be found, that, in theſe laws, originates the right of the heirs in the eſtate of their anceſtors. Civil inſtitutions have only modified, and confirmed the right. It is not, indeed, an abſolute, but a qualified and ſubordinate right, ſubjected to the right and occaſions of the anceſtor.</p>
               <p>The union of parents and children forms a ſociety, of all the moſt intimate, and the moſt purely natural. The reciprocal rights and duties, parental and filial, are derived purely from the relations of nature. They are, in their origin, independent of the modifications of art or civil policy. Not only members of the ſeveral families, but others, diſtinctly, and forcibly perceive, what I have ventured to call the individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of theſe little communities of nature.
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:025297_0183_0FCCF4CB52B7C368"/>
The perception reſembles that of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers united to form the body. All the members of theſe little communities are perceptively conſcious of the warmeſt and tendereſt intereſt, in the good or evil, moral or natural, which befals each other. No man heſitates, when he obſerves an inſtance of a contrary diſpoſition, boldly to pronounce it to be unnatural.</p>
               <p>When a child is arrived at maturity, and ready, as a new ſtock, to branch into a new family, it is, from the ſubſiſting relations, perceived to be the duty of the parent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ability, and with a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſubſiſting or growing relations of the other members of the family, to contribute to the advancement of ſuch child. Should a parent, in common caſes of this kind, neglect to contribute, every one perceives him to be guilty, tho' not of a civil, yet of a moral crime. He is, at once, believed to be under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing influence of avarice, or ſome other too ſelfiſh paſſion, which has ſtifled the voice of nature.</p>
               <p>The claim of the child, ariſes not from any <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> any legal conſideration, advanced on his part, in which the duty, on the part of the parent, originates. Did the duty originate in any ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the duty and the conſideration would
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:025297_0184_0FCCF4CCCBCFE530"/>
be commenſurate. The child, who had contributed leaſt to the benefit of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, during minority, would have the leaſt claim upon the parent for advancement. Where there has been a criminal neglect, or diſobedience, on the part of the child, this is truly the caſe. When it has happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a natural imbecility, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and not the crime of the child, the obligation of the parent is rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced, than diminiſhed. This is clearly a dictate of nature, and deſigned to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a degree of equality among the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame family, by apportioning the proviſion to the unavoidable exigences of each. Theſe duties, conſiſtently with the right of the parent, with his authority, and the harmony of the family union, can be very little, if at all, ſubjected to civil rules. They muſt be left to the law of moral obligation.</p>
               <p>I think the truth of theſe obſervations cannot be doubted. Hence it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the children, reſulting from the relations of nature, in their connexion, have a lien on the property of the parent; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected nevertheleſs to the full right of the parent. It as clearly follows that, when the right of the parent ceaſes, by his death the right of the children takes f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="186" facs="unknown:025297_0185_0FCCF4CE815CC140"/>
The law, which confirms it to them, does nothing more, than perform the laſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty of the parent.</p>
               <p>Where there is no immediate deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the ſame relations, different only in degree, appear to extend to collaterals. In proportion to the diſtance, the relations are leſs ſtrongly marked, and the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right more faint. It is not eaſily determined, at what preciſe point they wholly ceaſe. It has generally, in the beſt ordered ſtates, been agreed to carry the right, as far, as the relations can be traced. The relations, however remote, clearly carry a right preferable to that of a total ſtranger.</p>
               <p>It may be thought, that if the right of the children, as has been contended, be founded in the laws of nature, thoſe laws are immutable, and conſequently the right; that it will, therefore, abridge, or wholly ſuperſede the parent's right of diſpoſal. It is true of the laws of nature, when conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered abſtractly, that they are, immutable; but it is not true, in the application. The laws of nature reſult from certain relations. Theſe relations, remaining under the ſame combinations and modifications, the reſult, conſequently the law, will be invariably the ſame. The relations are ſubject to different arrangements. They may be
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:025297_0186_0FCCF4D0FA314B08"/>
enlarged, or diminiſhed. They may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially or wholly ceaſe. In all theſe caſes, the reſult, and conſequently the law, as to its application, will vary, preciſely as the relations themſelves.</p>
               <p>The parent during his life, has a full right to direct the uſe and diſpoſal of his property. That he is under a natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to provide for his houſhold, and to advance his children with his property, as his occaſions admit, and their circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces require, no more affects the freedom of his right, than any moral obligation affects the freedom of action. On the death of the parent, his right, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in which he ſtood, while living, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The relation of the children, as far as it reſpects the property, of which no diſpoſition had been made, ſtill remains. Their right, which was only a contingent right, and, indeed nothing more than a moral claim, is perfected and realized.</p>
               <p>It may likewiſe be thought, that if the right of the children be thus eſtabliſhed, it militates againſt the right of the parent to make any teſtamentary diſpoſitions of his property. It has been obſerved, in effect, that the right of the children, during the life of the parent, is founded in claims of a moral nature. Of their admiſſion and extent, he is, by nature, conſtituted the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:025297_0187_0FCCF4D274D350C0"/>
ſole judge. There are other claims upon him and his property, beſides thoſe of his children. His property is ſubjected, civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to all claims of right, both of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and of individuals, with whom be may be connected. It is ſubjected to other claims of a moral nature, of which he is, likewiſe, the ſole judge. He may think it his duty to give ſome of his property for public uſe, or for the encouragement of virtue, the reward of humanity, or exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary inſtances of filial piety. It is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, during his life, to his occaſions, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, civil, and moral; and a diſpoſition, to take effect after his death, is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the right of the children, than a transfer while he is living. In ſuch diſpoſitions, the parent may misjudge; he may have done wrong; but it is, generally, an affair of too much delicacy, to endure the deciſion of the civil law.</p>
               <p>After the death of the parent, when his rights are finiſhed, and the juſt claims of others anſwered, the children have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual claim, and equal right, in the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of their common anceſtor. If nature dictate any preference, it is in favor of the younger, and not of the elder branches. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> appears not unreaſonable, that, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the children have been left, in a ſtate of he pleſs infancy, the common property
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:025297_0188_0FCCF4D39615F228"/>
of the parent ſhould aſſiſt in making that proviſion for their ſupport and education, which the parent, were he alive, would conſider, not as an advancement, but an indiſpenſible duty of nature,</p>
               <p>Thus from a careful examination of the right of deſcents, upon natural principles, we find no intimation of the right of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture, no preference in ſucceſſions, but thoſe, which tend to an equal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the goods of fortune. We may repeat it, that the equal laws of nature, if rightly underſtood and practiſed in a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, tend to prevent, or correct every dangerous exceſs. The more we exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine theſe laws, the more will appear their coincidence with the niceſt moral feelings of the human heart, and the genuine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equal laws and government.</p>

            <p>THE exerciſe of theſe rights, by gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, the right of puniſhment, and the right of taxation, are neceſſary to its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and even to its very exiſtence. The exerciſe, however, would ſeem, on a curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry view, to be an infringement of perſonal liberty, and to approach a violation of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate right. Accordingly, it has been held by ſome, that they originate in that nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, by which they have ſuppoſed men to be compelled, on entering into civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to give up a part of their natural liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is propoſed in this Sketch, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more particularly, the origin, mode of exerciſe, and limitation of theſe rights.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Of the Right of Puniſhment.</head>
               <p>THE right to puniſh individuals for crimes againſt ſociety, is not an arbitrary inſtitution of civil policy, nor is it origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and independently inherent, in any particular
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:025297_0190_0FCCF4D745942190"/>
organ of government. It is founded in the moral and ſocial nature of man, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to government through that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. We have already ſeen, that man was not formed for individual independence, but for ſociety, for civil union in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All the liberty of an individual, all his right, which can affect the rights and liberties of others, is placed in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, a mutual compromiſe with the rights and liberties of all, and every member of the ſociety. To facilitate this accommodation, and to render a compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of rights practicable, mutual, and ſafe, is the great object of all civil inſtitutions and laws.</p>
               <p>If man be by nature a ſocial being, it is an obvious concluſion, that it is his duty to forbear to injure the ſociety, of which he is a member; and that the violation of this duty is a violation of the laws of his nature. It may here, perhaps, be thought ſufficient to ſay, that rights and duties are reciprocal; every ſociety muſt have a right correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the duty of the individual; if the individual violate his duty to the ſociety, the ſociety have clearly a right to take ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. But, as this ſubject is of great importance in national juriſprudence, I ſhall be more particular in the inveſtigation, by attempting to analiſe the right, and trace it to its ſource in the nature of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:025297_0191_0FCCF4D817410C78"/>Deity, in the conſtitution of nature, has not done every thing for man. He has eſtabliſhed certain relations, from which reſult the laws, which ought to govern, both moral and ſocial actions. He has given man powers and faculties, for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering theſe relations, and the laws, which reſult from them. The mode of giving theſe laws their full effect, is left to his ſagacity, to the exerciſe of his reaſoning powers. This is not all. To enable him more ſteadily to purſue them, and to give them a greater effect, he is furniſhed with a ſenſe of right and wrong, and a ſenſe of merit and demerit, attending the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or non-obſervance; the moral ſenſe, and the ſenſe of accountability. Theſe ſenſes, when rightly informed, extend their authority to every moral, every ſocial, and every civil action. Hence, on the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of a crime, ariſe in the mind of the perpetrator the feelings of guilt, and a conſciouſneſs of a deſert of puniſhment. Theſe ſentiments are common to men, both in a review of their actions, and in paſſing judgment upon the actions of others. What might at firſt ſeem to contradict that univerſal deſire of happineſs, which goes to the nature of every individual, is, that guilt is, ſometimes, attended with a ſtrong deſire of puniſhment. This is what we,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:025297_0192_0FCCF4D9B2EB2030"/>
generally, call remorſe. If puniſhment be inflicted by no other hand, ſelf puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is well known to be the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided by nature, for the violent emotion of remorſe. From this view of the ſubject, the right of puniſhing the guilty, is clearly perceived to be derived from the relations of men in ſociety. It was not alone from an extraordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the divine anger on the mind of Cain, after the murder of his brother, but from a perception of theſe relations, and a right reſulting from them, that he is made to ſay, "Whoſo findeth me ſhall ſlay me."</p>
               <p>The Marquis Beccaria has founded the right of puniſhment, on the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <q>Let us (ſays he) conſult the human heart; and there we ſhall find the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the ſovereign's right to puniſh; for no advantage in civil policy can be laſting, which is not founded in the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſentiments of the heart of man.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on Crimes and Puniſhments. Ch. ii.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In caſes of mere private injury, the right is perceived to belong to the party injured. He has a right to demand reparation for the injury, and a caution againſt the like injury in future. The mode of obtaining both is to be regulated by a conſideration of the preſent nature of ſocial rights.
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:025297_0193_0FCCF4DB0FA850E8"/>
Where the right cannot be exerciſed, by the party injured, without danger to the ſocial rights of others, the laws of ſocial nature dictate a ſubmiſſion to an impartial tribunal: a proviſion, which can be made, and enforced, in the union of civil ſociety only. When a perſon is guilty of a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſocial rights, which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affect the intereſt and happineſs of the whole, the right of demanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and caution is perceived to belong to the community. The perception is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated, by means of the ſocial ſenſe, mentioned in a former ſketch; the ſenſe, by which each member perceives a kind of individuality in the whole, comprehending himſelf.</p>
               <p>In a ſtate of any conſiderable degree of ſocial and civil improvement, men endure with reluctance the exerciſe of the right of puniſhment, by the party injured. This happens, not becauſe men are more unfit, in this ſtate, for the exerciſe; but becauſe they have a nicer ſenſe of right and wrong. Their ſocial feelings are extended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. The ſecurity and happineſs of each individual member, becomes the intereſt, as it affects the happineſs of the whole. They perceive, not only the inhumanity, to which the practice tends, but the injuſtice of which it is, in almoſt every inſtance,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:025297_0194_0FCCF4DC966C2490"/>
productive. They perceive, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of puniſhing can, in almoſt no caſe, be exerciſed by the party injured, without a perpetual violation of other's rights, of the obligations of morality, and the danger of a total annihilation of ſocial happineſs. Hence it becomes, the right, intereſt, and duty of every civil community, to puniſh by way of caution, all thoſe injuries which diſturb, or tend to diſturb their happineſs, or to render it inſecure. And it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to whatever the common ſentiment has connected with the public happineſs. It is evident then, that the appropriate right of government, to puniſh, by way of caution, the crimes of its members, is not an arbitrary inſtitution of civil ſociety, nor does it originate in neceſſity only; but in the ſentiments of the human heart, the exiſting relations of men in ſociety, and has the full ſanction of the laws of nature.</p>
               <p>The organ, by which the right of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment ſhall be exerciſed in government, is a conſideration of propriety, ſafety, and convenience. A flight attention to the ſubject, will diſcover it to be a branch of the right of legiſlation, or in propriety ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately connected with the duties of that branch. Without the right of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the violation of a law, the right of legiſlation would be perfectly nugatory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:025297_0195_0FCCF4DE14C8BD60"/>There is a threefold diviſion of the right of puniſhment, or rather of the exerciſe of the right, correſponding with the general diviſion of the powers of government. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 1. The decreeing of penalties, which ſhall be incurred by the breach of any law. This involves a conſideration of the importance of the law, to the intereſts of the ſtate, and correſponds with the right of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To that branch therefore, it will, with propriety, be intruſted. 2. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the law to particular caſes, for the purpoſe of determining whether it has been violated, and who has incurred the penalty. This is clearly, the proper buſineſs of the judiciary. 3. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſentence upon the criminal, which falls to the province of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>The right of puniſhing is, in practice, frequently limited, only by the will of the legiſlature, and the deciſions of the judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but the laws of nature have not left it arbitrary. They have aſſigned certain limits, beyond which the right ceaſes, and the exerciſe of the power becomes a crime againſt ſociety. Theſe limits are not, in every ſenſe, permanent and invariable. It is univerſally true, that it is limited by the end of preventing crimes, and ſecuring obedience to the laws. It is alſo true, that
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:025297_0196_0FCCF4DFA1040E90"/>
the penalties, which, in one ſtate of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and manners, are adequate to that end, may, in a different ſtate, be wholly inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate.</p>
               <p>Not only the ſtate of manners, but the principles of the government affect the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of puniſhments. Where the ſupport of the reigning powers, without any regard to the good of the people, is the ſole end of every meaſure of ſtate, fear, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated by the ſeverity of puniſhments, is the only principle of obedience. Such governments admit of limits, neither to crimes, nor to the ſeverity of puniſhments. No actions are conſidered to be criminal, becauſe they are injurious to the people, or even againſt the laws of nature; but becauſe they are conceived to be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the reigning power, and a contempt of its authority. In proportion as govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have aſcended to natural principles, and made the happineſs of the people the end of their inſtitutions, crimes and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have admitted of more definite lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its. It has been perceived and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, that, in a civil view, thoſe actions only are criminal, which are injurious to the community, or to individuals, whoſe rights and happineſs the community is bound to protect, and ſecure; that the prevention of crimes is the ſole end of
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:025297_0197_0FCCF4E357EDEE48"/>
puniſhments; and that all beyond this is the ſpirit of revenge, or of wanton cruelty.</p>
               <p>It is worthy of remark, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of ſociety, no ſcience has received ſo little improvement as that of criminal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence. <note n="*" place="bottom">The world is more indebted to the Marquis Beccaria, for his little treatiſe on Crimes and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, than to all other writers on the ſubject.</note> It is true, that many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of outrageous violence, with which capital and other puniſhments were inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have, in ſome nations, been aboliſhed; but it may, with equal truth, be obſerved, that among thoſe nations, who boaſt the higheſt refinement, the greateſt degree of improvement in their civil policy, the number of capital puniſhments, has been increaſed out of all proportion to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in point of cruelty. The Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which in civil improvements, and the humanity of its laws, has gone beyond moſt other European nations, has proceeded with a degree of wantonneſs, in the enacting of capital puniſhments.

Beyond theſe it has no relation, nor even mental exiſtence. This notion has done infinite miſchief in the world. It has repreſented juſtice, as really offended, in proportion to the crime committed, and inexorably demanding ſatisfaction by a certain, determinate puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the offender; like the malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deities of ſome nations, who are to be conciliated with human ſacrifices only. By conſidering a ſatisfaction to juſtice as the principal end of puniſhment, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding its utility to ſociety, the only ſafe and certain criterion of the real juſtice and propriety of any claſs of civil or ſocial actions, it has ſerved to reconcile people, in other reſpects, of a refined ſenſibility, to an exceſs of cruelty, in the enacting, and in the execution of laws.</p>
               <p>A puniſhment annexed to a crime is, by the force of habitual aſſociation, viewed in connexion with the crime, and often ſerves as a meaſure for the degree of its guilt, which ariſes only from its relation to ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.

The puniſhment ought never to exceed, but rather to fall ſhort of the demerit of the crime in the ſentiments of the people. Where this is the caſe, humanity is engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſide of the laws, and puniſhment is rendered as certain, as the perpetration of the crime. This adds a mild, but effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and irreſiſtable energy to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws. It is univerſally true, that certainty of puniſhment has a much more powerful effect, than ſeverity, in the prevention of crimes. Indeed, the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and contempt of mankind, which always purſue the perpetrators of a crime, if not converted into compaſſion, by the ſeverity of the law, conſtitute a puniſhment of no inconſiderable efficacy.</p>
               <p>I add, with entire ſatisfaction, that in no government, is a certain degree of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more requiſite, in none is it more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, to the prevention of crimes, than

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Of the Right of Taxation.</head>
               <p>THE Right of Taxation is, no more than the right of puniſhment, an arbitrary inſtitution of civil policy, or originally and independently inherent in any particular organ of the government. Wherever it is placed, it is a betruſted right. The right itſelf, like all legitimate, ſocial, and civil rights, is derived from the relations of men in ſociety.</p>
               <p>It is perceived, even by the moſt ſimple, that from the relations of men in civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there reſults a duty upon them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forbear to injure the ſociety, but alſo to contribute to its ſupport, and proſperity. The ſocial ſenſe, which has ſeveral times been mentioned, has no inconſiderable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:025297_0202_0FCCDA42849AAE30"/>
in rendering the perception diſtinct, and in collecting and fixing the object of this duty. The duty may be called, the duty of contribution on the one hand, from which, on the other, reſults to the ſociety the right of taxation. The right of taxation is nothing more than a right to enforce the duty of contribution, to which every member of the community is originally bound. The duty and the right, wherever it reſides, are reciprocal. The duty is the ſame upon every individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual member, as to the reality, not as to the quantity of the contribution.</p>
               <p>No civil duty, perhaps, can leſs be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the voluntary conduct of individuals. None more needs a proviſion of general rules, to ſecure equal juſtice, both to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals and to the community. The utility of the community cannot be oppoſed to the utility of the individual members in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral. Nevertheleſs the latter, from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more immediate, ſo far outweighs the former, that they are often viewed in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The duty, therefore, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be performed, unleſs there exiſted, ſomewhere, a right, with authority to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, as well as to apportion the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. The end of this duty is the utility of the community; not indeed, in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſenſe; but in a certain relation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:025297_0203_0FCCF4E6544FA560"/>
and agreement with the utility of individuals.</p>
               <p>The right of apportioning and enforcing this duty, which is the right of taxation, is originally, in the community, conſidered as an aggregate body. The organ, by which it ſhall be exerciſed, is, as in the caſe of puniſhment, a conſideration of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, convenience, and ſafety. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionment muſt be made by general and equal rules, and the demand enforced by the ſanctions of law. It is, therefore, with propriety and convenience entruſted to the legiſlative body. If ſuch body be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a full and equal repreſentation of the ſeveral national, as well as particular intereſts, the betruſtment is ſafe. The power and right of taxation can be entruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no man, or body of men, who are not amenable to the people for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and who do not equally ſhare the burdens, which they impoſe, without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral certainty, of oppreſſion, the total ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of liberty, and all ſecurity of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property. Thus it comes out, that the great queſtion about taxation and rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation, is a queſtion about modes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than rights; a mere conſideration of ſafety to the rights of the people. It is indeed, a moſt important conſideration; but it does not reach the original right,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:025297_0204_0FCCF4E825AA6CF0"/>
founded in the duty of contribution. The repreſentation of any part in the national legiſlature, is a proof of an intimate civil connexion, which undoubtedly ſubjects them to the duty of contribution; but if the people chuſe to entruſt the right of taxation, in any other mode, or to any other body, the exerciſe may be equally legitimate.</p>
               <p>It is not eaſy, perhaps, to aſcertain with preciſion, what degree of ſocial union, among individuals, will incur the duty of contribution. It is, however, clear, that one community can have no right to tax, perſonally, the members of another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, where the citizens of both are not united ultimately, by an internal, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, civil connexion. States in league may, as far as the league extends, incur, one to the other, the duty of contribution; but the duty is demandable againſt the States collectively, not againſt particular members Each ſtate has a demand againſt the other, and the ſeveral ſtates have a demand againſt their citizens individually, to enable them to fulfil their engagements. Between the ſeveral ſtates, the right to enforce the duty reſides equally in every part, till, by mutual agreement, a body is formed for its exerciſe. Till this has taken place, it remains, like that of independent
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:025297_0205_0FCCF4E95463D940"/>
individuals, a voluntary duty; or to be enforced only by an appeal to the law of nations—the right of the ſword.</p>
               <p>So different are the intereſts, both gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and particular, in different ſtates, that no univerſal rules can be preſcribed, as to the particular mode of taxation, which ſhall be equally applicable to all. It will ever be a conſideration of public convenience and private equity. The lawful intereſt of no citizen, or claſs of citizens, can, without injuſtice, and a violation of equal rights, be ſacrificed to that of another, or even to that of the whole. That mode ought to be adopted, which, as far as general rules can extend, will operate agreeably to the principles of mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe. A rule, very general, indeed, which has been applied in ethics, may, with great propriety, be applied in this caſe. Requiſition ſhall be made of a man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, which he hath, and not according to that, which he hath not. Taxes, therefore ought not to be appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned upon perſons, but upon things; upon property poſſeſſed or uſed by indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals. Its valuation, however, ought not to be according to the eſtimated value in market, but according to the ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, which it may afford.</p>
               <p>It has been uſual to apportion taxes upon
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:025297_0206_0FCCF4EB479E9F60"/>
a valuation of the property or thing taxed. This will be juſt and equal, provided the valuation be made, not according to the market rates, but according to the income, which it may produce, with ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement. There are yet ſome exceptions, which will occur in their place.</p>
               <p>Protection has, by many, been held, to be the conſideration, on the one ſide, in which is founded the right of taxation, on the other. If it were ſo, protection ſhould ſerve as a meaſure for the apportionment of taxes to individuals. But this is not the caſe. The duty of contribution, and conſequently the right of taxation, ariſes from the whole relations, in which men ſtand in ſociety. The ſame thing is true of every civil right and duty. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral relations are connected, and form a certain internal relation among themſelves. If we take away one relation, it deranges the connection, varies the mutual relations, and, of courſe, the reſult. In thoſe gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, in which the rights of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign are ſuppoſed to be original, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the rights of the people, it is in perfect conſiſtency with the principles of the government, to derive the ſovereign's right of taxation from the protection af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to the ſubject, as a conſideration. Where, as in democratic republics, thoſe
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:025297_0207_0FCCF4ECA81D0EE8"/>
who exerciſe the ſovereign power, are only conſtituted organs, and exerciſe only the power of the people aſſociated in civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, the conſideration between the ſovereign and the people does not exiſt. The ſovereign power, the whole right, is the power and the right of the people, thus aſſociated, not individually, but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that the laws of nature, from which reſult all legitimate civil rights and duties, are always calculated to attain ſome uſeful end; but the uſeful end to be attained, is the criterion, by which to judge of their authenticity, rather, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, or foundation of the duty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; the final, not the efficient cauſe. The right of the citizen to civil protection, is independent of any ſuch conſideration; and any apportionment of taxes, upon that principle, would be groſly unequal, and oppreſſive. It would make the poor and the weak the greateſt debtors to the ſtate, for contributors they could not be. It would, at once, be deſtructive of itſelf, by turning protection into oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of abſtract relations, and abſtract rights, fabrications of the mind only, which may, or may not, juſtly comprehend the relations and rights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are, perhaps, never preciſely the
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:025297_0208_0FCCF4EE9BD51B58"/>
ſame, in the conception of any two indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, cannot furniſh ſufficient data for the apportionment of takes. It is neceſſary to find ſomething more fixed and certain, and to take real quantities, as well in the data as in the product.</p>
               <p>The only plauſible theory, and which is capable of being reduced to practice, by the application of real quantities, is, that every individual in any community ſhall contribute to its ſupport, in proportion to his enjoyments, as a member of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. In this, however, no regard is to be had to mental, but to apparent and ſenſible enjoyments. Upon this principle the poſſeſſion, and the uſe of property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the data for apportioning taxes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals. I have added the uſe, which will comprehend the conſumption, at leaſt beyond what is common and neceſſary to every claſs; becauſe ſome will place the enjoyment in the uſe of conſumption, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of profit in the poſſeſſion. They may chuſe, while others hoard or uſe for profit, to ſpend their acquiſitions in the gratification of their paſſions and appetites.</p>
               <p>Taxes ought to be aſſeſſed according to a general valuation. This mode will be ſubject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:025297_0209_0FCCF4F0593F5160"/>
If taxes ſhould happen to fall more equally in the latter mode, yet they have, in the former, great advantages, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known and certain; a very important conſideration in the levying of taxes. It is, perhaps, a conſideration of equal weight, that men are, generally, leſs diſſatisfied with the inequalities of fortune, than thoſe, which are impoſed upon them by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, prejudice, or caprice of their fellow citizens. If, from the nature and ſituation of any ſpecies of property, which is a ſubject of taxation, great inequalities will unavoidably intervene, ſuch property ſhould be taxed with a degree of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proportioned to the inequality. It is a great alleviation, in ſuch caſes, that none are oppreſſively overburthened, though ſome may pay leſs than their juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Taxes ought not only to be equal, but, as far as the reaſonable exigencies of the ſtate require, and general rules can extend, to be apportioned to the viſible means of the citizens, both collectively and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually. This, however, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with ſome limitation. They ought not to be apportioned upon the means of living, but upon the means of payment, or what, on an ordinary calculation, ought to be the means of payment. This object
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:025297_0210_0FCCF4F26222F3E0"/>
can be attained only by an extenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the different intereſts, employments, modes, and neceſſary expence of living, with the different claſſes of citizens. With ſuch knowlege the legiſlators may, in the general mode of valuation, and with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention to the ſubjects of taxation, in a great meaſure, if not altogether, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the burden of taxes, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means of ſubſiſtence to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orer claſs of citizens, who, though they may contribute nothing, directly, to the ſupport of government, are far from being the leaſt uſeful claſs in the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The exigences of the ſtate muſt limit the aggregate ſum to be demanded in taxes. But the demand ought never, for any continuance, to equal the ſum of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenues; much leſs ought it to be ſuffered to diminiſh the capital ſtock. Were government, by thus anticipating the revenue of its citizens, to deprive them of every comfortable proſpect in a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the future, it would take away all incitement to enterprize, and even the ſpirit of private induſtry and economy. If in addition to this, the enormity of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſhould conſtantly diminiſh the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital ſtock, nothing would be preſented to view, but the gloomy proſpect of inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poverty and diſtreſs; a ſituation in
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:025297_0211_0FCCF4F3E0C2FE50"/>
which a government cannot long ſubſiſt, without the moſt violent commotions. The ſame obſervations will apply to thoſe burthen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, which, I through the unequal mode of apportionment, fall upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar claſſes only.</p>
               <p>The mode of apportionment, ought not to be directed by any ſingle claſs of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but by the intereſt of the whole, which conſiſts in a certain ratio of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſts. If in the political conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of taxes, the intereſt of the ſtate, by which is generally meant, nothing more, than the intereſt of the majority, comes in competition with the intereſt of any claſs of the citizens, in their lawful purſuits, their intereſt ought not to be wholly ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifiſed to that of the ſtate, much leſs to that of another claſs. Every affair of this nature ſhould be conducted upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a compromiſe of intereſts. In adjuſting the compromiſe, however, the magnitude of the intereſts in competition is not to be adopted as the only rule of preference: Such rule would frequently prove a total ſacrifice of the minor intereſt. Where it is demanded of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or claſſes that they give up their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for public ſervice, they are as fully, as in cauſes which ariſe in caſes between individuals only, entitled to a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:025297_0212_0FCCF4F55225C080"/>
for all that, which exceeds their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proportion. Such interferences will, however, rarely happen, unleſs taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is applied to other purpoſes, than thoſe merely of raiſing a public revenue.</p>
               <p>In modern times taxes, beſides their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancical purpoſes, have been employed as a principal engine of ſtate, for directing the induſtry of the citizens into thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular channels of arts, manufactures, or commerce, which are deemed to be moſt for the preſent intereſt of the community. A Britiſh writer obſerves, that <q>taxes may be ſo contrived, as to rival bounties, in promoting induſtry, manufactures, and commerce.<note n="*" place="bottom">Kaims's Sketches, B. II. Sk. viii. Sec. 1.</note>
                  </q> That they can have the effect to promote induſtry in general, is not very obvious. They may certainly be ſo contrived, as to promote it in particular channels; but perhaps, this is generally, if not always, done, by diverting it from others.</p>
               <p>The application of taxes, to theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes may, within certain limits, be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneficial to a community. Nations do not always make equal progreſs in thoſe arts, which furniſh the neceſſaries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and elegancies of life.

Where this is the caſe, it may be a happy contrivance to exempt the home productions of a manufacture from taxes, and to impoſe a duty upon foreign productions of the ſame kind. It may enable the home manufacturer, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced price of his goods, to indemnify himſelf, in a good meaſure, for the riſk and expence of a new undertaking. But it is eaſily perceived, that in a regulation of this kind, whatever the manufacturer gains by the advanced price of his goods, is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a tax upon the conſumer; and as it has a tendency to exclude competitors, it is neceſſary to proceed with caution, leſt it degenerate into a ſyſtem of monopoly, one of the greateſt evils in civil policy. there is, likewiſe, danger leſt thoſe, who are already engaged in lawful purſuits, and entitled to equal right, though, perhaps, not to equal favor, ſhould, by an over burden, be too much deprived of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable gains, and, perhaps, be too haſtily forced into different purſuits, without the ſame proſpect of an indemnification for their riſk and experience. I believe, it
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:025297_0214_0FCCF4F8507220F8"/>
not unfrequently happens, that from a zeal for new improvement, and a too ſanguine expectation of their public utility, old employments are burdened out of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any advantage, which may be deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the new.</p>

               <p>When any individual acts in conformity to the laws of his nature, as conſtituted by the author of his being, taking in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions and dependencies, for every thing is relative, nothing ſtands alone, the actions of that individual are right and fit; ſo far as he deviates from thoſe laws, they are wrong, or vicious. From the nature of man, it is impoſſible, that a ſociety ſhould,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:025297_0218_0FCCF500187E91A0"/>
like an individual direct its actions by any common united volition. It muſt be done by rules or laws, by which the actions of every individual, as they concern the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety at large, are to be directed. The ſame criterion holds here, as in the caſe of an individual. Thoſe actions are right in any ſociety, conſtituted upon natural principles, which are conformable to the principles and nature of that ſociety. The actions of a ſociety, which we call civil or political actions, are made up of the actions of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual members. It therefore clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that thoſe are good laws, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch actions of individuals as, taken together in all their connexions, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the principles and nature of the ſociety; and thoſe are bad laws, which deviate from this end. <note n="*" place="bottom">The foregoing obſervations may be extended as well to the fundamental laws or laws of the conſtitution, as to the municipal laws of the ſtate. Both ought to be equally adapted to the ſtate of ſociety, and of ſocial improvements.</note> Let it be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, that under action I comprehend both performance and forbearance.</p>
               <p>Judge Blackſtone, in another paſſage, defines municipal law to be, "a rule of civil conduct, commanding what is right,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:025297_0219_0FCCF50156FA4748"/>
and prohibiting what is wrong."<note n="†" place="bottom">Commentaries, vol. i. p. 44. "Municipal law is defined to be a rule of civil conduct, preſcribed by the ſupreme power in the ſtate, commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong."</note> If laws command or prohibit that, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely indifferent to the ſtate, they deviate from the true ſpirit and principles of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in a free government. They are arbitrary. They agree not with the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which is a good one, of "com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong." If they go farther, and command the violation, or forbid the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any moral duty, they become tyrannically unjuſt. In the former inſtance, inſtead of feeling an obligation, we feel ourſelves inſulted; in the latter we are filled with the utmoſt abhorrence of the laws. When laws coincide with the principles above laid down, when they fully agree with the above definition, they are ſtrictly binding on the conſciences of men. They ought not to allow themſelves an alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>The objection, that in this light the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of penal laws would become a ſnare for men's conſciences, does not appear to me to be well founded. It lies with equal weight againſt the moral obligation to the greater part of ſocial duties. Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

to a ſtate of ſociety, if man may be ſuppoſed ever to have exiſted in ſuch ſtate, the duties of the ſolitary individual muſt have been very few and ſimple. In the firſt ſtages of ſociety, in a ſimple ſtate of property, and a ſtate of manners no leſs ſimple, duties muſt be confined within very narrow limits. Still they would greatly exceed thoſe of the ſolitary individual. In the progreſs of ſociety, the complex ſtate of property, great improvements, numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous connections, and extenſive intercourſe, introduce a great variety of ſocial duties. Theſe are left to be diſcovered, as the reſult of ſituation, circumſtances, and relations; nor is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> diſcovery and performance thought to be a taſk too difficult. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which become the ſubject of civil laws, the caſe is eaſier. Many actions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as evil, only when they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Hence the duty of individuals ariſes on the requiſition of the law, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the law itſelf. We are not, however, to ſuppoſe, that civil laws conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the ultimate fitneſs or morality of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in a ſtrict ſenſe; but as an individual may allow others to reap advantage from the uſe of his property, ſo government may allow the individual members to do thoſe things for their private advantage, which it is fitting ſhould be the right of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:025297_0221_0FCCF505263952F8"/>
In the former caſe, if the individual prohibit to others the farther uſe of his property, it is their duty to forbear; to perſiſt in the uſe, will become a private injury. In the latter, if government pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the doing of thoſe things for private advantage, which, though before allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by tacit conſent, yet come within the claim and right of the public, the actions, for prohibited become wrong; morally ſo. It is to be obſerved here, that we are upon general rules or laws, and that the right of government is the right of the whole, not of any particular claſs, as diſtinct from the people.</p>
               <p>To erect crimes upon actions wholly indifferent to ſociety; to gratify the pride and caprice of one claſs of citizens, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them what is forbidden to others; to inflict penalties to ſupport a ſyſtem of monopoly, or for fiſcal purpoſes rather, then the purpoſe of preventing crimes, is to confound every idea of right and wrong in a criminal code. All this is to be found in a great variety of inſtances, in the laws of England. We need to inſtance only in the foreſt laws, the laws for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the game, and the penalties for not burying in woolen. In ſuch caſes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to find any moral reſtraint, men learn to make a diſtinction, between what is
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:025297_0222_0FCCF5068BC27B98"/>
morally, and what is only politically wrong Amid a great variety of laws, ſome arbitrary and ſome not, their minds are wearied with diſcriminations. They will readily adopt the diſtinction made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and refer the violation of the prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary duties in government, to the claſs of <hi>mala in ſe;</hi> the others to the claſs of <hi>mata prohibita.</hi> Probably, however, no two perſons in any government would agree in claſſing.</p>
               <p>Few actions, conſidered ſimply, are evil in themſelves. They are relatively good or bad. They take their qualities from ſituation and circumſtances. Reverence to the Supreme Being is, unchangeably, a duty. Such duties, however important, are few in number. Moſt actions of men are of the former kind. Murder for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is one of the moſt heinous crimes in ſociety. Yet to kill a man is not always wrong. To kill one, who by violence and wrong attempts my life, is, when the only probable means of ſaving it, in fact juſtifiable. We conceive an officer to do his duty, when he executes a criminal condemned to death, by the ſentence of the laws. Should a private perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authority, kill a criminal, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a legal and juſt ſentence of death, be would, by common conſent, as well as by
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:025297_0223_0FCCF508EB6B0938"/>
the laws of the land, be deemed guilty of murder. In every country, in the early ſtages of ſociety, when any perſon is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is held to be the duty of the next of kin to avenge the blood of the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in, to put the man-ſlayer to death. This, in the ruder ſtate of men in ſociety, is right. It is, in ſuch ſtate, the only known, or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable made of puniſhment, or mean of reſtraint. In the progreſs of ſocial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, this mode of puniſhment is accompanied with evils, which tend to ſap the very foundation of ſociety, and diſſolve every bond of general union. The ſole right therefore, of judging and puniſhing offenders, for the prevention of crimes, is at length entruſted with government. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> then becomes a crime in the kindred, who had been called the avengers of blood, to attempt ſuch puniſhment, by their own authority. Theſe are inſtances, in which, not only the political, if I may uſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, but the moral quality of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is altered, and even reverſed, by a change of ſocial and political circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If thoſe only are to be eſteemed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural duties, which ariſe antecedently to ſociety, and idependently of any relation to it, and their violation offences <hi>mala in ſe;</hi> they will be found, not only few in number, but the greater part will be found
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:025297_0224_0FCCF50B876D5E00"/>
to be unnoticed by municipal laws, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently guarded by the moral ſenſe and the common principles of humanity. The principal of theſe are the duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſelf-preſervation; and though men are to be protected and ſecured in the obſervance of theſe duties, the obſervance cannot be enforced by human laws.</p>
               <p>The laws of nature are not thus limited. When applied to man, the laws of nature are the laws of ſocial nature. As, I have before ſhewn, man is formed for a ſtate of ſociety and civil government. He is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with appetites, paſſions, and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which in no other ſtate have either gratification or uſe. In ſociety, in civil ſociety only, can man act agreeably to the laws of his nature. It is the ſtate pointed out in his formation; the ſtate, to which moſt of his paſſions, appetites, faculties, and powers are directed. It is, in truth, his ultimate ſtate of nature. The more perfect this ſtate is, the more it harmonizes with the whole ſtate of man; or rather, the more general operation it gives to the laws of his nature.</p>
               <p>If ſociety and civil government be founded in natural principles, the laws, which naturally and certainly reſult from ſuch ſtate, are laws of nature. There are certain principles, and relations, which are
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:025297_0225_0FCCF50C923CCED8"/>
common to all ſocieties, and governments, in the earlieſt and rudeſt ſtate, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue unchanged, through every ſucceſſive degree of improvement. From theſe principles and relations reſult laws and duties, which, with one conſent, are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mominated, by way of eminence, laws of nature and natural duties. This eminence they have derived from their permanency and univerſality. In the progreſs of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, in the natural courſe of improvement, new and different connexions are formed; new principles and new relations ariſe. Hence reſult new laws, and a different claſs of duties. Theſe laws and theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will vary, or rather, they will exiſt in one ſociety, and not in another, according to the various degrees of improvement in each. Still if they reſult from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, relations, and connexions, which ariſe in a natural courſe of improvement, they are, with the former, equally laws of nature, and natural duties. They both, in fact, reſult from a ſtate of ſociety, the natural ſtate of man. Human laws,<note n="*" place="bottom">I here comprehend, as well the laws of the conſtitution, as civil or municipal laws.</note> founded in theſe principles, as they ariſe in ſociety will have the force of moral obligation. Arbitrary laws; laws, which violate the principles of the ſociety, for which they
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:025297_0226_0FCCF50E0F26FB88"/>
were made, will be obeyed with reluctance. Obedience, in ſuch caſes, will, ſometimes, be conſidered as a matter of prudence, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as a matter of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Men would be in a deplorable condition, if the moral ſenſe enforced obedience, alike, to every act of legiſlation. The worſt laws, when once enacted, would be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a degree of veneration. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of execution would ſuperſede the neceſſity of repeated examination, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent recurrence to the principles of the government, and the rights, intereſt, and ſentiments of the people, without which the beſt intentions of a legiſlature, can afford no ſecurity againſt the danger of tyrannical laws.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Different Modes, in which Obligation is ſometimes diſcovered—have concurred to introduce a Diſtinction between moral and civil Obligation.</head>
               <p>IT is not, perhaps, difficult to account for the different views, which have been entertained of civil and moral obligation.
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:025297_0227_0FCCF50F9AD4A318"/>
The nature and principles of a government may be ſuch as to confound many moral and natural relations. In the beſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted governments, men may be led to conceive a difference between moral and civil obligation, from the different modes, which they, ſometimes, neceſſarily take to attain the knowlege of public and private duties. The mode of diſcovery is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently different; but the efficient cauſe of obligation, is, in both, the ſame.</p>
               <p>In all caſes, the efficient cauſe of moral obligation ariſes from the relations, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular, in which man is placed; the ſenſe, by which he diſcerns theſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a perception of the duty thence reſulting.</p>
               <p>The utility of the action to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not the efficient, but the ſmal cauſe, the end, for which the duty is impoſed. Theſe are not ſet at variance, but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony. Hence it is, that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral tendency of any claſs of actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſafe criterion to decide, whether the performance or forbearance be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>The approbation, which a perſon feels, of his own conduct, ariſes from a direct perception of right in his actions, or, that they coincide with his duty. As a ſocial being, he finds the pleaſure enhanced,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:025297_0228_0FCCF51463A10090"/>
from a perception of their utility to ſociety. The utility, which ariſes to ſociety from his actions, becomes a practical proof of the juſtneſs of his moral perceptions, and a farther confirmation of his duty. In the common actions of life, the duty is diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by a direct perception. This is not always the caſe, in the more general and extenſive concerns of ſocial and civil life. The ſituation is too intricate, the relations too numerous to be at once diſcovered and comprehended by a direct perception. This often happens in the enacting of laws, particularly in thoſe ſituations, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, in the more active and complicated ſcenes of civil ſociety. The complicated and various, exiſting relations, the reſult of which ought to point out the duty to be impoſed, or the claſs of actions to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, are not to be diſcovered and arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eaſe or certainty, by any direct contemplation. It therefore becomes the principal buſineſs of the legiſlator, to reſort to conſequences, to examine the probable operation of the law propoſed, the utility of the action to be required, as the only ſafe criterion, where the reſult of the exiſting relations is not obvious to a direct percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If he can diſcover the actions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be required, to be uſeful in their general tendency, in a civil, ſocial, and
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:025297_0229_0FCCF515F579C608"/>
moral view, he may reſt aſſured, that they will partake of the nature of original, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation; for moral obligation, and final, ſocial, and civil utility, ever coincide. The mind, however, frequently occupied with conſiderations of utility, is apt to reſt ſatisfied, without ſeeking any farther grounds of obligation. This has doubtleſs concurred with other cauſes, to introduce the diſtinction attempted by our learned author.</p>

               <p>THE ſole end of puniſhment is, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be, the prevention of crimes. Under crimes, I comprehend, not only the doing of thoſe things, which are directly detrimental, but the omiſſion of thoſe, which are neceſſary for the ſupport and happineſs of the community. For if man be a ſocial being, it clearly follows, that he is bound, not only to forbear injuries to the
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:025297_0230_0FCCF5171157BA50"/>
ſociety, but to contribute an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>qual ſhare to its ſupport and happineſs. It is not an obligation, ariſing from neceſſity merely. It is an original indiſpenſible duty.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen, that Deity has, by the ſtrongeſt and moſt intimate relation, the relation of cauſe and effect, connected happineſs with the virtuous actions of moral agents, miſery with their vices. Theſe are the rewards and puniſhments, in the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of Providence. To this ſyſtem, as we have ſeen, man, by the original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his nature, is admirably adapted. He is furniſhed with a moral ſenſe, by which he perceives the right and the wrong of his actions. He is alſo furniſhed with an appetite for the approbation of others. He has, conſequently, a dread of their cenſure. Thus he finds himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for his actions. When he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them to be right, he is intuitively conſcious, that he is deſerving of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, when wrong, of cenſure, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the ſame manner he judges of the actions of others.</p>
               <p>To this conſtitution of nature, all civil laws, and political inſtitutions ought to be adapted. This alone can produce and ſupport a coincidence between civil and moral obligation. Upon no other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will puniſhments be perceived to be
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:025297_0231_0FCCF518AE036370"/>
juſt and right. Upon no other principles can they have a ſalutary effect on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, life, and manners of men.</p>
               <p>If, in a government, the laws conſtitute crimes of actions indifferent to the good of ſociety, or require, that, which, in general, is detrimental, fear can be the only motive for the obſervance. In the caſe of a non-obſervance, there may be an apprehenſion of puniſhment, but there will be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of deſert. The ſuffering delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will conſider himſelf, not as guilty, but unfortunate. Others will conſider him in the ſame light. They will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed rather to pity his misfortune than to cenſure his conduct, unleſs it be for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of impudence. In ſuch caſe, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tends not to a general or particular prevention of crimes, by a ſentimental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the only end, which can juſtify puniſhments inflicted by human laws. The direct tendency of ſuch arbitrary laws is to introduce ſophiſtical evaſions, and to confound every idea of ſocial duty.</p>
               <p>The opinion that ſuch arbitrary laws, for they certainly merit no better appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are admiſſible in government, affords a pretext, for conſidering all laws in the ſame point of view, and referring all ſocial obligation to authority, not to right. The pernicious conſequences are obvious.</p>

               <p>FROM the different nature or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of governments, their principles and the ſpirit of their laws will be different. Fear, ſupported by the terror of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:025297_0233_0FCCF51C5C2060E0"/>
or a ſuperſtitious veneration for the reigning family, or both, are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that is, the great object of the laws, and the ſole motive of obedience, in a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic government. Monarchy does not loſe ſight of the principle of fear, but blends with it, chiefly in regard to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nobility, the principle of honor, as it is there underſtood, a ſentiment merely perſonal, and devoted to all the caprices of opinion. The principle of an ariſtocracy, as it relates to the ſubject, differs little from deſpotiſm. A republic, or rather a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic republic has for its principle, that is, the end of its inſtitution, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of obſervance, a rational and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental attachment of the people to the community, its laws, and government. A mixed government partakes of all the principles, each of which predominates, in proportion to the prevalence of one or other of its conſtituent parts.</p>
               <p>Where fear is the governing motive of every ſocial action, all happineſs in ſocial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, all ſocial improvements, are not neglected only, but are oppoſed by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius of the government. Blended with fear, however, <hi>honor,</hi> that principle of all the moſt capricious, ſometimes irradiates, but more frequently obſcures the ſocial horizon. Neither of them have any principal regard
<pb facs="unknown:025297_0234_0FCCF51DD61E75D8"/>
to the happineſs of the citizens, or to the intereſts of morality.</p>
               <p>The principle of a democratic republic, a ſentimental attachment to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, its inſtitution and laws, needs not, neither can it endure, the intervention of the other two principles; principles which regard the whole ſociety, as conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to gratify the paſſions and appetites of one, or a few individuals. Such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of heterogeneous principles in a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment muſt, of neceſſity, have a very general effect upon its legiſlation, upon the interpretation, and execution of its laws. It will unavoidably dictate many acts and rules of civil conduct, which can, in no view, claim the ſanction of the moral ſenſe. Such is the government of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of laws is directed by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective principle; the principle, by the conſtitution, or nature of the government. Perhaps, the laws of Great Britain are, in general, the beſt, which can conſiſt with the heterogeneous principles of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment If this be true, Judge Blackſtone's diſtinction between thoſe laws, which are morally, and thoſe which are only politic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally binding, is ſo far as it applies to thoſe laws, juſt and neceſſary. Still it is a ſevere, though an undeſigned ſtroke at the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that government.</p>

               <p>THE government of the United States of America exhibits a new ſcene in the political hiſtory of the world; a number of integral republics, each claiming and exerciſing all the powers of internal ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, within the limits of their reſpective juriſdictions, formed into one general gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, with powers of legiſlation for all national purpoſes, and the power of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting all their laws, within the ſeveral ſtates, on the individual citizens, and that independently of the local authority. The experiment was new, and the ſucceſs has, hitherto, exceeded the moſt ſanguine expectation of its advocates. A ſituation ſo complicated, ſo different from that of ſimple governments, which have been the ſubject of theſe ſketches, will have an effect,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:025297_0239_0FCCF5285BB77198"/>
if not upon the laws of nature, from which the general principles are ultimately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, yet to give a different modification to thoſe principles, owing to the different combinations and relative circumſtances of the conſtituent parts; and will have an influence on its organization, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of its laws.</p>
               <p>To examine theſe principles, and the ſeveral excellences and defects to be found in them, and the national government, to which they have given riſe, is a ſubject of importance to every citizen of the Union. The novelty of the ſubject, in which the example of other nations furniſh little or no light of experience, and in which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time has not yet been allowed for a full maturity of obſervation on the effects of this ſyſtem in operation, renders it a taſk of difficulty, and of dubious ſucceſs. I do not aſpire to a perfect ſyſtem, to a full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the ſubject. Mine is a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler taſk. I aim only at ſketches.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral American States, while co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, or provinces of the Britiſh empire, had, in general, no direct connexion, or governmental dependence on each other. They were, though ſituated in the ſame vicinity, and profeſſing allegiance to the ſame common ſovereign, connected only through the government of Great-Britain,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:025297_0240_0FCCF52A3B0E8BA8"/>
the common head. There exiſted a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of manners, which might well be called national. There were, indeed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial differences; not greater, however, than are to be found in the iſland of Great-Britain, or even in England alone. As Americans, they had little national ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was by different channels cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in Great-Britain. Any collected, permanent, national ſentiment was oppoſed by their foreign connexion. It was the policy of the Britiſh government to foment diviſions in the colonies, to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and to cheriſh their local prejudices. The ſimilarity of their circumſtances, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in the difficulties of making ſettlements in a wild, uncultivated country, at a great remove from any part of the civilized world, produced ſome degree of direct attachment. This was increaſed by the neceſſity of defence againſt a common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Bloody wars waged againſt them by the ſavages, who were inſtigated and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the French, the ancient enemies of the Engliſh, ſuggeſted the expediency of common counſels, and united excitions. Conſultations were held, by Delegates from the ſeveral provinces; meaſures for the common defence were deviſed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards executed, in purſuance of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual counſels. This was the germ of that general u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and ſentiments, which produced the American revolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="unknown:025297_0241_0FCCF52B83109B60"/>It for a time acquired its utmoſt force from the oppreſſive meaſures of the Britiſh government, which equally affected the liberties of all the colonies, now the United States of America. The firſt inhabitants had brought with them all the democratic principles of the Britiſh government and had communicated them, nearly free and unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to their deſcendants. Their love of liberty, and a knowlege of their rights, was not a little increaſed, both by an equal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of rights and property under mild and equitable laws, moſtly formed by themſelves, and by the diſputes, to which extraordinary claims of power, on the part of Great-Britain, had given occaſion. The principles of Monarchy and Ariſtocracy, had, however, prevailed, more, or leſs, in almoſt all the colonial governments. They were, in form, epitomes, of the Britiſh government. In each, there was a Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, repreſenting the King; a Council, repreſenting the Houſe of Lords; and an Aſſembly, compoſed of the Repreſentatives of the People, the Commons of America. In moſt of the colonies, the Governor and Council were mere creatures of the Crown. They were wholly dependent on the King. He appointed and removed them, as well as the Judges, at pleaſure. This created a powerful ariſtocratical influence, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:025297_0242_0FCCF52CCC73A710"/>
hoſtile to the liberties and intereſts of the people. Happily, the plan of eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a hereditary Nobility in America, was never adopted. Had ſuch an eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment been made, at an early day, it would, by ſecuring a permanent intereſt in the principles of the Britiſh government, and by holding out the tempting bait of honors to the more wealthy and influential characters, have firmly, perhaps durably, riveted the ſhackles of ſlavery on the Americans.</p>
               <p>When the meaſures, which gave riſe to the American revolution, were adopted by the government of Britain, the body of the people had not been corrupted by theſe principles. The ſentiments of attachment, which originated in their deſcent from a common ſtock, and was cheriſhed by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity of circumſtances and adventures, had been ſtrengthened by their common counſels, and common exertions, in a long and bloody war. Theſe common exertions had given them an opinion of their united importance. A more general acquaintance had been introduced, and a reciprocation of counſels and good offices, tended to ſoften and remove thoſe local prejudices, which had intervened, and which had been artfully fomented, by the jealous temper of the mother government. A ſimilarity
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:025297_0243_0FCCF52FE69194B8"/>
of ſituation, and a ſimilarity of danger, from the ſame quarter, united their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and ſentiments, and ſuggeſted the idea of again uniting their counſels, to obtain redreſs. This produced the firſt Congreſs. A number of delegates from the ſeveral colonies aſſembled for mutual council, on the common ſituation, in which they were placed, by the oppreſſive meaſures of the Britiſh government, and laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the American republic.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Congreſs was met, when Great Britain commenced her military operations againſt what ſhe termed her rebellious col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies. From that time, a Congreſs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the affairs of America. The fourth of July, 1776, the thirteen colonies were, with their general conſent, declared by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, Free and independent States. The ſeveral ſtates, now independent, adopted or continued republican forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and entered into articles of confed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration for their mutual defence, and the direction of national meaſures. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional government which was to be in a Congreſs of delegates from the ſeveral ſtates, had little more than the power of a diplomatic body. They were inveſted with neither the power, nor the means of carrying their ordinances into execution. The ſtates governments retained the only
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:025297_0244_0FCCF53580BAD038"/>
efficient power within their ſeveral juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Common danger, preſſing from every quarter, for a time, united their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and ſupplied a degree of energy to their meaſures, which carried them trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly through the war, and ſecured their independence; but the principle of this energy was wholly foreign to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooner was the war ended, than the total inefficiency of the federal government was diſcovered. An enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous debt had been contracted, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic credit was in the loweſt and moſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating ſtate of depreciation. Congreſs found themſelves, in effect, poſſeſſed of neither legiſlative nor executive powers. Their ordinances were diſregarded. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtates neglected or refuſed to furniſh their quotas of the national expenditures, the price of their liberty and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In ſome ſtates, the treaties made with foreign nations, particularly with Great Britain, were diſregarded, or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violated. The authority of Congreſs was wholly loſt. The ſtates had, in effect, become ſo many independent nations. There was no more a national ſentiment, or the purſuit of a national intereſt. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prejudices, which had ſubſided, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtruggle for liberty, were rapidly reviving. Each ſtate purſuing its local and
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:025297_0245_0FCCF53880FEF588"/>
ſeparate intereſts, ſeemed to bid defiance to any national union. The effect of this ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation began to be apparent in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people, and in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtates governments. They were verging towards the ſituation of ſmall, independent tribes in the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity. This ſituation viſibly contracted the views of the people, and formed them to a ſpirit of faction. The ſtates govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were moſtly incapable of purſuing any energetic ſyſtem of adminiſtration. The whole country was clearly in a ſtate of civil and political retrogradation.</p>
               <p>The effect on the minds of the people was no leſs moral than political. A want of public credit, and its concomitant evil, a depreciating paper currency, had nearly ruined their morals, their induſtry, and their commerce, as well as private credit. Many other cauſes, not neceſſary here to enumerate, concurred to heighten the evil. Dangerous inſurrections actually exiſted in ſome ſtates, and others trembled in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the like event. Many began to ſuppoſe that the liberty, for which they had riſked ſo much blood and treaſure, was but a phantom of the imagination; that an equal enjoyment of rights was, under any arangement, incompatible with political happineſs. The wiſeſt and beſt
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:025297_0246_0FCCF53CB055D338"/>
citizens had conceived, that an energetic ſyſtem of national government, could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone give any reaſonable hope of reviving the ruined ſtate of commerce, of reſtoring public and private credit, of giving any degree of nationality to the Union, of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the faith of public treaties, and in a word, of preventing or repelling the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous impending evils, which threatened to plunge the country into anarchy, and all the horrors of a civil war. Congreſs, who were fully ſenſible of the inefficiency of their powers, to any national purpoſe, recommended it to the ſtates to meet in Convention, by their Delegates, to delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate on a plan of national government, which might be equal to the exigencies of the ſtates. The preſent conſtitution of the United States of America, was the reſult of their deliberations. This conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as a <hi>unique</hi> in federal politics, orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated in an actual, deliberate agreement between the ſtates, and was ratified by the free conſent of the people of each ſtate, by their Repreſentatives, choſen for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Briefly to examine the principles of this government, both in its organization and operation, and to enquire how far it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the ſituation of the country, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready divided into ſeparate ſtates, will be the ſubject of the following ſections.</p>

               <p>THE political ſituation of the American States, occaſioned many anxious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, as to the practicability or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of conſtituting an efficient, national government. It created numerous diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which experience alone could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate. It was by many apprehended, that an efficient, national government could not conſiſt with any conſiderable degree of authority, in the ſtates governments; that it would encounter all the abſurdities of a ſovereignty within a ſovereignty; and that one, in the end, muſt be annihilated by the other. According to the various opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions concerning the utility and neceſſity of an energetic, national government, ſome warmly ſupported, while others deprecated the idea of a collected ſovereignty. The
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:025297_0248_0FCCF5426CF6BE00"/>
magnitude of the object excited the anxiety of every claſs. Many dreaded an arbitrary power in a general government, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled, by the authority of the ſtates. Some, alarmed at the danger, which threatened a diſſolution of all national union, and willing to riſk a deſperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which, they imagined, could alone prove effectual, would readily have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed the whole authority of the ſtates, to a national legiſlature. They wiſhed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation of the whole into one efficient government.</p>
               <p>Others, from a more happy train of thought, or more mature reflection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the plan of reconciling the general and particular powers, not ſo much by a ſubordination of one to the other, as by a preciſe limitation, in reſpect to their ſeveral objects, and rendering them mutually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient, and even neceſſary to each other's efficiency. They perceived, that it was not practicable, perhaps, not even deſirable that the ſame regulations, the ſame mode of holding property, and conducting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal policy, ſhould take place through the whole. They perceived, that in a country ſo extenſive, ſoil, climate, and circumſtances, at firſt, accidental, had introduced local differences of manners, habits, intereſts, and purſuits; that theſe differences were,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:025297_0249_0FCCF5434F09ABA0"/>
generally, limited by the limits of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtates; that they might give riſe to an emulation in arts and induſtry, and lay the foundation of an extenſive national in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, by way of exchange; but, that it would be impoſſible to comprehend them under any general regulations and uniform national laws. There were local legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures already eſtabliſhed, equal to all local occaſions. They perceived, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional intereſt was not concerned to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere in matters of this nature. The objects of the national <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vernment would be more general. The great idea was to give a national individuality to the ſtates collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively. It was apprehended, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent intereſts, properly repreſented, might be modified, compromiſed, and directed, in ſuch manner, that inſtead of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terferences and irreconcilable oppoſitions, which muſt frequently ariſe from too great a degree of independence among the ſeveral ſtates, they might be bro't to coaleſce, and add no leſs to the individual, than national proſperity. The point of great difficulty was, to render the acting members of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral government, accountable, as well to the ſtates governments, as to the people; and to conſtitute the federal government, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently energetic, to carry into execution, by an authority delegated for that purpoſe,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:025297_0250_0FCCF5465694C300"/>
every neceſſary, national meaſure; and yet, ſo to limit the authority, in exerciſe, that no danger might reaſonably be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to the rights of the people, or the ſtates in their particular juriſdictions.</p>
               <p>Several inſtances occur, both in ancient and modern times, of ſmall ſtates confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, with a view to a general union, in the purſuit of national meaſures. The great end in view, and which has always been a deſideratum in federal politics, was to bring the people to have a ſenſe of a national intereſt, and all the ſtates of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, effectually to act in concert, in thoſe meaſures, which relate immediately to the good of the whole. We may now reckon three principal modes, in which this has been attempted.</p>
               <p>The firſt, becauſe the moſt ancient mode, is by a council empowered to legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late upon the ſeveral ſtates compoſing the confederacy. Of this kind was the Council of the Amphictyons, at the head of the confederated ſtates of ancient Greece. In this caſe, as none but ſtates can refuſe to obey, a delinquent can be nothing leſs than a ſtate, already provided with arms and councils for a formidable oppoſition. To enforce the decrees of the confederate council, which we may call the laws of the union, it becomes neceſſary, in caſe of a
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:025297_0251_0FCCF548A0F6BC68"/>
refuſal of any part, to draw out the forces of the complying ſtates, and to compel obedience by dint of arms. The hiſtory of ancient Greece is, for many years, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for a ſucceſſion of ſuch wars. Such were the Sacred, and many other wars. The famous Peloponneſian war, which raged with almoſt unabated fury nearly thirty years, may, in a great meaſure, be attributed to the ſame cauſe, the want of an efficient power in the national council. Such ever have been, and ſuch ever will be the effects of this kind of government, unleſs, like the late Congreſs of the United States of America, they ſuffer their laws and ordinances to be violated with impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in this caſe, the conſequences will be the ſame; the government will ſoon ſink to the loweſt point of degradation, and tremble on the brink of evaneſcence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond mode is, by a council, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to propoſe meaſures to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated ſtates, ſubject to the ratification of the ſtates individually, before they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the force of laws, or can be carried into execution by the general authority. The government of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, furniſhes us with an example of this ſecond m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de. The State General are the grand council of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy. This council, though pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:025297_0252_0FCCF54B954D4710"/>
ſtiled THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES, have, in all matters of national concern, whether of greater or leſs moment, a power to propoſe only. The ſeveral ſtates have reſerved to themſelves the right of ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No law can be conſtitutionally binding, until it have been ratified by each. The <hi>veto</hi> of a ſingle ſtate, and even, in ſome inſtances, of a ſingle corporation, may diſconcert, and actually has diſconcerted the national counſels, in meaſures of preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſity. Frequently, on great emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, ſuch has been the delay, before all the ſtates could be brought to agree, that the opportunity of acting has been wholly loſt. This has induced the States General, aided by the hereditary Prince of Orange, who, as Stadtholder, adminiſters the republic, and whoſe power and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are great, ſometimes to act without the authority of the ſmaller ſtates, and even againſt their determinations. Such a diſregard to the conſtitutional principles of their union, has, among that people, not remarkable for a ſpirit of faction, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed high domeſtic violences, and convulſed the government, with dangerous inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

of the confederacy, to legiſlate upon the citizens of the ſeveral ſtates, as citizens of the Union, and to carry the laws into execution, by miniſterial officers of the ſame government. Of this form of federal government, we have the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete example, in the preſent conſtitution of the United States of America. In this government, the National Legiſlature, in all matters, which come within the ſphere of their conſtitutional authority, legiſlate, not upon the ſtates collectively, but upon the citizens of the union. Their meaſures and laws are valid and binding, without any ratification beyond their own act. The conſtitution, and all acts of authority, warranted by the conſtitution, are the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme law of the land, and binding in all deciſions, as well in the courts of the ſeveral ſtates, as in the federal courts. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent different conſtructions, which might ariſe in different tribunals, under the bias of local authority, influence, or prejudice, the judiciary, for all caſes ariſing under the conſtitution and laws of the Union, and thoſe caſes of public or private controverſy, to which the ſtate juriſdictions are incompetent, or, unavoidably liable to a partiality dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to general juſtice, hold their offices by appointment of the ſupreme power of the confederacy, and are amenable only to
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:025297_0254_0FCCF5500E27D720"/>
that power, and their deciſions are carried into effect by miniſterial officers appointed under the ſame authority.</p>
               <p>While the federal government is veſted with the ſupreme authority, in all matters, which involve the general welfare of the Union, conſidered in a national view, the ſtates governments, within the limits of their ſeveral juriſdictions, retain, as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, all thoſe powers, which, in their due adminiſtration, moſt endear the civil ſtate to mankind. To them it belongs, among their own citizens, to regulate the mode of acquiring, and to ſecure the acquiſition of property, to animadvert upon morals, and to reſtrain and puniſh thoſe crimes, which attack private property, violate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſecurity, or in any way, diſturb the peace of their communities.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> Organization and Powers of the Federal Government.—Limitation of its Powers. —Principles of Accountability.—Brief View of its effects in Practice.</head>
               <p>THE government of the United States of America is conſtituted with legiſlative, judicial, and executive powers, veſted in diſtinct and ſeparate departments. The legiſlative power is veſted in a Congreſs, conſiſting of a Senate, and Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, whoſe powers in legiſlation are mutual. The Repreſentatives are choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the people of the ſeveral ſtates, every ſecond year, and are apportioned by the number of people in each ſtate, to be aſcertained by an actual enumeration, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en once in every ten years.</p>
               <p>The qualifications for the Electors of the Repreſentatives are not reduced to a uniform rule throughout the Union; but are to be the ſame in each ſtate, as for the electors of the moſt numerous branch of the ſtate legiſlature. To be eligible, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, three qualifications are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, neither of which introduce any odious diſtinction of claſſes. To be eligible, a
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:025297_0256_0FCCF55731A54A20"/>
perſon, muſt have attained the age of twenty-five years, have been ſeven years a citizen of the United States, and at the time of his being elected, an inhabitant of the ſtate, for which he is elected. Property is, in moſt of the ſtates, a qualification, both of electors and candidates; ſo far it is a qualification for the electors of the federal repreſentatives; but not for candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates. Hence it may happen, that a perſon may be elected, who has not a right of ſuffrage in the election. This is, at leaſt, a ſlight inconſiſtency, which it would have been deſirable to have avoided, by extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, more equally and uniformly, the right of ſuffrage. It is probable, however, that difficulties, on this point, would have ariſen from an attachment to local uſages.</p>
               <p>The Senate of the United States is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two Senators from each ſtate, choſen by the Legiſlature. The Senators are divided into three claſſes. The ſeats of one claſs are vacated every ſecond year, and the vacancies ſupplied by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſtates, to which the ſenators of ſuch claſs reſpectively belong. Their election is, therefore, in reality, ſexennial, and the ſenate can never be compoſed of more than one third new members. There are three qualifications for a ſenator — He muſt have attained the age of thirty
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:025297_0257_0FCCF5584C7796E0"/>
years, have been nine years a citizen of the United States, and at the time of his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be an inhabitant of the ſtate, for which he is choſen.</p>
               <p>We may, with ſatisfaction obſerve, that in the qualifications of the ſenators, there is no feature of ariſtocracy, nothing, which tends to a diſtinction of ranks. The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, both of the ſenators and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, tend only to ſecure in the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral legiſlature, a maturity of experience and abilities, an attachment to the national intereſt, and the intereſts of the reſpective ſtates.</p>
               <p>Each Houſe chuſe their own officers, except, that the Vice-Preſident of the United States, for the time being, is Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Senate, and are ſole judges of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own members. The times and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of holding elections for ſenators are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the legiſlature of each ſtate; but Congreſs have power, by law, to make, or alter ſuch regulations, except, as to the place of electing ſenators. This exception was made, that Congreſs might not have it in their power to remove the ſtate legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures from place to place, at their pleaſure. Would it not have tended to ſecure a more equal repreſentation of the national intereſts, and a more ready acquieſcence in
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:025297_0258_0FCCF55B10D24E10"/>
the laws of the Union, had a conſtitutional proviſion been made, for a diviſion of each ſtate, in the election of repreſentatives, into diſtricts, agreeably to a juſt apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I apprehend it to be of ſufficient importance to claim a place among the laws of the conſtitution. Congreſs are to aſſemble, at leaſt, once in every year. Each Houſe is to keep a journal of its proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and to publiſh the ſame from time to time, with the yeas and nays, which are to be taken and entered on every queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if deſired by one fifth of the members preſent.</p>
               <p>Beſide the ordinary powers of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the houſe of repreſentatives have the ſole power, in the national government, of bringing impeachments, and the ſenate have the ſole power of trying ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments.</p>
               <p>No bill can paſs into a law, without the concurrence of both houſes, and bills may indifferently originate in either. There is, indeed, one exception, and that a wiſe one, relative to bills for raiſing a revenue. Theſe muſt originate in the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. The revenue is to be raiſed upon the people, to whom the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are amenable, not upon the ſtates col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively.</p>

               <p>Congreſs are, by the conſtitution, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, for the purpoſe of paying the debts of the Union, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding

No perſon is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being appointed an elector, who, at the time ſhall be a ſenator, or repreſentative in Congreſs, or hold any office of profit, or truſt, under the United States. Congreſs have power to determine the time of chuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the electors, and the day of giving their votes, which is to be the ſame in every ſtate.

If there be more than one, who have ſuch majority, and have an equal number of votes, the houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are immediately to chuſe, by ballot; one of them for Preſident; and if no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have a majority, the ſame houſe are to chuſe a Preſident from the five higheſt on the liſt.

               <p>The qualifications for the office of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, are, that he be a natural born citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time, when the conſtitution was adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that he have attained the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five years, and have been fourteen years reſident within the United States.

It is finally declared, that the enumeration of certain rights, in the conſtitution, ſhall not be conſtrued to deny or diſparage others retained by the people, and that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not delegated to the United States, by the conſtitution, nor prohibited by it to the ſtates, are reſerved to the ſtates reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or to the people.</p>
               <p>In ſimple governments, an expreſs limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powers is neceſſary, on the part of the rulers only. The limitations on the part of the conſtituent members, are implied in the duty of obedience to the conſtitutional acts of government. In the federal government, the ſituation of the conſtituent members, more involved, than in ſimple governments, rendered a different proviſion neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The members of the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though conſiſting ultimately of the ſame individuals, may be conſidered in two diſtinct views; individually, as citizens of the Union, and collectively, as formed into ſeveral ſtates, each, within its own limits, veſted with rights and powers of legiſlation, adequate to every civil regulation, merely internal. The ſtate legiſlatures might, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the objects, or the ſubject matter of their regulations, interfere with that author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which the collective national intereſts,
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:025297_0274_0FCCF580AEAF2048"/>
the peace, happineſs, and proſperity of the whole require ſhould be exerciſed by the national government alone. To prevent an evil, of a tendency ſo fatal, in a national view, is apparently the principal end of all the limitations on the powers of the ſeveral ſtates, and their legiſlative bodies. The federal government, deſigned to embrace only general, and national objects, and not extend to the merely internal regulations and policy of the individual ſtates, it was found, in reſpect to its objects, to be leſs involved, and its powers capable of a more preciſe enumeration and definition. For this reaſon few, and thoſe pretty general limitations of the powers of the federal government, are inſerted. Inſtead of particular, enumerated inſtances, in which its powers are limited, the ſame end is more fully attainted, by a declaration, which, in effect, denies to Congreſs, the exerciſe of any farther, or other powers, than thoſe, which are delegated by the conſtitution, and reſerves to the ſtates and the people, all thoſe powers and rights, which are not ſo delegated. This, as it takes away every pretence for claiming conſtructive powers, in derogation of the powers of the ſtates, and the rights of their reſpective citizens, if not the only effectual, is clearly the ſafeſt mode of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:025297_0275_0FCCF58315BE8B28"/>
the powers of a government thus conſtituted.</p>
               <p>The accountability of the rulers is a prominent feature, in the federal conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſecuring this important object, great attention has been paid to the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of the ſituation of the conſtituent members, both as ſtates, and as citizens. The ſenators of the United States, appointed by the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, and from time to time amenable to them, may well be conſidered as guardians of the rights of their reſpective ſtates againſt all eneroachments of the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The repreſentatives in Congreſs, elected by the people, and accountable to them, through the means of biennial elections, are bound by all the ties of intereſt and affection, to watch over the rights of the citizens, and the rights of the ſeveral ſtates, with which their electors are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately connected.</p>
               <p>The right which once in four years, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves on the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, of appointing the electors of the Preſident and Vice-Preſident of the United States, or of directing their appointment by the people, ſecures to the ſtates and to the people, a powerful check on the executive of the federal government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="unknown:025297_0276_0FCCDA3E148480A0"/>The judges, appointed by the Preſident, with the advice of the ſenate, to hold their offices during good behavior, ſecure of their compenſation, without the fear of diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſubjected with all other officers of the national government, to removal by impeachment, and puniſhment by the laws of the land, for male-adminiſtration, are placed in a ſtate of accountability, blended with a degree of independence, from which can alone be expected an inflexible integrity of conduct, in that department.</p>
               <p>This conſtitution of government, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame principles as the conſtitutions of the ſeveral ſtates in the Union, as nearly as the relative ſituations admit, and formed on the ſame plan, exhibits, in theory, the moſt beautiful ſyſtem, which has yet been deviſed by the wiſdom of man. It is true, that this form of federal government is a new phenomenon in the political world. Hardly a ſhadow of ſuch principles and powers, as it relates to the practice and execution, in a federal union of ſtates, is to be found in the hiſtory of ancient or modern politics. In this age of improvements, no leſs in the ſcience of government, than in other ſciences, its novelty will not be made a ſerious objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet it muſt be acknowleged, that the conſiſtency of theſe principles in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:025297_0277_0FCCF587D8A08508"/>
and their efficiency, in point of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, might ſtill be conſidered as problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, had they not, in a good meaſure, been evinced by actual experiment. Solely an impreſſion of the efficiency of the federal government, favored, perhaps, by its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional magnitude and importance, added, at the inſtant of its organization, a degree of energy to the ſtates governments, and put an end to thoſe factions and turbulent commotions, which made ſome of them tremble for their political exiſtence. The legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, under the auſpices of this government, appear to have exploded their former ſyſtems of local and temporary expediency, and founding themſelves more generally on the baſis of moral and national juſtice, have given a force and conſiſtency to their laws, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired a confidence among the citizens, the want of which had almoſt annihilated private credit. The authority of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral government rendered this confidence general and reciprocal. Its beneficial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence was not confined to the limits of the Union. It extended to diſtant countries, and produced the happieſt effects in the commercial intercourſe of the citizens with foreign nations.</p>
               <p>The adminiſtration of this government, by diſcovering the national reſources,
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:025297_0278_0FCCF58973839F40"/>
uniting and directing them to the proper objects, by an almoſt inſtantaneous impulſe, reſtored public credit and national faith, which had long been in a ſtate bordering on deſperation, to a degree of reſpectability, of which few examples are to be found in the hiſtory of nations. Theſe operations afforded means, and added vigor to induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try among every claſs of citizens. Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, commerce, arts, and manufactures, have felt a new, and more powerful ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. The ſpirit of enterpriſe, without which nothing great is ever to be expected, has, by the extenſiveneſs of the proſpects, and the magnitude of the objects preſented, been productive of effects, of which the Americans had, before, hardly entertained a conception. In ſuch a change of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch a novelty of proſpects and ſecurity of hope, an intemperance in the ſpirit of enterpriſe was, in ſome meaſure, to be expected. Accordingly, in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, it degenerated into ſpeculating projects, the influence of which on morals were, for the moment, no leſs pernicious, than the depreciating ſyſtem, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded. This ought, however, to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to its proper cauſe, the former extent and degraded ſtate of paper credit. In applying a remedy to an evil, ſo univerſally inveterate, this effect ought to be conſidered,
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:025297_0279_0FCCF58AD76EEAA8"/>
rather as the laſt malignant effort of the evil, than an indication of the unſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the remedy.</p>
               <p>The wiſdom, juſtice, and equality of the laws enacted under the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſequently the beneficial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of its principles, are ſtrongly evinced by the prompt obſervance of a free and enlightened people. Compared with the extent and variety of tranſactions, which, ſince the adoption of this government, have employed every claſs of citizens, the courts of the Union have in few inſtances, been called to animadvert on a breach of its laws.</p>
               <p>The experience, which we have already had, is ſufficient to found a confidence, not only in the efficiency of the federal government; but in the coincidence of its principles, with the laws of civil and ſocial nature, and the preſent ſtate of manners and knowlege.</p>

               <p>MONTESQUIEU, ſpeaking of that kind of government, which was eſtabliſhed through Europe, by the conquerors of the Roman empire, ſays, "It was a good government, that had in itſelf a capacity of growing better."<note n="*" place="bottom">Sp.

Accordingly we have ſeen this kind of government, almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, degenerating into a ſpecies of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm. If any government have admited improvements, theſe improvements have never been deliberately made, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of any fixed plan of reformation adopted in the conſtitution.

                  <pb n="282" facs="unknown:025297_0281_0FCCF58F42AA0D78"/>Notwithſtanding the foregoing obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monteſquieu, he appears to join in an opinion, which has very generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that governments, like men, from a neceſſity of nature, carry in themſelves, from their very origin, the feeds of diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that man is fatally incapable of forming any ſyſtem, which ſhall endure without degenerating. This opinion ſeems to be countenanced by the experience of ages. I am apprehenſive, however, that on enquiry, we ſhall find reaſon for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion. A more general develope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laws of human nature, may diſcover, that, though in the infancy of mankind, from which, perhaps thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who have made the greateſt advances, have hardly emerged, this may be true; yet man is, by nature, capable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may render an amelioration in government as eaſy and familiar as in any ſcience. The ſame fate has attended all ſciences of more difficult inveſtigation. Their eſtabliſhment and improvement have generally been attempted by reaſonings <hi>a priori,</hi> in which imagination is the principal agent. It has fared in the ſame manner with the various ſyſtems of natural philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, morality, and theology, which have ſucceeded each other in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="unknown:025297_0282_0FCCF591D3E72760"/>Within little more than a century, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental reaſonings have baniſhed almoſt innumerable abſurdities, and in many ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſeem to have laid a foundation of knowlege, as fixed and as durable, as the courſe of nature. It is at length perceived, that the operations of nature are ſubjected to certain laws, eſtabliſhed by Deity, in the conſtitution of things; and, that nothing can be durable, which is calculated to thwart thoſe laws, or divert them from their courſe. Man, and all the works of man, no leſs than inert matter, are ſubjected to thoſe laws. States, kingdoms and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, if they admit principles, which thwart the eſtabliſhed laws of nature, like heaps of ſand, oppoſed to the reſiſtleſs force of a torrent, are inevitably ſwept into the gulf of diſſolution.</p>
               <p>The laws of nature, we have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, are immutable; not ſo the relations, from which they reſult; or the particular ſituations, in which thoſe laws were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to operate. This may need ſome illuſtration.</p>
               <p>Matter is found exiſting, under modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions infinitely various, and is denominated of different kinds. Different kinds of matter, endued with what we call different powers, are found to have certain relations to each other, as well in the more ſimple, as in the
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:025297_0283_0FCCF59319DECD80"/>
more intricate and comprehenſive combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. In all the variety of ways, in which they may be combined, each particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, invariably produces the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular effect. If the combination be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the relations are changed. It comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a different law, and a different effect is produced. All kinds of inert matter are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, from any internal power, which they poſſeſs, of changing their combination, or of altering the preſent exiſting relations. If any change or alteration be made, it muſt ariſe from ſomething external. Hence, in the natural world, the courſe of effects is uniform, becauſe the relations and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of themſelves continue uniform. In the moral world it is different. Man has both active and paſſive powers; both intelligence and volition to direct their operations. He is capable of changing the relative ſituation of things, both in reſpect to himſelf, and in reſpect to the different kinds of matter, which are ſubjected to his operations. Hence the relative ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being leſs uniform, effects and events, both natural and moral, as they relate to him, will be leſs uniform. The relations of matter, and the laws of its operation, are to the material agents, irreſiſtible; not ſo the laws of moral action. The laws of moral action reſpect the deſign of the
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:025297_0284_0FCCF596F629AD48"/>
agent, in connexion with the means and the end, both general and particular. The laws of matter have no reſpect to the deſign of the material agents. The one is obligatory, and precedes the action: the other is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and accompanies the operation.</p>
               <p>For theſe, among other reaſons, the laws of moral agents, by which their actions are produced and governed, and the events, which reſpect them, directed, are not ſo eaſily underſtood, or ſo fully comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the laws of matter.</p>
               <p>To an omniſcient Being, indeed, the former are as perfectly intelligible as the latter. We know likewiſe, that men are capable of acquiring much knowlege on the ſubject, and that ſome of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive minds, and cloſer obſervation, are capable of tracing the laws of human actions, even in many very intricate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, and of calculating upon their general operations, in given ſituations, with no inconſiderable degree of certainty. This is, indeed, the only ſolid foundation of political ſcience. Political and civil laws are deſigned to regulate the future actions of men, as they ariſe in ſociety, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch relations, as are dictated by the laws of ſocial nature. Knowlege equal to this taſk is the reſult, only of accumulated experience. But a neceſſity for civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:025297_0285_0FCCF5991E1CC938"/>
ariſes antecedent to experience. Civil inſtitutions have generally been the rude productions of neceſſity, and the form originally impoſed by fraud, violence, or what, to men, are the mere ſuggeſtions of chance. Men have commonly regarded only ſome of the moſt obvious, the moſt predominant, exiſting relations, with little knowlege of the change in the preſent relations, which would be the neceſſary effect of their inſtitutions, or of the future improvement of the ſpecies. Indeed, could every individual in ſociety, have an intuitive preſcience of the changes, as they were to ariſe, in their order, it would ſtill, perhaps, be impoſſible to form any human inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhould accommodate itſelf to every ſituation in the progreſs. Intereſt, with ſome, an habitual veneration for anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent eſtabliſhments, with all, an opinion of the preſent perfection of government, and a dread of encouraging a ſpirit of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the bane of a well regulated ſociety, have concured to prevent any regular plan of fundamental reformation in government, and to continue, as unalterably perfect, thoſe inſtitutions, which were adapted only to the weakneſs, ignorance, and barbarous manners of an infant people.</p>
               <p>By the force of habit, and inveterate national prejudices, abuſes are rendered
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:025297_0286_0FCCF59A5A197908"/>
ſacred, and not unfrequently, come to be conſidered as rightful privileges; and thoſe inſtitutions, which were the offspring of chance or violence, to be extolled as the moſt perfect productions of reaſon, founded in the original and unalterable principles of nature. Such was the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch has been the force of hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual prejudice upon the people of that kingdom. That government has, indeed, received, many improvements, with the improvements of the age; but they have generally been wreſted by force from the reigning powers, or interpoſed in a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the crown. Many reſpectable characters long conſidered them as ſo many violations of the moſt ſacred rights. The greater part of the nation appear fully perſuaded, that all farther improvements are impracticable, and that becauſe their government was once the beſt, perhaps, which exiſted in the world, it muſt, through all the progreſſive advances in knowlege, in morals, and in manners, continue the beſt, a pattern of unchanging perfection, though, in its principles, it is much too limited for the preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>te. It is probable that all improvement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> will be oppoſed and prevented by thoſe in power, who are intereſted in the preſent order of things, till the improvements of an
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:025297_0287_0FCCF59BD60DA528"/>
enlightened age, ſhall produce a violent concuſſion in the combat with ancient prejudices, and ſtruggle through a ſcene of tumult, outrage, and perhaps civil war, to arrive at ſome inconſiderable amelioration, in their conſtitution.</p>
               <p>In the progreſs of ſocial improvements, there uſually ariſes a repugnancy, between the principles of the government, and the preſent morals and manners of the people. Hence we may learn to account for the conſtant ſuperiority, in moſt nations, of private to political morality, as practiſed by the ſame individuals. The principles of a government, adapted to the limited occaſions of a ſimple and infant ſtate of ſociety, tend in oppoſition to the progreſs of improvement, or to divert it into partial and devious channels. This muſt have a very pernicious effect, as well upon the adminiſtration of the government, as upon the morals, habits, and manners of the people. From this ſource, principally, has proceeded that corruption in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of government, that degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the manners of the people, which has perpetually proved the ruin of the moſt celebrated civil inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>The conſining of a people, who have arrived at a highly improved ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, to the forms and principles of a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment,
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:025297_0288_0FCCF59E753CF7A0"/>
which originated in a ſimple, if not barbarous ſtate of men and manners, may not unaptly be compared to a cuſtom, which prevails among the Chineſe. A ſmall foot being reckoned the higheſt point of beauty, it is the univerſal practice with them, to confine the feet of their female infants, to prevent their growth. When arrived at maturity, the feet of the Chineſe women, it is ſaid, do not exceed in ſize thoſe of an infant of ſix months old; ſo that from the diſproportion of thoſe members to the weight of the body, they appear rather to totter than walk. No leſs aukwardneſs of ſituation, no leſs perverſion of nature muſt take place, in a nation, where the improvement of its civil and political inſtitutions are limited, and not ſuffered to proceed in any degree of equality with the general improvements of the people.</p>
               <p>In this point, the conſtitution of the United States of America, is diſtinguiſhed from all other national eſtabliſhment. It is not pretended to have attained the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is calculated to admit amendments, correſponding with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the citizens in ſocial improvements, and political ſcience. The idea of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating, in the conſtitution itſelf, a plan

of reformation, which, without encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpirit of innovation, the parent of anarchy and final deſpotiſm, might enable the people, with deliberation, and more mature experience, to correct what ſhould be, at any time, found wrong in the form, principles, or operation of the government, was firſt adopted, in practice, in ſome of the individual ſtates of the confederacy. It had been found, not only practicable and ſafe in the exerciſe, but its happy effect in ameliorating the fundamental principles of the government, had, in ſeveral inſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, been fully evinced. This idea was taken up and purſued in framing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government for the United States. It is made a fundamental article of that conſtitution, that "Congreſs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever two thirds of both houſes ſhall deem it neceſſary, ſhall propoſe amendments to the conſtitution, or on application of two thirds of the ſeveral ſtates, ſhall call a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention for propoſing amendments, which in either caſe ſhall be valid to all intents and purpoſes, as parts of the conſtitution, when ratified by the legiſlatures of three fourths of the ſeveral ſtates, or by conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in three fourths thereof, as the one, or the other mode of ratification may be propoſed by Congreſs." There are ſome reſtrictions on the power of making

amendments. Among other things it is provided, that no ſtate ſhall, without its conſent, be deprived of its equal ſuffrage in the ſenate.</p>
               <p>In virtue of the power veſted in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and reſerved to the people and the ſtates, by this article, ſeveral important amendments have already been adopted in the federal conſtitution; and we have reaſon to believe, that whatever, on expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ſhall be found deficient in principle, will be added; whatever ſhall be found dangerous to the rights of the people or the ſtates, or impracticable in operation, will be retrenched and corrected. The wiſdom, which formed it, aided and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by experience, may, not only extend its principles, with the progreſs of ſocial improvements, but carry it to a greater degree of practical perfection than any thing, which has yet been known in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Let us not, then, raſhly, or from the pride of a prophetic ſpirit, conclude that this beautiful ſyſtem is, with the crazy empires of antiquity, deſtined to a ſpeedy diſſolution; or that it muſt in time, thro' the degeneracy of the people, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of its principles, of neceſſity give place to a ſyſtem of remedileſs tyranny and oppreſſion. Let us rather, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:025297_0291_0FCCF5A355FCCCA8"/>
a rational hope, that it will endure as long as the ſucceſſive generations of men, attend, with the calmneſs of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and the perſevering zeal of patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, to the enjoyment of its bleſſings, and the improvement of its principles. To an ardent wiſh for its perpetual duration, let us add the only means of ſecuring it. Let us endeavor to diffuſe, extenſively, the principles of uſeful knowlege, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, indelibly, on the minds of the riſing generation, the ſentiments of liberal virtue, and genuine patriotiſm.</p>
