            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And after the most laborious Enquiry into the State of the Primitive Church, it appears to have been the constant Practice, the <hi>first three hundred</hi> Years after <hi>Christ,</hi> that the Churches consisted of <hi>particular Congregations,</hi> each having their own <hi>Pastor,</hi> to minister unto them in the holy Things of God <note n="*" place="bottom">See, an Inquiry into the Consti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Surely, then, we may well eno' rest satisfied with this honourable Account of our Fathers, and firmly

            <p>But then, there are those who are to be ministred unto, or such as are under the Instruction, Watch, and Government, of them that are over them in the Lord, which includes the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Faithful;</hi> who, tho' they have an undoubted Right to choose their own Officers <note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 14 23.</note>, yet have no Part of the Power of Office belonging to them <note n="‡" place="bottom">

And these fall under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Consideration, namely, of such as approach unto all special Ordinances, and are in the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Brotherhood, to whom belong all the more peculiar Priviledges of a particular Church; and of such who, either by their Infant Baptism, as yet unrenounced, or by their personal Covenanting, (or publick Profession,) in their adult State, (tho' thro' groundless Fears, or Scruples, or, it may be, too great Negligence, they do not approach the Holy Table,) are truly Members of the Church, and have some of the Priviledges thereof appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them.</p>
            <p>So that as a competent Number of visible Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Christianity are requisite to the Constitution of a particular Church, thus the Officers are equally necessary to the compleating of that sacred Body, without whom, no Number of professing Christians can perform any Part of that Divine Worship which is peculiar unto a Church <note n="*" place="bottom">Whatever Acts can be comprised under those three Heads, of Preaching, Worship, and Government, were Parts of the Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that, neither the <hi>Officers,</hi> nor the <hi>Brethren,</hi> considered by themselves, are the Church, nor the Acts of either of them, seperate, Church Acts: And this, I think, is but agreable to the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Discourse of <hi>Schism</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii 21.</note>, where he says, <hi>The Eye cannot say unto the Hand, I have no need of you; nor again the Head unto the Feet, I have no need of you:</hi> and consequently, cannot the <hi>Hand</hi> say unto the <hi>Eye,</hi> or the <hi>Feet</hi> unto the <hi>Head,</hi> I have no need of you.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And now let us consider what it is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes a Church. And because the Materials of a Church, considered in every Light, are rational Agents, that are capacitated and have a Right, to act for themselves, in all that relates to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and the Salvation of their own Souls; therefore, I can conceive of no other constituting Principle, Bond of Union, and Cement, in the Church, but the free Consent of every particular Member of that sacred Body; which free Consent, manifested in the Truth and Sincerity of Faith in the Heart, renders a Person a Member of the real <hi>invisible</hi> Church, the true <hi>Body of Christ;</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in an outward visible Profession of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, renders him a Member of the <hi>Catholick visible</hi> Church, and agreeing with and to a particular
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004219_0013_0000000000000000"/>
Church, in their Faith and Worship, renders him a Member of that <hi>particular</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>So that the Cement, which holds the constit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent Parts of a particular Church in Union, cannot be the Sincerity of their Faith, which is unknown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men; nor a professed Faith, which gives no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto <hi>this</hi> more than unto <hi>that</hi> particular Church, tho' it is the Ground of Communion in all Churches; nor Cohabitation, because the nearest local Distance may be attended with the greatest mental one; much less does it lie in an Act of the civil Power combining of them together, because the Church subsists as truly under the most violent Persecution, as the greatest Patronage: but the Bond of Union, in a <hi>particular</hi> Church, can be no other than their mutual Consent, Agreement, Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, or Covenant, (call it what you please,) to worship the Lord together, according to the Light they shall receive from the divine Oracles; which, I think, the <hi>Apostle</hi> sufficiently intimates, when, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he says, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph,</hi> iv 16.</note> 
               <hi>The whole Body fitly framed together, and compacted, by that which every Joynt supplyeth, according to the effectual working in every Part, maketh increase of the Body, to the edifying of it self in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Consent, Agreement, or Covenant, is either plainly expressed, or necessarily implyed in their mutual constant assembling themselves together for divine Worship.</p>
            <p>And, from hence it appears, That no Person, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civil, or ecclesiastical, has any Right to impose either Officers, or Members, upon this, or that, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, or to divest them of any of them, without their own Consent; or has Right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul them, in any of their Actions, proper to them as a Church; but they must be left to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004219_0014_0000000000000000"/>
and direct all their Actions, as a Church, according to the best of their understanding of the Mind of their Master, their safest Rule, and to whom they must finally be accountable: tho' yet other Churches may be assisting in handing Light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, from the sacred Scriptures, when their own Way is dark, and perplexed.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the <hi>first</hi> Thing I proposed to speak to, namely the <hi>Church,</hi> and have consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it both in the General, and in Particular, as a Gospel Instituted Church, and viewed it in it's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it's constituent Parts, and the Cement of it. I proceed therefore to offer something upon the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Thing; <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Head</hi> of the Church. And here it may be enquired,</p>

               <item>1. Who is it that is called the Head of the Church?</item>

            <p n="1">I. The first Thing here is to enquire, who is it that is styled the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church? Whom does the <hi>Apostle</hi> mean by this Character?</p>

               </abbr> Who is this JESUS CHRIST? And, I think, we may come at a sufficient Knowledge of who, and what, He is, by considering the several Characters, and Description, given of Him in my Context. And here I shall briefly touch upon the Characters of Him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Apostle</hi> styles Him, <hi>GOD's dear Son</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ver</hi> 13.</note>. For in these Words, the Antecedent to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>He,</hi> in my <hi>Text,</hi> is found. <hi>Who,</hi> (that is the <hi>Father,</hi> before spoken of,) <hi>hath delivered us,</hi> (says the <hi>Apostle,) from the Powers of Darkness, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated us into the Kingdom of His,</hi> (that is the Father's) <hi>dear Son. His dear Son,</hi> (he goes on) in whom we have <hi>Redemption;—who is the Image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible God, the first born of every Creature;—and HE is the Head of the Body, the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then, is one Character of Him who is the Head of the Church, That He is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> yea, <hi>His dear Son,</hi> or, the <hi>Son of his Love</hi>

of his Father, tho' we are not able to conceive any thing about the Manner of the divine Generation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An other Character of Him is, That <hi>He is the Image of the invisible GOD</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Language originally, and in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> Days, was written without <hi>Accents:</hi> And how easy was it for those that first accented the sacred Text, or after Transcribers, to mistake in placing the <hi>Accent,</hi> which might lead our Translators into their <hi>Version.</hi> And it seems to me very evident, that there is a Mistake in placing the <hi>Accent,</hi> in our Greek Copies, upon the Word before us. For if we diligently attend to the Scope, and Design, of the Context, (which is the fairest way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any particular Word, that may seem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in any Writer,) We may easily see, that the <hi>Idea</hi> annexed unto this Word is that of an Author, an <hi>efficient Cause,</hi> or that from which a Thing ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginates, as it's <hi>first Cause;</hi> and thus the following <hi>Verse</hi> runs smooth and natural, which it scarcely does, according to our Translation. For the next Words are introduced as a Reason, and Evidence, of this Character of our Lord; <hi>He is the first Cause of every Creature: for by Him were all Things created, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, visible, and

and this Church, as His peculiar People, necessarily comes under His <hi>special Government,</hi> that He may seek them out, and bring them Home unto God, and Happiness; that He may lead them in the Path of Life, effectually defend them from the malicious Designs of their ghostly Adversaries, and finally conduct them as Sons to Glory; and thus a special <hi>Mediatorial Kingdom</hi> is formed, in which His Church becomes, in a peculiar Manner, subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His Laws, and receives the Blessing from Him.</p>
            <p>And in as much as this Mediatorial Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the <hi>visible Manifestation</hi> thereof in the World, both for the Improvement of those Methods which <hi>Christ,</hi> in his Wisdom, fixes upon, to recover Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto Himself from the Dominion of the Prince of Darkness, and for the conveying the many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and Priviledges, which he designs as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent delightful Entertainment of His Subjects, and necessary to the Christian Life, as also to strengthen the obedient Subject in the Hopes of the future Happiness, and train him up into a Meetness for it; therefore a <hi>visible Church</hi> is necessary, and that in <hi>particular</hi> Assemblies, or Congregations, in which the Laws, and Ordinances, of <hi>Christ</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, His Benefits ascertained and conveyed, and all Things managed in such a Way &amp; Manner, as not to fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thus also we find Him the Head of the <hi>Gospel Church.</hi> He abolished the Ancient <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> the aronical Priesthood, the levitical Service, the whole Form, and Mode, of that Church, and all the Worship Peculiar to it <note n="(b)" place="bottom">

            <p>This appears from his original Commission to His <hi>Apostles,</hi> and, in them, to all succeeding Ministers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004219_0024_0000000000000000"/>
shew them, and all the Disciples of our Lord after them, that they must not themselves assume a Power over other Men, nor give to any Men the Power over them, to rule and govern them by any Laws of their own devising, in Matters of Conscience, and that relate to the spiritual Kingdom of CHRIST; but remember that CHRIST, and He only, is their Head, their Master, their Lord, whose Laws are to be their only Rule, and to whom they must be finally accountable.</p>
            <p>So that we have no need to look to any Power upon Earth, whether <hi>civil,</hi> or <hi>ecclesiastical,</hi> to give Law unto the Church, to appoint the Bounds, to mark out the Form, to constitute the Officers, to direct the Worship, or number the Ceremonies thereof; seeing CHRIST, and <hi>He</hi> only, is the supream Head of the Church. <hi>He is the Head of the Body, the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have offered a few Considerations upon the two Points I proposed to speak to, namely, the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church. And I shall now proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. In the last Place, to draw such Inferences from what has been said, as are suitable unto the present Occasion. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1 I think we may from hence very plainly and naturally infer, That to assume unto our selves, or subject our selves to, any governing Authority, in the Church, not established by CHRIST, is so far to throw off the Government of CHRIST, as Head of the Christian Church. For since CHRIST is the supream Head of the Church, whether we consider it more generally, or in particular, and has the sole Right to give Law to it, to appoint the Officers, Services, and Regimen thereof, it can be no less than an invading of his Right, and a throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his Government, for any to assume unto themselves the Power to impose Laws, without a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004219_0025_0000000000000000"/>
Subjection whereunto their Brethren shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred the Priviledges of the Christian Church; and it is no less than a practical disowning of the Headship of CHRIST, for any to submit to such lordly Impositions.</p>
            <p>This indeed is the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which began early to work in the Christian Church, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> who struck at all the Offices of CHRIST, by setting up of Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Opposition to the sacred Scriptures, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing innumerable Mediators as Competitors with CHRIST, and by constituting a visible Head, with Power to enact Laws for the Government of the Church; under the Tyranny whereof the Christian World laboured for many Ages, until a glorious Reformation, under the Character of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism,</hi> nobly recovered, the Rights of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic,</hi> and <hi>Priestly,</hi> Office of CHRIST, from the Usurpations of <hi>Rome,</hi> and strove hard to rescue His <hi>Kingly</hi> Office, out of the Hands of His Enemies, that CHRIST might be LORD ALONE in His Church.</p>
            <p>But, tho' the Sweets of a lordly Power rendred it difficult for many to part with that Authority they had in the Church, and so prevented that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reformation which was desired, yet, there were many, among whom we may well reckon our venerable Fathers, who carried on that glorious Work so much further, as to assert the <hi>Kingly</hi> Office of CHRIST in his Church, and, (what is the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof,) that every particular Church, with their own Pastors, and Officers, has full Power in themselves, according to the Laws of CHRIST, for all Church Acts, for their Preservation, Purity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Peace and Unity, and are not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto any earthly Power; but yet owe that Love, Fellowship, and Communion to, and with,

            <p>And now, my <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> suffer me to say, That it highly concerns Us to be true to the Rights of CHRIST, and the Christian Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Him, their and our Head, according to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles of our pious Predecessors, collected from the sacred Scriptures, and the Archives of the primitive Church, and handed down unto us their Posterity, as their valuable Legacy.</p>

For, tho' I cannot sufficiently admire the Learning, Wisdom, and Temper, manifested in that Composure, which, the further we search into the primitive Church, will be found the more agreable to it's Constitution, and which was calculated to comprehend in it, all that acknowledged the Rights of particular Churches, and of CHRIST their Head, tho' they differed in their Opinions, and Practices, in lesser Matters; yet, it is abhorrent to me, as it was unto our Fathers, to set it up as a <hi>Rule,</hi> from which, neither They, nor We, may ever in the least vary. No; they only recommended it to the Churches, and left all to judge for themselves: and this I look upon as the true <hi>Glory</hi> of our renowned <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty</hi> wherein CHRIST hath made us free; <hi>Us,</hi> even <hi>all his Churches,</hi> if we knew but how to use our Liberty.</p>
            <p>Hence, as a particular <hi>Pastor's</hi> taking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the sole Government of his Church, without the Consent of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> would be a lording it over <hi>God's Heritage;</hi> so for <hi>other Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> to assume an Authority over any <hi>particular Pastor,</hi>

<pb facs="unknown:004219_0029_0000000000000000"/>
if ever such Principles, and Practices, should obtain among us, I must have leave to lament over our Churches, with an <hi>Heu Prisca Fides!</hi> and to write upon them <hi>Icabod,</hi> the Glory of <hi>New-England</hi> is departed. For whatever Cry any may make of the <hi>Platform,</hi> and <hi>Congregational Principles,</hi> it is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that, by such Means, the very Essence of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational</hi> Churches will be utterly overthrown.</p>
            <p>Having observed these Things, suffer me now to address my self unto the <hi>Candidates</hi> for the <hi>Ministry,</hi> who are to supply our Places, when we are fallen asleep,—That you, the Sons of the Prophets, our Hope and our Joy, would be careful to walk by the same Rule; and while you take Heed unto your selves, to have your own Hearts strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with the firm Belief of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and your Lives under the Influence thereof, you would also be studious of the Truths of the Day, that you may see more and more of the Excellency of CHRIST's Kingdom, and may stedfastly resolve to be true to <hi>Him,</hi> and the Interest of <hi>His Churches,</hi> neither subjecting your selves unto human Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor attempting to lord it over others.</p>
            <p>And that I may be assisting to you, in your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Serviceableness, allow me to mention a few brief Rules, which I think are worthy of your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remember, That the great GOD, in reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Mind unto the World, designed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. As He has been pleased to condescend to accommodate Himself unto our Capacity, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of heavenly Things in humane Language, so He wisely makes use of that Language as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understood among Men, and does not mean to fix any Ideas, or Conceptions, unto Words, but what are well known, in the common Use of them. This Rule, in your studying of the Scriptures, and comparing one Part with an other, will secure you from making the sacred Writings an <hi>uncertain Sound,</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:004219_0030_0000000000000000"/>
and lead you into the true Doctrine of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Study the sacred Scriptures with a steady View to the <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and the <hi>Grace,</hi> of God. These seem to be the two Master Characters, by which GOD would have Himself to be known among the Children of Men; His <hi>Sovereignty</hi> more especially displayed, in the infant State of His Church, under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> Dispensation, tho' not without clear Discoveries of His Grace; His <hi>Grace</hi> more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustriously shining forth, in the adult-state of the Church, under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> yet not without challenging the Rights of His Sovereignty. That is to say, That he is LORD alone, and his Will, which is the Will of an all-perfect Being, is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reason for what he requires of us, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for us; and that all that he does for us, and has promised to us, are Acts of free Grace and Favour. This will sufficiently establish you in the <hi>Quinquarticular</hi> Controversy, without Fear of your giving to <hi>Man</hi> what is due to GOD alone, or of reproaching the Divine Being as capricious, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moursome, and tyrannical.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ever subject Philosophy to Divinity. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy is but the Result of <hi>human Understanding,</hi> and Reasoning; Divinity, I mean what turns upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, flows directly from the <hi>Divine Mind:</hi> and therefore, tho' Philosophy be a fine Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a great Improvement of our rational Powers, yet look upon it, as it is, (and Honour eno' for it,) but as an <hi>Hand-maid</hi> unto Divinity: and never suffer the Hand-maid to usurp Authority over the Mistress, our safer Guide. This will keep you from corrupting the Truths of the Gospel with vain Philosophy, after the Traditions of Men, or repudiating Divinity, and denying the Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is <hi>inexplicable</hi> by the Rules of Philosophy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do not endeavour to be wise above what is written. Probably, the affectation of this Wisdom
<pb facs="unknown:004219_0031_0000000000000000"/>
has given Rise to most of the Errors, that have sprang up in the Christian Church. Remember, therefore, what God has not seen cause to <hi>reveal,</hi> in Divinity, He never intended we should <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;</hi> and all our Attempts to search the inscruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will but so much the more bewilder us. We can never be sure that we are right in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of what is unrevealed, after our most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Enquiry; but we may be sure that we are so far Wrong, as we pretend unto any Certainly about Things that are inexplicable by us. Be content, therefore, with what is revealed; this <hi>belongs to us; but secret Things belong upon the Lord our GOD.</hi> This will subdue the Itch of Novelty, which will but prove the Church's Scab.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Be sure to preach CHRIST. I do not mean to be often repeating His Name, tho' yet we are not ashamed of it; but, preach the Doctrines of CHRIST, of his Person, Natures, Offices, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, as well as the moral Duties which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: and endeavour to shew, how all Grace and Favour, all Virtue and Strength, flows from Him, the Head of all Influences, unto His several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and that the Glory of all, as to Merit, and Efficacy, in the great Work of Redemption, is to be returned unto Him. Suffer not the true Beauty, Excellency, and Spirit of Christianity, to give Way to the saint Glitter, and feeble Harrangues of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Writers, which it may be has been too much the Error of some late celebrated Preachers; but study to know, and preach, nothing so much as JESUS CHRIST, and Him crucifyed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Remember, you will have to do with the Souls of Men. And therefore, as they are worth all your Care, and demand your most tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and closest Application, so they are not to be forced by any external Methods of Coertion; but the only Compulsion, that will have any good Effect upon them, is that of bringing <hi>Light</hi> to the
<pb facs="unknown:004219_0032_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Warmth</hi> to the <hi>Heart;</hi> that by the Force of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> suitably applied, they may be strongly moved to their Duty, and Interest. This will preserve you from a lordly usurping Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and make you to look upon your selves, not, <hi>as having Dominion over the Faith, but, as Helpers of the Joy, of your Brethren.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="2">II. Hence we see that it must needs be our Duty to do all that we can for the Honour of CHRIST, and the Interest of His Church in the World. Think now, who is this glorious Head of the Church, and what His beautiful Church is, the many Priviledges we enjoy, and the divine Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations we are refreshed withal, in it; and surely upon the View hereof, we cannot suppose it too much for us, to lay our selves out in suitable Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therefor. This should quicken us to honour our glorious Head, by strenuously espousing His Cause, appearing on the Side of Vertue, against all its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers; by endeavouring to exemplify the Life of CHRIST, in the Holiness and Meekness of our own, and by manifesting a sincere Love and hearty Zeal to our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>This should fill us with a great Concern for the Welfare, and Flourishing, of the <hi>particular</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to which we severally stand related, and that both as Ministers, and Christians. <hi>As Ministers,</hi> in our painful Labours in the Work of the Gospel, our affectionate Addresses to the Consciences of Men, our assiduous Watchfulness over them, our meek instructing of them, our compassionate counselling of them, our impartial ministring unto them, and our servant Prayers to GOD for them: as <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in our hearty Subjection unto the Gospel of CHRIST, and Submission, and Honour, to those that watch for our Souls, our encouraging one an

            <p>This should quicken us unto all proper Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to the Church of CHRIST in <hi>General,</hi> by our asserting and defending the general Cause of Christianity, by holding the Unity of the Faith, and maintaining the Bond of Charity, in our brotherly Affection for all the sincere Worshippers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of CHRIST; that however we may differ from them, in some of the Externals, and Modalitys, of Religion, yet there may be no Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in our Hearts from them, but we may be of one Heart and of one Mind with them, as that, if possible, there may be no Schism in the Body of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>And, to come to the more special Work now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, This should make us willing, and ready, to expend of our worldly Substance for the sending, and supporting, of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST, and the Ordinances, and Priviledges of his Church, in the unevangeliz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
