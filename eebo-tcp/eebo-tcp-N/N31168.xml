            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Return of this blooming Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year puts me in Mind of my Duty towards my young Friends in this Congregation; thoſe growing Shoots, thoſe bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flowers of human Nature.— To you therefore, my dear Youth, I would now addreſs myſelf: And would do it with all the Tenderneſs of a fatherly Heart.</p>
            <p>AMONG you, I hope, I ſhall not meet with Diſcouragement, of the ſamd king, which I often meet with in my Addreſſes to others. Among you, I hope, I ſhall not find any Veterans in Sin, confirmed and hardened in Wickedneſs by a long Practice; though, alas! we ſometimes meet with the ſhocking Curioſity of one young in Years, but old in Sin. Among you, I hope
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:041259_0003_101A6817E7337A08"/>to find that Tenderneſs of Heart, and thoſe ſoft impreſſible Paſſions, which are ſo peculiar to your Age, and which may render you more ſuſceptive of religious Impreſſions, than thoſe whoſe Hearts are at once hardened by Age. and by a long Habit of Sinning; theſe Circumſtances afford me Encouragement. But alas! even among you, ſoft and pliable as you are, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect great Diſcouragements, tho' of another Kind. You are gay, merry and thoughtleſs; and cannot bear to fix your Thoughts upon ſuch diſagreeable Subjects; and flatter yourſelves it is time enough for you to ſubmit to the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of attending to them, as you advance farther in Life. Your Paſſions and Appetites are ſtrong and unruly: Your Hopes warm and ſanguine. And therefore I am afraid ſundry of you will hardly allow me a ſerious Hearing, tho' our for an Hour. However, whether you hear, or whether you forbear, I muſt endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my Meſſage to you, in the Name of God.</p>
            <p>IT is a very encouraging Thought, that the bleſſed Jeſus has a very tender Regard for ſuch young Creatures. This he ſhewed in his warm Reſentment againſt thoſe that would have kept them from his Arms, while he dwelt among Men.</p>
            <p>SOME of his Friends brought their young Children to him, that he might touch them, or lay his Hands upon them, as a Sign of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, after the Manner of the Patriarchs and Prophets, in their ſolemn Benedictions. But his Diſciples, thinking it beneath the Dignity
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:041259_0004_101A681A96969F90"/>of ſo great and divine a Prophet, to be troubled and teazed with little Children; and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that ſuch thoughtleſs Creatures could receive no Advantage from him, rebuked their Parents, and would have ſent them away. This muſt be a very affecting Diſcouragement to Parents to find themſelves forbid to come to Chriſt, and that by his Diſciples, who ought to have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, and encouraged their Application. <hi>But when Jeſus ſaw</hi> the dear little Creatures ſent away from him, <hi>he was greatly diſpleaſed.</hi> If good Men thro' Miſtake, and bad Men thro' obſtinate Wickedneſs diſcourage theſe young Immortals in coming to Chriſt, he himſelf is willing they ſhould come, and warmly reſents it, when any Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance is thrown in their Way. This gracious Shepherd takes ſpecial Care of the Weak and Young in his Flock; he <q>gathers the Lambs in his Arms, and carries them in his Boſom.</q> Hence he tells his Diſciples and all around him, <q>Suffer the little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</q> They are all welcome to my Arms: And the little Sinners ſtand in need of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>WHEN he ſays, <q>
                  <hi>Suffer</hi> them to come, and <hi>forbid them not,</hi>
               </q> he does not mean, meerly, that they ſhould not <hi>hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der</hi> or diſcourage them; but he means, that they ſhould <hi>poſitively aſſiſt</hi> and encourage them to come to him; and that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhould be ſo far from hindering them, that they ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:041259_0005_101A681D0E876028"/>Miniſters of the Goſpel. And I feel its Obligation binding me in particular to this agreeable Duty. Indeed the lovely Forms, the Blooms of Reaſon, and the engaging little Actions of thoſe amiable Creatures, whom I now addreſs, might win the Affection even of a ſtranger, and excite him to perform every kind Office in his Bower for them.</p>
            <p>OUR Saviour adds a Reaſon why he would have little Children ſuffered to come to him, which is, <q>For of ſuch is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q> This may be underſtood in two Senſes. It may either ſignify the Goſpel Church, which is often called <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and even the heavenly Church conſiſts of ſuch little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as theſe: Such little Creatures are admitted as Members into this divine Society, and are entitled to its Privileges. And therefore, <q>Chriſtian Parents ought to bring them to me; and it is their Duty to come as ſoon as they are capable of acting. Therefore forbid them not, but encourage them.</q> Or it may ſignify the Church of God, both in its earthly and heavenly State, conſiſts of <hi>ſuch Perſons;</hi> that is, of Perſons, who reſemble little Children in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; who, like them are humble, meek, pliable, forgiving, eaſily appeaſed, teachable. I rather chuſe this Senſe, becauſe the Connection ſeems to lead to it; for the very next Words are, <q>Verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, he ſhall not enter therein.</q> This is alſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what he ſays elſewhere, when he makes a little Child an Emblem of the Chriſtian
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041259_0006_101A681E9B69FD78"/>Temper. (<hi>Matt.</hi> xviii, 2, 3, 4.) <q>Jeſus called a little Child unto him, and ſet him in the midſt of them, and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, except ye be converted, and become as <hi>little Children,</hi> ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoſoever therefore ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf as this <hi>little Child,</hi> the ſame is greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</q> In this View the Argument is concluſive: For if Children have ſome Diſpoſitions, in which even Men muſt reſemble and imitate them, before they can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; then certainly Children are capable of being brought to Jeſus, and it is their Duty to come to him.</p>
            <p>You ſee, my dear Children and Youth, that you have a Right, and that it is your Duty, to come to Jeſus. Therefore, oh! come to him: Come to him this very Day, without Delay.</p>
            <p>BUT here, I hope, you ſtart a very proper Queſtion, <q>What is it to come to Chriſt? or, in what Senſe are we to underſtand this Phraſe, as it may be applied to us now, ſince he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from our World?</q>
            </p>
            <p>COMING to Chriſt, in my Text, did indeed mean a bodily Motion to him: And this was practicable, while he tabernacled in Fleſh among Men. But even then, it ſignified much <hi>more.</hi> It ſignified coming to him as a divine Teacher, to receive Inſtruction; as a Saviour, to obtain eternal Life; and as the only Mediator. through whom guilty Sinners might have Acceſs to God. It ſignified a Motion of Soul towards him, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the bodily Motion of coming: A
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:041259_0007_101A68205C71B148"/>Motion of the Deſires, a Flight of tender Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards him. In this View it is ſtill prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable to come to Christ; and it is our Duty in theſe latter Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, as much as it was theirs who were his Contemporaries upon Earth. It is in this View I now urge it upon you: And in this View it includes the following Particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A clear Conviction of Sin; of Sin in Heart, in Word, and in Practice; of Sin againſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; againſt alluring Mercies and fatherly Corrections; of Sin againſt all the ſtrongeſt Ties to Duty. Without ſuch a Conviction of Sin, it is impoſſible you ſhould fly to him as a Saviour: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <q>came not to call the Righteous, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Repentance.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. AN affecting Senſe of Danger, upon the Account of Sin. You cannot fly to him as a Saviour, till you ſee your extreme Need of Salvation; and you cannot ſo your Need of Salvation. till you are ſenſible or your Danger; ſenſible that you are every Moment liable to everlaſting Condemnation, and have no Title at all to the divine Favour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AN humbling Senſe of your own Inability to ſave yourſelves by the Merit of your own beſt Endeavours. I do not mean, that you ſhould neglect your beſt Endeavours; or that you ſhould not exert your utmoſt Strength in every good Work, and in the earneſt Uſe of all the Means of Grace: For you never will come to Chriſt, till you are brought to this. But I mean that while you are doing your utmoſt, you muſt be ſenſible, that you do not deſerve any Favour at
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:041259_0008_101A6823AB6A0F38"/>all from God on that Account, and that you neither can nor do make any Atonement for your Sins by all your good Works; but that God may juſtly condemn you notwithſtanding. Till you are ſenſible of this, you will weary yourſelves in vain, in idle ſelf-righteous Efforts to perform the Work which Jeſus came into the World to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and which he alone was able to do; I mean, to make Atonement for your Sin, and to work out a Righteouſneſs to recommend you to God. It is an eternal Truth, that you will never come to Chriſt as a Saviour, till you are deeply ſenſible there is no Salvation in any other; and particularly that you are not able to ſave yourſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. AN affecting Conviction, that Jeſus Chriſt is a glorious, all ſufficient, and willing Saviour: that his Righteouſneſs is perfect. equal to all the Demands of the divine Law, and ſufficient to make Satisfaction for all our Sins, and procure for us all the Bleſſings of the divine Favour; that he is able and willing to <q>
                  <hi>ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all thut come unto God by him,</hi>
               </q> and that he is freely offered in the Goſpel to all that will accept him, however unworthy, and however great their Sins. Indeed it is an eternal Truth, that though Multitudes periſh, it is not for want of a Saviour. There is a Saviour all ſufficient, and perfectly willing; and this you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of before you can come to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. AN entire Dependance upon his Merits alone for Acceptance with God. Senſible that you have no Merit of your own, on which to

You will as it were hang about him, as the only Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for your ſinking Soul, and plead his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the only Ground of your Acceptance with God. This is ſo unnatural to a proud ſelf-confident Sinner, that you muſt be brought very low indeed, throughly mortified and ſelf-emptied, before you will ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A chearful Subjection to Him as your Ruler; and a voluntary Surrender of yourſelves to his Service. If you come to Him at all, it will be as poor penitent Rebels, returning to Duty, with Shame and Sorrow, and fully determined never to depart from it more. To embrace Chriſt as a Saviour, and yet not ſubmit to Him as our Ruler; to truſt in his Righteouſneſs, and in the mean time diſobey his Authority; this is the greateſt Abſurdity, and utterly inconſiſtent with the wiſe Conſtitution of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>AND now, my dear young Friends, I hope even your tender Minds have ſome Ideas what it is to come to Chriſt. And therefore, when I exhort you to it, you know what I mean.

You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know, my dear young Creatures, that this is your Caſe; and therefore, believe it, you are Sinners, great Sinners.

            <p>BUT as this Part of my Text may he applied with peculiar Propriety to Parents, I muſt make
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:041259_0015_101A6838CD60E570"/>a ſhort digreſſive addreſs to them.—Fathers and Mothers! "O ſuffer your little Children to come to Jeſus, and "forbid them not."—Forbid them not, by your own Examples. Let them not ſee you neglect Jeſus Chriſt yourſelves, and going on is Sin: For this will be the greateſt Hindrance you can caſt in their Way. Forbid them not, by diſcouraging the Appearances of Thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſerious Impreſſions on their tender Minds.—Forbid them not, by flattering them with falſe Hopes, and healing their Wound ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpeaking Peace to them without good Reaſon; but endeavour to make them ſenſible of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Danger, and their extreme Need of a Saviour; of the Difficulty of Converſion, and a Courſe of ſtrict Religion: in ſhort, let them know the Truth of their Caſe.</p>
            <p>I told you before, that this Prohibition "forbid them not," implies an Injunction poſitively to encourage and aſſiſt them in coming to Chriſt. Therefore, Parents, do all you can by Inſtruction, by Example, by Prayer to God, and by every Means in your Power, to bring your dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Chriſt. Remember He hath laid his Commands upon you; and dare you diſobey, eſpecially, when the ſame Duty is inforced upon you by the ſtrongeſt Ties of Nature?</p>
            <p>BUT I return to you. my young Friends, to whoſe Service I have devoted this Hour. And my laſt Motive to you derived from the Text is,</p>
            <p n="3">3. "Of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven." This, I told you, may be taken in two Senſes; and in both it may be a ſtrong Inducement to you to come to Chriſt.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:041259_0016_101A682D44ADE040"/>
IF the Meaning be, that the Church of God conſiſts of Perſons, who in Temper and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſemble little Children, then it is natural to reflect how much you are obliged to come to Chriſt, that the amiable Qualities you have, may be finiſhed and compleat. You already have many lovely Diſpoſitions, and even a Stranger might ſee many Things in you that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his Heart. Even a Saint muſt reſemble you in ſome Things, and be as a little Child, as a Preparative for Heaven. But alas! you want one Thing; and that is, inward Holineſs. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, all your amiable Qualities are utterly deficient, and leave you guilty, vile, loathſome Creatures, in the Sight of God. Without this, you are really but gilded Maſſes of Corruption and Deformity. But ſhould you come to Jeſus, He would put his Comelineſs upon yon. He would make you all-glorious within: He would compleat your Character, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ender you all-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>throughout.</hi> But alas! if you come not to him, the agreeable Qualities you have, will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually decay, and you will degenerate into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right unmingled Wickedneſs. When you ſink into the infernal Regions, you will contract the very Genius and Temper of a Devil; all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Virtue, and whatever of the Image of God you may have retained ſince the Fall, will drop from you. Thus "from him that bath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath."</p>
            <p>BUT if we conſider this Reaſon, <q>for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</q> as ſignifying, that the Goſpel Church upon Earth, and even the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Church, conſiſts of little Children as well as
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:041259_0017_101A683C27905F48"/>Adults, then what a great Inducement may this be to you to labour to be of their happy Number? Why ſhould not you enter into the Kingdom of Heaven as well as others? There's young Abijah, in whom was found ſome good Thing towards the Lord God of Iſrael, even the wicked Family of Jeroboam. There are Jeremiah and John the Baptiſt, who were ſanctified from the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> Holy Scriptures. There are Thouſands of little Creatures, who juſt ſtayed long enough upon Earth, to know themſelves, and their God and Saviour, and have their deprav'd Nature chang'd, and then wing'd their willing Flight to Heaven. It is not to my preſent Purpoſe to enquire into the future State of thoſe that die in Infancy before they are capable of Reaſon. But as to the many who die in their earlier Days, when Reaſon has begun to dawn, they are conſidered as moral Agents, and rewarded according to their Works: And we have good Reaſon to hope, that ſundry of them in their ſhort Space of Life, are effectually prepar'd for a happy Eternity.

            <p>MR. <hi>Treat,</hi> and Mr. <hi>G. Tennant</hi> tell me in theirs, that the Concern appeared rational, ſolid, and ſcriptural, and that in a remarkable Degree. I was informed by ſome of the Students, who had been my Pupils, that this religious Concern firſt began with the Son of a very conſiderable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>New-York.</hi> The Youth was dangerouſly ſick in College, and on that Occaſion awakened to a Senſe of his Guilt: His Diſcourſe made ſome Impreſſion on a few others; and theirs again on others; and ſo it became almoſt general, before the good Preſident, or any others knew any thing of it. As ſoon as it became public, Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were ſpread abroad, and ſome Gentlemen ſent to bring their Sons Home: but upon better Information, the moſt were ſent back again— The wicked Companions of ſome young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men left no Methods untried to recover them to their former Exceſs of Riot; and with two or three they have been lamentably ſucceſsful.</p>

               <q>SAY now, my dear Brother, are not theſe glorious Things? Are they not beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation? Can you believe for Joy? It is true that the Lord hath thus appeared? or is it only a pleaſing Dream? It is true! it is a Reality!</q>

            <p>THIS is the joyful News, my Brethren, which I had to communicate to you; and I hope I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it in Seaſon, as a proper Supplement to this Diſcourſe. Shall this excite you to Emulation? You ſee Religion is not the Concern of the Old, or the Ignorant, or Poor only.

            <p>BUT Oh! how vain are all my Endeavours, while God withholds the Influences of his Spirit? The Students in the College of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> had heard many maſterly, ſolemn, and pungent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes from their worthy Preſident, and many that preached occaſionally to them: but all this

            <p>THE agreeable Piece of Hiſtory I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to you opens to us a very encouraging Proſpect with regard to Poſterity, and the Churches in general. From the College of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> you and many other Congregations expect Supplies, when I and my Brethren, who are now acting our Part upon the Stage of Life, have made our Exit, and are ſilent and forgotten in the Duſt.
