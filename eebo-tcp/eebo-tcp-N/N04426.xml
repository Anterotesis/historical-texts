            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GOD erected this viſible world as a monument of his Glory,— a theatre for the diſplay of his adorable perfections.—The Heavens proclaim his wiſdom and power in ſhining characters, and the whole Earth is full of his goodneſs. Man was in his original creation excellently fitted for the ſervice of GOD, and for perfect happineſs in the enjoyment of the divine favour.</p>
            <p>BUT Sin has diſturbed the order of nature, defaced the beauty of the creation, and involved Man, the Lord of this lower world, in the moſt diſconſolate circumſtances of guilt and miſery.</p>
            <p>THE all-ſeeing eye of GOD beheld our deplorable ſtate; infinite pity touched the heart of the Father of mercies; and infinite wiſdom laid the plan of our recovery. The Majeſty of heaven did not ſee meet to ſuffer the Enemy of mankind, eternally to triumph in his ſucceſs; nor leave his favourite workmanſhip, irrecoverably to periſh in the ruins of the Apoſtacy. By a method, which at once aſtoniſhes and delights the ſublimeſt ſpirits above, he opened a way
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005471_0008_101838B019E9A2F0"/>
for the diſplay of his mercy, without any violation of the ſacred claims of his juſtice; in which, the honour of the Law is vindicated, and the guilty Offender acquitted; Sin is condemned, and the Sinner eternally ſaved. To accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this bleſſed deſign, the beloved SON OF GOD aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the nature of man,— in our nature died a ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſacrifice for ſin,— by the atoning virtue of his blood he <hi>made reconciliation for iniquity,</hi> — and by his perfect obedience to the law of GOD, <hi>brought in everlaſting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING finiſhed his work upon Earth, before he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his heavenly Father, he commiſſioned the miniſters of his kingdom, to <hi>preach the goſpel to every creature.</hi> He ſent them forth to make the moſt extenſive offers of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to rebellious ſinners, and by all the methods of holy violence to <hi>compel them to come in,</hi> and accept the invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his grace. — We have a lively repreſentation of this in the <hi>Parable,</hi> in which our text is contained.</p>
            <p>THE evident deſign of which is, under the figure of a <hi>Marriage-Supper,</hi> to ſet forth the plentiful proviſion, which is made in our LORD JESUS CHRIST for the reception of his People, and the freedom and riches of divine grace, which invites the moſt unworthy and miſerable Sinners, to partake of this ſacred Entertainment. The firſt invited Gueſts were the <hi>Jews,</hi> the favourite people of GOD, who were heirs of divine love, while the reſt of the world were <hi>Aliens from the commonwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe</hi>: But theſe through the power of prevailing prejudice, and the influence of carnal affections, obſtinately rejected the invitation, and were therefore fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally excluded from theſe invaluable bleſſings.</p>
            <p>BUT it was not the deſign of infinite wiſdom, that theſe coſtly preparations ſhould be loſt, and the table he had ſpread, remain unfurniſhed with Gueſts. Therefore he ſent forth his Servant <hi>into the ſtreets and lanes of the city,</hi> and commanded him to bring in <hi>the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind,</hi>—i, e. the moſt neceſſitous and miſerable of mankind;—yea, to <hi>go out into the high-ways and hedges,</hi> to the wretched and periſhing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not only invite,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005471_0009_101838B1A32BC4D8"/>
but even <hi>compel them to come in, that his houſe might be filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of the Text repreſent to us,</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE <hi>melancholy ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Gentile</hi> world. They are deſcribed as <hi>in the high-ways and hedges,</hi> in the moſt periſhing and helpleſs condition.</p>

Says the Apoſtle to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, (Rom. 1.20.) <hi>The inviſible Things of GOD, from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi> And yet many, even among the Philoſophers of the <hi>Gentile</hi> nations, impiouſly denied the eternal Deity, from whoſe hands they received their exiſtence; and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed his infinite perfections, when ſurrounded with the cleareſt demonſtrations of his power and goodneſs.—Thoſe who acknowledged a Deity, entertained the moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conceptions of his nature and attributes, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Creature,</hi> in the place of <hi>the Creator, who is GOD bleſſed for ever.</hi> — Not only the illuſtrious heroes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and the public Benefactors of Mankind, but even the moſt deſpicable beings in the order of nature, were enrolled in the catalogue of their gods, and became the object of their impious adoration. <hi>They changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible man, to birds and four-footed beaſts, and creeping things,</hi> Rom. 1.23.</p>
               <p>A FEW of the ſublimeſt genius'<hi>s</hi> of ROME and ATHENS, had ſome faint diſcoveries of the ſpiritual nature of the human <hi>Soul,</hi> and formed ſome probable conjectures, that man was deſigned for a future ſtate of exiſtence. When they conſidered the extenſive Capacities of the humane mind, and the deep impreſſions of futurity, engraven in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Breaſt; they could not but infer, that the Soul was immortal, and at death would be tranſlated to ſome new and unknown ſtate. When they ſaw the Virtuous oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with various and ſucceſſive Calamities; and the vileſt of men triumphing in proſperity and pleaſure; they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained diſtant hopes, that in a future revolution, theſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inequalities would be rectified, theſe inconſiſtencies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,—the Righteous diſtinguiſhingly rewarded, and the Wicked remarkably puniſhed.—But after all their inquiries
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005471_0011_101838B95A1FA710"/>
upon this important ſubject, they attained no higher, than ſome probable conjectures, ſome uncertain expectations. — And when they came to deſcribe the nature and ſituation of theſe inviſible regions of happineſs or miſery, they made the wildeſt gueſſes, and run into the moſt abſurd and vain imaginations. The <hi>Heaven</hi> they contrived for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the virtuous, was made up of ſenſual pleaſures, beneath the dignity of human nature, and inconſiſtent with perfect felicity: The <hi>Hell</hi> they deſcribed for the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of the vitious, conſiſted in ridiculous terrors, unworthy the belief of a rational and religious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>THEIR <hi>practices</hi> were equally corrupt with their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. As the moſt extravagant errors were received among the eſtabliſhed articles of their faith, ſo the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous vices obtained in their practice, and were indulged not only with impunity, but authoriſed by the ſanction of their laws. They ſtupidly erected altars to idols of wood and ſtone; paid divine honours to thoſe, who in their lives had been the greateſt monſters of luſt and cruelty; yea, offered up their Sons and Daughters as ſacrifices to Devils. The principles of honour, the reſtraints of ſhame, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of their Philoſophers were all too weak, to keep their corruptions within any tolerable bounds. The wickedneſs of their hearts broke through every incloſure, and deluged the Earth with rapine and violence, blood and ſlaughter, and all manner of brutiſh and deteſtable impurities.—It is hardly poſſible to read the melancholy deſcription of the principles and manners of the heathen world, given us by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> without horror and ſurpriſe. To think, that man once the <hi>friend of GOD,</hi> and <hi>the Lord of this lower world,</hi> ſhould thus <hi>deny the GOD that made him,</hi> and bow down to <hi>dumb idols</hi>; ſhould thus by luſt and intemperance, degrade himſelf into the character of the <hi>Beaſt, which hath no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>; and by pride, malice, and revenge, transform himſelf into the very image of the <hi>Devil, who was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS was the ſtate of the <hi>gentile</hi> nations, when the light of the Goſpel appeared, to ſcatter the darkneſs that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread

the face of the Earth. And this has been the caſe, ſo far as has yet appeared, of all the nations ever ſince, upon whom the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS <hi>has not aroſe with healing in his wings.</hi> Every new-diſcovered Country opens a new ſcene of aſtoniſhing ignorance and barbarity; and gives us freſh evidence of the univerſal corruption of human nature.</p>

               <p>I PROCEED now to conſider the <hi>compaſſionate Care</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> of our Bleſſed REDEEMER towards mankind, in theſe their deplorable circumſtances. He <hi>ſends out his Servants,</hi> to invite them <hi>to come in,</hi> and accept the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of <hi>his houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD might have left his guilty creatures, to have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſuffered the diſmal effects of their apoſtacy, without the leaſt imputation of injuſtice, or violence of his infinite perfections. The fall was the conſequence of man's cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal choice, and attended with the higheſt aggravations. —The <hi>Angels that ſinned,</hi> were made examples of GOD's righteous ſeverity, and are reſerved <hi>in chains</hi> of guilt <hi>to the Judgment of the great day.</hi> Mercy, that tender, attribute of the divine nature, did not interpoſe in their behalf, to ſuſpend the execution of their ſentence, or avert GOD's threatned diſpleaſure: their puniſhment is, unalterably decreed, their Judgment is irreverſible; they are the awful monuments of revenging wrath, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>to blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi>— Now Juſtice might have ſhewn the ſame inflexible ſeverity to rebellious man, and have left the univerſal progeny of <hi>Adam,</hi> to periſh in their guilt and miſery. It was unmerited mercy, that diſtinguiſhed the human race, in providing a Saviour for us; and the moſt ſignal compaſſion that revealed the counſels of heaven for our recovery.</p>
               <p>BUT though Juſtice did not oblige the divine Being to provide for our relief, yet the Goodneſs of the indulgent Father of the univerſe inclined him to ſhew pity to his guilty Creatures, who fell from their innocence, through the ſubtilty and malice of ſeducing and apoſtate Spirits.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005471_0013_101838BFCF1294E0"/>
It was agreeable to the divine wiſdom, to diſappoint the devices of Satan, the enemy of GOD and Goodneſs, and recover the creatures he had made, from their ſubjection to the powers of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>HE therefore gave early diſcoveries of his deſigns of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to our firſt Parents, and immediately upon the apoſtacy opened a door of hope for their recovery. He revealed a SAVIOUR to the antient Patriarchs, under dark types, and by diſtant promiſes; made clearer declarations of his will, as the appointed time drew near, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the promiſes, and the manifeſtation of the Son of GOD in human fleſh.— <hi>And when the fulneſs of time was come, GOD ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS divine and illuſtrious Perſon left the boſom of his Father, that he might put on the Character of a ſervant; — deſcended from the glories of heaven, that he might dwell on this inferior earth;— was made under the law, that he might fulfill all righteouſneſs;— ſubmitted to the infirmities of human nature, to the ſorrows and ſufferings of an afflicted life, and to the agonies of a painful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death on a croſs, that he might deſtroy the power of ſin, aboliſh the empire of death, and purchaſe immortality and glory for periſhing Man.</p>
               <p>WHILE our LORD JESUS reſided in this lower world, he preached the glad tidings of ſalvation, and publiſhed the kingdom of GOD; confirming his doctrine by nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and undoubted miracles, and recommending his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the charms of a ſpotleſs life and converſation. He ſent forth his Apoſtles to purſue the ſame gracious deſign of goſpelliſing the people, and furniſhed them with ſufficient powers to proſelyte the nations to the faith. He alſo appointed a ſtanding miniſtry, to carry on a treaty of peace with rebellious <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p>THE Apoſtles, the primitive heralds of the everlaſting Goſpel, were ſent to make the firſt Tender of ſalvation to <hi>the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> ISRAEL; they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to begin at JERUSALEM, the centre of the Jewiſh Commonwealth: But when the Jews obſtinately perſiſted in their impenitence and unbelief, they were commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>to preach the goſpel to every Creature under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>— The ſinners of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were invited to <hi>come in,</hi> and accept of the offers of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>THE Prophets pointed out a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was to come, and proclaimed the joyful approach of a Redeemer, at the time appointed in the ſovereign counſels of heaven. The miniſters of the Goſpel now are ſent to declare, that the prophecies are accompliſhed, the promiſe fulfilled, juſtice ſatisfied, ſalvation purchaſed; and all that will <hi>come in,</hi> ſhall receive the bleſſings of the goſpel. They are not only freely to invite Sinners, of all orders and degrees, of all ages and nations; but to aſſure them, that <hi>all things are now ready,</hi> and to uſe the moſt powerful and perſuaſive methods, that they may engage them to comply with the heavenly Call.— Which brings me to the third thing propoſed.</p>

               <p>I AM next to ſhew, that it is the great duty of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the goſpel <hi>to compel ſinners to come in,</hi> and accept of the bleſſings of the Goſpel.— This is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in my text, that I ſhall not multiply argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confirm it. My only buſineſs ſhall be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the nature of this compulſion, or ſhew in what manner ſinners are to be <hi>compelled to come in</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.— And ſure I am, I muſt anſwer, negatively, not by the deceitful methods of fraud and diſguiſe, — nor the inhuman practices of perſecution and violence. This text indeed has often been alledged by the <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bigots</hi> of all ages, and apply'd to ſupport the cauſe of <hi>religious tyranny</hi>; to the infinite ſcandal of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian name, and the unſpeakable detriment of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an intereſt. — By this means the Enemies of our moſt holy faith have been ſtrengthen'd in their infidelity, the weak have been turned aſide from <hi>the truth, as it is in JESUS,</hi> and the peaceable kingdom of the Meſſiah tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a field of blood,—a ſcene of helliſh and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelties.

But ſurely every thing of this kind, every violent and driving meaſure, is in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the precepts and example of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and contrary to the very genius of his goſpel, — which proclaims, <note n="*" place="bottom">

It may transfigure men into accompliſh'd hypocrites; but will never convert them into real ſaints.</p>
               <p>THE Goſpel was originally propagated by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preaching of CHRIST and his Apoſtles, by the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing miracles which they wrought in confirmation of their doctrine, and the exemplary lives by which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned their profeſſion and character. Inſtead of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating their religion by the deſtructive methods of fire and ſword, they ſubmitted to the rage and cruelty of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant world with ſurpriſing patience, and ſacrificed their very lives in the cauſe of GOD, without any intemperate diſcoveries of anger and reſentment:— inſtead of calling for <hi>fire from heaven</hi> to deſtroy their oppoſers, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionated their ignorance, inſtructed them with <hi>meekneſs,</hi> counſel'd and exhorted them with <hi>all long-ſuffering and doctrine,</hi> and even ſpent their dying breath in praying for their conviction and converſion, that they might be ſaved in the day of the LORD JESUS.</p>
               <p>Now in imitation of theſe primitive Doctors of the chriſtian church, theſe wiſe and ſucceſsful preachers of the Goſpel, it is the duty of the miniſters of the <hi>preſent</hi> day, to uſe the ſame methods of compaſſion and friendly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. A diſintereſted zeal for the glory of God, a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt adherence to the truth, and unſhaken fidelity in our Maſter's cauſe, with univerſal benevolence to mankind, muſt conſtantly animate our public diſcourſes, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in our private converſation and behaviour. — We muſt diligently indeavour to convince the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, engage the affections, and direct the practice of our hearers.—Upon this head, it may not be amiſs to deſcend to a few particulars.</p>

THEY are to ſhew ſinners the mighty <hi>encouragement,</hi> that the goſpel gives them to <hi>accept</hi> of CHRIST, and <hi>Salvation</hi> through his merits and righteouſneſs.— As for ignorant <hi>preſumers,</hi> theſe hear the glad tidings of the goſpel with a fatal indifference; and ſay in their hearts, <hi>they ſhall have peace,</hi> though they go on in their evil way, ſtupidly <hi>neglecting ſo great ſalvation,</hi> and regardleſs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things. But <hi>awaken'd</hi> minds are rather apt to draw the darkeſt concluſions with reſpect to their caſe, and to judge themſelves excluded from the invitations of the goſpel.—Sometimes they imagine, that the <hi>number</hi> and <hi>aggravations</hi> of their <hi>ſins</hi> exceed the deſigns of pardoning mercy:— At other times, that they have ſo long reſiſted the heavenly call, that now the gate of heaven is irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably barred againſt them:— And Satan further ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, that it would be the height of <hi>preſumption</hi> in them to lay claim to the bleſſings of the goſpel, till <hi>better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> for the divine reception. — Upon ſuch imaginary and falſe grounds as theſe, multitudes of the invited gueſts make <hi>excuſes,</hi> and exclude themſelves from the <hi>marriage-ſupper of the Lamb.</hi> It is therefore the buſineſs of the ſervants of CHRIST to ſhew, that <hi>there is yet room,</hi> even for the greateſt and vileſt ſinners to <hi>come in,</hi> and partake of the goſpel-feſtival; that <hi>all things are now ready,</hi> for their welcome entertainment;— that the <hi>door</hi> is ſtill <hi>open,</hi> and there's free acceſs, not only for thoſe who have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the groſſer pollutions of the world, but even <hi>for the chief of ſinners,</hi> whoſe guilt is of a <hi>crimſon</hi> colour and a <hi>ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> dye; that neither the number nor aggravations of their iniquities will exclude them a ſhare in the divine mercy,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005471_0021_101838DBE8CAB020"/>
if now they ſubmit to the ſceptre of grace; — that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their condition and circumſtances may be, it is of preſent obligation upon them to accept the goſpel-call, and their inſtant duty to <hi>come in</hi>; the <hi>Maſter</hi> invites them <hi>to come to him, that they may have life</hi>: and <hi>whoſoever do ſo,</hi> the Maſter of the houſe has aſſured them, that <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt them out.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. THEY are to exhibit the unſpeakable <hi>advantages,</hi> that will attend a compliance with the goſpel-call. — I know indeed, the religion of JESUS is by its enemies of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repreſented in the moſt frightful and hideous colours, — particularly as laying an unreaſonable reſtraint on the liberties of mankind, and ſinking them into melancholy enthuſiaſts. It becomes us therefore, who are <hi>ſet for the defence of the Goſpel,</hi> to endeavour the removing this groundleſs prejudice, and to convince mankind by the light of reaſon and ſcripture, that <hi>the ways of wiſdom are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace</hi>: that verily a life of <hi>faith</hi> in the bleſſed Redeemer is the way to be happy, both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>O WHAT more honourable, than to be <hi>a child of GOD, an heir of the kingdom of heaven?</hi> What more pleaſing, than to look back, and behold our paſt iniquities all buried in the depths of eternal oblivion;— than to look forward, and view our dear Saviour acknowledging us his friends and favourites, and adjudging us to a ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſhing glory? What more advantageous, than to have the divine favour engaged for our protection, the promiſes of divine grace for our conſolation, and an aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed title to <hi>an inheritance undefiled, incorruptible, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</hi> This is the portion of the true Believer.

We adore the great Head of the church for the nobler gifts and graces of his SPIRIT; by which, we truſt, you are enabled to engage in this miſſion with an ardent love to GOD, the univerſal Father of mankind, wiih a diſintereſted zeal for the honour of CHRIST, the compaſſionate friend of ſinners, and with tender concern for the periſhing Souls of a <hi>People that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death</hi>; who have for ſo many ages been wandring out of the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>without CHRIST, and without GOD in the world.</hi>

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005471_0023_101838E1EB076568"/>THE work of the miniſtry, in every place, has its difficulties and dangers, and requires much wiſdom, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, patience, and ſelf-denial, to diſcharge it in a right manner, with an encouraging proſpect of ſucceſs: But greater degrees of prudence, humility and meekneſs, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to the preſent world, holy courage, and zeal for the honour of GOD our SAVIOUR, are neceſſary where any are call'd to miniſter the Goſpel unto thoſe, who through a long ſucceſſion of ages have dwelt in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heatheniſm, have from their infancy imbibed inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate prejudices againſt the chriſtian faith, and from time immemorial been inured to many ſuperſtitious and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous practices, directly oppoſite to the nature and deſign of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>WHAT heavenly <hi>ſkill</hi> is required, to convey the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural myſteries of the goſpel into the Minds of uninſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Pagans, who are <hi>a people of a ſtrange ſpeech and hard language?</hi>— What deep <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is neceſſary, to enable you chearfully to forſake the pleaſures of your native Country, with the agreeable ſociety of your friends and acquaintance, to dwell among thoſe who inhabit not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>the high-ways and hedges,</hi> but uncultivated deſarts, and the remoteſt receſſes of the wilderneſs?— What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> to proſelyte thoſe to the faith of the goſpel, who have quenched the light of reaſon, and by their inhumane and barbarous practices have placed themſelves upon a level with the brute-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>METHINKS, I hear you crying out, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things!</hi>— And indeed, if you had no ſtrength to depend upon, but only your own, — no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but from human aſſiſtance, you might juſtly ſink down in a diſconſolate deſpair, and utter the paſſionate language of MOSES, <hi>O my LORD, ſend, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend</hi>: Thy ſervant is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for ſo great a work.—But it is at the command of CHRIST, the great Head of the church, that you go forth; who by a train of ſurpriſing providences, has been preparing your way for this important embaſſy; and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005471_0024_101838E7117F5EC0"/>
therefore you may be aſſured, that he will ſupport you in the faithful diſcharge of your duty, accept your unfeigned deſires to promote the intereſts of his kingdom, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward your imperfect ſervices with his gracious appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. You have his divine promiſe for your ſecurity and conſolation; <hi>Lo!

If CHRIST be with you, <hi>in vain do the heathen rage,</hi> in vain will their confederated tribes unite their forces to obſtruct and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you. Infinite wiſdom will be your guide,— Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power your ſhield,— and GOD himſelf <hi>your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reward.</hi> The preſence of your divine Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will make amends for the abſence of your deareſt friends and relatives. This will transform a wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated deſart into a paradiſe of joy and pleaſure; and the lonely hutts of ſavages into more delightful habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than the palaces of Princes.</p>
               <p>LET not then any difficulties diſcourage, any dangers affright you. Go forth <hi>in the name</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Lord JESUS, to whom you are now to be devoted in the ſacred office of the miniſtry. <hi>Be not aſhamed of the goſpel of CHRIST; for it is the power of GOD unto ſalvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile.</hi> Let zeal for the honour of GOD, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the ſouls of men, animate your publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and private addreſſes to the people committed to your charge. Always remember, that your character is A MINISTER OF JESUS; and therefore with the inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor of the Gentiles, you <hi>are to know nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſave CHRIST and him crucified.</hi> Frequently conſider, that the goſpel is a divine diſcipline to purify the heart, and ſet up the kingdom of the Redeemer in the ſouls of men: And therefore it is not ſufficient to bring ſinners to a profeſſion of the name of CHRIST, and an outward ſubjection to the inſtitutions of divine worſhip. <hi>You are ſent to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God — that they may receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005471_0025_101838E8ABEF0A30"/>
of ſins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in CHRIST.</hi> Unleſs this be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected (whatever other improvements they gain) they are left under the dominion of ſin, and expoſed to the wrath of GOD; and their ſuperior degrees of knowledge will only ſerve to light them down to the regions of death and miſery.— <hi>This</hi> then is to be the principal deſign of your miniſtry: For <hi>this</hi> you are to labour with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied application,— and with inceſſant importunity to encompaſs the throne of that God, whoſe peculiar prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative it is <hi>to teach us to profit</hi>; whoſe grace alone can make them <hi>a willing people in the day of his power</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND for your encouragement, I will only add,—When I conſider the many prophecies, in ſacred ſcripture, of the triumphant progreſs of the goſpel in the laſt ages of the world, I cannot but <hi>lift up</hi> my <hi>head with joy</hi> in an humble expectation, that the <hi>day draws near,</hi> yea, is <hi>even at hand,</hi> when the promiſes made to the Son of God ſhall be more illuſtriouſly fulfilled: — <hi>When he ſhall have the heathen for his inheritance, amd the utmoſt ends of the earth for his poſſeſſion; — When his name ſhall be great among the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and be</hi> honoured and adored <hi>from the riſing of the ſun to the going down of the ſame.</hi>— But if the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time is not yet come, and the attempts made to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this glorious day, fail of deſired ſucceſs,—<hi>your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be with the Lord, and your Reward with your God.</hi> If the gentiles <hi>be not gathered</hi> in; you will <hi>be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eyes of the Lord,</hi> who accepts and rewards his ſervants according to the ſincerity of their deſires, and not according to the ſucceſs of their endeavours.</p>
               <p>I ſhall CONCLUDE, with a few words to the <hi>Body of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD our Saviour, in infinite condeſcenſion, hath <hi>ſent his ſervants</hi> to invite you to <hi>come in,</hi> and receive the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which infinite wiſdom has contrived, and aſtoniſhing grace prepared, for your entertainment. And ſurely MY BRETHREN, it is your important duty, and incomparable

intereſt, not to deſpiſe <hi>the ſalvation of God ſent unto the gentiles,</hi> nor <hi>make light of</hi> the goſpel-meſſage to you.</p>
               <p>GÒD has been pleaſed to employ us the meſſengers of his grace, <hi>Men of like paſſions</hi> with yourſelves, ſubject to the common infirmities of human nature: But the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage comes from Him, who is KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS; whom you are under the ſtrongeſt obligations to hear and obey, in point of intereſt, gratitude, and duty.</p>
               <p>WHAT gracious and condeſcending methods has he taken, to allure and invite you! Has he not deſcended from heaven to earth; from the boundleſs glories of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to all the ſufferings and afflictions of this mortal life, that he might purchaſe and reveal ſalvation; that he might engage your love, and perſwade you to comply with his ſaving deſigns! Does he not ſend his <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to beſeech you in his ſtead, to be reconciled to God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHAT excuſes have you to make, that will ſtand the trial of an enlightned conſcience, or juſtify you at the awful tribunal of God? Will the vaniſhing enjoyments of ſin and ſenſe, or the periſhing riches of this tranſitory world, make amends for the loſs of the divine favour, or ſupport you under the terrors of eternal damnation?</p>
               <p>ARE there any honours comparable to the dignity and character of a child of God, — a title to the privileges of his houſe and family? Are there any pleaſures equal to the ſmiles of God's reconciled face,— the refreſhing viſits of his love,— the immortal <hi>joys of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT how deplorable, how deſperate will be your caſe, if you finally refuſe the goſpel-invitation, and periſh in your natural ſtate of guilt and miſery? The compaſſionate JESUS, who now addreſſes you in the inviting language of love, will then ſpeak to you with the voice of terror, and <hi>ſwear in his wrath, that you ſhall never enter into his reſt,</hi> that <hi>you ſhall never taſte of his ſupper,</hi> the rich proviſion which he has made for the eternal entertainment of his gueſts. <hi>When once the Maſter of the houſe is riſen up

and hath ſhut to the door,</hi> you will in vain <hi>ſtand without,</hi> and <hi>knock</hi> for admiſſion.</p>
               <p>IN a word, <hi>Now,</hi> he declares by his ſervants, that <hi>all things are ready,</hi> — and all that are <hi>bidden,</hi> ſhall be welcome, upon their <hi>coming in,</hi> to be <hi>partakers of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</hi> The blood of Chriſt is now ready, to cleanſe you from all your guilt and pollution; — His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is now ready, to adorn your naked ſouls with the garment of ſalvation; — His Spirit is now ready, to take poſſeſſion of you, and make you eternal monuments of victorious and redeeming grace. <hi>The Spirit and the Pride ſay, Come; and whoſoever</hi> (of the loſt and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſons of <hi>Adam) will, let him come,</hi> and participate of the bleſſings of the goſpel <hi>freely, without money and without price.</hi> The arms of everlaſting mercy are open, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you: The treaſures of divine grace are open, to ſupply your wants: And every one of you that now ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely accepts this gracious invitation, ſhall hereafter be admitted <hi>to ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

            <p>THE deplorable, periſhing State of the <hi>Indians</hi> in theſe Parts of <hi>America,</hi> being by ſeveral Miniſters here repreſented to the <hi>Society in</hi> Scotland <hi>for propagating Chriſtian Knowledge</hi>; the ſaid Society cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably and chearfully came into the Propoſal of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>two Miſſionaries</hi> among theſe miſerable Pagans, to endeavour their Converſion <hi>from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD</hi>: and ſent their Commiſſion to ſome Miniſters and other Gentlemen here, to act as their <hi>Correſpondents,</hi> in providing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, and inſpecting the ſaid Miſſion.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Correſpondents were authorized by the Society's Commiſſion, they immediately looked out for two Candidates of the evangelical Miniſtry, whoſe Zeal for the Intereſts of the REDEEMER's Kingdom, and whoſe Compaſſion for poor periſhing Souls, would prompt them to ſuch an exceeding difficult and ſelf-denying Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. — They firſt prevail'd with Mr. <hi>Azariah Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to relinquiſh a Call to an encouraging Pariſh, and to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005471_0029_101838F66021F7A8"/>
devote himſelf to the <hi>Indian</hi> Service. — He was directed to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1741, at the Eaſt End whereof there are two ſmall Towns of the <hi>Indians</hi>; and from the Eaſt to the Weſt End of the Iſland, leſſer Companies ſettled at a few Miles Diſtance from one another, for the Length of above an Hundred Miles.— At his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among theſe, he was well received by the moſt, and heartily welcom'd by ſome of them.— They at the Eaſt End of the Iſland eſpecially, gave diligent and ſerious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his Inſtructions, and were many of them put upon ſolemn Enquiries about <hi>what they ſhould do to be ſaved.</hi>— A general Reformation of Manners was ſoon obſervable among the moſt of theſe <hi>Indians.</hi>—They were careful to attend, and ſerious and ſolemn in Attendance, upon both publick and private Inſtructions. — A Number of them were under very deep Convictions of their miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble periſhing State; and about <hi>twenty</hi> of them give laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evidences of their ſaving Converſion to God.— Mr. <hi>Horton</hi> has baptized <hi>thirty five</hi> Adults, and <hi>forty four</hi> Children. — He took Pains with them to learn them to read; and ſome of them have made conſiderable Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. But the Extenſiveneſs of his Charge, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his travelling from Place to Place, makes him incapable of giving ſo conſtant Attendance to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Reading, as is needful. In his laſt Letter to the Correſpondents, he heavily complains of a great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of ſome of them, from their firſt Reformation and Care of their Souls, occaſioned by ſtrong Drink being brought among them, and their being thereby allured to a Relapſe into their darling Vice of Drunkenneſs: A Vice, to which the <hi>Indians</hi> are every where ſo greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and ſo vehemently diſpoſed, that Nothing but the Power of divine Grace can reſtrain that impetuous Luſt, when they have Opportunity to gratify it. He likewiſe complains, that ſome of them are grown more careleſs and remiſs in the Duties of religious Worſhip, than they were when firſt acquainted with the great Things of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Peace.— But as a Number retain their firſt Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005471_0030_101838FBD07F9E18"/>
and as they generally attend with Reverence upon his Miniſtry, he goes on in his Work, with encouraging Hopes of the Preſence and Bleſſing of God with him in his difficult Undertaking.</p>
            <p>This is a general View of the State of the Miſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> collected from ſeveral of Mr. <hi>Horton</hi>'s Letters; which is all that could now be offered, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as yet a particular Account from Mr. <hi>Horton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>It was ſome Time after Mr. <hi>Horton</hi> was imploy'd in the <hi>Indian</hi> Service, before the Correſpondents could obtain another qualified Candidate for this ſelf-denying Miſſion.

And this I ſhall do with more Freedom, and Chearfulneſs, both becauſe I apprehend it will be a likely Means to give pious Perſons, who are concern'd for the Kingdom of CHRIST, ſome juſt Apprehenſion of the many and great Difficulties, that attend the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it amongſt the poor Pagans, and conſequently 'tis hopeful, will engage their more frequent and fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, that thoſe may be ſucceeded, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in this arduous Work: And alſo becauſe I perſuade my ſelf that the Tidings of the Goſpel's ſpreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor Heathen, will be, to thoſe who are wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Accompliſhment of the <hi>Glorious Things ſpoken of the City of our God,</hi> as <hi>good News from a far Country:</hi> And that <hi>theſe</hi> will be ſo far from <hi>deſpiſing the Day of ſmall Things,</hi> that on the contrary the leaſt Dawn of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Hope, in this important Affair, will rather inſpire their pious Breaſts with more generous and warm Deſires, that <hi>the Kingdoms of this World,</hi> may ſpeedily <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore immediately proceed to the Buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and briefly touch upon the moſt important Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that have concern'd my Miſſion, from the Beginning to this preſent Time.</p>
               <p>On <hi>March</hi> 15, 1743. I waited on the Correſpondents for the <hi>Indian</hi> Miſſion at <hi>New-York</hi>; and the Week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, attended their Meeting at <hi>Woodbridge</hi> in <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> and was ſpeedily diſmiſſed by them with Orders to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Inſtruction of a Number of <hi>Indians</hi> in a Place ſome Miles diſtant from the City of <hi>Albany.</hi> And on the firſt Day of <hi>April</hi> following, I arrived among the <hi>Indians,</hi> at a Place call'd by them <hi>Kaunaumeek,</hi> in the County of <hi>Albany,</hi> near about twenty Miles diſtant from the City Eaſtward.</p>
               <p>The Place, as to its Situation, was ſufficiently loneſome, and unpleaſant, being incompaſſed with Mountains, and Woods; twenty Miles diſtant from any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005471_0032_101839008D3FEC08"/>
ſix, or ſeven from any <hi>Dutch</hi>; and more than two from a Family that came, ſome Time ſince, from the Highlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had then liv'd (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) about two Years in this Wilderneſs. In this Family I lodg'd about the Space of three Months, the Maſter of it being the only Perſon with whom I could readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in thoſe Parts, except my Interpreter; others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding very little <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After I had ſpent about three Months in this Situation, I found my Diſtance from the <hi>Indians</hi> a very great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to my Work amongſt them, and very burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to my ſelf; as I was oblig'd to travel forward and backward almoſt daily on Foot, having no Paſture in which I could keep my Horſe for that Purpoſe. And after all my Pains, could not be with the <hi>Indians</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening and Morning, which were uſually the beſt Hours to find them at home, and when they could beſt attend my Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>I therefore reſolv'd to remove, and live with or near the <hi>Indians,</hi> that I might watch all Opportunities, when they were generally at Home, and take the Advantage of ſuch Seaſons for their Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Accordingly I removed ſoon after; and, for a Time, liv'd with them in one of their <hi>Wigwams</hi>: and not long after, built me a ſmall Houſe, where I ſpent the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Year intirely alone; my Interpreter (who was an <hi>Indian</hi>) chooſing rather to live in a Wigwam among his own Country-Men.</p>
               <p>This Way of living I found attended with many Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and uncomfortable Circumſtances, in a Place where I could get none of the Neceſſaries and common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Life (no, not ſo much as a Morſel of Bread) but what I brought from Places fifteen and twenty Miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and oftentimes was oblig'd, for ſome Time together to content my ſelf without, for Want of an Opportunity to procure the Things I needed.</p>
               <p>But although the Difficulties of this ſolitary Way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving are not the leaſt, or moſt inconſiderable, (and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005471_0033_1018390294C42D68"/>
are in Fact many more and greater to thoſe who <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> than they can readily <hi>appear</hi> to thoſe, who only view them at a Diſtance) yet I can truly ſay, that the Burden I felt reſpecting my <hi>great Work</hi> among the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> the Fear and Concern that continually hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit, leſt they ſhould be prejudic'd againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and their Minds imbitter'd againſt me, and my Labours among them, by Means of the Inſinuations of ſome who (although they are call'd <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) ſeem to have no Concern for CHRIST's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but had rather (as their Conduct plainly diſcovers) that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould remain Heathens, that they may with the more Eaſe cheat, and ſo inrich themſelves by them; The Burden, I ſay, the Fear, and Concern I felt in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects were much more preſſing to me, than all the Difficulties that attended the Circumſtances of my liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Temper of Mind,</hi> in which I found theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> at my firſt coming among them, I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, it was much more deſireable, and encouraging, than what appears among thoſe who are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated. Their Heatheniſh Jealouſies and Suſpicion and their Prejudices againſt Chriſtianity, were in a great Meaſure remov'd by the long continued Labours of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Sargeant</hi> among a Number of the ſame Tribe, in a Place little more than twenty Miles diſtant: by which Means theſe were, in ſome good Degree, prepar'd to entertain the Truths of Chriſtianity, inſtead of object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them, and appearing almoſt intirely untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is common with them at firſt and as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe appear'd a few Years ago. Some of them, at leaſt, appear'd very well diſpos'd toward Religion, and ſeem'd much pleas'd with my coming among them.</p>
               <p>In my Labours with them, in Order <hi>to turn them from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> I ſtudied what was moſt <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>eaſy,</hi> and beſt ſuited to their Capacities: and endeavour'd to ſet before them from Time to Time (as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005471_0034_1018390749726948"/>
to receive them) the moſt <hi>important,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> Truths of Chriſtianity; ſuch as moſt immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd their ſpeedy Converſion to God, and ſuch as I judg'd had the greateſt Tendency (as means) to effect that glorious Change in them. But eſpecially I made it the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Drift</hi> of all my Labours, to lead them into a thorow Acquaintance with theſe two Things. — Firſt, the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> of the Eſtate they were <hi>natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in: The Evil of their Hearts, the Pollution of their Natures: The heavy Guilt they were under, and their Expoſedneſs to everlaſting Puniſhment; as alſo their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inability to ſave themſelves, either from their Sins, or from thoſe Miſeries which are the juſt Puniſhment of them; and their Unworthineſs of any Mercy at the Hand of God, on Account of any Thing they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could do to procure his Favour, and conſequently their extreme Need of CHRIST to ſave them. — And, Secondly, I frequently endeavoured to open to them the <hi>Fulneſs, Alſufficiency,</hi> and <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of that <hi>Redemption,</hi> which the SON of GOD has wrought out by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Sufferings, for periſhing Sinners: How this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion he had made, was ſuited to all their Wants; and how he call'd and invited them to accept of everlaſting Life freely, notwithſtanding all their Sinfulneſs, Inability, Unworthineſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After I had been with the <hi>Indians</hi> ſeveral Months, I compos'd ſundry <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> adapted to their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Capacities; which with the Help of my Interpreter, I tranſlated into the <hi>Indian</hi> Language; and ſoon learn'd to pronounce their Words ſo as to pray with them in their own Tongue. I alſo tranſlated ſundry <hi>Pſalms</hi> into their Language, and ſoon after we were able to ſing in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>When my People had gained ſome Acquaintance with many of the Truths of Chriſtianity, ſo that they were capable of receiving, and underſtanding many others, which at firſt could not be taught them, by Reaſon of their Ignorance of thoſe that were neceſſary to be previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005471_0035_1018390C07A19148"/>
known, and upon which others depended; I then gave them an <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Account of God's Dealings with his ancient profeſſing People, the <hi>Jews</hi>: Some of the Rites, and Ceremonies, they were obliged to obſerve, as their Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what theſe were deſign'd to repreſent to them: As alſo ſome of the ſurprizing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles God wrought for their Salvation, while they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, and the ſore Puniſhments he ſometimes bro't upon them, when they forſook and ſinn'd againſt him. Afterwards I proceeded to give them a Relation of the Birth, Life, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of CHRIST: as well as his Aſcenſion, and the wonderful Effuſion of the Holy SPIRIT conſequent thereupon.</p>
               <p>And having thus endeavour'd to prepare the Way by ſuch a general Account of Things, I next proceeded to read, and <hi>expound</hi> to them the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (at leaſt the Subſtance of it) in Courſe, wherein they had a more diſtinct, and particular View of what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome general Notion of.</p>
               <p>Theſe Expoſitions I attended almoſt every <hi>Evening,</hi> when there was any conſiderable Number of them at Home; except when I was obliged to be abſent my ſelf, in Order to learn the <hi>Indian</hi> Language with the Rev. Mr. <hi>Sargeant.</hi>— Beſides theſe Means of Inſtruction, there was likewiſe an <hi>Engliſh School</hi> conſtantly kept by my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter among the <hi>Indians</hi>: which I us'd frequently to viſit, in Order to give the Children and young People ſome proper Inſtructions, and ſerious Exhortations ſuited to their Age.</p>
               <p>The Degree of <hi>Knowledge</hi> to which ſome of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, was conſiderable. Many of the Truths of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſeem'd fix'd in their Minds, (eſpecially in ſome Inſtances,) ſo that they would ſpeak to me of them, and aſk ſuch Queſtions about them, as were neceſſary to render them more plain and clear to their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005471_0036_1018390F31DBDAE0"/>The Children alſo, and young People, who attended the <hi>School,</hi> made conſiderable Proficiency (at leaſt ſome of them) in their Learning; ſo that had they underſtood the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language well, they would have been able to read ſomewhat readily in a <hi>Pſalter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which was moſt of all deſirable, and gave me the greateſt Encouragement amidſt many Difficulties and diſconſolate Hours, was, that the Truths of God's Word ſeem'd, at Times, to be attended with ſome <hi>Power</hi> upon the Hearts and Conſciences of the <hi>Indians.</hi> And eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this appeared evident in a few Inſtances, who were awaken'd to ſome Senſe of their miſerable Eſtate by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and appear'd ſolicitous for Deliverance from it. Several of them came, of their own Accord, to diſcourſe with me about their Soul's Concerns; and ſome, with Tears, enquired <hi>what they ſhould do to be ſaved?</hi> And whether the GOD that Chriſtians ſerv'd, would be merciful to thoſe that had been frequently drunk, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And although I can't ſay, I have ſatisfactory Evidences of their being <hi>renewed in the Spirit of their Mind,</hi> and ſavingly converted to God, yet the Spirit of God did (I apprehend) in ſuch a Manner attend the Means of Grace, and ſo operate upon their Minds thereby, as might juſtly afford Matter of Encouragement to hope, that God deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Good to them, and that he was preparing his Way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Souls.</p>
               <p>There likewiſe appeared a <hi>Reformation</hi> in the Lives and Manners of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their idolatrous <hi>Sacrifices</hi> (of which there was but one or two, that I know of, after my coming among them) were wholly laid aſide. And their Heatheniſh Cuſtom of <hi>Dancing, Halloeing,</hi> &amp;c. they ſeem'd in a conſiderable Meaſure broken off from. And I could not but hope, that they were reform'd in ſome Meaſure from the Sin of <hi>Drunkenneſs.</hi> They likewiſe manifeſted a Regard to the <hi>Lord's Day</hi>: And not only behav'd ſoberly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005471_0037_10183910C4AA4E30"/>
but took Care alſo to keep their <hi>Children</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Yet after all I muſt confeſs, that as there were many hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Appearances among them, ſo there were ſome Things more <hi>diſcouraging.</hi> And while I rejoic'd to obſerve any Seriouſneſs, and Concern among them about the Affairs of their Souls, ſtill I was not without continual Fear and Concern, leſt ſuch encouraging Appearances might prove <hi>like a Morning-Cloud, that paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I had ſpent near a Year with the <hi>Indians,</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd them that I expected to leave them in the Spring then approaching, and to be ſent to another Tribe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> at a great Diſtance from them: Upon hearing of which they appear'd very ſorrowful, and ſome of them endeavour'd to perſwade me to continue with them; urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had now heard ſo much about their <hi>Souls Concerns,</hi> that they could never more be willing to live as they had done, without a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and further Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Way to Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereupon I told them, they ought to be willing that others alſo ſhould hear about their Soul's Concerns, ſeeing thoſe needed it as much as themſelves. Yet further to diſſuade me from going, they added, that thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> to whom I had Thoughts of going (as they had heard) were not willing to become <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> were, and therefore urged me to tarry with them. I then told them, that <hi>they</hi> might receive further Inſtruction without me; but the <hi>Indians,</hi> to whom I expected to be ſent, could not, there being no Miniſter near to teach them. And hereupon I adviſed them, in Caſe I ſhould leave them, and be ſent otherwhere, to remove to <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> where they might be ſupplied with Land, and Conveniences of Living, and be under the Miniſtry of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Sargeant</hi>: Which Advice, and Propoſal, they ſeem'd diſpoſed to comply with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:005471_0038_101839146FA49FF0"/>On <hi>April</hi> 6, 1744. I was order'd and directed by the Correſpondents for the <hi>Indian</hi> Miſſion, to take Leave of the People, with whom I had then ſpent a full Year, and to go (as ſoon as conveniently I could) to a Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> on <hi>Delaware</hi>-River in <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Orders I ſoon attended, and on <hi>April</hi> 29th took Leave of my People, who were moſtly remov'd to <hi>Stockbridge</hi> under the Care of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Sargeant.</hi> I then ſet out on my Journey toward <hi>Delaware</hi>; and on <hi>May</hi> tenth, met with a Number of <hi>Indians</hi> in a Place called <hi>Minniſſinks,</hi> about an hundred and forty Miles from <hi>Kau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naumeek</hi> (the Place where I ſpent the laſt Year) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in my Way to <hi>Delaware</hi>-River. With theſe <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> I ſpent ſome Time, and firſt addreſs'd their <hi>King</hi> in a friendly Manner; and after ſome Diſcourſe, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to contract a Friendſhip with him, I told him I had a Deſire (for his Benefit and Happineſs) to inſtruct them in <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> At which he laugh'd, turn'd his Back upon me, and went away. I then addreſs'd another <hi>Principal</hi> Man in the ſame Manner, who ſaid he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear me. After ſome Time, I follow'd the <hi>King</hi> into his Houſe, and renew'd my Diſcourſe to him: but he declin'd talking, and left the Affair to another, who appeared to be a rational Man. He began, and talked very warmly near a Quarter of an Hour together: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired why I deſir'd the <hi>Indians</hi> to become <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſeeing the Chriſtians were ſo much worſe than the <hi>Indians</hi> are in their preſent State. The Chriſtians, he ſaid, would lie, ſteal, and drink, worſe than the <hi>Indians.</hi> 'Twas <hi>they</hi> firſt taught the <hi>Indians</hi> to be drunk: And <hi>they</hi> ſtole from one another, to that Degree, that their Rulers were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to hang them for it, and that was not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others from the like Practice. But the <hi>Indians,</hi> he added, were none of them ever hang'd for Stealing, and yet they did not ſteal half ſo much; and he ſuppos'd that if the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould become Chriſtians, they would then be as bad as theſe. And hereupon he ſaid, they would live as their <hi>Fathers</hi> liv'd, and go where their <hi>Fathers</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:005471_0039_10183919CDCB7A98"/>
were when they died. I then freely <hi>owned, lamented,</hi> and join'd with him in <hi>condemning</hi> the ill Conduct of ſome, who are called <hi>Chriſtians</hi>: told him, theſe were not <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in <hi>Heart</hi>; that I hated ſuch wicked Practices, and did not deſire the <hi>Indians</hi> to become ſuch as theſe.—And when he appear'd calmer, I aſk'd him if he was willing, that I ſhould come and ſee them again: he replied, he ſhould be willing to ſee me again: as a <hi>Friend,</hi> if I would not deſire 'em to become <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>—I then bid them farewell, and proſecuted my Journey toward <hi>Delaware.</hi> And <hi>May</hi> 13th I arrived at a Place called by the Indians, <hi>Sakhauwotung,</hi> within the Forks of <hi>Delaware</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here alſo, when I came to the <hi>Indians,</hi> I ſaluted their <hi>King,</hi> and others, in a Manner I thought moſt engaging. And ſoon after informed the <hi>King</hi> of my Deſire to inſtruct them in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> After he had conſulted a few Minutes with two or three old Men, he told me, he was willing to hear. I then preach'd to thoſe few that were preſent: who appear'd very attentive, and well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And the <hi>King</hi> in particular ſeemed both to wonder, and at the ſame Time to be well pleas'd with what I taught them, reſpecting the DIVINE BEING, &amp;c. And ſince that Time he has ever ſhewn himſelf friendly to me, giving me free Liberty to preach in his Houſe, whenever I think fit.—Here therefore I have ſpent the greater Part of the Summer paſt, preaching uſually in the <hi>King</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> in this Place, is but ſmall: moſt of thoſe that formerly belong'd here, are diſpers'd, and remov'd to Places farther back in the Country. There are not more than ten Houſes hereabouts, that continue to be inhabited; and ſome of theſe are ſeveral Miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from others, which makes it difficult for the <hi>Indians</hi> to meet together ſo frequently as could be deſir'd.</p>
               <p>When I firſt began to preach here, the Number of my <hi>Hearers</hi> was very ſmall; often not exceeding twenty or twenty-five Perſons: But towards the latter Part of the Summer, their Number increas'd, ſo that I have frequently had forty Perſons, or more at once: and oftentimes the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005471_0040_1018391B64A5CA48"/>
moſt of thoſe belonging to thoſe Parts, came together to hear me preach.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Effects</hi> which the Truths of God's Word have had upon ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in this Place, are ſomewhat encouraging. Sundry of them are brought to renounce <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to decline partaking of thoſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> which they uſed to offer in Sacrifice to certain ſuppoſed unknown Powers. And ſome few Inſtances among them have, for a conſiderable Time, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſerious Concern for their Soul's eternal Welfare, and ſtill continue to <hi>enquire the Way to Zion,</hi> with ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, Affection, and becoming Solicitude, as gives me Reaſon to hope, that <hi>God who</hi> (I truſt) <hi>has begun this Work in them,</hi> will carry it on, until it ſhall iſſue in their ſaving Converſion to himſelf. Theſe not only deteſt their old idolatrous Notions, but ſtrive alſo to bring their Friends off from them. And as they are ſeeking Salvation for their own Souls, ſo they ſeem deſirous, and ſome of them take Pains, that others might be excited to do the like.</p>
               <p>In <hi>July</hi> laſt I heard of a Number of <hi>Indians</hi> reſiding at a Place (call'd <hi>Kaukſéſauchung</hi>) more than thirty Miles Weſtward from the Place where I uſually preach. I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited them, found about thirty Perſons, and propoſed my Deſire of preaching to them: they readily comply'd, and I preach'd them only twice; they being juſt then remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from this Place (where they only liv'd for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) to <hi>Suſquahannah</hi>-River where they belong'd.</p>
               <p>While I was preaching, they appear'd ſober, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and were ſomewhat ſurpriz'd, having never before heard of theſe Things. There were two or three, who ſuſpected that I had ſome ill Deſign upon them; and urg'd, that the <hi>white</hi> People had abus'd them, and taken their Lands from them, and therefore they had no Reaſon to think that they were now concern'd for their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But on the contrary, that they deſign'd to make them Slaves, or get them on board their Veſſels, and make them fight with the People over the Water (as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd it) meaning the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> However,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005471_0041_1018391FB0B285B0"/>
the moſt of them appear'd very friendly, and told me, they were then going directly home to <hi>Suſquahannah,</hi> and deſired I would make them a Viſit there, and manifeſted a conſiderable Deſire of farther Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>This Invitation gave me ſome Encouragement in my great Work; and made me hope, that God deſign'd to <hi>open an effectual Door to me</hi> for ſpreading the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor Heathen farther Weſtward.</p>
               <p>In the Beginning of <hi>October</hi> laſt, with the Advice and Direction of the Correſpondents for the <hi>Indian Miſſion,</hi> I undertook a Journey to <hi>Suſquahannah.</hi> And after three Days tedious Travel, two of them thro' a Wilderneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unpaſſable by Reaſon of Mountains and Rocks, and two Nights lodging in the open Wilderneſs, I came to an <hi>Indian</hi> Settlement on the Side of <hi>Suſquahan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>-River, call'd <hi>Opeholhaupung</hi>: where were twelve Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Houſes, and (as nigh as I could learn) about ſeventy Souls, old and young, belonging to them.</p>
               <p>Here alſo, ſoon after my Arrival, I viſited the <hi>King,</hi> addreſſing him with Expreſſions of Kindneſs: and after a few Words of Friendſhip, inform'd him of my Deſire to teach them the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> He heſitated not long before he told me, that he was willing to hear. I then preached, and continu'd there ſeveral Days, preaching every Day, as long as the <hi>Indians</hi> were at Home. And they in order to hear me, deferr'd the Deſign of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hunting (which they were juſt then entering upon) for the Space of three or four Days.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Men,</hi> I think, univerſally (except one) attended my Preaching. Only, the <hi>Women,</hi> ſuppoſing the Affair we were upon was of a publick Nature, belonging only to the Men, and not what every individual Perſon ſhould concern himſelf with, could not readily be perſuaded to come and hear: but, after much Pains uſed with them for that Purpoſe, ſome few ventured to come, and ſtand at a Diſtance.</p>
               <p>When I had preach'd to the <hi>Indians</hi> ſeveral Times, ſome of them very frankly propoſed what they had to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005471_0042_101839248C80B2E8"/>
againſt <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; and ſo gave me a fair Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for uſing my beſt Endeavours to remove from their Minds thoſe Scruples and Jealouſies they laboured under: And when I had endeavour'd to anſwer their Objections, ſome appeared much ſatisfied. I then aſked the <hi>King</hi> if he was willing I ſhould viſit, and preach to them again, if I ſhould live to the next Spring: He replied, he ſhould be heartily willing for his own Part, and added, he wiſh'd the young People would learn <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I then put the ſame Queſtion to the reſt: Some anſwered, they ſhould be very glad, and none manifeſted any diſlike to it.</p>
               <p>There were ſundry other Things in their Behaviour, which appeared with a comfortable, and encouraging Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; that, upon the whole, I could not but rejoice I had taken that Journey among them, altho' it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many Difficulties and Hardſhips. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I uſed with them, and the Inſtructions I gave them (I am perſuaded) were Means in ſome Meaſure, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their heatheniſh Jealouſies, and Prejudices againſt Chriſtianity: And I could not but hope, <hi>the God of all Grace</hi> was preparing their Minds to receive <hi>the Truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi> If this may be the happy Conſequence, I ſhall not only rejoice in my paſt Labours and Fatigues; but ſhall, I truſt, alſo <hi>be willing to ſpend and be ſpend,</hi> if I may thereby be inſtrumental <hi>to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have given you a faithful Account of what has been moſt conſiderable reſpecting my Miſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Indians</hi>; in which I have ſtudied all convenient Brevity. I ſhall only now take leave to add a Word or two reſpecting the <hi>Difficulties</hi> that attend the Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of theſe poor Pagans.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, Their Minds are fill'd with <hi>Prejudices</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> on Account of the <hi>vicious</hi> Lives and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> Behaviour of ſome that are call'd <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Theſe not only ſet before them the worſt Examples, but ſome of them take Pains, expreſly in Words, to diſſuade them from becoming Chriſtians; foreſeeing, that if theſe ſhould be
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005471_0043_10183926DF98EDA0"/>
converted to God, <hi>the Hope of their</hi> unlawful <hi>Gain</hi> would thereby be loſt.</p>
               <p>Again, Theſe poor Heathens are extremely attach'd to the Cuſtoms, Traditions and fabulous Notions of their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> And this one ſeems to be the Foundation of all their other Notions, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>'twas not the ſame GOD made them, who made the White People,</hi> but another who commanded them to live by <hi>Hunting,</hi> &amp;c. and not conform to the Cuſtoms of the <hi>white</hi> People.— Hence when they are deſir'd to become Chriſtians, they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reply, that <hi>they will live as their Fathers liv'd, and go to their Fathers, when they die.</hi> And if the <hi>Miracles</hi> of Chriſt and his Apoſtles be mentioned, to prove the Truth of Chriſtianity; They alſo mention ſundry Miracles, which their Fathers have told them were anciently wro't among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and which Satan makes them believe were ſo.—They are much attach'd to <hi>Idolatry</hi>: Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making <hi>Feaſts,</hi> which they eat in Honour to ſome <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi> Beings, who, they ſuppoſe, ſpeak to them in <hi>Dreams</hi>; promiſing them Succeſs in Hunting, and other Affairs, in Caſe they will ſacrifice to them. They oftentimes alſo offer their Sacrifices to the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Dead</hi>; who, they ſuppoſe, ſtand in Need of Favours from the Living, and yet are in ſuch a State as that they can well reward all the Offices of Kindneſs that are ſhewn them. And they impute all their Calamities to the Neglect of theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, they are much awed by thoſe among themſelves, who are call'd <hi>Powwaws,</hi> who are ſuppoſed to have a Power of Inchanting, or poyſoning them to Death, or at leaſt in a very diſtreſſing Manner. And they apprehend it would be their ſad Fate to be thus inchanted, in Caſe they ſhould become Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Manner of their living</hi> is likewiſe a great Diſadvantage to the Deſign of their being Chriſtianized. They are almoſt continually roving from Place to Place; and 'tis but rare, that an Opportunity can be had with ſome of them for their Inſtruction. There is ſcarce
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005471_0044_1018392B85AD4710"/>
any Time of the Year, wherein the <hi>Men</hi> can be found generally at home, except about ſix Weeks before, and in, the Seaſon of planting their Corn, and about two Months in the latter Part of Summer, from the Time they begin to road their Corn, until 'tis fit to gather in.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Hardſhips</hi> that neceſſarily attend a Miſſion among them, the Fatigues of frequent Journeying in the Wilderneſs, the Unpleaſantneſs of a mean and hard Way of Living, and the great Difficulty of addreſſing <hi>a People of a ſtrange Language,</hi> theſe I ſhall, at preſent, paſs over in Silence; deſigning what I have already ſaid of Difficulties attending this Work, not for the Diſcouragement of <hi>any,</hi> but rather for the Incitement of <hi>all,</hi> who <hi>live the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> to frequent the Throne of Grace with earneſt Supplications, that the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who were anciently <hi>promiſed</hi> to Chriſt <hi>for his Inheritance,</hi> may now <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>ſpeedily</hi> be brought into his Kingdom of Grace, and made Heirs of immortal Glory. —</p>

                     <label>P. S</label>. It ſhould have been obſerved in the <hi>preceding Account,</hi> that although the Number of <hi>Indians</hi> in the Place I viſited on <hi>Suſquahannah</hi> River, in <hi>October</hi> laſt, is but ſmall, yet their Numbers in the adjacent Places are very conſiderable: Who, 'tis hopeful, might be brought to embrace Chriſtianity by the Example of others.
