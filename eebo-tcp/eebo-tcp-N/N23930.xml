            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON DELIVERED AT THE EXECUTION OF Thomas Powers.</head>
            <p>WE are convened this day to be ſpectators of a moſt ſolemn and affecting event, the launching of a moral veſſel from the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation into the boundleſs ocean of eternity, and endleſs retribution, <hi>never to return.</hi> And whether it will depart, freighted with the love of GOD, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itence, faith, and the joys of pardoning grace, as a veſſel of mercy, prepared unto glory; or freighted with pride, impenitence, unbelief, and the guilt of unpardoned ſin, as a veſſel of wrath fitted to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, to us, a matter of dreadful uncertainty.</p>
            <p>Such an event muſt deeply intereſt the feelings of every benevolent ſpectator, and produce the moſt ſervent prayer, that what ſhall be ſaid on the occaſion, may prove a favour of life unto life, and not of death unto death.</p>
            <p>As a directory for our thoughts, and the ground of our diſcourſe, on the preſent occaſion, the following paſſage of ſcripture has been ſelected.</p>
            <p>LUKE xxiiid Chapter, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43d verſes.—<hi>And one of the malefactors, which were banged, railed on him, ſaying, If thou be Chriſt, ſave thyſelf and us.</hi>

               <hi>But the other anſwering, rebuked him, ſaying—Doſt thou not fear GOD, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And we indeed juſtly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And be ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, verify I ſay unto thee, To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This paſſage of ſacred hiſtory preſents to our view, a paſt ſcene, in all reſpects as ſolemn, and in ſome reſpects, vaſtly more intereſting than the preſent.</p>
            <p>The great Redeemer, who was rich, for our ſake became poor; that we through his poverty might be made rich. To accompliſh the important work of our redemption, he appeared on earth in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man. And according to ancient prophecy, in the laſt years of his viſible reſidence among men, the ſpirit of the Lord God was upon him, and he was anointed to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to thoſe that were bound; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God.—But although he manifeſted the greateſt benevolence, both with regard to the ſouls and bodies of men, yet his faithfulneſs in reproving the wickedneſs and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrify of the Jews, excited their indignation to ſuch a degree, that nothing would ſatiſfy their malicious deſires, ſhort of embruing their hands in his blood. With theſe malignant feelings, they inceſſantly ſought to enſnare and to deſtroy him.</p>
            <p>But here we may obſerve that it was a great part of his errand into the world to die an accurſed death on the croſs; to give his life a ranſom for many; for without the ſnedding of blood, there could be no remiſſion. So while the Jews with wicked hands crucified and ſlew him, they did what God's hand and counſel had before determined ſhould he done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:031657_0004_0FED90FDCA9D848"/>
And when the time drew nigh which the Father had appointed, and to which the Son had previouſly conſented, that he ſhould be made a ſacrifice for the ſins of the world; he was betrayed by one of his own family into the hands of his enemies. And when by art and malice they had obtained againſt him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſentence of condemnation, he was led as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a malefactor to the place of execution.</p>
            <p>And for the greater reproach and indignity, he was hung between two thieves, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. Their placing him thus, between the two malefactors, was probably, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as the ringleader in miſchief, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt criminal of the three,—This will appear further probable, if we conſider, that while the three hung on the croſs together, Chriſt was the peculiar object of their inſults. We have no account that one inſulting word was ſaid to either of the malefactors; but againſt the Son of God, the artillery of hell was diſcharged in the moſt barbarous inſults and reproaches.</p>
            <p>They that paſſed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, Thou that deſtroyeſt the temple, and buildeſt it in three days, ſave thyſelf. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs.—Likewiſe, alſo the chief prieſts mocking him, with the ſcribes and elders, ſaid, He ſaved others, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he cannot ſave; if he be the king of Iſrael, let him come down from the croſs, and we will believe him. And when, from anguiſh of ſoul, he cried, Eloi, Eloi, Lamaſabachthani; ſome ſaid he calleth for Elias—One ran and took a ſpunge, and filled it with vinegar, and gave him to drink; and the reſt ſaid let us be, let us ſee whether Elias will come to ſave him.</p>
            <p>Had Chriſt been the greateſt criminal who ever ſuffered an infamous death, their inſulting him thus, in the hour of diſtreſs, would have been an indelible blot upon humanity. But conſidering him as perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinleſs and holy, no wonder that the ſun refuſed to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031657_0005_0FED90FC615F1B28"/>
give them light; that the earth quaked with dire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and the rocks burſt aſunder with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while ſuch a horrid deed was perpetrated; ſuch indignity ſhewn to him, who was the brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding we reprobate the conduct of men on that occaſion, we muſt adore the conduct of GOD. The event, in one view of it, was gloomy and infinitely dreadful; but in another, it was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly expreſſive of the love of GOD to mankind. It was needful that the Captain of our Salvation ſhould be made perfect through ſuffering. It was needful that he ſhould die that we might live.—And for this end he came into the world; ſo it pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him, and to lay upon him the iniquities of us all; that whoſoever ſhould believe in his name might have everlaſting life. Thus Chriſt ſuffered for ſins; the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</p>
            <p>Let us now turn our attention to ſome particulars ſuggeſted in our text.</p>
            <p>We may notice that awful degree of ſtupidity which appeared in one of the malefactors, in the hour of crucifixion.—<hi>And one of the malefactors railed on him, ſaying, If thou be Chriſt, ſave thyſelf and us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The railing and inſults of the ſpectators, on that occaſion, was evidential of very great malignity and inhumanity. But the railing of this malefactor not only evidenced his inhumanity, but the moſt ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtupidity and hardneſs of heart. He himſelf was juſt cloſing his ſtate of probation, and about to enter into the world of retribution. It would he natural to expect, that in ſuch a ſolemn and critical moment, his mind would have been otherwiſe employed than in inventing raillery againſt a fellow ſufferer. No words can ſufficiently expreſs the deteſtable nature of ſuch hardneſs and ſtupidity. How much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a rational creature it would have been, to ſpend thoſe few moments of life, in pouring out his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031657_0006_OFED9100D5659D88"/>
foul before GOD, in humble conſeſſion of his ſin, and ſervent ſupplication for his forgiving grace.</p>
            <p>It is not ſuppoſable that he arrived at that pitch of ſtupidity otherwiſe than by a long courſe of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing iniquity. It is not improbable, that in his younger years, the very thought of ſuch an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous death would have filled him with fear and trembling, and had a prophet foretold him that in ſome future day he would diſcover ſuch ſhocking ſtupidity, he would have utterly diſbelieved it; thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and replied as Hazael did to Eliſha—Is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this thing!</p>
            <p>But by continuing in the practice of iniquity, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating his conſcience, and deſpiſing reproof, he grew more and more feared, and regardleſs of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſtill he would ruſh blindly and unfeelingly into the boſom of deſpair.</p>
            <p>Nor is it improbable, that while he purſued his ſinful courſe, he found his conſcience and his fears of future miſery, an embarraſſment; and to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from inward anguiſh, greedily ſwallowed the doctrine of the sadduces, or ſome other ſentiment calculated to pleaſe his heart, and to footh his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, while he gave full latitude to his vicious inclinations. And that, becauſe he did not like to retain GOD in his knowledge, the Lord in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gave him over to a reprobate mind, and ſent him ſtrong deluſions to believe a lie, that he might be ſnared in the works of his own hands, and finally damned for having pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs. And thus, by degrees, he was fitted for deſtruction. So that when the ſolemn hour of execution arrived, he could mock at death, laugh at the idea of a future retribution, and ſpend his expiring moments in rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, who alone could ſave him from endleſs death.</p>
            <p>It is common for perſons in the time of youth, and till they become hardened in the extreme, to fancy, that if they have any previous warning reſpecting
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031657_0007_0FED9102738CB378"/>
the hour of death, they ſhall, aſſuredly, attend to the concerns of their ſouls, repent of their ſins, and make their peace with GOD. But from this inſtance of the malefactors ſtupidity, we may ſee that there is no certainty that ſinners will not be as ſtupid in the hour of death, as in any former period of their lives; and conſequently to purſue ſinful courſes in hopes of a diſpoſition to repent, at ſuch a late period of life, muſt be infinitely hazardous.</p>
            <p>We may attend to the temper and conduct of the other malefactor at the ſame ſolemn hour.</p>
            <p>While he heard his former companion in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, impiouſly, railing on the Son of GOD, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting his ſtupidity; his ſoul was filled with aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and contrition. In the moſt ſolemn, feeling and affecting manner, he rebuked him, Doſt thou not fear GOD, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?—And we indeed juſtly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs.</p>
            <p>No language could have been more ſuitable on the occaſion, nor better calculated to have a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the mind of that hardened wretch; had he not been paſt feeling, he muſt have ſunk in contrition under the weight of ſuch a ſeaſonable, ſolemn, and humble reproof.</p>
            <p>The former part of this reproof, will pertinently, apply in many caſes.—When one perſon judges, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or rails upon another for crimes, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is guilty of the ſame or greater crimes; it may be ſaid to him, Doſt thou not fear GOD, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? So when one perſon, in a careleſs and unfeeling manner, ſees another pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed for certain crimes, while he himſelf is guilty of the ſame, or greater, he might in this language juſtly be rebuked.—Doſt thou not fear GOD, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation?</p>
            <p>"And is it not to be feared that there are ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this aſſembly to day, to whom the rebuke may be penitently applied;—Some who are guilty
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031657_0008_0FED910416ACB7D0"/>
of the ſame or greater crimes, than that for which this priſoner is to be executed, and yet are deſtitute of any proper feelings towards the priſoner, and any ſuitable contrition for their own ſins. To ſuch we may ſay, to ſuch their own conſciences may ſay, Doſt thou not fear GOD, ſeeing thou art in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?—For although their crimes have not been brought into public view, and their perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a Court of Juſtice; yet, they and their crimes are open to the view of GOD, and by his law they are condemned. And they are now priſoners to Divine Juſtice, and on their way to trial and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and nothing ſhort of a cordial repentance, will prevent their receiving a more dreadful puniſhment than it is in the power of man to inflict.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of this malefactors reproof to his companion, he evidenced the penitent feelings of his heart. He did not, like a ſelf juſtifying ſinner, ſay, And <hi>you</hi> indeed juſtly, for <hi>you</hi> receive the due reward of your deeds. But like one who was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his own guilt, and diſpoſed to condemn ſin in himſelf as freely as in others, he ſaid, And <hi>we</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed juſtly, for <hi>we</hi> receive the due reward of our deeds. It is natural enough for impenitent ſinners to accuſe one another; but while they are diſpoſed to accuſe one another, they are generally diſpoſed to excuſe themſelves.</p>
            <p>The truly humble and penitent are moſt deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with their own guilt and vileneſs, and diſpoſed to think others leſs vile than themſelves. The reaſon is this, they have not ſo clear a diſcovery of the hearts of others, and the aggravations of their conduct, as they have of their own.</p>
            <p>The difference between the feelings of a ſelf juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and a ſelf condemning ſinner, is ſtrikingly illuſtrated by Chriſt, in the parable of the Phariſee and Publican, who went up into the temple to pray. The Phariſee, unaffected with the wickedneſs of his own heart, could draw near and proudly thank GOD that he was not as other men. But the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031657_0009_0FED9108A062E4C0"/>
feeling moſt ſenſibly, his own vileneſs, could not ſo much as lift up his eyes towards Heaven, but, ſtanding at an humble diſtance, ſmote on his aching breaſt, and ſaid, GOD be merciful to me a ſinner.</p>
            <p>Similar to the feelings of the Publican were thoſe of the malefactor, when he ſaid, and <hi>we</hi> indeed juſtly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds. How ſuitable were theſe feelings for one in his ſituation—and how great the contraſt of tempers in the two malefactors!</p>
            <p>When the penitent had done his duty, in reproving his companion in ſin and ſuffering, and had confeſſed his own guilt and ill deſerts, he humbly made his ſupplication to the ſuffering Redeemer. Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom.—This is expreſſive of the ſenſe he had of his need of a Saviour; his faith in Chriſt as the Meſſiah; his love to the character of Chriſt as Mediator; his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſubject himſelf to Chriſt as his Lord, and the pleaſure of his ſoul in committing himſelf into the divine hand. While others mocked and derided he was not aſhamed to own the Lord, and to call upon his name. And to his humble requeſt he received the moſt comforting reply.</p>
            <p>Thus we are led,</p>
            <p n="3">3d. To conſider the import of the Lord's anſwer, to the penitent thief—<hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Paradiſe is doubtleſs intended, the heavenly ſtate; a ſtate of complete felicity and the higheſt enjoyment, exempt from all ſin and ſuffering; where the weary are at reſt, and the wicked ceaſe from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Every ſoul being perfected in holineſs, is completely prepared to be pleaſed with divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to enter into the joys of the Lord. As they are prepared to enter into the joys of the Lord, ſo they are prepared to be comforted in each others comfort. And as GOD will never ceaſe to diſplay his glory, and as it may be ſuppoſed that Angels and ſaints will for ever be in a ſtate of youthful vigor, ſo
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031657_0010_0FED910BAB9D5FF0"/>
it may be ſuppoſed that they will be perpetually growing in knowledge, in holineſs and felicity.—Every employment of the ſaints in ſerving the Lord and each other, will afford refined pleaſure. As nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as the company of happy beings, ſo numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the ſtreams of individual felicity; and the perfection and happineſs of GOD, with his innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able family, collectively conſidered, will be, to every ſoul, an ocean of delight, without ſurface, ſhore or bottom.</p>
            <p>Into ſuch a paradiſe of joy unſpeakable and full of glory, Chriſt promiſed the penitent malefactor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate entrance.</p>
            <p>This anſwer of Chriſt naturally leads us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that men have ſouls capable of exiſtence in a ſtate of ſeparation from the body; that this ſoul is the moſt important part of the man, and that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the death of the body, the ſoul enters into a ſtate of retribution.</p>
            <p>There is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that Chriſt expected the body of the malefactor would, that day, be with him in Paradiſe. Yet, he ſaid to him—To day ſhalt <hi>thou</hi> be with me in Paradiſe. Which evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys the idea, that the ſoul is capable of ſeparate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; likewiſe that the ſoul is ſo important a part of the man, that it may be conſidered as the perſon when ſeparated from the body; and alſo, that as ſoon as the ſoul leaves the body, or as ſoon as the body dies, the ſoul enters into a ſtate of retribution.</p>
            <p>That upon the death of the body, the ſoul enters immediately into a ſtate of retribution, is denied by ſome who profeſs adherence to the ſcriptures as the word of God. But the words of Chriſt, under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, moſt naturally conveys this idea. And ſeveral paſſages of Scripture, are calculated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm us in the belief, that this was really the meaning of Chriſt, one or two of which will here be brought into view.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle Paul in his epiſtle to the Phlippians mentioned a conflict of deſires in his own breaſt.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031657_0011_0FED910EB4155020"/>
He expreſſed himſelf thus: <hi>"For me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.—Yet what I ſhall chooſe I wot not. For I am in a ſtrait betwixt too, having a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt; which is far better. Nevertheleſs to abide in the fleſh is more needful for you."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how can this be reconciled to the idea of the ſouls remaining in a ſtate of inſenſibility from the death of the body, to the general reſurrection?</p>
            <p>It, perhaps, will be pleaded that during the time of the ſouls inſenſibility it has no perception of any thing; and therefore it can perceive no loſs of time. Conſequently, it muſt be all one, as to the perceptions of the ſoul, whether it be one ſecond, or thouſands of years, from the death of the body, to the ſouls entering into Paradiſe. And as the Apoſtle was, in this world, ſubjected to grievous afflictions; and as he expected that, on his firſt perception after death, he ſhould find himſelf with the Lord; he might, with propriety ſay, <hi>to die is gain.</hi> To this we may anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A man may be ſenſible, before he lies down to ſleep, that if, in his ſleeping moments, he ſhall have no perception or ſucceſſion of ideas, that he can, during that ſtate, have no conſciouſneſs of the paſſing of time: yet, while he contemplates the matter beforehand, he will, alſo, be ſenſible that time will paſs, during his ſleep, whether he ſhall then be conſcious of it or not. And when a man awakes in the morning, he may be conſcious that time has paſſed while he was aſleep, although he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect any perceptions which he had during his ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.—So if Paul expected that his ſoul would reſt in a ſtate of total inſenſibility from the death of the body to the general reſurrection, and that during that ſtate he ſhould be unconſcious of the paſſing of time, yet doubtleſs, he was ſenſible that there would be loſs of time during that ſtate of inſenſibility. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he did not view ſuch a ſtate as neceſſary to prepare the ſoul for future ſervices and enjoyments,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031657_0012_0FED91132C769D38"/>
as ſleep is neceſſary while the ſoul and body are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, he muſt eſtimate living in this world as prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch a ſtate of inſenſibility: provided that the happineſs he might enjoy in this life, would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the leaſt degree, to overbalance the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he muſt endure. For if happineſs be at all a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable object to be continued in exiſtence, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of one degree of real-happineſs, is preferable to annihilation, or a ſtate of inſenſibility.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. It will be readily granted that Paul's afflictions in the preſent ſtate were exceedingly great; but it will not be granted that his afflictions were ſo great as to overbalance his happineſs. For in the ſame epiſtle, he ſays, reſpecting himſelf, "I have learned in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtate I am, therewith to be content". And in another of his epiſtles he teſtifies that Godlineſs with contentment is great gain. It is therefore, eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he might enjoy in this world, ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of happineſs greatly to overbalance all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to which he was ſubjected.</p>
            <p>Paul was poſſeſſed of that charity which ſeeketh not her own. He was formed for activity, and to do good and communicate was pleaſure to his ſoul.—This pleaſure he expected he could enjoy while he lived. And to ſuch a mind the thought of paſſing into a ſtate of total inactivity muſt be highly diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it was Paul's opinion, that the afflictions of ſaints in the preſent life, work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; which ſentiment would be a great ſupport to his ſoul under his preſent trials. We may therefore on the whole, conclude, that had Paul expected, that, at death, his ſoul would remain for thouſands of years, in a ſtate of inactivity and inſenſibility, he would rather have ſaid—<hi>To die is leſs, to live is gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, already, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears pretty evident, that the ſouls of the righteous, or penitent, immediately after the death of the body, enter into a ſtate of retribution. And if it be ſo with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031657_0013_0FED9114CF923C90"/>
the righteous, we may expect it will be ſo with the wicked. If we may ſuppoſe that the penitent go immediately into Paradiſe, we may ſuppoſe that the wicked go immediately into hell: And both theſe ideas are clearly exhibited in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.</p>
            <p>The beggar died, and was carried by the Angels, not into a ſtate of inſenſibility, but into Abraham's boſom. The rich man died alſo, and the next news we hear of him, is this. In hell he lift up his eyes, and ſaw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſom, and ſo far was he from being in a ſtate of inſenſibility, that he cried, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and ſend Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</p>
            <p>That the wicked are here repreſented as being in hell, and the righteous in heaven, before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day, appears evident from the laſt petition of the rich man. When he was denied ſo much favor as one drop of water to cool his tongue, he further requeſted that Lazarus might be ſent to his father's houſe to warn his five brethren, left they alſo ſhould come to that place of torment. But after the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the wicked in hell will have no brethren left in this world to need either the dead or the living to warn them.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour's anſwer to the malefactor, is alſo expreſſive of the <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>freeneſs</hi> of Divine Grace in pardoning the penitent.</p>
            <p>This malefactor had been a great ſinner. He had delayed repentance to the eleventh hour, and was juſt about to enter into eternity. He then came to himſelf. The feelings of penitence took place in his breaſt; the love of God was ſhed abroad on his ſoul; he cried for mercy with a humble heart.—And lo! with what readineſs his petition was granted. Although he had been exceedingly guilty in delaying repentance ſo long, yet no objection was made to his forgiveneſs and ſalvation. But ſaid the all compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031657_0014_0FED9117D81C1A98"/>
Redeemer, To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>As there is this one inſtance of repentance and forgiveneſs at the eleventh hour, recorded in ſcripture, it may afford encouragement to all ſuch as have delayed to that time. But as there is only this inſtance recorded, and as in the ſame connexion, there is another inſtance of the moſt ſhocking ſtupidity at the laſt hour, it concerns every one who has now the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to improve an earlier ſeaſon to make his peace with God.</p>
            <p>We may now proceed to ſome particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the ſubject, and improvement of the ſolemn occaſion, upon which we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened. And here the priſoner claims our firſt attention.</p>

               <p>The bleſſed Redeemer who had been exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hanging on a tree, was cut off, but not for himſelf, he ſhed his blood for the remiſſion of ſins, and altho' he died, he lives again, and is now a merciful advocate for ſinners, before the throne of God the Father: And through him there is forgiveneſs with God, even for the chief of penitent ſinners.

               <p>If like the penitent thief, you are now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a broken heart, and a contrite ſpirit, and from ſuch feelings, are diſpoſed to cry, God be merciful to me a ſinner: You may freely apply the gracious promiſe of Chriſt to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. And the gallows will be to you as the laſt ſtep to heaven.</p>

               <p>THE occaſion on which we are convened has had no precedent in this county, and but very few in the State. And it is devoutly to be deſired that this melancholly event, may have ſuch a happy influence upon all claſſes of people, that a ſimilar occaſion for convening, ſhall never be needful.</p>
               <p>Although capital puniſhments have ſeldom taken place among us, yet criminal proſecutions and ſuch crimes as lay a foundation for them, have of late, been very numerous; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences a corruption of morals, and growth in wickedneſs, and gives reaſon to fear that capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal puniſhments will be multiplied. It may, therefore, be ſuitable in this ſerious hour, to bring into view ſome things which have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to corrupt the morals of community; that for the future, we may all be on our guard, and act a faithful part according to our reſpective ſtations and capacities, for the ſuppreſſion of vice, and a reformation of morals. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, for preventing a further encreaſe of criminal proſecutions, and capital puniſhments.</p>
               <p>There are four claſſes of citizens who have great influence in regulating, or corrupting the morals of ſociety, <abbr>viz.</abbr>—<hi>Rulers, Public Teachers, Profeſſors of Religion,</hi> and <hi>Heads of Families.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Rulers.</hi>—They have vaſt influence upon the morals of community. When they duly execute their reſpective offices, they are miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of GOD for good to the people. They are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.—So that, while good rulers are in authority, and faithfully diſcharge their duty, vice hides its
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031657_0019_0FED912723D318C8"/>
head, and the people rejoice. But when the wicked bear rule, iniquity abounds, and the people mourn. The wicked walk on every ſide, when the vileſt men are exalted. It is written, Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the ruler of thy people. And we wiſh not do it.—But perhaps we may, for a good end, humbly point out faults, without juſtly incurring cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for ſpeaking evil.</p>
               <p>It may, however, be ſuitable here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that we have great cauſe of thankfulneſs, that we have ſo many good rules in our land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eſpecially, that we have ſuch an unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed and exemplary character as Preſident of the Nation.</p>
               <p>But is there not ſtill ſome reaſon for mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on account of deficiencies in our Rulers?—Are not thoſe who may be eſteemed good Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, chargeable with ſome deficiency at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day?—Are they not, in ſome degree, too negligent of their duties, and too regardleſs of the morals of community?—Are there not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral laws in this ſtate, againſt immoralities, which are frequently violated, but ſeldom if ever executed? <abbr>viz.</abbr>—Such as reſpect <hi>Adultery, Drunkenneſs. Tavern Haunting, Idleneſs, Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>profane Swearing.</hi> Now, if the laws of the State are, in theſe inſtances trampled upon with impunity;—if executive officers are negligent in their duty reſpecting ſuch violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of law, does not this tend to encourage the vicious, and pave the way to capital crimes?</p>
               <p>Beſides, are there not ſome who ſit as legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, and ſuſtain the office of magiſtrates, who are notoriouſly vicious in their characters, immoral in their lives, and profane in their
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031657_0020_0FED912C21D9A258"/>
language!—Such characters in office, are a real curſe to community. While they thus tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the laws themſelves, are they not guilty of the moſt ſolemn perjury? And inſtead of being a terror to evil doers, are they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a terror to thoſe who do well?</p>
               <p>While they thus encourage vice by their own example, their conduct tends directly to the ſubverſion of Government, to the corruption of morals, to the deſtruction of happineſs, to infamous deaths, and the ruin of ſouls And were not perſons of this character moſt fearfully hardened, they would bluſh whenever they take the ſeat of judgment, to execute the laws upon others; and like Felix or Belſhazzar, they would tremble at the proſpect of a judgment to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. PUBLIC TEACHERS are another very influential claſs of citizens. If they preach the goſpel of JESUS CHRIST, they inculcate the beſt ſyſtem of morals with which human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety has ever been bleſt—Morals which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the pureſt principles, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the higheſt motives, and which iſſue in the greateſt good. And while Miniſters preach as Chriſt preached, and walk as he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their influence is vaſtly beneficial to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as to the regulation of morals.</p>
               <p>But if a Miniſter preaches <hi>Benevolence</hi> in words, and <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> in deeds; if he preaches that men ſhould be juſt and merciful, while his practice encourages diſhoneſty and incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;—if he preaches that men ſhould be ſober and temperate in all things, and yet devotes himſelf to diſſipation and intemperance; the influence of his example ſo far over balances the

influence of his preaching, that he does much more hurt than good.</p>
               <p>Or if a Public Teacher, under pretence of preaching the goſpel of Chriſt, preaches the goſpel of Satan;—if in oppoſition to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, he makes no difference between the holy and profane, the ſaint and the ſinner, either with reſpect to their characters here, or their rewards hereafter; or if he does not preach that the grace of GOD, which bringeth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, teaches us that, denying all ungodlineſs and every worldly luſt, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world;—but inſtead of this, in his preaching and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, he tolerates thoſe revellings, banquettings, and vain amuſements, which have no reſpect to the glory of GOD, the good of the ſoul, or the benefit of community; it is eaſy to ſee, that while men are lovers of pleaſure more than lovers of GOD, ſuch preaching is calculated to pleaſe the hearts of the vicious, and to ruin their ſouls forever. And it is referred to the judgment of others, whether the corruption of morals is not, in ſome degree, to be attributed to the preaching and practice of ſome, who profeſs to be ambaſſadors for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. PROFESSORS OF RELIGION, are alſo to be conſidered as influential in forming the morals of ſociety. They are for lights in the world, their conduct is particularly noticed, and has great influence upon the minds of ſuch as are converſant with them. When they walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their profeſſion, they hold forth the word of life in their morals; as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and devout in worſhipping God, ſo they love one another with a pure heart ſervently,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031657_0022_0FED9130D172EF28"/>
and walk in wiſdom towards thoſe who are without. Their morals proceed from that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from above; which is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full of mercy and good fruits, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and without hypocriſy. Such morals, every one muſt ſee, can do no injury to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
               <p>But thoſe profeſſors of religion who are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reſpecting the word and worſhip of God; who bite and devour one another; who are fordid and a varicious in their purſuits; kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh in their dealings; implacable and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in their conduct; looſe and profane in their language, do vaſt miſchief in ſociety; for, it is natural for careleſs ſinners to reſpect profeſſors as examples, and to think it lawful for themſelves to be leſs circumſpect than thoſe who profeſs to be followers of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And are there not, at the preſent day, many profeſſors of religion who are ſo looſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in their morals, that they contribute rather to the increaſe of darkneſs than light. Are there not many whoſe morals would be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ever to a heathen? Many who are ſo worldly minded that they regard neither juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice nor mercy in their purſuits? who not only countenance iniquity in others, but even ſet the moſt impious examples themſelves.</p>
               <p>Do not many profeſſors of religion, almoſt forſake the public worſhip, and inſtitutions of God. David could ſay, I was glad when they ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe of the Lord. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord, My ſoul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031657_0023_0FED9133D9122EB0"/>
courts of the Lord: For a day in thy courts is better than a thouſand. I had rather be a door keeper in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>But muſt not many modern profeſſors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion make a great change in this language to repeat it from the heart. Muſt they not ſay I was glad when they ſaid unto me let us go into the houſe of <hi>merriment.</hi> How amiable are thy tabernacles <hi>O Prince of Darkneſs!</hi> My ſoul longeth, yea even ſainteth for the <hi>Ball room,</hi> the <hi>licencious tavern,</hi> or the <hi>chambers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling and wantonneſs;</hi> for a day in ſuch <hi>ſport's</hi> are better than a thouſand:—I had rather be a <hi>door-keeper in theſe tents of wickedneſs,</hi> than to dwell in the <hi>Houſe of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a common obſervation, that actions ſpeak louder than words; and it is ſubmitted to conſcience whether the practice of many profeſſors does not clearly expreſs the ideas which have now been brought into view.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. HEADS OF FAMILIES—Theſe are, in a high degree, influential as to the morals of community. The morals of ſociety depend much on the education of children. For a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule we may ſay as Solomon has ſaid—Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.—But the education of children is under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction of parents. Their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and examples have vaſt influence upon their offspring in forming their habits and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
               <p>If parents were univerſally faithful in the diſcharge of their duty, in giving inſtruction, governing and ſetting good examples, children
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031657_0024_0FED913579FDBFB8"/>
would, in general, ſhun immoral courſes, and grow up for uſefulneſs in the world.</p>
               <p>But if parents are irreligious and immoral; if they neglect to give their children good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ſet evil examples before them, and ſurrender the right of government, or make it ſubordinate to the inclinations of children, young people will imbibe vicious habits, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vicious courſes, and grow up for miſchief and deſtruction. It will perhaps, be ſaid that ſome of the moſt pious and exemplary parents have ſome of the moſt vicious children. This may be admitted, and ſtill it is no objection to what has been advanced; for we do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the children of good people, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally any better than others, and the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of pious parents may be counteracted and ſubverted, by the evil influence of wicked parents. As children are naturally inclined to evil rather than to good, they will moſt naturally be pleaſed with that mode of family govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which lays the leaſt reſtraint upon their vicious inclinations. Hence, if a faithful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent uſes his endeavours to bring up his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the fear of the Lord, and to reſtrain them from vicious courſes; yet if neighboring parents ſet evil examples, and give unbounded liberty to their children, to gratify their fooliſh inclinations, the children of the faithful parent may, by degrees, be drawn away, and be led to think hard of him for laying greater reſtraints than are laid upon other children; and when they have proceeded thus far, they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of proceeding farther, even to deſpiſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental authority, and to ruſh, with a feared conſcience, into vice and miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:031657_0025_0FED913B7B4C7738"/>
And is it not evident that parents, in general, have become too negligent with regard to the morals of their children? And are there not many to be found, who inſtead of training up their children for virtue and uſefulneſs in the world, do, by the neglect of good inſtruction, by ſetting evil examples, and by proſtituting parental affection and authority, train them up as ſervants for the Devil?—Oh! how will ſuch parents endure the ſight of their children at the day of Judgment!</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved that vicious parents counteract the influence of good parents. And we may add, that they alſo counteract the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of good miniſters and good magiſtrates. They teach children to deſpiſe religion, and to deſpiſe government; and vicious miniſters counteract the influence of good magiſtrates, and wicked magiſtrates counteract the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of good miniſters.</p>
               <p>How important is it then, that the ſeveral claſſes which have been named, <hi>Rulers, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> ſhould all unite their efforts and their influence for the ſuppreſſion of vice and the reformation of morals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Let thoſe of us who belong to either of theſe claſſes, duly examine ourſelves, and be ſuitably humbled before the Lord. Probably in a greater or loſs degree, we muſt all plead guilty before the bar of conſcience, as having had ſome ſhare in corrupting the morals of community, and levelling the high way to the gallows: Let us all feel the importance of uniting our influence for the future, in a cauſe of ſuch conſequence to the welfare of ſociety, to the lives, and to the ſouls of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:031657_0026_0FED913D1E73BB08"/>
Let us be deeply affected with the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good examples, and the danger of thoſe which are evil.</p>
               <p>Bad example in community is like the plague in a city, if one is infected, thouſands are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. The contagion may ſpread from man to man, from family to family; from town to town; from ſtate to ſtate; and it may be ſhipped and waſted from land to land.—It may alſo be tranſmitted from one generation to another; ſo that in the courſe of ages and events, the example of one vicious man, may have influence to hurry thouſands up to the gallows, and millions down to Hell. May we all, therefore, in this ſerious moment reſolve, that we will not be the imitators of Jeroboam, the ſon of Nebat, who made Iſrael to ſin.</p>
               <p>As the riſing generation are deeply intereſted in the events of this day, I ſhall cloſe with an addreſs to them.</p>

               <p>HERE you ſee one, in the bloom of youth, to be this day cut off from the land of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the judgment of men, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment of GOD. The courſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he has purſued, has led him into the ſnares of death; ſoon he muſt bid adieu to all earthly objects, and what will become of his precious ſoul is known only to GOD.</p>
               <p>And think ye that this unhappy creature is a ſinner above all the young people in the land, becauſe he ſuffers ſuch things?—I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. You may, perhaps, continue impenitent,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031657_0027_0FED913EC0AFFAC8"/>
and eſcape the county priſon and the gallows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you cannot continue long in impenitency, and finally eſcape the priſon of deſpair.</p>
               <p>This event is a ſolemn call to you, to flee youthful luſts, to ſhun vicious courſes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and make your peace with GOD; and if you make a right improvement of the event, it will be a mean of everlaſting benefit to your ſouls. The death of this criminal <hi>will</hi> have ſome influence on your minds; it will either ſerve to reform or to harden. This is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of God to you this day, both by his word and his providence—Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth. And you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſregard it without greatly endangering your ſouls.</p>
               <p>It is natural for young people to neglect their ſouls, in hopes of a future opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. If you were ſatisfied that this day would be your laſt, probably, you would be filled with great anxiety—but you expect to ſee this priſoner die, and ſtill live yourſelves for many years to come. However, there may be leſs time between the hour of his departure, and yours, than you now imagine. God has many ways to call mankind into eternity; and it is poſſible that the moſt thoughtleſs of you will be called before this criminal.</p>
               <p>But however long you may live, it is not now too early to ſecure an intereſt in Chriſt, and to begin the ſervice of the Lord. To delay repentance is very hazardous, even on ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that your lives ſhould be long continued. For by delay your hearts harden and become more and more oppoſed to repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:031657_0028_0FED91433A0CC760"/>
Think ſeriouſly of the fearful ſtupidity of the thief on the croſs; how far he was from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in his expiring moments; you may flatter yourſelves that you ſhall conduct more wiſely. But what evidence can you have of it, if you are now ſo fooliſh as to refuſe to repent? One delay prepares you for another; and the probability of your ever repenting, grows leſs and leſs every day; and the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of your final hardineſs and remedileſs ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in grows greater and greater.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem hard to you to forſake your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and to devote yourſelves to the ſervice of God in ſo early a period of your lives. But is it not better to do it <hi>now,</hi> than it ſhould <hi>never</hi> be done. Such may be the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD, reſpecting your repentance and ſalvation, that it is with you, <hi>now</hi> or <hi>never.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is probable that you feel pretty confident that you ſhall never arrive to ſuch a pitch of wickedneſs, as to be expoſed to an infamous death. But who can truſt your hearts? If you have hearts to diſobey God now, you have hearts to liſten to the advices of ſatan, and how far you will fellow them, is not for man to tell. Aſk the poor criminal whether two years ago, he had any more expectation of coming to the halter, than you have now. If not, your danger may be greater than ever you yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p>If you wiſh to be ſecured from ſuch crimes as expoſe to ſuch a death, ſhun thoſe paths which lead to ſuch crimes. Give up your hearts and your all to God. This is the way of ſafety, and every other is a way of danger.</p>
               <p>

It is much to be lamented that young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general have become ſo regardleſs of God, of duty and of danger, and ſo devoted to carnal and ſenſitive pleaſures. It affords but a diſmal proſpect with regard to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their living in this world, or their entering into another. For in the time of youth they generally form the characters they ſuſtain through life, and with which they leave the world.</p>
               <p>If you wiſh to be truly uſeful, truly reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and truly happy in this, or a future world, it will be wiſdom in you to devote this early part of life, to forming habits of real excellence. If this courſe ſhould ſtill be neglected by you, the probability is, that you will be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of much ſin and miſchief in this world, and the ſubjects of much wrath and woe in the world to come.</p>
               <p>O think to what eminence ſome have arrived in uſefulneſs and honor in this world, by an early devotion of themſelves to the ſervice of God. Think of Joſeph, of Moſes, David, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah and Daniel. What a ſweet ſavor have they left behind them, and with what honor and reſpect will their names be ſtill handed down to unborn ages.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be the ſtudy of every one to render himſelf ſo uſeful in life, that when he dies, ſociety may feel that they have loſt a valuable character. And thus their memory will be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, while the name of the wicked ſhall rot, or be tranſmitted down to poſterity, loaded with infamy and contempt.</p>
               <p>Your Fathers are dropping away, one after another, and if you live in the world, you muſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031657_0030_0FED9149553D39B0"/>
be their ſucceſſors in the great affairs of church and ſtate. And how intereſting it is that, now in the time of youth, you ſhould lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſerve your generation by the will of God! In order to, this you ſhould devote your time and advantages to the noble purpoſes of ſtoring your heads with knowledge, and your hearts with the habits of piety and virtue. In ſo doing you will be prepared for an early death, or a uſeful life, and a bleſſed eternity.</p>
               <p>This ſolemn ſcene may well excite your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to one, which is faſt approaching, that is infinitely more ſolemn, the <hi>Judgment of the Great Day.</hi> When the deſpiſed Redeemer ſhall deſcend from Heaven, and appears not as an infamous malefactor, but, arrayed in all the majeſty and ſplendor of God. When all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be ſummoned before his bar, have all their works diſplayed to public view, and every individual receive a ſentence which will fix his ſoul in endleſs joy, or endleſs woe. To this ſolemn ſcene you are all haſtening with every breath you draw.</p>
               <p>Are you not then, now ſolemnly called to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflections, to ſerious reſolutions, and to a ſerious deportment. Let me entreat you, in the moſt affectionate manner, to forbear, on this occaſion, every appearance of lightneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency, and to behave as becomes thoſe who expect to ſtand at the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt. If you ſhould devote this day to ſport and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, you will greatly expoſe yourſelves to the diſpleaſure of Heaven;—give ſatan a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt you, and vaſtly encreaſe tho probability that you will finally <hi>die</hi> in your ſins. To day then if you will hear the voice of God harden not your hearts; left he ſwear in his wrath that you ſhall never enter the manſions of reſt.</p>
