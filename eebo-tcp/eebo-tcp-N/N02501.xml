            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is not one Truth in the Scriptures more ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both in the Old &amp; New Testament; than this of the last Judgment, as a Doctrine that above all others, is most effectual to awaken Men out of their deep Security, to work mens Hearts to a reverent Fear and Awe, of that Majesty, before whom they must one Day appear to give up their last Account. See the Effects of this in <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>knowing the Terror of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>11.

                  <p>Oh, how should the consideration of this, cause every Man to sit and prepare himself for this Judgment, that he may be able to stand bfore the Son of Man.</p>

And therefore it is good that we make our Calling and Election sure and labour with the Apostle to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling, and not to lie in Security, which is the first hindrance, in that we do not meditate on the Day of Death <hi>For after Death there is no Repentance</hi>; let us not think that God hath leaden Feet, because he is slow in coming, left when he cometh, <hi>we</hi>

breaking his Commandments, and in pelleting his Sabbaths; which will make our Reckoning greater at his second coming, which will be to Judgment. Therefore let every one who reads these Words, have a Care to do well, and cease to be what they have been, and deny &amp; go out of our selves, that we may entertain this new Man Christ Jesus, and say with holy <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 51.10 <hi>Create in me, O God, a clean, Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me,</hi> so that they may appear blamless and spotless before him ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been cloathed with Robes of Christ's Righteousness, God doth not delight in the Death of any Sinner.

endless Power and Glory, of such wonderful Might and Majesty, this must humble all men, when they come to stand in the Presence of so great a Person, as we do when <hi>we</hi> come to hear the Word preached and taught, to receive the holy Sacrament. For when the Word is preached God speaks to us, &amp; <hi>when</hi> we pray we speak to God, and how dare <hi>we</hi> then be so bold to sleep in his Presence, talk, or use any unreverent Gesture? If we were to come into the Presence of an Earthly Prince how careful and circumspect would <hi>we</hi> behave our selves, to do nothing unbeseeming the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of so great a Person? This is the great care of Men, <hi>when</hi> they come into the Presence of an Earthly Judge, to put off their Hats, and to shew all Tokens of Reverence, &amp; it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see how unreverently Men and Women come into the Presence of the ever-living and most high God, into the Presence of the Great Judge of Heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. When we come to pray, or sing Psalms unto God, how unreverent are some, <hi>would</hi> any man be so in the Sight of an Earthly Judge, or a Mortal Prince?

Well, both great and small must appear, none shall be so young or so little, but they must stand before God, &amp; none so great of so strong, but they must appear likewise.</p>

                  <p>None <hi>shall</hi> be wanting, the rich and needy, Young and Old, High and Low, Bond &amp; Free, all must stand before God.

And as St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith when he thought of God's Attributes, <hi>O Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, O Eternity, O Eternity, in repeating the word so often, he thought to have dwelt upon the word</hi>; for indeed Eternity hath no end, &amp; all things else have an end, and all must appear before this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting God at this General Assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, Because seeing the Angels <hi>shall</hi> be sent to gather together all the Elect from the four winds, from the one end of the Heavens to the other; it is most probable that the place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they <hi>shall</hi> be gathered, is to be near to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Judgment, and what a lamentable thing will that be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As our Consciences is privy unto all our thoughts, and will accuse us of them at the day of Judgment: So all our speeches are noted within. What a number of prophane speeches pass out of the mouth of wicked and ungodly men and women? What horrible and blaspemous Oaths? What cursed speaking ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and slandring? Now a wicked Person that thus abuseth his tongue so many several times in one day, he cannot for his life remember them. Well, know, that every sinful word thou speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, <hi>is written in this Book,</hi> there it is recorded; and when this Book of thy Conscience shall be opened, it will discover all thy Sins, not only thy filthy Thoughts, but every wicked Word.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour tells us, Mat. 12 35. <hi>That we must give an account of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>lle word at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: And tho' Men labour to forget them, &amp; slight them by Pastimes and Company, yet they are written in their Consciences, and one day must come to Judgment. Know this I intreat you, that we must all have a Resurrection, and then give an Account of all our Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have been good or bad; the number is here set down in the word, <hi>all,</hi> as in 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>All must appear,</hi> all must arise and give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to this Judge. Nor must we imagine that we shall be called one by one, like a Jury impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell'd, or like a Company, or Corporation, as first one, and then another, no, it is said all must arise together, and give an Account how we have bestow'd our Talents.</p>
                  <p>If so, how then should this awaken us ail, and cause us to look unto our Lives, and to learn to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002963_0028_0FE6A92C0540FC68"/>
know of what we are made, and to make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with our Eyes, at <hi>Job</hi> did; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with him, 'tho' we be now rich and strong, as <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>that Corruption is our Father, and to the Worm thou art our Mother, and our Sister, and to set a Watch before our Mouths,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did; and to lay aside our vain Oaths and idle Mirth, <hi>which</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>cannot want Iniquity,</hi> seeing, all of them must come to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If we view the lives of Men &amp; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, why? (alas) they be nothing almost but a continual Practice of Sin, &amp; the Sins of Mens Lives be innumerable, even as the Sand on the Sea-shore. Now tho' Mens Lives abound with so many thousand Sins, yet we see that Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not, nor knows one quarter of his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is no Sin so secret, that God will not bring to light, yea, all our sins <hi>shall</hi> be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laid naked before them, <hi>what hath been done in secret sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Men. But that we may have a good Cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, we must,</p>
                  <p>First, Repent of all our sins; we must know by the Law of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> what is sin, &amp; what is not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly We must know the heavy curse of God even for sin, that the reward of sin <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>is</hi> death eternal, both of body and soul, for men do by Nature sooth themselves in their sins, and tho' we hear of God's Judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin, (yet whose heart is touched or troubled?) Thus we run on still in sin, and fear nothing; they mean well they say, but live ill, and think all well.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Till we see what sin is, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> see the curse of God due to sin, we <hi>shall</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seriously try our Consciences, &amp; see how our sins have wounded them, that so we may repent us of sin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We must be grieved for our sins, we must acknowledge and confess them, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for the pardon of them; <hi>and to hunger and thirst after Christ Jesus.</hi> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can purify the Conscience, &amp; quiet the heart, but only the blood of Jesus Christ applied to our Souls by Faith, with perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the forgiveness of them.</p>
                  <p>Mark then here (beloved) when a man is thus truly humbled for his sins, and beggeth the pardon of them with sighs and groans, then will the Lord send down into his Soul <hi>his blessed Spirit, to assure us of God's mercy, of the pardon of our sins, that our wounds in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are healed: And this is done by the means of a lively Faith, which purifies the Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby we may perceive that most men &amp;c. women are in a woful case; for (alas) the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002963_0031_0FE6A938C19117B0"/>
greatest part are ignorant of the Law of God, and know not what sin is, and what is not sin, and therefore cannot possibly have a clear Conscience; <hi>for Whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, tho' men see their sins, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Consciences check them for sin, yet how few do bewail their sins? For I am perswaded, that there is not so wicked a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner living, but sometimes his Conscience checks him: Indeed Men see not the danger, and feel not he wounds of the Conscience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause now their Books be clasped, they be shut up, their feared Consciences be now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; but the day will come that their Books must be opened, and their secrets declared, &amp; than their Consciences will accuse, condemn and torment them so, that they will wish they had never been born.</p>
                  <p>Again, When a Man or Woman hath got a good Conscience, so as being truly humbled for their sins, and begging pardon, they find some assurance of God's love in Christ, and that now their Consciences do not accuse 'em; even then must men take no less pains to keep and preserve a good Conscience, to do nothing to wound their Conscience, <hi>O Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, a wounded Conscience who can bear?</hi> A man's Conscience is a very tender thing, it is li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> a tender thing if ye prick it by sin, it will blemish thy Conscience, wound it, and make havock of thy Soul. And therefore saith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Counterguard thy heart, and watch over thy soul,</hi> Prov. 4 6. That thou do nothing that may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> try Conscience.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:002963_0031_0FE6A938C19117B0"/>
                  <head>Meant to preserve a good Conscience.</head>
                  <p>Now that we may keep these Books of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (our Conscience) pure and good, we must do two things. First, avoid all things that may any way hurt a good Conscience. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Use all good means and helps to cherish a good Conscience. In truth all sin hinders a good Conscience. Sin is that which does wound the Soul, maketh Shipwreck of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that is the very overthrow of mens Souls. And therefore if you would keep a clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, take heed of sin, which wounds a good Conscience, <hi>and makes it unable to stand before God at the last day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there be two special lets &amp; impediments of a good Conscience: First, Ignorance of the Law, and of the Word of God: For when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> man knows not what is sin, and what not, how can he take heed left he wound his own Soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> And therefore we see, let a man come into his House at midnight, he can find nothing amiss and out of order; but let a man come in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then the other impediment of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, is worldly lust; namely, the love and exceeding desire of Riches, Honours, Pleasures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he that suffers these desires to rule too much in his Heart, cannot possibly keep a good Conscience.</p>

For Faith is the root and foundation of a good Conscience. And without Faith there can be no good Conscience. Now to preserve Faith, we must often hear &amp; read in the Word of God, repent of our sins; acknowledge and confess them, and be humbled for them, and walk in the Path of Faith and Repentance, and in so doing we shall find more and more the Comforts of a good Conscience. And therefore we must take heed that we do nothing to break off the feeling of God's love, for to wound our poor Consciences.</p>

To be the Son of a rich man, a Gentleman or Nobleman? To have Gold and Silver, Lands and Livings? This makes Men so Lofty and prodigal, that they forget God and a good Conscience, <hi>which</hi> must stand them in great stead at the End of their Life: <hi>But who is he that rejoyceth in this, that he is the Son of God, and that his Name is written in the Book of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, having thus observed from the Word of God, <hi>what</hi> is understood by the Book of Life, namely, the eternal decrees of God's Election: hence ariseth two weighty points to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. First, <hi>If it be possible for a Child of God to know whether his Name be written in the Book of Life or no?</hi> Secondly <hi>If it be possible, then by what means we may attain this knowledge, to be assured that our Names be in Heaven, that we are in the number of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>se that shall be saved.</hi> And these are <hi>two</hi> most necessary points to be known of all good Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the first, <hi>If it be possible for a Child of God to know whether his name is written in the Book of Life or not?</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds that no man can certainly know <hi>whether</hi> he be a true Child of God, or no. Nay, they condemn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>is as a fault, and bold presumption for a man to be certainly persuades of this, that he is a Child of God, Elected in Christ Jesus, and that his name is <hi>written</hi> in the Book of Life. They say, <hi>we are to hope well,</hi> But (alas) shall <hi>we</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:002963_0034_0FE6A93A169AE168"/>
the Salvation of our Souls upon an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope? No, we must go further, and labour to be assured, and certainly persuaded of this hope that our names are Written in the Book of Life.</p>
                  <p>And that a true Christian Man or Woman, may assuredly be persuaded, and certainly know that he is a Child of God, it is out of question, if he <hi>will</hi> believe the Holy Ghost; else <hi>why</hi> should St. <hi>Peter exhort us to give diligence to make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election sure.</hi> And why did our Saviour bid his Disciples, <hi>Rejoyce that their Names were written in the Book of Life,</hi> if they could not <hi>know</hi> it? Again, every Article of our Christian Faith confirms the truth of this Doctrine, <hi>where we</hi> are taught to believe the Catholick Church, &amp; that <hi>we</hi> are the number of Gods People: We believe the pardon of our sins, and that we shall have Life Everlasting.</p>
                  <p>By this you see <hi>how</hi> little we are beholden to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who holds that <hi>we</hi> cannot be certainly persuaded of our Salvation, but must only hope well. Did not <hi>Job</hi> know it? <hi>Iob</hi> 19.25. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> before know it? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. Then let no man doubt of this, that the Children of God may, and do <hi>know</hi> that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>y shall be saved. And therefore let us believe this doctrine, and embrace it? And withal let us abhor the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For <hi>what</hi> comfort can any Christian have, till he knows that he is a Child of God? How can we be at peace with our souls? With <hi>what</hi> comfort can we perform obedience unto God, except w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> find this blessed persuasion, that our names are
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002963_0035_0FE6A949088F21B0"/>
in this Book, and that we are the elect, and chosen of God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Now the next question is, <hi>How a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> man or woman may come to this certain knowledge, that his Name is written in this Book, and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> may confidemtly be persuaded that he is a Child of God, or no?</hi> And this is a matter of no small moment; but a thing that concerns our Souls very nearly, and therefore let us be very careful to listen unto it, that we be able to prove our selves, <hi>whether we are in the Faith or no,</hi> whether <hi>we</hi> be the Sons of God or no; and so <hi>whether we</hi> shall be saved or not. Oh it is a matter of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less comfort to Gods Children when they know this, <hi>that they are the Children of God, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life belongs unto them, it will stir them up to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now there are two ways to know it: One is by ascending up to heaven into the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this way no man dares assay.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, there is yet another <hi>way</hi> to <hi>know</hi> this, and that is by descending and looking in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>So then the first fruit of our Election is our <hi>Effectual Calling:</hi> When God doth by his Spirit, and the preaching of the Gospel, call us out of the World from our old sins, to be of the number of his People, to live as his Children: As he call'd <hi>Samuel</hi> three times, so <hi>Samuel</hi> answered and left his bed: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> when he went to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Children of God at <hi>Damascus</hi>; and so he did <hi>Matthew</hi> from the receipt of Custom. So he called <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> from fishing, and made them to be fishers of men.

                  </p>

He which findeth the effectual calling in him, may assure his soul, that he is predestinated to eternal life. But we must take heed that we deceive not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with an outward calling: For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour saith, <hi>Many are called, but few are chosen.</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:002963_0037_0FE6A94A55A01E18"/>
Many hear the Word of God with the ear, but we must labour to find <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> to preach unto our souls, to apply the Word of God unto our <hi>Consciences,</hi> to believe in it, &amp; to obey it, this is that which is found in every Christian, and that which assures him of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life and Salvation, and therefore they which live in their old sin, are as blind, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and prophane as ever; (alas) how can they think to be saved, seeing God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth none, or saves not any but whom he calls effectually by the Gospel, and severs from the rest of the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The fruit of Election is Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>For whom he predestinated, them he called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For before a man can be justified, he must <hi>repent of his sins,</hi> know them, <hi>hate and abhor them,</hi> and beg the pardon of them, &amp; then <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> will assure us of the pardon of them. And therefore if <hi>we</hi> would know whether we be jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified or no, we must look whether we have truly repented; yea, &amp; have been truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our sins, and got the pardon of them all. Secondly, that we may be truly justified, we must have a true faith in Christ Jesus, to lay hold upon him, and to wrestle with him, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did with the Angel, and not let him go, till he gives us a blessing, to be persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002963_0038_0FE6A94A703994C0"/>
and assured in our souls, that Christ died for us, shed his blood for us, obeyed the law for us, and will cover all our sins and trespasses in his Righteousness, so then, mark the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; where there is repentance and obedience, there is remission of sins, where there is remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, there is Justification; and where there is Justification, there is Salvation. And this we must acknowledge not to have by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which is wrought in us by Jesus Christ, being the Author and Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher of our Faith and Salvation; and we must always confess that all the benefits and means of our Salvation we have received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>hether he is Elected</hi> and ordained to Life, or not. Now let us see what Use ariseth hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Seeing God hath this Book of Life, in which is Written the names of all those that shall be saved, and none of them shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. Hence proceeds endless comfort to all Gods Children; if thou find that thou art a Child of God, and thy name is written in Heaven, nothing can hurt thee though thou be poor with <hi>Job,</hi> sick with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in Prison with <hi>Joseph,</hi> haled to death with thy Saviour Christ, yet nothing can hurt thee; Nay the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against thee; no damnation can come to thee; <hi>For if God justify, who can condemn</hi>? For at the day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>udgment, Christ Jesus will take his Book of Life, and call us, saying, <hi>Come ye blessed, &amp;c.</hi> So that we shall not come to a terrible Judge, but a loving Saviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Secondly, Seeing it is so excellent a thing to have our Names Written in this Book, to be the <hi>Elect Children of God</hi>; we should labour for this above all things in the World, for without this we can have no found Comfort, either in this Life or death. And therefore our blessed Saviour bids us in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <div type="part">
                  <head>This shews the necessity of Christian Obedience.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, Seeing God hath a Book of Life and hath written down the very names of every man and woman that shall be saved, and hath withal shewed us the way that leads to Life, and unless we walk in this way, we cannot come unto it; it is our wisest course for to walk in the way, that leads to Life, in the practice of Godliness. We are <hi>Vessels of Honour,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must live <hi>Soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World</hi> Not serve Sin and Satan any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but labour to die to sin, before we die so nature, &amp; bury sin, before it buries us; for the issues of sin brings nothing but vexation and shame in this Life, and perdition in the Life to come. Oh let us then as the redeemed of the Lord, walk from strength to strength, from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to vertue, from one degree of perfection to another, till at length we appear perfect Men and Women before the Lord, and there reap the happy reward, even the fruition of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that for evermore.</p>

               <p>COncerning the Book of Life, you have heard already, what is meant by it; namely, the Counsel and decree of God's Election, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> he hath chosen Men and Women out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, We have learned that a Man may, nay, every Christian Man and Woman ought to be assured that his <hi>Name is written in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We set down some marks out of the Scriptures, whereby a Christian may be assured he is Elected; namely,</p>
               <p>First, the Testimony of God's Spirit, which cannot lie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the fruits and <hi>effect</hi> of Election, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And without it we can have no <hi>true Joy</hi> to our Souls. Surely mens carelesness in this point is great.

                  <p>Now St. <hi>John</hi> proceedeth in the description of this last <hi>Judgment,</hi> as it was declared unto him in a <hi>Vision</hi>; in an <hi>Island.</hi> It was necessary to have it there, it being private and free from Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, his Soul might the better be fitted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation to receive the power of God: For when humane help is farthest o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>But St. <hi>John</hi> saith, that it shall not be so here, for all must proceed according to the written Records, <hi>And according to those things which are written in the Book.</hi> So that when Christ Jesus the great Judge shall once sit upon the Throne of his Glory, attended by his holy Angels, then

                  <p>In these words we are to observe three speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al points.</p>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, God would have us certain of the Time.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The means whereby they must be tryed; even by those things which are written and Recorded in their Books which is their Consciences.</p>

                     </gap>st of the Persons.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be doubted, but that St. <hi>John</hi> meaneth that <hi>all</hi> must come to Judgment; <hi>Both great and small must stand before God.</hi> But why doth he say here, <hi>And the dead shall be judged!</hi> It is to be observed, that he names expresly the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002963_0041_0FE6A958B563C538"/>
dead, even those that have lain rotten many thousand years, must come to Judgment they must be called to account, their old sins must now be brought to light; for these are the Wicked Thoughts of many carnal men, that when a man is dead, he is well! Then all his sins die with him, he is forgotten, and his sins are not spoken of. But St. <hi>John</hi> saith here, <hi>that even the dead must come to Iudgment, even their old sins must come to light, and they must answer for 'em.</hi> It is perhaps Six Thousand Years since <hi>Cain</hi> flew his Brother, yet his sin shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; tho' <hi>Cain</hi> be dead long since, yet his sins are not dead; No, no, <hi>Cain</hi> shall one day come to account for his sin. <hi>Iudas</hi> who betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Master many hundred years ago, at this day shall be called to account.</p>

But St. <hi>John</hi> saith here, <hi>That the dead were judged,</hi> even those whom we forget, and whose sins we would think would never be called to an account, even they must come to a reckoning: <hi>For God will bring every work to Iudgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi> Eccl. 12.14. Which will be terror to the Wicked: But the Saints of God are not afraid of the Tribunal, or Judgment Seat; but in the quiet of a good Conscience they comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Jesus Christ.

                  <p>In the next place St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, how men shall be tryed, and according to what evidence, Sentence shall be awarded; namely, according to those things written in their Books.

While we lived, we sowed our words and idle thoughts, as a Husbandman doth his seed, <hi>which</hi> will one day rise up again, which we long ago tho't had been forgotten &amp; intombed. Mans Conscience is Gods Register, as one day will appear plainly and evidently to our sorrow, <hi>we</hi> shall hear again of every light transgression, and idle word that we do but whisper against our neighbour; and by this sentence must proceed, and according to our deserts, must Judgment be awarded.</p>
                  <p>Now then, those <hi>which</hi> have good and holy thoughts <hi>written</hi> in their Book, they are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and happy, for they shall not be ashamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray, they shall be glad to have their Books laid open, that their <hi>Obedience, Repentance, Faith, Love, Zeal, Patience,</hi> &amp;c. may be known and come to light: But woe then to all filthy Adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the reward of these sins is death, the wrath and curse of God for ever.</p>

                  <p>Neither let us content our selves to think, <hi>we</hi> are in a good case, if <hi>we</hi> can say, like the proud Pharisee, (which justified himself before God &amp; Man) <hi>I am no Drunkard, nor Formcator, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner,</hi> &amp;c. No, let us look to our own Book, that there be not so much as an idle word written there, that hath not been blotted out with the tears of true Repentance, for even they must come to Judgment, as our Saviour saith, <hi>for I say unto you, that every idle word that Men shall speak, they foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour teacheth us, that a cup of cold water should not go unrewarded with him at the last: And of <hi>Cornelius</hi> it is said, <hi>that his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and aims are come up for a memorial before God.</hi> And to this agreeth, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews, God is not unrighteous to forget your works and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love,</hi> &amp;c. And as the Godly <hi>shall</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to their works: So likewise in regard of the Wicked. <hi>These things hast thou done,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>I was hungry, and ye fed me not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. Well, what should this teach us, seeing <hi>we</hi> must <hi>all</hi> receive sentence, according to our Works? Surely it ought to move us <hi>above all</hi> things in the World, to labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in <hi>all</hi> holy Duties and Graces of God's Spirit, in Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Love, Zeal, Cloathing, Feeding, &amp; Lodging the poor Members of Christ; for according to our <hi>works,</hi> so <hi>shall</hi> our reward be: And though our Works can merit nothing at the hands of the Judge, yet he being a most bountiful and merciful Saviour, <hi>will</hi> crown his own Works in us, and reward them in his mercy, though <hi>we</hi> merit nothing. Dost thou relieve a poor Member of Jesus Christ? or dost thou give a Cup of cold Water to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.

                  </p>
                  <p>Oh how should this persuade <hi>all</hi> to labour to abound in <hi>all</hi> holy duties, to be liberal &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful

But you will say, are not mens Bodies eaten of Fishes, and Men eat them again? How is it possible to raise the Bodies of these men thus consumed to dust, and mingled with the bodies of several Fishes, and of divers sorts of Beasts.</p>
                  <p>I Answer, that tho' it be impossible to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men, yet it is not impossible to God; For he that created all our Bodies of nothing can make them again with something, namely, of their own matter, and sever their Bodies from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Substances. The Atheist denies the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, which we will confute by the Scriptures, &amp; the Resurrection of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And since Christ gave life to himself when dead and in the Grave: How much more now being alive, &amp; in Heaven Glorified, is he able to raise his members from Death to Life, and to raise up those that are dead in sin, by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto newness of Life?

confidently. Christ's death was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our sins, but his Resurrection <hi>was</hi> to obtain Righteousness for us, the Holy Ghost, and Everlasting Life and Glory.</p>
                  <p>First, He rose for our Justification.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For our Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For our Resurrection to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory.</p>
                  <p>All the benefits of Christ's Death, are the fruits which we receive by his Resurrection; by Christ's Resurrection he applies the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to us which he merited for us of his own free love.</p>
                  <p>The Fruits of Christ's Resurrection are, First, we are confirmed, that by his merit he hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>First, Because Christ is our Head, and we his Members.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He hath taken away sin the cause of Death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He received Life for us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We have the <hi>same Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, By the Man Christ, came the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly and lastly, The Fruit of Christ's <hi>Resurrection,</hi> is the consummation of all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:002963_0053_0FE6A98970E716B8"/>
and the glorification of his Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and therefore with <hi>Paul,</hi> let us believe in the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, who rose the third day from the dead; to make us partakers of his Righteousness, Sanctification and Glorification, purchased by his Merits only. John 16 <hi>These things have I spoken</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>unto you, that in me you might have peace, in the world ye shall have tribulation: But be of good chear, I have overcome the World:</hi> And St <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom</hi> 14.9. <hi>To this end Christ both died and rose again, and revived that he might be Lord both of the living and the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then this place proves and confirms that Article of our Faith, that we believe the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the Dead. For tho' a man die by Sea or Land, in his Bed, or in the Field, St. <hi>John</hi> saith, The Sea <hi>shall</hi> give up all that have been drowned, Death and Hell, that is the Grave <hi>shall</hi> deliver the dead in them, so as all must come to Judgment, of what Death soever they die. O then, see (Beloved) how the Devil be witcheth many a poor ignorant soul, When he is in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, distress and calamity, or in a deep melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, the Devil perswadeth him to become his own Executioner, to end his misery and shame, by hanging himself, cutting his <hi>own</hi> Throat, drowning himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>we know</hi> and hear, that he prevaileth much in these days: Some being in disgrace, as <hi>Nebuchadnezza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now they foolishly think by this means to end their grief. When alas, alas, they do but hasten their <hi>own destruction,</hi> as if a man should (to avoid a

little smoak) cast himself into a flaming fire. So they to avoid this little grief of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, plunge both Body and Soul into Eternal Torments: For <hi>what</hi> case is it for any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy themselves, seeing they must come to Judgment: Tho' they kill or drown themselves, <hi>The Water and Grave must one day give up their dead.</hi> From hence let us learn, to arm our selves if Satan should tempt us to such horrible facts, to cast away our selves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us <hi>answer</hi> him, we may not cast away that which Christ hath bought with his own Blood; nay, let us answer him, that we shall not thereby end our misery, but increase it.</p>
                  <p>Now if you demand, by what means the dead <hi>shall</hi> then arise at the last day; I answer. It is by the mighty power of the Voice of Christ, <hi>The hour shall come,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>in which all that are in the Grave shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and come forth.</hi> And to shew the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power of the voice of Christ. It is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the sound of a Trumpet, the loudest and shrillest of all Instruments, Thes. 1.25. <hi>For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch Angel, and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</hi> Such shall be the power and force of this Voice of the Lord Jesus, that it shall be heard over the whole World. Nay, though men have lain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand Years rotten in the Grave, yet they <hi>shall</hi> hear it. and come forth to Judgment. Nay the Devils &amp; damned Spirits shall be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear at his Voice. No Prince, nor Monarch, no King, nor Noble-man shall be able to absent himself from Gods Presence, nor once dare to plead in our Cause, but they must be
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:002963_0054_0FE6A989906CD580"/>
forced to obey the Voice of the Son of God, and come to Judgment. Christ was a Lamb at his Passion, and some shall find him a Lion at his <hi>Resurrection</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing then we must all hear the Voice of the Lord Jesus at the day of Judgment, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If we do not leave sin, hear our Saviour Jesus Christ speaking unto us in his Word, and embrace his Truth; Then let us know, that we shall one day hear another voice; when we shall be compelled to come before him to condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in all afflictions and miseries what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, and especially in diseases and death, we must strengthen our selves in the future Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, remembring that of the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21 <hi>Our conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according the working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Every Christian. as in the eleventh Article of our Creed, doth believe the <hi>Resurrection of the body.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.10.21. saith, <hi>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

is impossible.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> satisfieth this scruple abundantly and sufficiently, which is able to stop the mouth of all Atheists whatsoever: <hi>O thou Fool,</hi> (saith he) <hi>that which thou sowest is not quickned, except it die, and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bear grain, as it were wheat or some other grain; but God giveth it a body, as it pleaseth him; and to every seed his own body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' it pleaseth God not to let thee know the time of the Resurrection, to himself only known; yet the manner hath he left to be shewed by the Apostles, and they have record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for us, as in 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16. <hi>For the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch Angels, and with the Trump of God, the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we for ever be with the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This hope of the Resurrection hath ever been the greatest consolation to the godly in their afflictions, whence <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith. <hi>That the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Christian is in the Resurrection from the dead.</hi> An example hereof is in <hi>Job,</hi> in the midst of his affliction, he said, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth, and tho' after my skin worms destroy my body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.</hi> What can be more manifest? No man (after Christ, than he before Christ's appearance in the flesh) could speak more plainly and certainly of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, from the confidence of our Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we contemn things present, in hope of the future, for all flesh shall see the Salvation of God.</p>

                  <p>True it is, that our Saviour wept for <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and the Disciples made great lamentation for <hi>Stephen</hi>: And so we have great cause to mourn and weep when Holy Men are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; we ought not to be as stocks and stones, or senseless Creatures, without affection.

                  <p>Where the Holy Ghost tells us, that the dead in Christ do not die <hi>properly,</hi> but lay them down to take a sweet sleep, after their long and tedious labours and troubles in this World, and afterwards they must rise again to Life, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Liberty, Glory, and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore then should we mourn excessively, and weep &amp; lament at the death of our Friends,

seeing they do not perish, they are not cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Oh no, their Souls are presently in joy; and their wearied Bodies are at rest in the Grave as in a Bed of Down, until the day of Judgment, and then they shall rise to Glory. And whether this separation of our Souls from our Bodies, shall be by voice, or a secret guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness of our own Consciences: It is all one, for all must rise &amp; come to Judgment. The Angels they shall obey his Voice, they shall be his reapers at this great Day of Harvest, and they shall make a separation at his Word; for by the Power and Omnipotency of Christ shall this separation be. Wherefore let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to die to sin, before we die to nature; &amp; let us strive to bury it, before it bury us; for sin brings only guilt and shame in this Life, and utter perdition in the Life to come.

               <p>IN handling this weighty point of Religion, the (second coming of Christ to Judgment,) I have shewed you from the mouth of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> First, what manner of Person the Judge <hi>shall</hi> be, and how he shall come: namely, like a mighty Prince, with great Power, Majesty and Glory, with an innumerable company of Arch Angels and Angels, with all the Host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; there is the number of them that shall appear at the last day, <hi>even all,</hi> and leave Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven empty, as it were, of Angels; for at this Sentence the whole Trinity will be present, so that there will be no need of Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to do any office to wait upon God, or on the Holy Ghost, while this Sentence is passing, unto the great comfort of his poor Members, and to the terror and amazement of all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:002963_0058_0FE6A996290674E8"/>Secondly, You have heard who <hi>shall</hi> be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Both great and small.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The manner how Judgment shall proceed. Namely, By the written Records, which are the Books of Mens Consciences,</p>
               <p>And now in the last place we come to the execution of Judgment upon wicked Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and ungodly in these two last Verses: For when Judgment is pronounced according to their works, when Christ Jesus, which is the second Person in the Sacred Trinity, shall say unto them, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into Hell-fire, there to remain for ever with the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c. Then immediately the execution of this Sentence shall follow; for saith St. <hi>John, Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of fire; that is the second Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, We are to enquire and seek the true meaning of the Text, because every word may move a Question. For,</p>
               <p>Quest 1. <hi>What is Death, that he should be cast into Hell-fire?</hi> Is Death any Creature? Is Death subject unto pain and torments? Surely, no, Death is no body, it hath no sense nor feeling; Death is no Creature, but only the deprivation of Life. Again, What a strange speech is this, <hi>that Death</hi> shall be cast into Hell: How can this be?</p>
               <p>Quest: 2. Secondly, <hi>What is meant by the Lake of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>?</hi> Is Hell a Water, or a Fire like unto our F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e?</p>
               <p>Quest. 3. And lastly, <hi>We are to consider, What is meant by the Second Death, into which all Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates must be cast without Recovery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First Here by Death and Hell, is meant not Death it self, nor Hell it self, but the Heirs of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:002963_0059_0FE6A9A10E952780"/>
Death and Hell, that is <hi>all the Reprobates</hi> that shall be cast into <hi>Hell</hi> fire, and there abide for evermore. Thus you see what is here meant by Death and <hi>Hell</hi>; namely, the Heirs of <hi>Death</hi> and fire brands of <hi>Hell,</hi> all Reprobates, all s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use</hi> 1. Seeing the Holy Ghost gives these Titles and Names unto all wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly sinners, even <hi>Death</hi> &amp; <hi>Hell</hi>: This shews the wonderful misery, and cursed Estate of all those that live and die in their sins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance. Alas! It is so woful and damnable, that they are even called Death &amp; Hell it self.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>This shews the misery of those that die in their sins.</head>
                  <p>Oh then, let all sinners that live and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in sin, take heed to themselves. You see the woful misery of all impenitent sinners, namely, that they are no better than Vessels of Wrath, the Heirs of Eternal Death, and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of <hi>Hell</hi> for evermore. Oh that all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would forethink of this woful misery that hangs over their sinful heads. What a strange kind of speech is this, &amp; of what force? When God called such Reprobates, even Death and <hi>Hell</hi> it self. Ah poor Wretches! Ah miserable and woful Creatures, which are but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

nor the woful estate wherein they live, but chear themselves in their sinful ways, yet they are no better than the heirs of vengeance and Wrath of God, nay indeed very Death &amp; Hell it self; and one day the Vials of Gods Wrath will be poured upon them.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that Wicked men do as the people did in <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s time, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.21. Tho' they lived in horrible sin, yet they made a League with Death, and were at an Agreement with the Grave; they had taken a Lease of Death and Hell; as the Rich Man, which said to his Soul, <hi>Soul take thine ease, for thou hast Goods and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es laid up for many years,</hi> and so live in sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of punishment: But the Lord tells 'em, he will break the Covenant. and disanul their Agreement. And although they have lived a long time in sin, yet in the end Death <hi>will</hi> knock at their Doors, and then seize them, and they must pay dear for their long Lease, even the loss of Body and Soul for ever.</p>
                  <p>And is not this the daily practice of most men &amp; women at this day? Do they not make a Covenant with Death, and labour to be at an Agreement with Hell? Men live in Swearing, Lying, Drunkenness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they thought they should never die, they imagine they shall escape for all their sins. But (poor Souls) let them know, that Death and Hell will seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Nay, if they live and die in their sins without repentance, let them know that they are no better than <hi>Death and Hell it self, and they must be cast into the Lake of Fire.</hi>

Yet these are nothing in comparison of those most extream and endless torments in this Lake of Fire, when both Body and Soul shall burn and broyl, and as it were fry, yet never be consumed in those scorching flames which cannot be quenched. Most men are afraid to commit Treason, because Traytors are so grievously punished; they are drawn, hanged and quartered; but alas, Men are not afraid to commit Treason against the King of Heaven, though they must be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Lake of Fire for evermore.

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet we see that men and women are more afraid to offend Man than God, <hi>That can cast both body and soul into Hell fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we should see a Child fall into the fire, and hear it cry pitifully, and the very bowels should be burnt out, how would it grieve us, &amp; make our hearts bleed within us? How much more then should it grieve us to see, not a Child, but even our own Bodies and Souls cast away for ever by sin, <hi>into the lake of fire that cannot be quenched</hi>? If a man should come amongst us, &amp; cry Fire, Fire, thy House is all of a flaming Fire, thy Corn and thy Cattle, thy Wife and thy Children, and all thou hast, are consumed by fire; how would this astonish us!

                  <p>I wil leave the further handling of this point, until I come unto the next verse, where the Holy Ghost again, the better to make it sink into our hard hearts, <hi>That whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, shall be cast into the Lake of Fire.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The First Death is the separation of the Soul from the Body, and that is common to all; the Children of God die this Death as well as the wicked; yet there is some difference; for Death is no curse to the Children of God, because Christ's Death hath taken away the sting of Death; it can neither dismay nor hurt them, no, it is but as a door for our Souls to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: But the second they never taste of; no Child of God needs to fear the second Death, Rom. 8 1. <hi>For there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</hi> Now as the First Death is only a separation of the Soul from the Body, so the Second Death is a total and final separation both of Soul &amp; Body from God for ever; and this second Death stands principally in these three points.</p>
                  <p>First, That all wicked and ungodly sinners, that live and die in their sins, <hi>shall be punished with everlasting destruction, being severed from the blessed Presence of the Lord for ever, and from the glory of his Power,</hi> 2 Thes. 1 9 Oh what a woful death is this, to be deprived of the blessed and comfortable Presence of God! <hi>Wherein the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

presence of the Lord for ever, who alone is the Fountain of Life and Happiness.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second Death stands in this, that wicked men and women shall not only be severed in Body and Soul from the blessed and glorious presence of the Almighty for ever; but shall be cast into the Lake of Fire, &amp; have their abode with the Devils, and all the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits in Hell, where there is no joy, nor comfort, nor ease, but weeping and wailing, &amp; gnashing of Teeth If a man should be cast into a deep and dark Dungeon, full of Toads and Serpents, what comfort I pray, could be have but to wish for Death: That is the death that all impenitent sinners must die, they must be cast out of the sweet and comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord Jesus Christ, and thrown head-long into the terrible Lake of Fire and Brimstone, there to be tormented for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The third thing wherein this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death doth consist, is, that all Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates shall be punished with everlasting perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they shall be tormented both Body and Soul with unspeakable torments: The wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God shall seize upon them, and feed on them, as fire do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our Saviour compareth the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful torment of this second death, to a Furnace of Fire: What a woful torment is it to be cast into a furnace of Fire, and there to lie many thousand years?

                     </gap> worm shall never die nor kill them, but be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gnawing and wounding them. And this condition of the damned in Hell is miserable in three respects.</p>
                  <p>First, In regard of the degrees of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In regard of the place.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, In regard of the perpetuity thereof.</p>
                  <p>The first appears in the loss of our blessed Communion with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <hi>In whose presence is life, and at whose right hand there is pleasure for evermore</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus shall the wicked be punished at that day with <hi>everlasting Destruction from the presence of the Lord,</hi> 2 Thes. 1.9.</p>
                  <p>A second degree of their misery consists in the Society they shall have for ever with the Devil and his Angels, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> A punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we may guess to be intolerable; to burn and not to consume, to live, and have no end; includes all woe and misery whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Cursed of Christ himself, cursed of the Angels; whose curse will always remain in their Consciences: Cursed shall they be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the Devils themselves, whose curse shall be always tormenting them; never have rest nor ease; perpetually howling and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is their Musick, their joy nothing but cursing and blasphemy.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The place shall add likewise to their misery, and that is Hell, the proper place of the damned after death: This in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called <hi>Hell, the bottomless Gulpb, utter darkness, the fearful Tophet, the Dungeon of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, the burning Lake, the hollow Cave, the Chaos of all Confusion, the Grave of Perdition, whose Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And last of all the Eternity of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the damned shall suffer, adds not a little to the misery of the wicked; they <hi>shall</hi> suffer and endure the heat and burning of Gods Wrath for ever: It shall never have an end; It <hi>shall</hi> be without hope of intermission, for saith St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 14.11. <hi>The smoak of their Torment shall ascend evermore, and they shall have no rest Day nor Night.</hi> What a punishment will this be! Let all Men and Women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>
                  <p>First, It is the loss of Almighty God, and of his most Glorious and Blessed Presence, which the Saints and Angels always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And this is a very great Comfort to <hi>all</hi> the true Members of Christ, that repent &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their sins, &amp; strive to conquer their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly passions, bearing patiently what wicked men lay upon them, &amp; strive <hi>to live a Godly Life,</hi> though they are in Misery, Poverty, or Want, and in the end die the first Death of the Body yet they <hi>shall</hi> be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And mark this difference The Children of God have two Resurrections, and one Death; they rise from sin in this Life, to newness and holiness of Life; and they rise at the Last Day to Eternal Life in Heaven, and therefore truly blessed. But graceless and ungodly sinners have two deaths, and but one Resurrection, they die in sin here, then when they are dead in sin, and <hi>delight</hi> in sin here, and so they die the first Death of the Body, &amp; an Eternal Death, <hi>the second Death of Body and Soul in Hell.</hi> And as they never had part in the first Resurrection, so <hi>the</hi> second Resurrection is only to Judgment, to Death. Nor is <hi>that all</hi> to <hi>die and go to Hell,</hi> for they <hi>shall be</hi> in the Sea of Miseries, &amp; in an Ocean of Calamities, Fire continually fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about them, and yet not wasted, nor they consumed.

                  <p>THE former Verse shews us the execution of the last Judgment upon all wicked and ungodly sinners, and of that we spake the last time. Now in this Verse we may observe the different Estate of the Children of God, &amp; of the Wicked, for as there are but two sorts
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:002963_0066_0FE6A9B15DF7EFA0"/>
of Men, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad, Elect</hi> and <hi>Reprobates, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,</hi> and <hi>Impenitent,</hi> the Children of God, and the Children of the Devil, so there be but two places, <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell, Joy</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> the <hi>Right Hand</hi> and <hi>Left:</hi> And the Rewards shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, either <hi>Blessed</hi> or <hi>Cursed:</hi> For so St. <hi>John</hi> saith here, <hi>The Elect shall have Eternal Life, but they that are Reprobates, shall be cast into the Lake of Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, concerning the Elect, and those that be chosen in the Lord Jesus; and whose names are written in Heaven: As their Lives differ from the wicked and ungodly, so their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state after this life is far different; for they shall be blessed and happy for ever. And if you ask, what is the blessedness that all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect shall have? I answer with <hi>Paul, The eye never saw it, nor ever entred into the heart of Man to conceive the hundreth part of this happiness,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 9 Yet we may out of the Scripture gather some relish of it, as it is there described un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
                  <p>And first this blessed estate of the Godly at the last day, stands in this, that God shall be <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all unto us</hi>: What good things soever the heart of man can wish, that will God be to us. If thou desire <hi>Wealth,</hi> God will be it to thee: If <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Pleasure.</hi> Almighty God will be all in all unto us: Nay, every Child of God shall have as it were a Kingdom, <hi>Come ye blessed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the Kingdom of Heaven there shall be no manner of want; for we shall be free from all sin, and all defects of Body and Soul shall be supplied. And tho' we see God now but in part, yet then we shall behold him face to face, unto our eternal comfort; not as
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:002963_0067_0FE6A9BDCE55A1C8"/>
in a Glass darkly; but see and behold him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as we are seen and beheld perfectly; and Jesus Christ the Lamb of God, which hath been our Advocate; and the Vision of the Holy Ghost, not like a Dove hovering, but perfectly and directly, <hi>and we shall then for evermore live in his blessed presence, and reign with him for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then all the Elect shall be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jesus Christ: So saith <hi>Paul, He shall change our vile Bodies, and make them like unto his glorious Body.</hi> Christ was most holy, pure, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and glorious; even so shall we be: We shall be free from Sin, Satan, Death and Hell, and the Grave. And at the point of Death let us intreat the Lord, that he would be a Fountain of Everlasting Water, to besprinkle our Souls and Hearts, for his Son's sake, Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In Heaven we shall reap <hi>endless Joy, and Eternal Happiness; and shall delight in praising God for ever, so as we shall keep a perpetual Sabbath and Joy in the Service of God for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh it is a great happiness to be in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God: for there is Glory and Honour, and true content indeed: Where we shall have Joy without Sorrow, Day without Night; no Valley of Tears, but a Sion of Glory, &amp; endless comforts. And this shall be for all that fear God, and whose Names shall be found written in the Book of Life.</p>
                  <p>Oh then, cursed be those men and women, who think and say, it is in vain to serve the Lord: Or as <hi>Pharoah</hi> said, <hi>who is the Lord, that I should fear him?</hi> Then men shall know it is not in vain to serve the Lord; for if we will not be careful to keep a good Conscience, and serve God aright, and so go to Heaven by good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; we then must expect to go to Hell with
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:002963_0067_0FE6A9BDCE55A1C8"/>
the wicked for Company; Nay, God will put a difference between them that serve him, and them that serve him not. And this should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all men to labour to abound in holy Duties, seeing God will reward even the least work of Faith.</p>
                  <p>If thou give but a Cup of cold Water in the Name of Christ, verily thou shalt not lose thy reward. Tho' our works cannot any way me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet he will in Mercy for his Son Christ's sake thus Crown the good Works of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: For tho' Works do not Merit, yet they are Rwardable. And seeing few shall be saved, let us labour to be of that little Flock, let us above all things seek this Kingdom of God; if thou obtain this, thou art happy and blessed, although thou lose all the World besides; and if thou lose it, thou art miserable &amp; wretched, tho' thou win the whole World. Oh then, what madmen are we, if we never seek for this, or think of Heaven, until we have one foot in the Grave or Hell; let us not think to gain a Kingdom so easily; we cannot go to Heaven on Beds of Down, but we must strive to enter therein, we must take pains for what is got without? And as Life, Joy, Riches, Honour, and Pleasures are sweet; so to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them for ever, without fear of losing, this is a blessed thing; for it is with them that are in possession of this Kingdom, they be out of all fear to lose it, and shall reign with Christ for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Thus (in some sort) you may conceive the blessed and most happy estate of all the Elect and faithful Children of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ought to stir us up to repent, and

                  <p>This Lake of Fire, into which all impenitent and hard-hearted sinners shall be cast for ever, I have already described to you; and for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, to put you still in mind of this Lake, this Hell, this Tophet, this place of Torment, which will never have end, I will set down three weighty Points, and that briefly.</p>
                  <p>First, The extremity of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The perpetuity of it.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, That it is remediless.</p>
                  <p>And which well considered, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ke of Fire.</p>
                  <p>And seeing the Spirit of God doth repeat it again &amp; again; that all reprobate sinners shall
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:002963_0068_0FE6A9BDE3907A18"/>
be cast into the Lake of Fire, it is to shew, that men little consider of it, they do not tremble at it; and therefore he insists upon it, to teach us that it is a weighty Point to be thought on, to mollisie our hard Hearts. And first, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this same Lake of Fire: In that it is named here, <hi>a Lake of Fire</hi>; this noteth to us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Torment, that it is a place of endless <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>oe, and unspeakable pain. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures afford it sundry Names, to set forth the unspeakable torments thereof. <hi>All wicked and impeniten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e, and Christ saith, <hi>There shall be weeping, wail<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. And it shall be most hot, and yet most cold, which shews the strangeness of this Fire. Again, <hi>their worm shall never die,</hi> Mark 8 14. That worm which shall gnaw their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Oh what a woful thing is this for any man or woman to have a worm continually to gnaw their Bowels within, never to let them alone, or give them any rest! Such shall be the misery of the wicked. Again, <hi>Tophet is prepared for the King, he cannot escape, and it is deep and and large, and the burning thereof is Fire and much Wood, and the Breath of the Lord as a River of Brimstone shall kindle it,</hi> Isa. 33.33. So the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ath of God shall be as Bestows to blow it, and as a River of Brimstone to maintain it. By this you may conceive the extremity of this woful Lake of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ll Fire. But if I had the Tongue of Men and Angels, I could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it to the full. For as the Joys of Heaven are unspeakable, so the Torments of Hell are unexpressible: For then the full Wrath of GOD shall seize upon the Reprobates, both

                     </gap>ody ond Soul, and that for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Now to the end you may the better conceive the extremity of it, you must know that the Torments of <hi>Hell</hi> are universal, even in <hi>all</hi> the the parts of the Body, and the faculties of the Soul at once, the Mind, the Will, the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Affections, the Head, the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all at once shall be tormented.

But we look for new Heavens and a new Earth, according to his Promise, wherein dwelleth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. Wherefore, Beloved, seeing you look for such things be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the long suffering of the Lord is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore sober, and watching in prayer,</hi> Luke 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness; and Cares of this Life, and so that Day come upon you unawares. For as a Snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the Face of the whole Earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man:</hi> For it is he that will say, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise ye dead and come to Judgment.</hi> Now I have done with the Text, and have shewed you the way to get a good Conscience, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, and likewise the Reward of an evil Conscience, which <hi>is the Lake which burns with Fire and Brimstone for ever.</hi> I will not leave you in Horror and Dread in the conclusion of the Text, being the last words of it, but I <hi>will</hi> comfort you with the description of

Also considering our own great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, we might with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> break forth into the Praises of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144.3. and say, <hi>Lord, what is Man that thou takest Knowledge of him, or the Son of Man that thou makest account of him.</hi> Now as the Prophets do stir up the peoples minds to Serve &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, by setting before them the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Blessings of this Life, &amp; thereby giving them an earnest of greater Blessings to come, so is the Happy Estate of Everlasting Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed unto us by such earthly comparisons as our natural capacity can conceive; that we beholding in mind and contemplation, those wonderful Joys which we can conceive; may grow into admiration of those Heavenly and inexpressible excellencies which are altogether past our apprehension, &amp; far beyond our reach and understanding. For as Spiritual Blessings do far surpass Corporal Blessings, so Heavenly Joys do far exceed <hi>all</hi> earthly Glory; yea, and these stately secrets of another Life are so much hidden from Flesh and Blood, that <hi>all</hi> the Learning of the Wise men of the World can come nothing near them; that in this case they may truly say with the Astrologers of King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan 2 11. <hi>It is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can shew before the King, except the Gods, whose dwelling is not with Flesh.</hi>

                  <p>A torrent of Pleasure, a full Cup running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: in which the Saints of God rejoyce in Christ, cloathed in White, and following the Lamb wheresoever he goeth; and with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Sing to the Lord, saying, <hi>Salvation to our God, which sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb,</hi> Amen. <hi>Blessing and Glory, and Wisdom, and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and Honour, and Power, and Might be unto our God, for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

comfortable &amp; inexpressible are those things within the City? For we may assure our selves, there are many hidden Treasures, and matters of far more account. Many things spoken of the outward Palace, but those things which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are unsearchable. According to <hi>Rev</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, save he that receiveth it:</hi> So secret and hidden are the things within the City.</p>

                  <p>Gods Kingdom is not shaken, as our earthly Kingdoms are; nor is it to be compared to our Terristrial or Temporary Kingdoms; no, he hath left those Kingdoms to the Sons of Men, as to <hi>David, Solomon, Hezekiah,</hi> and the like. His Kingdom is not made with hands, that is past our Imagination, and contains in it all that can be wished or desired; and therefore did <hi>Abraham</hi> forsake his own native Country, his Kindred, &amp; his Fathers House, to go into, a Land he knew not whither And why did <hi>Moses</hi> forsake <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not only that, but refused to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Daughter? Why did so many Patriarchs, Prophets, Saints, and holy Men and Women, leave their ancient Houses, Riches, and lay down their Treasures at the Apostles feet, &amp; wander up and down in Wildernesses, and in Mountains, and hide themselves in Dens &amp; Caves of the Earth? Surely for this cause they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the Recompence of Reward, and that was <hi>Regnum Dei,</hi> the Kingdom of God, this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Mansion, where they desired to be, and were assured they should see the Goodness of the Lord in the Land of the Living, which hath a Crown that never fadeth, and Salvation that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endeth; an inheritance immortal, &amp; a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation perpetual. <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where God would be worshipped, and in which King <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple, seated in that place, which we now call the Holy Land, was in times past so famous, that all Nations had recourse thither? Both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of God's Worship and Service performed
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:002963_0077_0FE6A9DB4A8106A0"/>
there, and his manifold gracious Blessings pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereon; and therefore the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is compared to this, and called the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> Likewise also <hi>Canaan,</hi> that plentiful Land, which flowed with Milk and Hony, which was the Land that was promised to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> is compared to this Heavenly Habitation, But as many died short of it, and never entred into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> some for Murmuring, some for Wheredom, some for Idolatry, some for one offence, some for another; so although we hear of the Joys of Heaven, and of this new City, and many would enter therein; yet for their manifold offences in this time of their life and tryal, many are debarred from thence, and few are made the Citizens of Heaven; therefore if we expect to come to this place of Happiness, we must first be Reconciled to God by true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; we must come with Jesus Christ in our hearts by Faith, and plead his Merits, Death and Passion and so enter into his Joy.</p>

there shall be no Temple, no Church. <hi>And I saw no Temple therein</hi> How then? Why the Presence of God himself shall be unto them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Temple and Church.

And they were Cloathed in long white Garments, having Palms in their hands,</hi> Verse 9. <hi>Which cried with a loud voice, saying, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be ascribed to him that sitteth upon the Seat of our God.

                  <p>In earth no joy, or comfort so surpassing, strange and wonderful, but <hi>will</hi> breed a satiety, and we shall after a while wax weary thereof, either desiring a greater, or else longing after variety; for mans Nature is given to nothing so much as to newness and novelty. But behold the joys of this new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall be so diverse, so strange and incredible, that we shall never be satisfied therewith. We see in <hi>Rev</hi> 21. <hi>The Tree of Life bears twelve manner of Fruits, and gave fruit every month; twelve manner of Fruits.</hi> There is the diversity of their joy; giving fruits every month, there is the continual change still pleasing thy mind with variety, &amp; ravishing thy senses with infinite delight.</p>
                  <p>And this may make us more eager after those joys, because we shall not be long without 'em. For the time of this Life is but short, and the time of thy Tryal in this World, is but in a manner a moment. If our time here should be a thousand years, what is it to one day there which hath no night; which, be it that it hath a Sun rising, yet it shall never set; an entrance and a beginning there is unto those Joys, but the terms and date thereof cannot be told. And as the Torments of <hi>Hell,</hi> already spoken of, are endless; so are the Joys of Heaven beyond <hi>all</hi> time; as they are remediless (for out of Hell, there is no redemption) so are these joys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>all</hi> change or alteration; as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortless, so these exceed in <hi>all</hi> manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; all without end, without number, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure.</p>

                     <pb n="161" facs="unknown:002963_0082_0FE6A9E6F6731640"/>Thus have I shewed you the Joys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, in part, but their fulness I cannot utter, nor you conceive, we can only guess at them: But that which I have already spoken is sufficient, for the satisfying of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infinite desires, edification, comfort and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if I should fill your Heads, with my own devices and Imaginations, I should but delude you. Again, be not desirous to know more than is fit and convenient: For when we have spoken <hi>all,</hi> or the learnedest in the World expressed <hi>all,</hi> yet none can fully utter the truth of these Joys. For if no Eye hath ever seen them, or Heart of Man can conceive them, how is it possible for me to declare them? But that which we do know, let it be instructive, and let us leave off to search where God will give no understanding. Hidden they are &amp; unknown that we might the more earnestly desire them, for known things grow out of love.</p>
                  <p>The consideration of these Joys already reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be sufficient to establish and confirm us that there be not in any of us an unfaithful Heart, to depart from the Living God. And who would deprive himself of those Joyes, if they were no other, but such as our own minds might imagine, or our own hearts conceive? In this case, let us be content there to make a stop where Gods Word hath set a full point. And blessed be God, who to encourage us in a way of Godliness, hath giveh us a taste of these unutterable Joys, though it be but as it were under a Veil</p>
                  <p>Now to shew you all these Joys and not apply them, seemeth altogether without use, and life. The profitable instructions therefore that hence
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:002963_0083_0FE6A9F22D7690A8"/>
may arise, are more than I can utter; yet give me leave to recite some, and be not uneasie tho' I stay you a little longer, for to hear the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of those things which pertain to the Kingdom of Heaven.

                  </p>
                  <p>The first instruction for our use may be this, to learn to grow out of love with the present World, and with the transitory Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Profits of the same; so <hi>that</hi> we may prepare our journey to our long &amp; wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home; and to those Houses and Heavenly Habitations, whose Leases <hi>shall</hi> never expire; to our Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi>; and to this beautiful new <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Howbeit for the most part we are so bewitched with the glistering Joys of this present fading World, <hi>that</hi> no exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or perswasion <hi>will</hi> lightly prevail to withdraw our minds from thence; which thing may lively be set forth to your view, by reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a parable of the custom of a certain Common-wealth, People and Nation, which were wont to chuse their King from amongst the poorest sort of people to advance him to great honour, wealth and pleasure for a time.</p>

                  <p>The Joys of Heaven, and the desire of the World, are quite contrary; worldly pleasures hinder us from mounting up so high.

and they which feed their hearts with things be low, cannot have their affections in Heaven; the joys of Heaven being so excellent, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they might remove our heavy, lumpish &amp; grovelling desire after this World. The care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, earthly and worldly mind, hath no sight nor sense, nor feeling of these Joys. But as the Ox is fatted in the pasture, and the Bird singeth sweetly, and feedeth without fear, and suddenly the one is driven to the Slaughter, and the other is taken in the snare; so they that be Worldly minded are lulled asleep in security, until the time that Death striketh with his dart, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less destruction overwhelm them. But where is the Man or Woman which can say with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is best of all. For they that say such things, declare plainly that they seek a Country,</hi> Heb. 11.16. <hi>Desiring a better Country than is to be found in this World</hi>; that is, <hi>a Heavenly Country, and for them hath God prepared a City,</hi> Heb. 13.14. <hi>For here we have no continuing City, no continuing Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Let us therefore seek this new Habitation to come, which is of longer continuance, &amp; free from all miseries. The next fruit is that the remembrance of these Joys teacheth us patience in afflictions, troubles and distresses.

                  <p>To add to these, one of the greatest Joyes of <hi>all,</hi> is God's mercy, whereof we have a sweet taste in this Life: For were it not for that, none at <hi>all</hi> should enter into <hi>that</hi> place where those joys are to be found.

This mercy is called the <hi>rich Mercy</hi> of God; for no Treasure is comparable unto it: And as it passeth all understanding, so cannot the deepest reach of men conceive any part of the depth or heighth thereof; the compass, the largeness, the wideness, &amp; breadth

                  <p>Last of all, for a conclusion, and for admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In brief, I will shew you the right way of dying <hi>well</hi>; and the comfort of it, which in the end brings <hi>all</hi> this joy and happiness. First, by Virtue of Christ's Death, Death ceaseth to be any more a terror or a plague, but it's made a blessing, and a passage between this and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. Christ is the Key of our Graves, and hath opened the Kingdom of Heaven to <hi>all</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. The day of death is only terrible, when it is joyned with the apprehension of GOD's Wrath, and we are not defended with the Shield of Faith. When we die, we should rejoyce in the Lord, for the corruption of our nature is quite abolished, and our Sanctification is there accomplished. By death our present miseries are removed, and the future prevented. What happiness is it to see the glory of God's Majesty, face to face, to live and abide with God, &amp; the Holy and Blessed Angels for ever? And when we are joyned to Christ by the bond of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our life time, we shall eternally remain with him in unutterable felicity. Likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once certainly assured in conscience of our being in Christ let Death come when it <hi>will,</hi> we
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:002963_0087_0FE6AA00759894C0"/>
shall yet remain in the covenant, and shall be re-united with him, and taken up to Everlasting Life: And whether we wake or sleep, or whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we do, let us alway bear in mind the end of our Life; and that we continually hear the found of the Trumpet, <hi>Arise ye Dead, and come to Judgment</hi>; knowing that the power of Death lies in our sin; &amp; therefore let us use all g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>od means, that our sins may be removed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. And to weaken the force of Death, the best way is to humble our selves, repent us of our sins, amend our lives, &amp; to trust and relie upon the Mercies of God, <hi>that</hi> we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably say with St. <hi>Paul, I live not, but Christ lives in me,</hi> which we must find by the Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of our sanctified conscience, <hi>that Christ</hi> my Redeemer by his Spirit, governs according to his Holy Will. O how late is that hour for a man to begin to live <hi>well</hi> when he must of necessity die, and depart out of this Life? <hi>Doth any man think that God will be co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

No sure, or do we think that when we have spent all our time and study to got Wealth and Honour, and then in our old age when we can do nothing else, begin to pray and serve God? This will be a great cause, when we examine our lives, how we have mispent it to fear Death. What was the reason that Christ loved his Disciple</hi> John <hi>better than the rest? because he came to him in his youth, while he was young and lusty.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God will not be our Staff in our Age, if we do not serve him in our youth. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the wisest King that ever lived, gives

but a passage to a better Life. I would have every Christian man and woman upon their sick beds to look for Death, and take it patiently &amp; willingly: My first reason is, because the Death of every Member of Christ is foreseen and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the special Decree and Providence of God, yea the very circumstances thereof. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Then God's promise, <hi>Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for they rest from their Labours, and their Works follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. Then Fourthly and Lastly, God hath promised his special and blessed presence to the sick and dying that are his, as we may read, Isa. 43.2. Where he declares himself t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

must fix his eye of Faith on Christ exalted on the Gross, and also crucified for Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>The very sighs, sobs and groans of a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and a believing heart, are Prayers before God as effectual, as if they were uttered by V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Obedience, saith a Holy Father, is one of the first steps to Heaven; and to die in obedience, is to be willing and ready to go out of the World when God calls us. As in <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Secondly, All future sin is prevented by Death, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the last Enemy that shall be destroyed is Death.

Increase my Faith, O merciful Father, that I may not swerve at any time from thy Heavenly Word, but increase in me Hope and Love, with a care of keep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing all thy Commandments. Shew thy mercy upon me, and enlighten the natural blindness and darkness of my Heart, by thy Heavenly Grace and Spirit, that I may be regenerated and renewed by the same; by which, O Lord, purge the grossness of my hearing, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which have been choaked with the cares and pleasures of this World, that I may profitably read, hear and understand thy Heavenly.

But most chiefly, I intreat thee, O Lord, to defend my Soul against the temptations, and subtle deceits of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: And when I happen to fall into sin thro' frailty and weakness of Nature, I beseech thee to work true repentance in my heart, that trusting in thy mercy without presumption, I may amend my life, and become truly religions, faithful and trusty without deceit, sad without distrust, and content with what thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon me; that I may increase it to thy Honour. Finally, For as much as it hath pleased thee to make the night for Man to rest, and ordained for him the day, to follow his honest Labour and Vocation: Grant, O Heavenly Father, that I may so enjoy my bodily rest that my Soul may continually watch like the wise Virgins, with the Oyl of Faith in my Heart, for the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that I be not overcome by Dreams, or any other temptations but that I may fully set my mind upon thee, to love<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> fear, and rest in thee.

Order of Placing this Book, the Title of it, the Subject, and the matter therein contained.</p>
            <p>First, Touching the Order of placing this Book, wherein <hi>Solomon</hi> labours to build up the Spiritual Temple of the Soul: It is the same he hath observed in building the material Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where he framed three Courts; the outmost for the common People, the second for the Priests and Levites; and last of all the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the Holiest of Holies, only for the High Priest to enter in at, and that but once a Year. Even so in this Spiritual Temple of Mans Soul he hath likewise framed three Courts: First an outward Court, which is his Book of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> where all sorts and degrees of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever are taught and instructed a civil course of manners: Next to that, he hath a second Court, which is his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, he hath a <hi>Sanctum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> which is the <hi>Canticles,</hi> where not every one, but only those that delight in Heavenly &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries, can behold the pure, free, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, eternal and constant Love of Christ Jesus towards his Church, and every faithful Soul, as also the love of his Church towards him, and the great benefit she reapeth by him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the Title and Subject, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this most excellent Book: As there is <hi>Sabbatum Sabbati.</hi> So this is a <hi>Song of Songs</hi>; because of all that <hi>Solomon</hi> indited, this is most divine and most excellent: Wherein he most lively and affectionately, by Allegorical and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical Speeches, deciphers out, and describes unto us the most Holy and Perfect Love of

Christ Jesus towards the Church his Blessed Spouse. For Christ and his Church are here brought in, in this worthy Book, as two Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, who are in love, one with the other, as the time of wooing ever goeth before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of Matrimony, of those which in due time purpose to Marry, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.18. as <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were first espoused before they came together, so the same order is observed in this Spiritual Union betwixt Christ and his Church, <hi>Job</hi> 3.29. They must first be contracted, then afterwards married: The contract is, when a man is Regenerate and born a new, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.9. Translated out of Nature into Grace, depending only upon our Saviour Christ for Salvation, and finished and made up in the day of Judgment, when all the Elect shall surely enjoy God: For so witnesseth the Holy Ghost, where it is said, <hi>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give Honour to him: For the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife has made her self ready,</hi> Rev. 19.7. So then this Book contains in it the wonderful love, &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection betwixt our Saviour Christ and his Spouse, the true Church of God, and every true Believer. This may serve touching the Book it self; we will now come to the words of the Text.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Tell me, O thou whom my Soul loveth.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter, the Church beginning to speak to Christ, and being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd in heart with his love, desires more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to be embraced of him, that she might be joined unto him, prefering Christ Jesus with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002963_0100_0FE6AA4423BFD718"/>
the Blessings and Benefits she reaped by him, before all other things in the World.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Verse she confesseth her ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and want of power to embrace Christ; and therefore she desireth him to draw her heart by his Word and Spirit, whereby she sheweth her earnest desire to receive Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. She removes an objection <hi>that</hi> might be made; for it might be said, Alas, thou art black and deformed: how canst thou hope that he will take any pleasure in thy Beauty, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is the most Pure, Blessed and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Son of God: To this she confesses, that tho' by Nature she be black and full of ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, and natural Corruption, by reason of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>her Original Sin, Natural Pollutions, &amp; actual Transgressions, yet notwithstanding, being Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Christ's Blood, Cloathed with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and being Deckt and Beautified with the Graces of his Spirit, Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Zeal, Patience, Love, Obedience, &amp;c. <hi>She is fair and Comely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the Seventh Verse, she puts up an earnest request to Christ, that he would in mercy shew her where he feedeth his Flock, and where he provides comfort for them in the time of Trouble. For Christ being the great Shepherd, his Church on Earth seeks only after him for Food, resting assured that there is but one true Shepherd, who feedeth all his Sheep with wholesome Pasture.</p>
               <p>In these two Verses, are two things to be considered, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002963_0101_0FE6AA4438E44520"/>
                  <item>1. The Request &amp; Petition which the Church maketh unto Christ, <hi>Verse</hi> 7.</item>
                  <item>2. The most kind and loving Answer of Christ unto his Church, directing and comforting her, according to her Petition. <hi>Verse</hi> 8</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the first of these, we are to consider two things.</p>
               <p>First, The Request: And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Reason of the Request.</p>
               <p>In the Request, note first the Person whom she implores, <hi>O thou whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Request it self, which is two-fold.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Jesus Christ would shew her where he feeds his Flock, with his holy Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to the end that he would feed her, as he fed the Flocks of former times.</item>
                  <item>2. Where he provides shelter and shade in the heat of Persecution? At the manner of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherds was in these hot Countries, to drive their sheep to shade in the heat of the day.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And lastly, The Reason, <hi>For why should I be as one that turneth aside by the Flocks of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansons</hi>? So that if Christ do it not, it will not be for his Honour, nor yet for her good.</p>
               <p>First, For the Person to whom she seeketh for direction and sure comfort, it is Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Saviour and Redeemer of his Church and People; whom she describeth thus: <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth,</hi> &amp;c. That is to say, O Lord Jesus Christ, my only Saviour and Redeemer, whom I love with all my Heart; yea whom I love most earnestly above all the World: So as if the Question were asked, what I love best

in all the World; I speak it from my heart, It is thou Lord alone,</p>
               <p>Hence we learn, with what affection every Child of God, and true Believer must love our Saviour Christ: Namely, with the greatest and strongest affection of love they can; So as if it were asked, what or whom dost thou love most?

Yea, it is a precept given by the Lord God himself, that he must have the chiefest Love, and the first from in our Hearts <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might,</hi> Deut. 6.5. The Lord will not be satisfied with the Love o our Eyes, to behold his Works; the Love of the Ear, to listen to his Word; the Love of the Tongue, to talk of him; the Love of the Feet to go to the Sanctuary; but the Lord requires
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002963_0102_0FE6AA4562C4F0A0"/>
all these Loves together in one. So as a Man may truly say with <hi>David</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I desire besides that,</hi> Psal 73 25 The Lord allows not that a man should have two Hearts, one for God, and another for the Devil; <hi>We cannot serve God and Mammon:</hi> We must not part our Love to the World, the Flesh and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; divided it must not be, Christ must have it all. Now the Reasons are divers, to shew with what an ardent affection we must love Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>First. Because he is our Husband, and we are his Spouse, for so saith the Prophet, <hi>Isa</hi> 54 5. <hi>For thy Maker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hosts is his Name:</hi> And again, <hi>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her self ready</hi> Rev. 10.7. Now our Spiritual Services and Worship of God (is as it were) ascertain Marriage of our Souls unto God when we take upon us the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Jesus Christ, as in Baptism, then we betroth our selves to Christ as to an Husband, entring into Covenant with Christ, to keep only to him unto our lives end. So then, by this means the Lord is become our Husband, and we his Spouse. Now then, as an honest man cannot endure that another should have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in his Wife, so will not Christ endure that another should have with him any interest or portion in his Church. <hi>For he is a jealous God, Exod.</hi> 20 4, 5. So then the force of the Reason standeth thus: God's People which are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto Christ, must love Christ alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are linked and Married unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002963_0102_0FE6AA4562C4F0A0"/>
as a Wife to her Husband, unto whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>one she is bound.</p>
               <p>Therefore if we forsake the Lord, and break the Promise we made to him in Baptism, and betroth our selves unto others, then will he cast us off, give us a Bill of Divorcement, as shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Strumpets, and punish us for our unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He loved us first and best, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of St. <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him, because he first loved us.</hi> Yea he loved us first when we were his Enemies, and had made a voluntary separation between him &amp; our Souls, committing Spiritual Fornication with Sin and Satan. Yea, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> 1. <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead in Sin.</hi> And lest he should any whit doubt of his love, he hath manifested it in that <hi>He washed us from our Sins in his own Blood,</hi> Rev. 1.5. O then greater Love than this can no man shew? Christ loved us first; And he invitesus to love him; and shall not we love him again? It is a great sin of ingratitude, not to love where we are beloved for our good: And therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ hath loved thy Soul so dearly, as to suffer a cursed death, yea to shed his own Blood to save thy Soul, O how oughtest thou to love Christ again? If a Man were taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and put to extream slavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, where he should remain for ever, unless a great Sum of Money were paid for his Ransom, which he is never able to pay, how miserable and grievous were the estate of this Man!

                  </gap>ch were bound unto him? We are all taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and that not by the <hi>Turks,</hi> which only can hold, us in Temporal Bondage, but by the Subtilty of Satan the Prince of Darkness: where we should have endured not a Temporal, but a Spiritual and Eternal Bondage and Slavery, and that, in Hell for evermore; and nothing but only the Blood of the Son of God could pay our Ransom.</p>
               <p>Oh how should this work upon the affections of every Christian Man and Woman, and even bind us to love Christ again: Now, what could bind Christ, but only his love to give himself to death for us? Surely nothing that was in us. <hi>But God who is rich in Mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sin, hath quickned us together with Christ, by whose Grace ye are saved,</hi> Eph. 2.4. And again, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us. In whom</hi> (said the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) <hi>we have Redemption through his blood,</hi> Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.7. And therefore the love that Christ Jesus hath first shewed unto us, must constrain us to love Christ again.</p>
               <p>And last of all, because Christ Jesus is the most excellent in himself, and therefore most worthy of our respect, for so saith the Church of God; <hi>My Beloved is white and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002963_0103_0FE6AA458363D7F8"/>
and Wise, and some because they are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably descended: Now <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> hath all these: For whatsoever may affect a man's Heart, and any way procu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Oh let this serve to reprove all carnal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Hypocrites, Worldly men, Covetous Cormorants, who love any thing more than Christ Jesus, and his Glorious Gospel? Like the</hi> Gadarens, <hi>who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their Hogs before our Saviour: Yea, one mess of Pottage with</hi> Esau, <hi>that can be content with</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das <hi>to sell Christ for less than Thirty Pence, that love their salthy Pleasures, Eating, Drinking, Pride, Uncleanness as</hi> Dives <hi>did,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>more than Christ and their own Souls; or like the</hi> Bethlemites, <hi>let Christ lie in the Stable amongst Beasts, for they cannot afford him one corner in their Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, It is the sin of Thousands that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Christ to be their Husband, and Saviour, that yet break their Baptismal Covenant, and serve the World, and the Flesh; that pretend they love the Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; yet betroth themselves to the World, the Flesh and the Devil, and serve them. Now how could that man be content with this, that his Wife should say she loves him, and yet sets her Heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002963_0104_0FE6AA5204825BA0"/>
another Man? So how can we think that God will take it at our hands, if we make a shew that we love Christ, and yet are dallying with the World, Christ's Enemy; Oh he is a jealous God, and will never endure it at our hands.</p>
               <p>And lastly, By the Rule of this Doctrine, are the Papists here no less to be reproved, who rob God of his Honour in calling upon Saints, and praying to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> before Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, giving Honour and Adoration to Saints &amp; Angels, making them Mediators and Saviours. They shall find one day, that God will not put up this Robbery at their Hands, but will shew his Jealousie, and terrible anger and wrath against them, as most Sacrilegious Persons and Robbers.</p>
               <p>It must stir up every Christian man to labour to find his heart ravished with the love of our Saviour: So as he can say out of the affection of his Heart, <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth!</hi> So if the Question were demanded, what I love best? I can truly say, <hi>I love Christ more than the whole World; yea, I account all things as dross and dung to win Christ.</hi> And where Men find this true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and love of Christ in them, it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sign of their Salvation, that God hath cast his love on them, so that the love of God draws love to him again. As the light of the Sun lights on the eye, and by it we see the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And as by the Impression in the Wax, we know the Seal, so by our love to God, we know his love to us. Oh how should this cause every Man and Woman amongst us, to examine their love towards Christ, that so they may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002963_0104_0FE6AA5204825BA0"/>
some Assurance to their Souls, that Christ hath cast his love upon them. And to do this, ask this Question of thy Soul. <hi>Dost thou desire with the Apostle</hi> Paul, <hi>to be loosed and to be with Christ? Is it Meat and Drink unto thee to do the Will of Christ? Is thy hand ever ready (according to thy ability) to bestow any thing upon Christ, and for the advancement of his Glory? Dost thou labour in the place where thou livest, to advance the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ?</hi> Canst thou be content to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Shame, Disgrace, Troubles, Persecution and Bonds, yea, Death it self for Christ's sake? Doth the remembrance of his Coming to Judgment, chear up thy heavy Soul? And dost thou cry with the Spouse of Christ, <hi>Come Lord Jesus, Come quickly?</hi> And forsake the delights of the world with a detestation and scorn, saying with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</hi> These are the marks and tokens whereby you may discern whether you love Christ or no.</p>
               <p>But because all Men are ready to say, that they love Christ, or it were pity that they should live, when indeed the love of Christ is not in them; I will yet proceed a little further, and observe a few notes and marks, of this pure and hearty love to Christ, which are most certain signs of Grace.</p>
               <p>First, If we love Christ, we <hi>will</hi> love his Word, delight in it, and esteem it above Gold &amp; preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones. <hi>O how I love thy Law, saith</hi> David, <hi>it is my meditation all the day.</hi> Yea, it is altogether impossible for a Man to be religious, to fear God, and to love him, that hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> found love or delight in the Word of God; so that by our
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002963_0105_0FE6AA52199B6798"/>
love to his Word, we may judge of our <hi>love</hi> to Christ; no <hi>love</hi> nor delight in the Word, surely no <hi>love</hi> nor delight in Christ; great <hi>love</hi> to the Word, great <hi>love</hi> to Christ. In the Valuing of this Pearl, <hi>Davids</hi> practice is notable, <hi>who made the Testimonies of God his Heritage, and the Joy of his Heart, and esteemed them above Gold, yea, above fine Gold</hi> And (therefore seeing most men have no delight in the Word, seldom or <hi>never</hi> hear it, (unless it be for fashion sake) read it, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on it day or night; it is a certain token that the <hi>love</hi> of Christ is not in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we <hi>love</hi> Christ Jesus with all our hearts, we will <hi>love</hi> those whom he <hi>loves,</hi> his blessed Members, True Christians. <hi>Hereby</hi> (saith St. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>we know that we are passed from death unto life; because we love the Brethren?</hi> 1 Joh. 3.24. <hi>David</hi> testifies of himself, <hi>all my delight is in thy Saints.</hi> It is our duty to <hi>love</hi> all, but we must <hi>love</hi> the Saints with a peculiar and special <hi>love</hi>; as Heirs with Christ, &amp; Members of the same Body with us; therefore seeing men generally hate the Members of Christ, contemn and despise them; doth not this make it very apparent, that the <hi>love</hi> of Christ is not in them, for the World <hi>loves</hi> her own. <hi>But because ye are not of the World, but I have chosen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you, John</hi> 15.19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If we <hi>love</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> we must shew it by obedience to his Word and Holy Laws. For so saith Christ, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</hi> John 15.14. Little Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, little love; No Obedience to Christ's
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002963_0105_0FE6AA52199B6798"/>
Will, no Love; hearty Obedience, hearty <hi>Love.</hi> And therefore seeing generally men rebel against his Word, and break his Commandments; tho' these men should swear they <hi>love</hi> Christ, yet they are Lyars, and the <hi>love</hi> of Christ is not in 'em; for who can believe that a Traitor can Love his Prince.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If we <hi>love</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> we cannot endure to hear him blasphemed, his Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, or his Sabbath prophan'd, but it will grieve us at the <hi>very</hi> heart; and we will (to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now the Church of Christ puts up her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to this great Shepherd and Bishop of his Church, that he would be pleased to tell her where he feeds his Sheep, with the Preaching of the Word; and the use of the Sacraments that she may joyn with them, there to be fed and comforted.</p>

                  <p>Tho' the Church of God is but one in all the World, yet it hath divers parts; as the Sea, though but one, yet it is called by divers Names, according to the place where it lies; even so the Church of Christ, though but one, yet it hath divers parts, as the Holy Spirit distinguisheth of it, writing to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches which are in <hi>Asia</hi> Now of the whole Church of Christ, some parts of it are at peace and quiet, free from Persecution, when other parts may suffer Persecutions and Molestations. Now in this place the Church of God, in persecution and great affliction, desireth to know of Christ, <hi>where he feeds his sheep,</hi> that is, where the Church is at rest and peace, where the Word is purely preached, the Sacraments duly administred, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline duly performed, that she might joyn with them in the Service of Almighty God.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002963_0106_0FE6AA54FAB0BC08"/>From this Request and earnest suit of the Church to Christ, to know where he feeds his Sheep, we may learn: That it is a true note of a Sheep of Christ Jesus, to hunger &amp; thirst after the Word of God, to enquire where Christ feeds his Flock, where the Word is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully preached; and the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments duly administred. And this our Saviour himself observes to be the mark of his Sheep, Joh. 10.27. <hi>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: But the voice of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will they not hear.</hi> This Affection was in Godly <hi>David; O Lord, how amiable are thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles! How doth my Soul long after they Altars, O when shall I come and appear before the Lord in Sion!</hi> And this duty is imposed upon every Christian, for to have an earnest affection to the Word of God. As when a man is hungry, the Veins sucking moisture at the bottom of the Stomach, he feels a pain that makes him desire meat; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so our Souls void of Grace and nourishment unto eternal life, should hunger and thirst after Christ and his Righteousness; after his Word, which is the true Spiritual food of our Souls. As till a man be hungry he wants no meat, so till we see our wants, we never seek to have our silly Souls fed with the Word of God. Now in that so few desire the Word of God, and so few esteem of it, it shews that very few feel their want of food, very few can discern their misery and wretched estate, but most men run on in sin, joy themselves in their evil ways, and <hi>never</hi> say, <hi>Alas! What have I done? Jer.</hi> 8.6. We must <hi>desire</hi> the <hi>sincere</hi> Milk of the <hi>Word,</hi> as the Infant does the Mothers Breasts, <hi>and as the Hart doth the River of Waters,</hi> Psal. 42. And as the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002963_0107_0FE6AA5518CBE680"/>
Church doth here. <hi>Tell me where thou feedest thy Flock.</hi> We should do as the Earth doth in time of <hi>drought</hi>; she opens <hi>her</hi> mouth, begging and gaping until the <hi>Lord</hi> send Rain. The <hi>Beggar never</hi> begs so earnestly, till he feels his own want, and then he will spare no time, labour, nor words: So till we see our own wants, we <hi>never</hi> seek for the Spiritual food of our Souls. But <hi>they are blessed which hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> Mat. 5.6. Though we think we <hi>are</hi> happy when we feel no want: And it is common to say, <hi>I never doubted of my Salvation, I would be loth my Conscience should so trouble me,</hi> &amp;c. But sure it is the beginning of Grace to find our selves want Grace. Those that eat upon a full Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it doth them least good: So they that are full, and feel not the want of the Word, it doth them little good.</p>
               <p>And the Reason is, that if we do not hunger and thirst after the Word of God, we can <hi>never</hi> enjoy the Variety of all those good things which are laid up in the Word, for as all good things we have, and enjoy in this present life, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences to the Word, by which Word, &amp; by Prayer, they are sanctified unto us. Now it is got and obtained no other way, but by thirsting after it, as the blessed Virgin saith in her Song, Luke 1.53. <hi>He filleth the hungry with good things, and the rich he sendeth empty away.</hi> Which may serve to comfort the distressed Children of God, which sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ffing for it, by such as are far from thirsting after it themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002963_0107_0FE6AA5518CBE680"/>Secondly, If we should not eagerly seek after the Word of God, we should <hi>never</hi> know how much we are beholding unto the Lord, for the manifold Graces and Blessings which we receive every day from our most merciful God thereby. For so saith <hi>Solomon, The full Soul loatheth the honey comb; but unto the hungry Soul, every bitter thing is sweet,</hi> Prov. 27.7. So that when we see our Spiritual Poverty, it will then make us prize the excellency of that benefit we enjoy, when we have, the Word truly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely preached and taught among us.</p>
               <p>Seeing this longing desire after Christ and his Word, is the badge and mark of the Sheep of Christ, and of the true Church and Children of God: This Doctrine then maketh a plain distinction betwixt the Sheep of Christ, &amp; the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ts of Satan. The Sheep of Christ, long after their Shepherd, desire to be instructed by him, hunger after the true Word preached and taught, with for the Sabbath, <hi>Enquire where Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

Yea, they are weary of it, they will not go to the door to hear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.13. They can be content as well to want it, as to have it; so that hereby we may judge our own Estates, whether we are the true Sheep of Christ, or the Goats of Satan; the Children of God, or Limbs of the Devil: Dost thou love the Word of God more than thy appointed food? Tell me, dost thou desire to be taught in the Word? E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002963_0108_0FE6AA625229BC08"/>
delight in his word? <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.27. These are the marks of Christ's sheep, and may minister com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto thy Soul, if thou art one of those that belong unto his fold; but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thou loath and abhor the Word of God, &amp; hast no desire at all to tread in God's House, but spendest the Sabbath irreligiously, vainly &amp;, prophanely at Dice, Cards, Bowls, or Tables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O deceive not thine own Soul, it is a sign that thou art none of Christ's Sheep, but one of the stinking Goats of Satan; and there will come a day of separation, when Christ Jesus the great Shepherd will divide the Sheep from the Goats: When he shall set the Sheep on the right hand, and the Goats on the left.</p>
               <p>The same Doctrine serves to reprove three sorts of men.</p>
               <p>First, Atheists, that think it lost labour to be Religious, and that there is no good got by hearing Sermons, nor leading a Godly Life. Oh it hath ever been the cursed thought of a mans heart to think so, as was used in the time of the Prophet <hi>Malachy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, The Papists which keep poor men in ignorance and blindness: And all others, which seek by all means possible, to hinder Christ's Sheep from endeavouring to be taught which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These are like the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>who shut up the Kingdom of Heaven, and will not enter themselves, nor suffer those that would:</hi> Whereas the Scriptures do require of all men the <hi>Spirit of discerning,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.1. <hi>Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, All carnal and secure Worldlings<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who although they do enquire where they may buy a good bargain, or get a good purchase, and labour for that, yet never enquire, <hi>Where Christ feeds his Sheep.</hi> Oh! it is a wonder to see how men covet pleasures, profits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; these they seek with might and main; surely by this they declare to the World, that they are none of Christ's Sheep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seeing the true Church of God doth here seek unto Christ Jesus to be taught and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, we learn that it is the Duty of the true Church of God to acknowledge Christ Jesus alone for their great Pastor and Shepherd, the only Head and chief Bishop of his Church, &amp; therefore to be ruled by him, and his Word alone, to be content to be led and governed by this great Pastor &amp; Shepherd of the Church. Joh. 10 14. <hi>I am the true Shepherd, and know my Sheep, and am known of mine.</hi> This is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Peter,</hi> in the behalf of his Disciples.

               <p>This condemns the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as no true Church of God, first, because they will not content themselves with our Saviour Christ to be their great Pastor and general Shepherd, but they set up the Pope as his Vicar, and prefer him before Jesus Christ: Nay, they will not be content with that Pasture which Christ alloweth for his sheep, the green pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Sacred Word, and clear streams of his blessed Gospel, but they will feed upon the trash and filthy dregs of their own d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Doctrine is <hi>further cleared</hi> by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Joseph, Job,</hi> the Church in <hi>Egypt, Daniel, Shadrath, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Reasons to confirm this Doctrine are manifest.</p>
               <p>First, Consider the Title by which God is called: A Father, to shew the care <hi>that</hi> he takes over his Church, as his Children, to provide for them and govern them. For what Father will not save his Child, if possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002963_0113_0FE6AA6F6CE38BF0"/>
what shall we think <hi>that</hi> Christ the true Shepherd of his Church, will be more careless of his Flock, whom he hath purchased with no less price than his own hearts blood, than an earthly man is of his sheep. Seeing then that Christ Jesus is the King of his Church, and the Shepherd of his sheep, we need not doubt but <hi>that</hi> he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Church, and save his sheep, so <hi>that</hi> none shall be able to destroy them, nor take them out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our weakness and natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not hid from the Lord: <hi>He knoweth whereof we be made, he remembreth that we are but lust:</hi> And therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>GOD is faithful, that he will not suffer us to be tempted above that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>

So then, whether we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Office of Christ, as a Shepherd to keep his Church, or the mercy of Christ, <hi>that</hi> is <hi>over</hi> ready to cover the wants of his servants, making their afflictions to be but momentary; in these two respects we may easily gather <hi>that</hi> the Lord never forsakes his Children, but provides for 'em both shelter and comfort, when they shall find the heat of Afflictions hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Use</hi> 1. The Use serves to direct us to whom we shoulst go in time of Trouble and great Distress, for if Christ be our Shepherd, we are to flee to him, he is a faithful Preserver of them <hi>that trust in him. Shall we go to Saints and Angels?</hi> Isa. 16.63. <hi>Doubtless, Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel knoweth us not.</hi> What then, shall we trust in our Chariots, or in our Horses? <hi>Doubtless</hi> a

                  <hi>Horse is counted a vain thing to save a man</hi>? Psalm 47.1. Surely we cannot honour him more than when we depend on him, and Rest upon his Mercy.

So long therefore, as we have a voice to call upon God, or a heart to sigh and groan unto him, we have comfort and assurance to be delivered, and that he will not leave us nor forsake us in danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use</hi> 2. Here is matter of endless comfort unto the Church and Children of God, that they know that the Lord Jesus Christ promiseth and will provide a place of comfort and refreshing a shade even at noon-day, in the heat of of bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Persecution. Many indeed are our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, fears, cares, sorrows and troubles, yet in <hi>the</hi> midst of them all, the Children of God may say with the Prophet, <hi>Why art thou cast down (O my Soul) and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his Countenance,</hi> Psal. 42.5. O then let us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and comfort our selves in Christ Jesus; let us not for fear deny Christ and his Gospel? for Christ will be a shelter to refresh and deliver us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use</hi> 3. This shews the woful and desperate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of all wicked and ungodly Men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Gods favour, nor believing in Christ,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002963_0114_0FE6AA7207B68C60"/>

And therefore thou which art a wicked man, an impenitent sinner<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> a prophane Person; alas, what wilt thou do? And which way wilt thou turn thee in the time of trouble and calamity, when the Sun waxeth hot in the heat of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and scorching Tryal? Whither wilt thou run for shelter? Alas, thou shalt then be as a beast, which in the heat of the day runs up and down, and findeth no covert.

               <p>Now followeth the Reason which she useth to move the Lord Jesus Christ to grant her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and Petition, taken from the great peril and danger she was like to fall into; namely, lest being left without his direction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

assistance to direct and comfort her in Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then it shall not be for his honour, nor her good. This is the substance of her reason.</p>
               <p>Hence we are taught, <hi>That it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for men and women ever to stand the brunt of Persecution, unless they be taught of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and assisted by his Spirit.</hi> And hence it is that the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own Heart, and endued with a signal portion of <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> earnestly craves at God's hand the enlightning of his holy Spirit, desireth to be taught of him: <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may see the wondrous things of thy Law.</hi> And again, <hi>Teach me thy statutes.</hi> And again, <hi>make me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the way of thy precepts,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, Christ tells the Jews which murmured against him, (because he said, <hi>That no man could come unto him, unless his Father drew them) that all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are taught of God,</hi> Joh. 6.45.</p>
               <p>And this made <hi>Paul</hi> to pray for the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> Eph 2. <hi>That God would give them the Spirit of wisdom, and enlighten their minds that they might know their calling, and what the riches of his glorious Inheritance.</hi>

               <head>And the Reasons are,</head>
               <p>First, We are blind, and by nature can hardly see into the truth, unless God direct us by his Spirit; for so saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Prov, 14.12. <hi>The ways that seen right unto us; the issues thereof are the ways of Death.</hi> It is a part of our misery, <hi>that we are turned every one to his own way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, When we know it alas! we are of our selves so weak, and flesh and blood will be so unwilling to suffer for Christ's sake, that unless the Lord do assist us, we shall not be able to undergo the least temptation that shall be laid upon us:</p>
               <p>And lastly, The Enemies of God's Truth are in their Generation, so wise and subtil coming to us in S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s. In all these respects, we may safely conclude, that it is impossible for us to hold out in the day of Tryal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we be assisted by the <hi>Lord's Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use</hi> 1. This sheweth, that if Tryals do come and Persecutions shall arise for Christ and the Gospels sake: that alas it is to be feared most men would yield to Popery, Idolatry, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, <hi>to the Flocks of his Companions,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the Faith, Religion, Worship and Service of God, which my ancient Servants, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> have done, and tread in their Steps. Secondly, Thou must plant thy Tents where the Shepherds have done the Patriarchs, Prophets &amp; Apostles of Christ, and their doctrine taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

               <p>First, Observe here how Christ describes his true Church and Spouse, giving her a most kind and loving Name, expressing his kind and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Love unto her, <hi>O thou fairest among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But this may seem strange, for the Church confesseth before, that she was black and Sunburnt, deformed,</hi> &amp;c <hi>How then can Christ call her,</hi> Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est among Women.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
                  <p>The Church and every true Believer, are black and deformed in themselves, vile and deformed by Nature, and they can see no beauty in themselves, but are blemished; yea, &amp; stain'd with Sins Original and Actual. But as they are sanctified by his Spirit, washed with his Blood, and cloathed in his Righteousness, they are Fair and Beautiful in the sight of God, because <hi>Christ hath washed them from all their sins in his Blood</hi>; &amp;c. covered them with the pure Robes of his own Righteousness.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Here mark the endless love of Christ Jesus to his poor Church and People, that esteemeth so highly of them, as if they had no spot of sin &amp; uncleanness, though they in themselves be black, deformed, and polluted; yet all those who truly repent, embrace Jesus Christ, and believe in him, that are washed from their sins, Sanctified by his Spirit, and obey his Will, all these are Fair;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002963_0117_0FE6AA7B6A0E0978"/>
Yea, most Beautiful in his Eyes. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by wicked <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he saw no policy nor device could take any place against the Church of God. Hereunto come the titles and commendations given to the Church so often in this most excellent Book of the <hi>Canticles: She is the Rose of the Field, the Lilly of the Valley, the fairest among Women, an Orchard of Pomegranates, a Well of Springing Waters, the Spouse and Sister of Christ, the Beauty of the Earth, the Glory of the World, a Lilly among Thorns, &amp;c.</hi> These and the like serve to confirm the everlasting truth of this Doctrine unto us, how dear and precious the Church is in Christ's sight, that of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Assemblies of Men in the World, none are more excellent and worthy, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and lovely, none more beautiful &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, than the <hi>Church of God, the Spouse of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Reason of the Doctrine is apparent. Man was first cast out of Paradise for sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing that doth hinder his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but only sin; for it is sin that separates &amp; hinders all good things from us. For so long as sin remains, it's a weighty burden to press down a sinner into Hell, &amp; the wages of it is Eternal Death, Therefore if sin be pardoned, as it is to all the Elect, what should hinder their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? God hath against them no displeasure, the Obedience of Jesus Christ being imputed unto them, Heaven cannot be denied them, but they must needs be saved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ Jesus doth esteem highly of his Church, and the Church is most excellent in her self, because in it, alone Salvation is to be

found, and no where else. When the LORD brought the great and general Deluge over the face of the whole Earth, what place was there left more excellent than the Ark, in which <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family were saved, &amp; the whole World besides Perished? What was the Ark but a type and figure of Christ's Church, wherein Salvation is to be found, and out of which is no Salvation to be looked for. Seeing therefore, that Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins is proper only to Christ's Church, &amp; that therein is Salvation and Eternal Life to be found, we may safely conclude, that the Estate of Christ's Church, and every Member thereof, is most excellent and Blessed.</p>

               <p>Dost thou Repent of thy Sins, and art truly humbled for 'em? <hi>Dost thou embrace Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus for the Pardon of them? Hath God Sanctified thy Heart by his Spirit, so that thou hatest every wicked way, and desirest and endeavourest to obey God's Will in all his Commandments</hi>?

Indeed many a poor Child of God looking upon their own infirmities, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002963_0118_0FE648707818EA88"/>
manifold corruptions, see themselves to be black indeed, deformed and stained with sin; it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them <hi>that</hi> they hang down their heads and go drooping <hi>all</hi> their days, striving &amp; struggling with their rebellious Hearts, and vile corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thinking <hi>that</hi> Christ Jesus cares not for them, cannot love them, being so defil'd with sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But be not discouraged; for if thou repent of them, believe in Christ, hate thy sins, and prayest often to God, to give thee power to withstand them, using all godly means so to do, Christ Jesus will cover, &amp; pass by them all, as he dealth with</hi> David, Peter, <hi>&amp;c, Oh then! What care ought all men daily to take to be members of this Society, that they may have a part in all these excellent Prerogatives? And then though the World esteem them not, but count them miserable, grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and nodding at them with their Head, and every way contumeliously reproaching them, yet they are most dear and precious in the sight of Christ, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them with the Ransom of his own Blood.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>; thou must embrace that Faith, Religion, and Worship of the Lord which they did; that is meant by the <hi>Steps of the Sheep.</hi> Secondly, thou must <hi>feed thy Kids,</hi> that is, thou must embrace that same Doctrine which the Ancient Shepherds, Fathers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles have taught and delivered<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And if thou thus tread in the steps of the Sheep, as <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. and embrace and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Doctrine taught by the Prophets and holy Apostles in the Old and New Testament, thou shalt then know where I feed my Sheep, that thou mayst feed with them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me for the true Shepherd.</p>

               <head>A Direction to know which is the true Church.</head>
               <p>From this Answer of Christ, we learn a clear direction to know true Religion, and the true Worship of God, from false Religion &amp; false Worship. If any Man desires to know where Christ feeds his Sheep, and God is truly and rightly worshipped, where true Religion is, we must then <hi>tread in the steps of the sheep</hi>; that is, we must worship God, as <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did, as <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets did, tread in their steps, &amp; follow their Godly Examples, believe, repent, and walk with God
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002963_0121_0FE6AA91581B8240"/>
by Faith, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did. Such as these are the true Sheep of Christ; for of them our Saviour speaketh here, and not of a company of Popes, which greatly boast of their Succession, which we <hi>will</hi> not deny to be a Succession of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as Cardinals, Jesuits, and the like of that Rabble; of whom to think that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this Fold, I know not from whence I should fetch my Charity. Again, we must embrace and believe the Doctrine taught by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, Christ &amp; his Apostles, who were the true Shepherds, &amp; the faithful Pastors of the Church of God. <hi>To the Law &amp; the Testimony, if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.</hi> And again, <hi>Thus said the Lord, stand in the ways, and behold and ask for the old way, which is the good way, and walk therein, and you shall find peace &amp; rest for your Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, if we desire to know the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the true Worship and Service of God, this is the way which I here teach, and deliver from the Lord Jesus Christ, against the Doctrine of <hi>Rome: viz.</hi> To enquire of the Faith, true Religion, and manner of Worshipping performed by <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Patriachs and Prophets, Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; believe that, embrace that, and rest your Souls on that.</p>
               <p>This then may serve to decide a great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and a long Controversie, between us &amp; the Papists: They affirm, That they are the true Church, and we Hereticks: We believe and hold, that we are the true Church of God, and that they are not, but <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Synagogue of Satan. This then is the main
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002963_0121_0FE6AA91581B8240"/>
Question, whether they or we are the true Church? Who should judge? Even the Lord Christ Jesus himself in his own Word; we must rest upon him, and flee unto him, and if the Papists would do so too, they would never have run into a Labyrinth of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, as they have at this very day; for Christ would quickly have put an end to all. For he saith, they are the true Church which <hi>tread in the steps of the Sheep, and feed by the tents of the Shepherds.</hi> That is, those People that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Worship of God, as <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and that old Religion, which they believed and embraced, is the true Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> For that was taught by the holy Servants of the Almighty, who were the faithful Shepherds and Pastors, sent of God unto his Church. Now let us try, whether the Papists or the Protestants, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Church of <hi>England</hi> do thus. For the Papists, although they call their Religion the old Religion; yet alas, it is newly devised, the greatest part of it within these four or five Hundred years.</p>
               <p>They teach such Doctrine as was never known to <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses,</hi> or the Prophets; it was never known to Christ or his Apostles: They have lost the <hi>steps of the Sheep, and the tents of the Shepherds,</hi> and have got a new Religion of their own devising; they walk not in the steps of the Flock, but in the steps of the proud Popes, covetous Cardinals, leacherous Fryars, lascivious Monks: They have devised a thousand things in the Service and Worship of God, against his Word, &amp; against the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles; meerly for their own gain. Where shall we ever find, that <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:002963_0122_0FE6AA97B15AF2E0"/>
and the Prophets, pray'd unto Angels &amp; Saints, Worshipped Images, prayed for the dead, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be saved by their own Works, by vowing of chastity, or by their Poverty? If they can shew me, any soul mouth'd Jesuit of them all, but any one Example in the whole Book of God, or any of God's Children, that have performed 'em, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>will</hi> then lay my hand upon my Mouth. In the mean time give me leave, O ye Papists, to tell you, that you are none of Christ's Church, you are none of Christ's Sheep, for you have left the <hi>steps of the Sheep, and the tents of the Shepherd:</hi> The Doctrine taught by the Prophets of God, Christ and his Apostles; and therefore are no better than the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Synagogue of Satan: And as there hath been a succession of Popes and Cardinals, so they are a succession of Hereticks, that seduce ignorant people for their own private gains.</p>
               <p>But as for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we believe, and firmly embrace that old and true Religion, that is, the same Faith which <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> used. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>II.</hi> Directions how to Die well.</head>
               <p>THink that the greatest Work thou hast to do in this World is to Die well, &amp; to make an happy Departure out of this World. They which Die well, Die not to Die, but to Live Eternally.</p>
               <p>Be every Day ready to leave this Life. That Man doth finish his Days in best sort, that every Day esteemeth the last Day of his Life to be present and at hand.</p>
               <p>Endeavour before Death come upon thee, to pull out his Sting, and take from him his Power and Strength, by humbling thy self in the time present for all thy Sins past, &amp; by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy self unto God for the time to come. That man can never Die ill, that hath a Care to live well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inure thy self by little and little to Die before thou come to that Point that thou must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eds Die. He that leaves the World before the World leaves him, gives Death, the Hand like a welcome Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and departs in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chiefly when thou art Visited with Sickness, or Old Age, think either of these a Summoner, Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e long to appear before the Great Lord, Judge of all the World: Therefore now prepare to set all things in good order, and make thing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ready.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make a new Examination of thy self, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation passed. Make a new Confession unto God of thy new and particular Sins: As God sendeth new Corrections and Chastisements, make new Prayers, &amp;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002963_0124_0FE6AAAF45DC3A98"/>
more earnest than ever before, for Pardon of thy Sins, and Reconciliation with God in Christ; by all means avoid those Sins which thou findest &amp; feelest encrease the Wrath of God against thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seek Reconciliation with thy Neighbour, by free forgiveness of them that have offended thee, and earnestly desire to be forgiven of <hi>all</hi> that have offended thee. Set thine House and Family in order, by disposing of thy worldly Goods in thy Will and Testament; thereby thou shalt Die not the more quickly, but the more quietly, and prevent the Brawls &amp; jars <hi>that</hi> otherwise (when thou art gone) may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from thine Heirs. Thou partest with earthly Possessions, and art going to take Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Heavenly.</p>
               <p>In the last Agony of Death, when <hi>all things,</hi> in and of the World do fail &amp; forsake thee rest thy self by Faith on the Favour &amp; Mercy of God in Christ, and Comfort thy self in the Lord thy God. What shall separate from the Love of God in Christ? Not Life nor Death.</p>
               <p>Let thine Heart and Tongue be still employ'd in Prayer to the Lord: First, for Patience in thy Trouble. Secondly, For Comfort in thine Affliction. Thirdly, For Strength in Weakness. Fourthly, For Deliverance at his Pleasure: Yea, endeavour to Die Praying. When thou art in the depth of Miseries, and at the Gates of Death, there is a depth of God's Mercy, which is ready to hear and help thee. Misery must call upon Mercy.</p>
               <p>Be willing and ready to depart out of this World without murmuring or repining, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, wheresoever, or howsoever it <hi>shall</hi> please the Lord to <hi>call</hi> thee. For why shouldest thou
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002963_0124_0FE6AAAF45DC3A98"/>
unwillingly suffer a short Death that <hi>will</hi> bring thee to the Fruition of Eternal Joys? Perswade thy self, <hi>that</hi> if thou live by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, thou shalt do <hi>well</hi>; but if thou Die, doubt not but thou shalt do better. And with a free Heart speak it, <hi>Come, Lord Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, When thou feelest Death approaching, commend thy departing Soul into the Holy Hands of God: He gave it, to him surrender it again. So laying thy self down to sleep and rest, God shall make thee to dwell in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Safety. <hi>The Grave is ready for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A good Life <hi>till</hi> Death, and a good Death after a good Life, are the best means to attain an eternal happy Life in Heaven. As Death leaveth thee, so <hi>shall</hi> Judgment find thee. <hi>Christ is to me both in Life and Death advantage.</hi>

            <p>THere was a certain Divine famous in Learning and Piety, that did earnestly importune God by Prayer, for some time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conceiving <hi>that</hi> he had not the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ways of God, notwithstanding his much Learning attained by long Studies; deg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>that</hi> God would give him to know more of Him, and himself, and <hi>that</hi> God would direct him to some <hi>that</hi> would teach him the way of Truth; And being inflamed at a certain time with Vehemency of desire, a Voice as was supposed, spoke thus to him: <hi>Go forth into the Church Yard, and there thou must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
