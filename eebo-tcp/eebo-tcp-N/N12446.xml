            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I SHALL make no apology for writing this pamphlet; ſure I am it was meant for your good: Beſides, this is not the firſt time I have mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my quill in your behalf. Many times have I hazarded my life for you, as well as for my own property; and if occaſion ſhall in future require, will freely do it again.</p>
            <p>ON my return from a barbarous captivity, (part of which extraordinary ſufferings was for your ſakes) to <hi>Bennington,</hi> the latter end of May, 1778, and having received the congratulations of a large circle of friends, and returned them the mutual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of compliment and friendſhip, and had agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably entertained ourſelves in commemorating the ſurprizing ſucceſs of the laſt campaign; —the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of a whole Britiſh army, with a BURGOYNE at their head: And after moving the flowing bowl, expatiated on the ever-memorable battle and victory of <hi>Bennington,</hi> the forerunner and grand typical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the deſtruction of the Northern army; we then took a retroſpective view of our old <hi>New-York</hi> quarrel, and entered into a diſcuſſion on the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015719_0003_0F99DFB5A3C4E028"/>
events of forming the new State of VERMONT, it then appeared to me to be a very political move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have ſince, upon mature deliberation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated on the good effects which cannot fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to the inhabitants, in ſo extenſive a fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier country, from the bleſſings of a well eſtabliſhed civil government; and think it worth my trouble to communicate my ſentiments and reflections to the public, with a view of encouraging the good and virtuous inhabitants of this State, to perſevere and be happy in the further confirming and eſtabliſhing the ſame.</p>
            <p>TO live in a ſtate of anarchy, has been found to be inconſiſtent with the wiſdom and practice of mankind in all ages and nations, particularly the civilized; and ſavage tribes have certain maxims, cuſtoms or traditions, which are ſubſtituted inſtead of written laws. Indeed, the ſtate and condition of men urgeth, nay, neceſſitates them to adopt ſome form of government for their mutual protection and defence: And, inaſmuch as a long courſe of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has, or in truth may convince every capable judge in the ſaid ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York</hi> never deſired to exerciſe juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional authority over the inhabitants of ſaid ſtate, for any other purpoſe but to oppreſs and deprive them of their lands and labours; therefore, it is our duty and intereſt to yield them no ſubjection. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was not becauſe they loved us or we them; for, the hatred ſubſiſting between us, is equivalent to that which ſubſiſts between the Independent States of <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Every overture of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015719_0004_0F99DFB663BD8558"/>
pretended peace and friendſhip to us, is big with miſchief and ſecret deſign to entrap and enſnare the unwary among us, to divide us, and overturn our new government. This may be learnt from their late proclamation, as well as from many other ways and arts uſed particularly in the ſouth-eaſt corner of <hi>Cumberland</hi> county, where there are many Tories, who, to a man, through the whole ſtate, are uſing their influence and intrigues againſt our new ſtate, in favour of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> which, for certain motives they prefer.</p>
            <p>BUT, to take a retroſpective view of the conduct of that government towards us, from four to ſix, or ſeven years ago, and we ſhall find that the <hi>New York</hi> patentees got judgment againſt thoſe under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> at trials at common law; but the claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> appealed to club law, and, in this mode of trial, they beat the claimants under <hi>New-York;</hi> and, in thoſe days, a ſort of mob go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the now county of <hi>Bennington</hi> took place, which, however deficient in moſt reſpects, was nevertheleſs the terror of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the only means by which we could poſſibly maintain the poſſeſſion of our lands. In the mean the then counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Glouceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> were greatly oppreſſed by the venality and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the government of <hi>New-York:</hi> This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the knowledge of the inhabitants in thoſe counties; though it is altogether probable, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided <hi>New-York</hi> government had conquered the Green Mountain Boys, and monopolized their lands, thoſe on the eaſt ſide of the mountain would have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015719_0005_0F99DFB74A8B3800"/>
ſhared the ſame fate. I have only to add, in this place, that in thoſe days civil government could not be aſſumed; but I now rejoice to ſee it eſtabliſhed. This is the happy aera which our worthy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend, Doctor <hi>Thomas Young,</hi> beautifully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf to the inhabitants of the ſtate of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> in theſe words: <q>As the ſupreme Arbiter of right has ſmiled on the juſt cauſe of <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> at large, you in a peculiar manner have been highly favoured; God has done by you the beſt thing commonly done for our ſpecies; he has fairly put it in your power to help yourſelves.</q> Our conſtitution is very much approved of in ſuch parts of the eaſtern ſtates, where it has been circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; and though it be difficult, nay, impoſſible to form a mode of government to the entire ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole body politic; yet I am appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that there are as little, I may ſay leſs diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> as to matters of government, as in any of the eaſtern ſtates, <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> excepted. Probably, there are ſome in every ſtate who are averſe to any mode of government at all; and ſuch, I fear, are out of the reach of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reaſon; ſuch are untractable and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſouls, who enjoy no ſatisfaction in the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſpecies, or in the effuſion of domeſtic peace, order, and ſocial virtue: But all good and wiſe men, will exert themſelves in eſtabliſhing and ſupporting good government and order, which are inſeparably connected together: And though, in the tumults and confuſions of a cruel war, the preſent formed conſtitutions and modes of government may, and undoubtedly are, more or leſs imperfect; yet
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015719_0006_0F99DFBB8AAE44A8"/>
they may, in future, be corrected and amended as time of leiſure, cool deliberation, and experience may dictate.</p>
            <p>CERTAIN I am, that our frontier country was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt neceſſity of forming into a civil and political government. They were obliged to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, not only an internal policy among themſelves, but an external policy againſt a foreign invaſion. This they could not truſt to <hi>New-York,</hi> who would have been rejoiced to have our inhabitants cut off, that their lands might have fallen into their hands; an object which they have been purſuing for more than ſeven years laſt paſt. In this extreme ſituation government was formed, and General <hi>Burgoyne</hi> at the ſame time advancing into the country. The Council of our new ſtate was very buſy and zealous in forming the militia into regiments, under brave officers, to face Mr. <hi>Burgoyne:</hi> At the ſame time Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Schuyler</hi> ordered our militia to march to <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taga;</hi> but the Council would not allow it, as they viewed <hi>Bennington,</hi> and the adjacent country, to be the object of deſtruction by the enemy, at leaſt, if not ſo, by their old adverſaries. The Council, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſent an expreſs to the Council of the ſtate of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> acquainting them of the diſtreſſed ſituation of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> and imploring their aſſiſtance, which <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> generouſly afforded, ſending their hero General <hi>Starks,</hi> with a brigade of valiant men, which being joined by the Green Mountain Boys, terminated in the memorable and twice glorious battles and victories of <hi>Bennington.</hi> This proved the ſalvation of our new ſtate, and had
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015719_0007_0F99DFBCC3955008"/>
its ſalutary influence on the pending cauſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent States of <hi>America</hi> at large, and is a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof of the good policy of aſſuming govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>ANY one who is acquainted with mankind and things, muſt know, that it is impoſſible to manage the political matters of this country without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of civil government. A large body of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deſtitute of it, is like a ſhip in the ſea without a helm or mariner, toſſed by impetuous waves. We could not enjoy domeſtic peace and ſecurity alone, ſet aſide the conſequences of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> war and <hi>New-York</hi> ſtrife, without civil regulations. The two laſt conſiderations do, in the moſt ſtriking manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to ſtrengthen and confirm the government already ſet up by the authority of the people, which is the fountain of all temporal power, and from which the ſubjects of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont</hi> have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received ſuch ſignal advantages. This puts us on an equal footing with our old <hi>New-York</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and will enable us to baffle all their ſchemes; and this the General Aſſembly of the State of <hi>New-York</hi> well knew, when they ſent forth their Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from <hi>Poughkeepſie,</hi> dated the 23d day of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 1778, and ſigned by his Excellency <hi>George Clinton,</hi>

                        <p>THAT the aforeſaid diſaffection has been greatly increaſed, by an act paſſed by the Legiſlature of the late colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy-four, entitled, "An Act for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting tumultuous and riotous aſſemblies in the places therein mentioned, and for the more ſpeedy and effectual puniſhing the rioters." That many of the aforeſaid diſaffected perſons, though unjuſtifiable in their oppoſition to the authority of this ſtate, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under grievances ariſing from the cauſes above mentioned, which in ſome meaſure extenuate their offence, and which ought to be redreſſed.</p>
                        <p>THAT therefore the Legiſlature of this ſtate, while on the one hand, they will vigorouſly maintain their rightful ſupremacy over the perſons and property of thoſe diſaffected ſubjects, will on the other hand, make overtures to induce the voluntary ſubmiſſion of the delinquents.</p>
                        <p>THAT an abſolute and unconditional diſcharge, and remiſſion of all proſecutions, penalties and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, under the above-mentioned act, ſhall be an

            <p>THIS proclamation, after mentioning a diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of many perſons inhabiting the northeaſt parts of the county of <hi>Albany,</hi> and certain parts of the counties of <hi>Charlotte, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> proceeds to affirm that theſe tracts of country were clearly included within the antient, original, true and lately eſtabliſhed bounds of the ſtate of <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT many, nay almoſt the whole of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in thoſe counties, <hi>alias,</hi> the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> are diſaffected to the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> will not be diſputed. This is a fact: But it is not fact, that the ancient, original and true bounds of <hi>New-York</hi> included thoſe lands. The firſt intimation that ever ſaluted the ears of the public, aſſerting this doctrine, was, from a proclamation of Governor <hi>Tryon</hi>'s, dat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 11th day of December, 1771, which begins thus: <q>Whereas, it is the ancient and inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015719_0015_0F99DFC5F3F79AA8"/>
right of this colony, to extend to <hi>Connecticut</hi> River as its eaſtern boundary.</q> This aſſertion hath been anſwered at large in my Treatiſe on the Conduct of this Government towards the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers, to which I refer the reader, and at preſent obſerve, that as the quoted aſſertions in theſe proclamations, are wholly without foundation, they need only to be as poſitively denied as they are aſſerted. The fact is, that the tract of land which now comprehends the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> was univerſally known to be in the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> Thus it was placed by all Geographers in their maps, 'till the year 1764, when the now <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, for certain political reaſons, which I ſhall mention, extended the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York</hi> over the premiſes, by his ſpecial royal authority. At the time of the alteration of this juriſdiction, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies had fir'd the minds of King and Parliament againſt the growth and riſing power of <hi>America,</hi> and at this time they began to advance men and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into power, with a political deſign to cruſh the liberties of <hi>America. New-York</hi> had ever been their favourite government: They could almoſt vie with <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in the art of vaſſalaging common people, and in eraſing every idea of liberty from the human mind, by making and keeping them poor and ſervile. This <hi>Great-Britain</hi> well knew; and therefore ſliced a large territory from <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and added it to <hi>New York,</hi> to depreſs the power of the one, and enlarge and extend the other. A well concerted plan: But the Green Mountain Boys diſconcerted it, by throwing their weight in to the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015719_0016_0F99DFC729E791D0"/>
ſcale of Congreſs, which, thank God, has fairly ponderated. Thus may be ſeen the deſign, as well as date, of the original, ancient and true bounds of the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi>'s being extended over the ſtate of <hi>Vermont;</hi> and, for the ſame reaſon it was thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> it will undoubtedly be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed by Congreſs.</p>
            <p>AS to the acts of outlawry, mentioned in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, they died a natural death the firſt day of January, 1776, as may be ſeen from the act itſelf, here quoted:
<q>And be it further enacted by the authority aforeſaid, that this act ſhall remain and continue in full force and effect, from the paſſing thereof, until the firſt day of January, which will be in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-ſix.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſubjects of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont</hi> were under no apprehenſions from theſe old, lifeleſs acts: Nor do I conceive, that the preſent Legiſlature of the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi> have laid them under any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in granting them a pardon. It was a matter which formerly reſpected Governor <hi>Tryon,</hi> the old Legiſlature of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the Green Mountain Boys; and the party laſt mentioned, chooſe to ſettle that old quarrel with Mr. <hi>Tryon,</hi> and reſent it, that the Legiſlature of the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi> have, ſo late in the day, undertook to give an <q>Unconditional diſcharge and remiſſion of all penalties and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures incurred,</q> under an act, which had been long dead; and which, when alive, ſerved only to diſcover to the world, the wickedneſs and depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015719_0017_0F99DFC89BCF6280"/>
of that legiſlative body which enacted them. In the lifetime of this act, I was called by the <hi>Yorkers</hi> an outlaw, and afterwards by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> was called a rebel; and I humbly conceive, that there was as much propriety in the one name as the other, and I verily believe, that the King's Commiſſioners would now be as willing to pardon me for the ſin of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, provided I would afterwards be ſubject to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as the Legiſlature abovementioned, provided I would be a ſubject to <hi>New-York;</hi> and, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I had as leave be a ſubject to the one as the other, and, it is well known, I have had great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with them both.</p>
            <p>NEXT, I propoſe to conſider that part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation called Overtures, which are contained in the three firſt articles. Article 1ſt. <q>That all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons actually poſſeſſing and improving lands, by title under grants from <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> of <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay,</hi> and not granted under <hi>New-York,</hi> ſhall be confirmed in their reſpective poſſeſſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS firſt article cannot be conſidered of any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial conſequence, inasmuch, as among almoſt the whole poſſeſſions referred to in the article, there are but very few, if any, but what are covered with <hi>New-York</hi> grants.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond article is as follows: <q>That all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons poſſeſſing and improving lands, not granted by either of the three governments, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their reſpective poſſeſſions, together with ſuch additional quantity of vacant land, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015719_0018_0F99DFC8AF0907E8"/>
contiguous to each reſpective poſſeſſion, as may be neceſſary to form the ſame into a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient farm, ſo as the quantity of land to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to each reſpective poſſeſſion, ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed three hundred acres.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NEITHER of theſe two firſt articles, called Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, affect the controverſy, except in ſome very few inſtances, inasmuch as all, or in a manner all the poſſeſſions ſpoken of, were firſt granted by <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> except ſome few which were granted by <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay;</hi> and then, laſtly, almoſt the whole of thoſe poſſeſſions regranted by <hi>New-York.</hi> This being the caſe, what has been hitherto propoſed, does not reach the eſſence of the controverſy, as the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> very well know; beſides, it is not in the power of the government to confirm any of thoſe poſſeſſions which have been already granted, and therefore become the property of the grantees, as will be more fully diſcuſſed in its proper place. I proceed to the third article of the much boaſted O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THAT where lands have been heretofore grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, and actually poſſeſſed in conſequence thereof, and being ſo poſſeſſed, were afterwards granted by <hi>New-York,</hi> ſuch poſſeſſion ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, the poſterior grant under <hi>New-York</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH it is abſolutely out of the power of the ſaid legiſlative authority, to confirm the poſſeſſions
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015719_0019_0F99DFC93499C648"/>
mentioned; yet, to diſcover their want of generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their propoſal, I ſhall, in the firſt place, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a trifling proportion of thoſe poſſeſſions could be confirmed upon their own ſtating, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the confirming clauſe in the article, only confirms the poſſeſſor, who being ſo poſſeſſed at the time that the <hi>New-York</hi> grant was laid, and has no reſpect to any additional poſſeſſion carried on after the grant took place: The identical words are, <q>And being ſo poſſeſſed, were afterwards granted by <hi>New-York;</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> After ſuch poſſeſſion was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made, and the poſſeſſor being ſo in poſſeſſion, at the time the grant took place, ſuch poſſeſſion ſhall be confirmed, but any later poſſeſſion cannot be included in the condition of "being ſo poſſeſſed;" for, a later poſſeſſion was no poſſeſſion at all at the time the condition of poſſeſſion took place; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, every poſſeſſion which has been begun in the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> ſince the lands were granted by <hi>New-York,</hi> muſt be loſt to the poſſeſſor, and fall into the hands of the <hi>New-York</hi> grantees, with all other uncultivated lands in the ſtate; and all our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes of thoſe lands from <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> fall to the ground, together with our poſſeſſions, which have been increaſed an hundred fold.</p>
            <p>THESE Overtures have hitherto been conſidered only in a grammatical and logical ſenſe, allowing them their own conſtruction; I now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in a law ſenſe. A legiſlative authority, within its own juriſdiction, may confirm a poſſeſſion on vacant land, by making a grant of the ſame to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015719_0020_0F99DFC9EC878558"/>
the poſſeſſor: But, for the legiſlative authority of the ſtate of <hi>New York,</hi> to pretend as they do in their proclamation, to vacate any grants made by their own authority, in favour of any poſſeſſion, and to confirm ſuch poſſeſſions, by nullifying and defeating their own grants, is the height of folly and ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For, the lands being once granted, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paſſeth to the grantee, who is become the ſole proprietor of the ſame; and he is as independent of that legiſlative authority which granted it, as any perſon may be ſuppoſed to be, who purchaſeth a farm of land of me by deed of conveyance; and it is as much out of the power of that legiſlature to vacate a grant made by them, or the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in favour of any poſſeſſor, as it is out of my power to vacate my deed of conveyance in favour of ſome ſecond perſon. It is contrary to common ſenſe, to ſuppoſe, that the property of the ſubject is at the arbitrary diſpoſal of the Legiſlature: If it was, they might give a grant to-day, and vacate it to-morrow, and ſo on, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> This would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very nature and exiſtance of perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as the whole would depend on the ſovereign will and laſt act of the Legiſlature: But the truth of the matter is, the firſt conveyance will, and ought to hold good; and this defeats all ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid on this ſubject, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Overtures in the Proclamation ſet forth, are either romantic, or calculated to deceive woods people, who, in general, may not be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to underſtand law, or the power of a legiſlative authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:015719_0021_0F99DFCAD1E82AE0"/>I HAVE further to evince my arguments on this ſubject, by the concurring opinion of the Lords of the Board of Trade, on complaint made to them from thoſe very perſons, poſſeſſing the lands we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. That clauſe of their report which is ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to what I have argued, is in theſe words: <q>Such ſubſequent grants made by the government of <hi>New York,</hi> however unwarrantable, cannot be ſet aſide by any authority from his Majeſty, in caſe the grantees ſhall inſiſt on their title.</q>

            <p>THUS it appears, in a trial (of the ſame caſe we are treating of) before the Board of Trade, that the King, under whoſe authority the government of <hi>New-York</hi> had, in an oppreſſive manner granted thoſe very lands, could not, by his royal authority, vacate or ſet aſide the grants; yet the preſent legiſlative authority of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> proclaim to the world, and pledge the faith of government, that they will do it: But enough has been ſaid on the impoſſibility of it, as well as on the ungenerouſneſs of the propoſal: And as to the quit-rents, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont</hi> will determine their expediency, and probably releaſe them all.</p>
            <p>WHAT has been obſerved, anſwers every part of the Proclamation worth notice, as the five laſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles had an entire reference to the three firſt; though, it may be worth obſerving, that the time of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe Overtures are run out, and, it is my opinion, that but few of the ſubjects of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont</hi> have cloſed with them. The main induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

I had in anſwering them was, to draw a full and convincing proof from the ſame, that the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, beſt, and moſt eligible, I had almoſt ſaid, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible way of vacating thoſe <hi>New-York</hi> interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grants, is, to maintain inviolable the ſupremacy of the legiſlative authority of the independent ſtate of <hi>Vermont:</hi> This, at one ſtroke, overturns every <hi>New-York</hi> ſcheme which may be calculated for our ruin, makes us free men, confirms our property, "and puts it fairly in our power to help ourſelves," in the enjoyment of the great bleſſings of a free, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted and virtuous civil government. You have fought, bled, and hitherto conquered, and are as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving theſe good fruits of your valour, hazard and toil, as any people under heaven.</p>
            <p>YOU have experienced every ſpecies of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the old government of <hi>New-York,</hi> with a <hi>Tryon</hi> at their head, could invent and inflict; and it is manifeſt, that the new government are minded to follow nearly in their ſteps. Happy it is for you that you are fitted for the ſevereſt of tryals, you have been wonderfully ſupported, and carried through thus far in your oppoſition to that government. Formerly you had every thing to fear from it: But now you have little to fear, for your public character is eſtabliſhed, and your cauſe known to be juſt. In your early ſtruggles with that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you acquired a reputation of bravery; this gave you a reliſh for martial glory, and the Britiſh invaſion opened an ample field for its diſplay, and you have gone on conquering and to conquer until

TALL GRENADIERS are diſmayed and tremble at your approach. Your frontier ſituation often obliges you to be in arms and battles; and by repeated marchings, ſcoutings and manly exerciſes, your nerves have become ſtrong to ſtrike the mortal blow. What enemy to the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> or <hi>New-York</hi> land monopolizer, ſhall be able to ſtand before you in the day of your fierce anger!</p>
