            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cash.</hi> I therefore cannot a little wonder at the great indiscretion of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who Refuse to accept that, which they call <hi>Paper-mony,</hi> as pay of equal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue with the best <hi>Spanish</hi> Silver. What? is the word <hi>Paper</hi> a scandal to them?

their management as ill, and that they have needlesly drawn the Charges upon us; pray tell them, as long as they enjoy the <hi>Choice of Administrators,</hi> they must bear what's <hi>past,</hi> and right themselves for the <hi>future,</hi> by chusing better next, if they know where to find them; So Merchants do with their Factors, and 'tis their only Remedy.</p>
            <p>You know Sir you and <hi>I</hi> have had some former Discourse about the <hi>Nature of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> That (as such) it is but a <hi>Counter</hi> or <hi>Measure</hi> of mens Proprieties and Instituted <hi>mean</hi> of permutation.

But as <hi>Mony</hi> it is no more than what was said, And had it's <hi>Original</hi> from a general ignorance of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Arithmetick; But now these Arts being commonly known may well Discharge <hi>mony</hi> from the conceited Necessity thereof in Humane Traffick.

a prank plaid in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> after the War. Some bought up the <hi>Soldiers Debenters</hi> at very low Rates, and then with half Debenters and half Mony purchased great Estates in Kings and Bishops Lands, (a fine Trade they made of it if it had held) but God shook his Lap at this disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and interloping gain; and a great unexpected Revolution made them lose both their Lands and Mony.

            <p>A better way (in my opinion) to make the <hi>Credit passable</hi> without Interruption, is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Raise the Rates of those above the <hi>common Standard,</hi> whom you catch Tardy in Debasing the Credit of your bills either by purchasing them with little mony; or sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling commodities for them at Excessive dearer Rates:</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. What if the <hi>General Court</hi> Declare by a Law, that if any man tender these Bills for payment of his Debts, to be accepted at their full value, which the Country has put upon

them; If any private person will not receive them so, That then the Government will not concern themselves for the recovery of those Debts, till all the <hi>Publick Debts</hi> are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. It is a known Maxim of Law in <hi>England</hi> (and <hi>I</hi> think in all other Countrys) that <hi>of Debts, The Kings must be first paid.</hi> And great reason for it; for why shall the Government secure <hi>others Debts</hi> by Law; and not <hi>their own?</hi> now if these refusers stay for their Debts till the Country be first serv'd they may stay till they are weary. And if hereafter they resolve to make no more <hi>Debts</hi> (for fear of this Law) I believe their Trading will be very dull.
