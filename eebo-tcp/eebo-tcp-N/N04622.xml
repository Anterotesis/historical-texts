            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005752_0004_1026F56F0F2C4700"/>
Houſe of</hi> DAVID, <hi>ſaying,</hi> SYRIA <hi>is confederate with</hi> EPHRAIM. The <hi>Original</hi> here rendered <hi>is confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,</hi> ſignifies, as a learned Critick obſerves, <hi>is reſted</hi>; and may import, not only that theſe confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Forces were joined, but that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready encamped in the Borders of the Tribe of EPHRAIM; which was not a great way diſtant from JERUSALEM the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of JUDEA. And no wonder that AHAZ, and all his loyal Subjects, were ſurprized at the Tidings of ſo powerful an Invaſion, threatning the Loſs of every Thing that was near and dear to them.</p>
            <p>IT was while King AHAZ was under fearful Apprehenſions as to the Conſequence of this <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy</hi> againſt him, that God ſent the Prophet ISAIAH with a ſpecial Meſſage to him; partly to huſh his Fears, by aſſuring him, that the Attempt of theſe Kings to rend his Kingdom from him ſhould prove vain; and partly to forewarn him of the Evil that ſhould befall his Land from another King, the King of ASSYRIA, upon whom he too much depended: Interpoſing, by the Way, as a ſure Ground of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to <hi>the Houſe of</hi> DAVID, under their preſent Difficulty, that remarkable Prophecy concerning the MESSIAH, that he ſhould be <hi>born of a Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Meſſage the Prophet was ſent to deliver to him begins with the 4th Verſe, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks him in that Language, <hi>Take Heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two Tails of thoſe ſmoaking Fire-brands, for the fierce Anger of</hi> REZIN <hi>with</hi> SYRIA, and of the Son of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005752_0005_1026F5717184C9D0"/>
REMALIAH. Some think the Advice here given to the King is intended, at leaſt in Part, to moderate his <hi>angry</hi> Reſentments. <hi>Take Heed, and be quiet.</hi> Look to it, that you keep your Temper; that you don't fly into a Paſſion; and ſpeak unadviſedly with your Lips: Have a Care you don't complain of Providence, and murmur againſt God for ſuffering theſe powerful Enemies to combine together in an enterprize to deprive you of your Crown, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave your People. But others more probably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Deſign of the Advice is, to reſtrain his Fear within due Bounds and Limits: As if it had been ſaid, See that you keep the Poſſeſſion of your ſelf; don't be diſpirited; don't ſuffer your Heart to melt and fail within you; don't let your Fears prevail ſo as to betray you into any Thing unworthy your Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as a King, or that may reflect Diſhonour on God.</p>
            <p>AND, as an Enforcement of this Advice, the Prophet, under the Direction of God, compares theſe <hi>confederate Kings,</hi> in a Way of Contempt, to <hi>two Tails of ſmoaking Fire-brands.</hi> They ſeemed to AHAZ <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>furious,</hi> like burning <hi>Brands of Fire</hi>; yea, his ſurpriſed Imagination repreſented their united Force by a <hi>raging Fire,</hi> whoſe Violence could not be reſiſted. But the Prophet, to allay his Fears, aſſures him from God they ſhould prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than <hi>ſmoaking Fire-brands.</hi> They might for a while make a Smoother; but they ſhould not be able to do him any conſiderable Hurt. Yea, he is commiſſion'd to tell him, they were only the <hi>Tails</hi> or <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>ſmoaking Fire-brands.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005752_0006_1026F57683C7F0F8"/>
Their Force was ſpent; they ſhould ſoon expire; they ſhould eaſily be put out.</p>
            <p>THE Prophet goes on with his Meſſage in the Words I have read to you for the Text, <hi>Becauſe</hi> SYRIA EPHRAIM, <hi>and the Son of</hi> REMALIAH <hi>have taken evil Counſel againſt thee, ſaying, Let us go up againſt</hi> JUDAH, <hi>and vex it; and let us make a Breach in it for us, and ſet a</hi> KING <hi>in the Midſt of it, even the Son of</hi> TABEAL. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, it ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs.</hi> In which Words the three following Things are obſervable,</p>
            <p n="1">I. A REPRESENTATION of the <hi>Deſign</hi> which the confederate Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL had formed againſt AHAZ; which was to dethrone him, and <hi>ſet a King in the Midſt of his Kingdom, even the Son of</hi> TABEAL.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE Reſolution of Heaven to <hi>bring this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to nought. Thus ſaith the Lord God, it ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this Reſolution; ſuggeſted in thoſe Words, <hi>Becauſe they have taken evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel againſt thee, ſaying, Let us go up againſt</hi> JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAH, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, theſe are the Particulars we ſhall diſtinctly conſider; but with all poſſible Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005752_0007_1026F579B0BAC310"/>
that we may have more Time to apply them to the Circumſtances of our <hi>Nation</hi> at this Day.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt Thing contained in the Words of the Prophet is a Repreſentation of the <hi>Deſign,</hi> which the confederate Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL had formed againſt AHAZ King of JUDAH.</p>
            <p>SYRIA, EPHRAIM, and <hi>the Son of</hi> REMALIAH are the <hi>Confederates</hi> ſpoken of in the Text, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Deſign againſt JUDAH: But, by a common Figure, SYRIA is here put for the <hi>King</hi> of SYRIA; and EPHRAIM being the known Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Term giving Denomination to the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> or the Kingdom of ISRAEL, and <hi>the Son of</hi> REMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAH being their King, he is the Perſon here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: So that by SYRIA, EPHRAIM, and <hi>the Son of</hi> REMALIAH, we are to underſtand the Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL. The ſame Thing is meant as if theſe two Kings had been mentioned by Name. To be ſure, theſe were the allied Potentates who had formed a <hi>Deſign</hi> againſt the Kingdom of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAH; and the <hi>Prophet</hi> here opens their Deſign, and plainly tells AHAZ their King what it was. And this he does by bringing them in, ſaying, as in the middle Clauſe of the Text, <hi>Let us go up againſt</hi> JUDAH, <hi>and vex it; and let us make a Breach in it for us, and ſet a</hi> KING <hi>in the midſt of it, even the Son of</hi> TABEAL. Their Scheme was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne AHAZ, and ſet up a PRETENDER in his Room, conſtituting him King of JUDAH.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005752_0008_1026F57E0EEA8310"/>WHO this Man was they intended to exalt to the Throne, we can't tell at this Diſtance of Time. He is called in the Text, <hi>the Son of</hi> TABEAL. And this is all we certainly know about him. Some conjecture he was a SYRIAN; others think he was an ISRAELITE; others a <hi>Native</hi> of JUDEA, but in the Intereſt of SYRIA and ISRAEL, and a fit <hi>Tool</hi> to ſerve their Turn. This ſeems moſt probable; and that he <hi>pretended</hi> ſome Sort of Right to the Crown, and had a Party in the Kingdom who abetted him. But whoever he was, and whether he pretended a Right to the Crown or not, he was the <hi>Creature</hi> of theſe confederate Kings, a ſutable Engine for them to work with; and therefore they reſolve to ſet the <hi>Crown</hi> of JUDAH on his Head. This was the Deſign they had principally in their View; and the <hi>Means</hi> they reſolved upon in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it, are particularly recorded in the Text.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Thing they determined upon, in a Way of Means, the Prophet expreſſes in their own Words, <hi>Let us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>go up againſt</hi> JUDAH. The Thing reſolved upon is an Invaſion of their Land. This they judged neceſſary; an Expedient without which they might not hope for Succeſs. 'Tis likely a Party in the Kingdom had an Affection for this <hi>Son of</hi> TABEAL, lik'd well the Scheme of making him King, and would gladly be aſſiſting in it, could a Way be contrived to bring about ſo great a Revolution. Such Intelligence as this at the Courts of SYRIA and ISRAEL might give Riſe to their Reſolution <hi>to go up againſt</hi> JUDAH. A conſiderable Force from <hi>abroad</hi> they judged might
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005752_0009_1026F57FAA01CCA8"/>
countenance the Diſaffected at <hi>home,</hi> and ſpirit them to riſe up in Rebellion againſt their rightful and lawful King: They therefore project an Invaſion, as a hopeful Method to ſucceed in their Intention to diſplace AHAZ, and ſet <hi>the Son of</hi> TABEAL on the Throne.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Means they reſolved upon whereby to effect this Deſign was, the filling JUDAH with <hi>Vexation</hi> and <hi>Sorrow. Let us go up againſt</hi> JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAH, ſay they, <hi>and vex it.</hi> The Meaning is, Let us ravage their Country, pillage and plunder their Towns and Cities, and ſo vex and harraſs them as to make them weary of adhering to their preſent King, and willing to take the <hi>Son of</hi> TABEAL to reign over them.</p>
            <p>NOR was this all, but they determine upon a more miſchievous Means ſtill in order to compaſs their Deſign againſt JUDAH; which was, <hi>to make a Breach in it for them. Let us go,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and make a Breach in it for us,</hi> i. e. ſay ſome, Let us penetrate into the Heart of the Country, advance even to JERUSALEM, the head or capital City of it, and make a Breach in its Wall, a Breach wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us to march in; without which there will be no Hope to ſet a King in the midſt of the Land. <hi>Let us make a Breach in it for us,</hi> i. e. ſay others, Let us rend the Kingdom from AHAZ, part in Twain, and ſhare it between us; placing over it a King of our own, <hi>the Son of</hi> TABEAL, our very good Friend, in whom we have a joint Intereſt, and on whom we may both with Safety depend.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005752_0010_1026F584B6533DE8"/>
               <hi>Let us make a Breach in it for us,</hi> i. e. ſay others, Let us tear the Kingdom to Peices by enflaming the Diſaffection there may be in the Minds of the People to their preſent King, and his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by promoting Broils and civil Diſcords among them, dividing and getting them into Parties. Let us work by the diſcontented, factious and turbulent Spirits there are among them; ſetting them one againſt another, whereby they will weaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ſtrengthen us.</p>
            <p>AND this Senſe of the Words, as it is agreeable to the <hi>Original,</hi> ſo it well ſutes with their Deſign to ſet up a <hi>new King.</hi> This is ſeldom attempted, unleſs a Nation is ſuppoſed to have thoſe within themſelves, who will help forward ſuch a Change. And when this is the Caſe, a foreign Invaſion is more likely to effect a Revolution in Government. This might be conſidered by the allied Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL, and they might go <hi>againſt</hi> JUDAH in Expectation of <hi>making a Breach in it,</hi> i. e. of dividing the People, ſtirring up in them a Spirit of Hatred, Animoſity and Variance: And they might probably hope to gain a Party from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to join in their Attempt againſt the Crown of AHAZ, and to exalt <hi>the Son of</hi> TABEAL to the Throne.</p>
            <p>THIS now was their <hi>Deſign</hi>: It aim'd at nothing ſhort of overturning the Conſtitution, of dethroning the King of JUDAH, and ſetting his Crown on the Head of a vagrant <hi>Pretender.</hi> And the Means in order to accompliſh this Deſign, was an Invaſion

of the Land; diſtreſſing its Inhabitants, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them into Parties.</p>
            <p>AND as they had concerted ſo plauſible a Scheme, they little doubted of Succeſs in the Execution of it: But this the righteous ſovereign God would not grant; which leads to the next Thing obſervable in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THE <hi>Reſolution</hi> of Heaven to bring this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to nought</hi>; contained in theſe Words, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, it ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs.</hi> Their Meaſures ſhall be broken, the Enterpriſe they have undertaken ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>

A Deſign is ſaid <hi>to ſtand,</hi> according to the Genius of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, when it takes Effect. Hence that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Prov. 30.11. <hi>The Counſel of the Lord ſtandeth forever.</hi> It forever takes Place. On the other Hand, A Deſign is ſaid <hi>not to ſtand,</hi> when it fails of its Accompliſhment, proves fruſtrate and vain. And this is the Thing here intended. <hi>It ſhall not ſtand.</hi> 'Tis as if it had been affirmed, it ſhall not be carried into Execution; but, like <hi>the Counſel of the Heathen be brought to nought</hi>; like <hi>the Devices of the People made of none effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005752_0012_1026F587D7520438"/>IT is added, <hi>neither ſhall it come to paſs.</hi> In the <hi>Original</hi> 'tis, <hi>neither ſhall it be</hi>; which may have a further Emphaſis in it. For a Thing purpoſed may be <hi>produced,</hi> and yet not <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi>; it may be bro't into <hi>Being,</hi> and for all that fall to the Ground and <hi>come to nothing.</hi> But this Reſult of <hi>their's</hi> ſhall never have Exiſtence: <hi>It ſhall not be.</hi> 'Tis as if the Prophet had ſaid, AHAZ ſhall not be dethron'd; JUDAH ſhall not be enſlaved. The Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL have deſign'd this; but it ſhall no more be, than if they had not formed ſuch a Deſign: So far from it, that theſe Kings themſelves ſhall be ſubdued, <hi>the Riches of</hi> DAMASCUS, the chief Seat of the King of SYRIA, <hi>ſhall be taken away</hi>; and EPHRAIM <hi>ſhall be broken that it be not a People,</hi> as it follows in this and the next Chapter.</p>
            <p>AND AHAZ, to whom this Meſſage was ſent, had reaſon to depend upon the Truth of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. For it is introduced with a <hi>thus ſaith the Lord God.</hi> The Prophet did not ſuggeſt his own Wiſhes; he did not deliver his own Conjectures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the probable Appearances of Things: But ſpake as immediately ſent from God, and ſaid nothing but what he was inſtructed from Heaven to ſay.</p>
            <p>AND that AHAZ might have no Reaſon for Doubt upon this Head, the Prophet, in God's Name, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him to aſk a <hi>Sign</hi> for the Confirmation of his Faith, Verſe 11. <hi>Aſk thee a Sign of the Lord thy God; aſk it either in the Depth, or in the Height above.</hi> He is permitted to make his own Choice, to aſk ſuch a Sign as he himſelf pleaſed, either in <hi>Heaven</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005752_0013_1026F58CBA1D49F0"/>
or <hi>Earth</hi>; as that the Sun might ſtand ſtill, or go back, or withdraw his Light for a while; or that there might be a Convulſion in the Earth, or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of it out of its Place, or the like extraordinary and miraculous Performance.</p>
            <p>ONE would think this was eno' to ſatisfy Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity itſelf; and yet, AHAZ was faithleſs and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. He refuſed this gracious condeſcending Offer of God, ſaying, as in the 12th Verſe, <hi>I will not aſk.</hi> He pretends indeed a <hi>pious</hi> Reaſon; <hi>I will not tempt the Lord</hi>: As if it would be a tempting God to do that which he had himſelf permitted, yea, directed him to do. But this was a meer Pretence. The <hi>true</hi> Reaſon, why he would not aſk a Sign was, becauſe he was reſolved to provide for his own Safety a ſecurer Way, as he imagined. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance was upon the ASSYRIANS for Help: He choſe rather to rely upon an Arm of Fleſh, than upon the God of JACOB, in whom is everlaſting Strength.</p>
            <p>UPON which the Prophet ſharply reproves, both <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>Houſe of</hi> DAVID, for their Contempt of the divine Offer he had made them: But withal lets them underſtand, that God would notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing give them a Sign. Verſe 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Hear ye now, O Houſe of</hi> DAVID, <hi>Is it a ſmall Thing for you to weary Men? But will ye weary my God alſo? Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a Sign; behold, A Virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a Son, and ſhall call his Name Immanuel. Butter and Honey ſhall he eat, that he may know to refuſe the Evil, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005752_0014_1026F58E68AA7DF0"/>
chuſe the Good. For before the Child ſhall know to refuſe the Evil and chuſe the Good, the Land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>A great deal has been wrote, eſpecially in the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon this Paſſage of Scripture, in order to aſcertain its true Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Some are of Opinion, that, by theſe Words, nothing more is intended, than that one who was now a Virgin ſhould marry and bear a Son, before whoſe coming to Years of Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Kings of SAMARIA and DAMASCUS ſhould be deſtroyed. And they give this Reaſon, why they put ſuch an Interpretation on the Words, becauſe the Child here promiſed to be born is given as a <hi>Sign</hi> to the <hi>Houſe of</hi> DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID, that they ſhould be delivered from that Ruin with which they were now threaten'd; which he could not be, if he was not to be <hi>then</hi> born, nor 'till above 500 Years afterwards: For a Sign in Scripture, ſay they, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Speech, ſignifies ſomething ſenſible, ſomething that is at preſent done in Confirmation of a divine Meſſage.</p>
                  <p>Others therefore to avoid this, and ſome other Difficulties, ſuppoſe a double View in the Words; that tho' <hi>literally</hi> they are to be interpreted of a Virgin that was ſpeedily to be married, and bear a Son; yet that they have a <hi>ſecondary</hi> and <hi>higher</hi> Meaning, looking forward to CHRIST, and pointing out his <hi>miraculous Birth of a pure Virgin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, perhaps, upon ſtrict Enquiry, it will be found, that theſe Words of the Prophet contain not only the <hi>Sign</hi> he had ſaid the Lord himſelf would give, but beſides that, a <hi>prophetic Promiſe,</hi> bro't in by Way of Parentheſis, looking forward to CHRIST, and deſcribing the Manner of his Conception and Birth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>prophetic Promiſe</hi> deſcriptive of the MESSIAH's Birth, is contained in the 14th and 15th Verſes, <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a Son, and ſhall call his Name Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual. Butter and Honey ſhall he eat, that he may know to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Evil, and chuſe the Good.</hi> The Evangeliſt MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEW, having given an Account of CHRIST as <hi>born of a Virgin,</hi> adds upon it that obſervable Remark, Chap. 1.22, 23. <hi>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the Prophet, ſaying, Behold, a Virgin ſhall be with Child, and ſhall bring forth a Son; and they ſhall call his Name Immanuel.</hi> 'Tis to me very plain, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt MATTHEW tho't this Paſſage in ISAIAH a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of CHRIST; foretelling that he ſhould be <hi>conceived in the Womb of a Virgin,</hi> and <hi>born of one who knew no Man.</hi> And when he ſays of CHRIST's being born of a Virgin, <hi>that it was, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord, by the Prophet,</hi> it is evident, he ſpeaks of this Event as an Accompliſhment of this Prophecy. I know, it has been pleaded by ſome, that nothing more is intended by the Phraſe, <hi>this was done that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet,</hi> than only an Analogy between the Birth of CHRIST, and the Birth of a Child in the Days of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ISAIAH, an Event now anſwering to an Event in former Times: But this by no Means comes up to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Force of the Expreſſions here uſed. In the <hi>Original</hi> the Language is as ſtrong as in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation: And there are no Words, either in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wherein it could have been more peremptorily declared, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of CHRIST in the Womb of one that was a pure Virgin, <hi>was the Thing propheſied by the Prophet</hi> ISAIAH, and that this Prophecy received its real intended Fulfillment in the Conception and Birth of CHRIST, as here related.</p>
                  <p>The plain Truth is, this Prophecy, ſtrictly and literally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, agrees to none but CHRIST; and it was perfectly anſwered in him. 'Tis evident from the current Strain of the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> writers, that he was <hi>born of a Virgin,</hi> literally ſpeaking; that he really was the Thing intended by IMMANUEL, <hi>God with us,</hi> God and Man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God manifeſted in the Fleſh, and dwelling with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and that he was nouriſhed and bro't up like other Children, tho' he was not born like them, but of a Virgin. <hi>Butter and Honey did he eat,</hi> i. e. he was fed, when a Child, with the common Aliment given to Children in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which was <hi>Milk or Butter and Honey.</hi> And he was thus nouriſhed, <hi>that he might know,</hi> or until he ſhould know, as the Words might be more intelligibly rendered, <hi>to refuſe the Evil and chuſe the Good.</hi> So that this Prophecy is ſtrictly and properly applicable to CHRIST, and was fulfilled in him.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs indeed, I can't ſee how this Prophecy of the Birth of CHRIST could be a <hi>Sign</hi> to the <hi>Houſe of</hi> DAVID, that they ſhould not be cut off; as it was not to be fulfilled 'till ſo many Ages after its Delivery: But it's eaſy to ſee, how it could be an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to them that they ſhould not, and an Aſſurance ſeaſonably and properly given, as, at this Time, they were threaten'd with a total Invaſion by two powerful Kings, who had entred into an Alliance for this Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But you will aſk then, What was the <hi>Sign</hi> here given? For the Prophet ſays, <hi>the Lord himſelf would give them a Sign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in order to point this out unto you, I muſt put you in Mind, that when the Prophet ISAIAH was bid to go forth to meet AHAZ, he was ordered by God to take with him his <hi>little Son</hi> SHEAR-JASHUB, as you may ſee, Verſe 3. And accordingly he was the Child that is here given, as a <hi>Sign</hi> to AHAZ and <hi>the Houſe of</hi> DAVID, that they ſhould not be deſtroyed. Says the Prophet, <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall give you a Sign.</hi> And the <hi>Sign</hi> is given, not in the Words immediately following, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> &amp;c.; [Theſe are rather Introductory to the Sign it ſelf, looking forward to the Birth of the MESSIAH of a Virgin] but in the 16th Verſe, in thoſe Words, <hi>For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Child ſhall know to refuſe the Evil and chuſe the Good, the Land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, Before this Child of mine, (pointing to him with his Finger) before this my Son SHEAR-JASHUB, whom God has ſent with me, ſhall come to a Capacity of diſtinguiſhing between moral Good and Evil, theſe Kings, of whom you are ſo dreadfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, ſhall be themſelves deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>I own, it would be more natural to interpret the whole Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, as one continued Period, ſpeaking <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> one and the ſame Child, if we had not previous Notice that God, for ſome ſpecial Purpoſe, had ordered the Prophet to take with him his little Son, when he went to AHAZ: And if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as pointing to this his Son, when he delivered theſe Words, <hi>Before this Child ſhall know to refuſe the Good and chuſe the Evil, the Land which thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings,</hi> 'tis eaſy and natural to underſtand him, as ſpeaking, in this Verſe, of a different Child from <hi>that</hi> he ſpake of in the two foregoing Ones: To be ſure, AHAZ and thoſe preſent with him could be at no Loſs to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him in ſuch a Senſe. And I ſee not, while we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret what is ſaid in the 14th and 15th Verſes, as a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic Promiſe,</hi> bro't in by way of <hi>Parentheſis</hi>; and what is ſaid in the 16th Verſe, as the <hi>Sign</hi> given by God to <hi>the Houſe of</hi> DAVID; I ſay, I ſee not, that the Interpretation is forced, or that it does at all interrupt the Period, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex its Senſe.</p>
                  <p>And I can't but think this the true Conſtruction, becauſe it interprets the whole Paſſage in a ſtrict and literal Senſe, and yet ſo as to free it from thoſe Objections which have been laid againſt it, as it has ſometimes been explained. For according to this Interpretation, here is an illuſtrious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of CHRIST, applicable to him, and to him only; and here is alſo a <hi>Sign</hi> diſtinct from this Prophecy, a true and proper Sign, adapted in its Nature to give preſent and ſufficient Confirmation to the Faith of <hi>the Houſe of</hi> DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID, in the Prophet's Meſſage, that they ſhould not be deſtroy'd by the Attempt that was how making againſt them.—If any ſhould reject this Interpretation for one that is more natural, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005752_0018_1026F597F9C64498"/>III. THE <hi>Reaſon</hi> of God's Reſolution to bring this Deſign formed againſt JUDAH to nought; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it was an <hi>evil</hi> Deſign. This <hi>Reaſon</hi> is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in thoſe Words. BECAUSE they <hi>have taken evil Counſel againſt thee, ſaying, Let us go up againſt</hi> JUDAH, &amp;c. The Matter of which their Reſult conſiſted was <hi>evil,</hi> and therefore devoted by God to Shame and Diſappointment. It was evil in reſpect of the <hi>Effects</hi> to be produced by it; and it was evil alſo in it's <hi>moral</hi> Nature, as being an outragious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Injuſtice and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>IT was an <hi>evil</hi> Deſign in reſpect of the <hi>Effects</hi> to be bro't to paſs. Theſe were as diſmal as could be deviſed by the Heart of Man. For not only might the ordinary Miſchiefs of War be expected, in Conſequence of this <hi>evil Counſel,</hi> but civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, inteſtine Broils, Hatred and Variance; which naturally and powerfully tend to divide a Kingdom againſt it ſelf, and bring it to Ruin. And what is ſtill worſe, their Counſels aimed at making a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in the Government; at cutting off AHAZ, and ſetting a PRETENDER on his Throne, to the utter Extermination of the <hi>Houſe of</hi> DAVID. What more ſhocking could they have enterprized? What more fatal in it's Conſequences to the Kingdom of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAH? Their King; the Succeſſion in his royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; their civil and religious Intereſts; their <hi>All</hi> was now threatned by the combined Forces of SY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA and ISRAEL.</p>
            <p>BUT this was an <hi>evil</hi> Deſign alſo in Reſpect of it's <hi>moral</hi> Nature. The Thing intended was vile;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005752_0019_1026F59A7B7CE5A8"/>
a Contrivance formed under the Influence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed Luſts and Paſſions, without either Reaſon or Juſtice to give Countenance to it. It does not appear that AHAZ had done theſe Kings any Wrong; without which their taking up Arms againſt him was highly injurious: Much more their Deſign to deprive him of his Crown, and place it on the Head of the <hi>Son of</hi> TABEAL; hereby ſubverting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of JUDAH, and making that happy People Slaves to a <hi>Tool,</hi> they had no other View in trying to advance to the Throne, than to ſerve their own baſe Purpoſes. There is ſcarce a Name bad enough to convey a full Idea of the Outrage, Violence, and Injuſtice of this Intention. It was abominable in the Sight of a holy and righteous God; and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to bring it to nothing.</p>
            <p>NOT that God always defeats the Counſels that are <hi>evil.</hi> He ſometimes ſuffers them to take Effect, for the Puniſhment of his own People, and to bring about his own Purpoſes, in the Changes he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſhould be made in the Kingdoms of this World. But when that which is <hi>evil,</hi> in it's <hi>Nature</hi> as well as <hi>Conſequences,</hi> is intended againſt a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he often interpoſes for their Help; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for this very <hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe the Deſign form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them is <hi>evil</hi>; hereby teſtifying againſt it as a Thing odious in his Sight. Thus it was here. Becauſe the Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL <hi>took evil Counſel againſt</hi> JUDAH, therefore <hi>the Lord God ſaid, it ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:005752_0020_1026F59DA59B9040"/>AND he might the rather come into this Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, becauſe the <hi>Counſel taken againſt</hi> JUDAH was, in a Senſe, a Contrivance to overſet an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own, forming. For 'tis obſervable, after SAUL, who was once King of the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had the Kingdom taken from him for his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, God gave it to DAVID, and ſettled it on <hi>him</hi> and on <hi>his Sons</hi> in Succeſſion forever. So that this Counſel to ſet <hi>the Son of</hi> TABEAL on the Throne of JUDAH was virtually an Attempt againſt God, and that <hi>Suceeſſion</hi> he had eſtabliſhed to run in the Family of DAVID.—But I muſt haſten to the</p>

Nor are any of you ignorant, that this Deſign was formed and carried on under the Countenance and Protection of two allied Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, the Kings of FRANCE and SPAIN, thoſe natural and inveterate Enemies of ENGLAND. At firſt, indeed, it look'd like a Contrivance of thoſe Princes to keep our Fleets at home, and prevent our ſending Forces abroad; but it is now too evident, that they have reſolved to make an Attempt againſt the Perſon and Crown of our rightful and lawful Sovereign, and are getting in Readineſs a Body of regular Troops to be ſent into ENGLAND upon this fatal Deſign. Their Counſel againſt GREAT-BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN appears to be like that in my Text againſt JUDAH, <hi>Let us go up againſt it, and ſet a King in the midſt of it, even the Son of</hi> TABEAL, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Friend and Tool, thro' whom we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all our Deſire: Which Counſel of their's,</p>

what Progreſs did King JAMES, the ſuppoſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the preſent PRETENDER, make towards bringing upon us this Yoke of Bondage, together with all the Miſeries of an arbitrary and tyrannical Government<note n="‡" place="bottom">The moſt perfect Account in a little Room, I have met with, of the <hi>popiſh arbitrary</hi> Meaſures of King JAMES II. I ſhall here give you, in the Words of Dr. KENNET, in his <hi>Thankſgiving Sermon</hi> for the <hi>Suppreſſion</hi> of the REBELLION in the Times of King GEORGE the Firſt. <q>This <hi>popiſh</hi> King, ſays he, in a ſhort Time, was to have a new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and a Rule of Government unknown to our Anceſtors, <hi>His Royal Will and Pleaſure.</hi> To evacuate all the Laws, he ſet up a diſpenſing Power, and to maintain that Power he ſet up a ſtanding Army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and againſt Conſent of the Parliament. He regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that Army, by bringing in <hi>popiſh</hi> Officers, and whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops. He placed <hi>popiſh</hi> Judges upon the Bench. He ſet a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> near the Head of the Privy Council. He went on to purge the Corporations, by turning out the Men of Abillity and Integrity, and thruſting in new and mean Creatures, for the Tools of Tyranny and Oppreſſion: And to remove all Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was iſſued to compel the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the ancient Charter, or to declare it null and void, and bring the Election of Magiſtrates to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Crown, as in the Capital City. If any Subjects offered to oppoſe the violent Tide, they were ſtopped by vexatious Suits, and loaded with exorbitant Fines. A Toleration was indeed granted without Law, and againſt it, only to divide and break the Proteſtant Intereſt, and to open the Gates towards FRANCE and ROME. The Church of ENGLAND had the leaſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: If her Clergy preached againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> they were ſilenced, or worſe treated; if a <hi>Biſhop</hi> would not obey an arbitrary Order, he was proſecuted and ſuſpended; if an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and his <hi>Brethren</hi> did but humbly petition againſt ſuch extraordinary Proceedings, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd in the Tower, and brought forth to be tried as Criminals. <hi>Popiſh</hi> Schools were ſet up, <hi>Maſs-Houſes</hi> were open'd in every Town, <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Habits along the Streets; nay they got the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Univerſities</hi> and of the Places of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in them.

An eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion was ſet up to vex and deſtroy the Church.

                        <q>My <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> This is certainly the greateſt Proof of the Truſt you have in us that can be given, which is the Thing that makes us value it the more, and we thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept what you have offered: And as I had no other Intention in coming hither, than to preſerve your Religion, Laws, and Liberties; ſo you may be ſure, that I ſhall endeavour to ſupport them, and ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to concur in any thing that ſhall be for the Good of the Kingdom, and to do all that is in my Power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Welfare and Glory of the Nation.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this was followed with the Acclamations of the People, which quickly flew over the whole City.

                     <p>In the Declaration which the Prince of ORANGE publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vindicating his Deſign to come over into ENGLAND, one Thing particularly mentioned is, <q>That there were great and violent Preſumptions, inducing his <hi>Highneſs</hi> to believe, that <hi>evil Councillors,</hi> in order to the gaining more Time for the effecting of their ill Deſigns, had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, <hi>That the Queen had bro't forth a Son</hi>; tho' there had appeared, both during the Queen's pretended Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the Manner wherein the Birth was managed, ſo many juſt and viſible Grounds of Suſpicion, that not only <hi>He himſelf,</hi> but <hi>all the good Subjects of this Kingdom,</hi> did <hi>vehemently ſuſpect,</hi> that the pretended Prince of WALES was not born of the Queen.

                     <p>1. That the King for certain Reaſons, was become incapable of Children. 2. That the Queen had been ſeven Years without being with Child, and for ſix Years in ſuch an ill State of Health, that thoſe about her were aſſured ſhe would have no more Children. 3. That all Things about her perſon, in the Time of her ſuppoſed pregnancy, were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be managed with a myſterious Secreſy, into which none were admitted but a few <hi>Papiſts.</hi> 4. That the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ANNE, not being well, was urged by the King with an unuſual Vehemence, and at his Deſire perſwaded by others, to go to the BATH; a Contrivance as was thought to have her out of the Way at the Queen's ſuppoſed Delivery: For upon her going thither, the Queen's <hi>Reckoning</hi> was altered; and upon News at Court, that Princeſs ANNE would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Bath</hi> ſooner than was expected, (the Waters either really or pretendedly not agreeing with her) the very next Day the Queen gave out that ſhe would go to St. JAMES's, and <hi>look for the good Hour</hi>; tho' WINDSOR was the Place where Preparations had been made for her lying in, and it was told her it was impoſſible, on ſo ſhort Warning, Things could be got ready at St. JAMES's. But ſhe was ſo poſitive, that ſhe ſaid <hi>ſhe would lye there that Night tho' ſhe ſhould lye on the Boards</hi>; and accordingly, thither ſhe went that Night: And it was given out, by all her Train, that ſhe was going to be delivered. Some ſaid, it would be the <hi>next Morning</hi>; and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſaid very confidently, <hi>it would be a Boy.</hi> And accordingly next Morning was the Time of the ſuppoſed Birth of the Prince of WALES. 5. That her Delivery was on a Sunday Morning, when all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Court Ladies were at Church. 6. That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Princeſs ANNE of DENMARK, the <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> nor the <hi>Dutch Ambaſſador,</hi> were preſent at her Labour; tho' they were the three Perſons who ought prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to have been there. 7. That during her Labour the Curtains of the Bed were drawn cloſe, and none came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them but the <hi>Midwife</hi> and an <hi>Under-Dreſſer:</hi> And a Warming-Pan was brought into the Room not <hi>opened,</hi> under Pretence of warming one Side of the Bed, tho' the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was extream hot, and the Room heated by a vaſt Crowd of People. 8. That ſhe never ſatisfyed the Princeſs ANNE and other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Ladies, either of her being with Child, or of her having been delivered of a Child, in any of thoſe Ways which might have carried Conviction with them. 9. That tho' the King, Queen and Courtiers ſufficiently knew, before the Delivery, that the Nation ſuſpected an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> they did not uſe thoſe Precautions as they might, and ought to have done, in ſuch a Caſe; and inſtead of putting it beyond all poſſible Doubt, they left ſo many Marks of Suſpicion, as cauſed infinite Doubts and Diſputes, inſomuch that ſome <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> themſelves owned, that ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an Affair had been managed with great Supineneſs and Imprudence. Laſtly, That upon the Prince of ORANGE's landing in ENGLAND, not only the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> went over to FRANCE, but the <hi>Midwife</hi> &amp; <hi>all aſſiſting at the Birth</hi> were ſent with them, or ſo diſpoſed of, that it could never be learned what became of them afterwards.</p>

FRANCE and SPAIN, be advanced to the BRITISH Throne? God forbid! The Deſign is abominable. It is ſo in the Sight of every true Friend to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of ENGLAND; and, I doubt not, it is ſo in the Sight of a holy and righteous God: Which leads me,</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> Place, to mention a few Things tending to encourage us to hope, that God will ſay concerning this Deſign, <hi>it ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have no Commiſſion to declare this to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of God. And indeed, while we conſider the <hi>moral</hi> State of the Nation, we have Reaſon for Concern and Fear. Perhaps, it was never in a more corrupt and degenerate State, than at this Day. Were the Truths of God ever more generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd? Were the Revelations of God ever more generally diſbelieved? Were the Commandments of God ever more generally and ſhamefully violated?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:005752_0039_1026F5CF810F9370"/>The Land of our Fore-fathers may juſtly be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over in the Language of the Prophet ISAIAH, <hi>Ah ſinful Nation! A People laden with Iniquity, a Seed of evil Doers! They have forſaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy One of</hi> ISRAEL <hi>to Anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT when we turn our View to the Intereſt of the REDEEMER, which will ſuffer by ſetting a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Prince on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne, we have ſtrong Reaſon for Hope. Will God ſuffer the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> that <hi>Son of Perdition, who hath exalted himſelf into the Seat of</hi> CHRIST, to be again acknowledged and adored, by a Nation who have declared their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of worſhipping him, inſtead of the Son of God? Will God ſuffer the Fopperies and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and abominable Idolatries of the Church of ROME, to take place among a People who have undergone ſo much in proteſting againſt them? Will God ſuffer the chief Bulwark of the Proteſtant Cauſe in <hi>Europe</hi> to be broken down and deſtroy'd? There would be no Unrighteouſneſs in him ſhould he, in this Way, puniſh us for our Iniquities. But yet, we have great Encouragement to rely on his Power for our Protection and Deliverance, as the Deſign of our Enemies is really a Deſign againſt CHRIST, as well as us; a Deſign againſt the pure uncorrupt Religion of the Goſpel, as well as againſt our civil Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>AND it ſhould animate our Faith and Hope to conſider, how often, and in what remarkable Ways, God has appeared for our Help, when our <hi>popiſh</hi> Enemies have laid their Plots as deep as Hell to ruin us; particular Inſtances whereof might be mention'd, would the Time allow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:005752_0040_1026F5D11D96CC70"/>AND it looks like a Token for Good, that ſuch a Spirit appears in the Nation, among all Sorts of Men, to oppoſe this accurſed Deſign, at the Peril both of their Eſtates and Lives. At firſt, it may be, it was treated with too much Neglect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but ſince the Defeat of General COPE, and the Entrance of the <hi>Rebels</hi> into the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of SCOTLAND, the Attention of the Nation has been rouſed; and they are voluntarily muſtering, from all Quarters, for the Defence of their King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And it may be hoped, God intends, in this Way, to put an End to the preſent Diſturbances, and reſettle the Kingdom in Peace and Quiet.</p>
               <p>THERE are none among his Majeſty's Subjects more heartily deſirous of this, than WE in theſe <hi>diſtant Provinces.</hi> I don't believe there could be found in them all ſo much as one NEW-ENGLAND Man, but his Indignation is enkindled at the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſet a <hi>popiſh</hi> PRETENDER on the Throne of GREAT-BRITAIN, in the Room of his Majeſty King GEORGE the Second. And could the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, inhabiting the ſeveral <hi>Provinces,</hi> be gathered together in one general Aſſembly, I doubt not, they would join Heart and Voice in the Cry of AMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAI, <hi>Thine are we,</hi> DAVID, <hi>and on thy Side, thou Son of</hi> JESSE: <hi>Peace, Peace, be to thee, and Peace be to thine Helpers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND horribly ungrateful ſhould we be, if a juſt Senſe of the invaluable Priviledges, <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> which we enjoy, under the mild and kind Adminiſtration of ſo gracious a Sovereign and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Father, did not knit our Hearts to him in Love, diſpoſing us to all Reverence and Loyalty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:005752_0041_1026F5D2C1D8E298"/>AND ſhall we be dutifully affected to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and not bow the Knee before the Throne of Mercy for him, now that his Enemies are riſen up in <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt him? This is the only Way, wherein we, who live at ſuch a Diſtance, can help our King and Nation, in ſubduing thoſe who are endeavouring their Ruin.</p>
               <p>AND let us, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> in this Way, expreſs our Love, and Gratitude, and Loyalty, to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and Concern for the Safety of his Kingdom. Let us be conſtant and importunate in our Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God, that he would preſerve the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and protect the <hi>Crown</hi> of our rightful and lawful King; cloathing his Enemies with Shame, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Crown to flouriſh on his Head, and on the Head of his Poſterity forever: And that he would mercifully ſave his People from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi>; perpetuating to them the Enjoyment of their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> which diſtinguiſh them from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations of the Earth. Happy will they be while in ſuch a Caſe; yea, happy will they be, ſo long as God is their Lord. And may our <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> be thus happy, 'till Time ſhall be no more!
