            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following <hi>SERMONS,</hi> as you will find by ſome Paſſages in them, were Preach'd not long after the <hi>Terrible Earthquake</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">October 29, 30. 1727.</note>, whereby, the People in <hi>NEW-ENGLAND,</hi> were generally very much <hi>Awakened;</hi> and Multitudes, almoſt in every Town and Pariſh, came to their Miniſters, as the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> in my Text, did to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> with this important Inquiry, <hi>Sirs, What muſt we do to be Saved?</hi> And 'twas a Joyful Sight to us, to behold ſuch a gracious Effect of ſo aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Diſpenſation. For tho', by this means, our Work was greatly increaſed on our Hands; yet I believe, your Paſtors never went more cheerfully thro' their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Labours, nor took more Pains to
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003231_0003_0FF024AE6678C140"/>
ſuit their Diſcourſes to the ſtate of their Hearers: And it was with this <hi>View,</hi> theſe Sermons were firſt Compos'd and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Pulpit. But alas! 'tis no leſs grievous now, to find, how <hi>ſoon</hi> and <hi>eaſily</hi> theſe ſolemn Impreſſions are worn off the Minds of a great many, both Old and Young. Who, notwithſtanding their late Convictions and Vows for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, are returned to their former Evil Courſes, <hi>as the Dog to his Vomit:</hi> and ſo are fallen under the weight of that heavy Charge againſt <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> Hoſ. <hi>6.4. O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee? O</hi> Judah, <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee? for your Goodneſs is as the Morning Cloud, and as the early Dew it goeth away.</hi> And 'tis enough to make one's Heart and Fleſh to tremble, to think of the fearful Doom that awaits theſe Backſliders in Heart and Life. For, we have it from the mouth of GOD Himſelf, in Heb. <hi>10.38. Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith: but if any man draw back my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> And if any ſuch Perſons ſhould caſt an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Pages, I beſeech you, for GOD's ſake, and for the ſake of your poor Souls, to look back, before it be too late, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, How many ſtrong Convictions you have ſtifled, how many ſolemn Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003231_0004_0FF024B0F5C75198"/>
you have broken, and what hopeful Beginnings you are fallen from; and then look forward, and behold the amazing Gulph of Endleſs Miſeries you are plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deep into. And, Oh, That GOD, of His infinite Mercy, would Revive your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and bring you in earneſt to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what you muſt do to be Saved; and ſo pluck you as brands out of the Burning!</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding the Melancholy Proſpect we have from theſe Revolters from GOD and Duty, There are (Bleſſed be GOD for it) ſome Thouſands in the Land upon whom theſe Impreſſions do yet remain; and I hope will do ſo to their dying Day. And 'tis no ſmall Comfort to me to find ſo many of this Character, in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I belong to, and very particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our Dear <hi>YOUNG PEOPLE,</hi> who are ſtill, <hi>Inquiring the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as an Help to them herein, a <hi>Number</hi> of them have earneſtly deſired (and I have accordingly comply'd with their Deſires, in) the Publication of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. And how defective ſoever they may be as to the <hi>manner</hi> of them, I am ſure the <hi>Subject</hi> of them is of infinite Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. And therefore, tho' at ſome times they may be more peculiarly <hi>a Word in
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003231_0005_0FF024B463A7A3C8"/>
Seaſon,</hi> as they were intended in the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; yet, Diſcourſes of this kind, can never <hi>be out of Seaſon,</hi> while there are any Men in the World under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Sentence of GOD's righteous Law, and ſo ſtand in abſolute need of Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>AND if theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> mean as they are, ſhould fall into the Hands of any, that are in deep Concern about the ſtate of their Souls and another World, for whom they are chiefly deſigned; I hope, by the Bleſſing of GOD, they will meet with ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in them, as may be of Service to them, <hi>in working out their Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if ſuch poor diſtreſſed Souls, or any elſe, ſhould reap the leaſt Spiritual Benefit by them, my End is anſwered: And let GOD the <hi>CREATOR, REDEEMER,</hi> and <hi>SANCTIFIER</hi> have the whole Glory of it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>TERNAL Salvation is a matter of the greateſt Concern to every Sinner. And accordingly this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in the <hi>Text</hi> is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the firſt and great Inquiry of every one, that is thoroughly convinced of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003231_0007_0FF024BB4699E930"/>
and wretched ſtate he is in by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The apprehenſions he has of his own Sin and Guilt, fill him with the deepeſt Concern about the ſtate of his poor Soul and another World: And he deſires nothing ſo much as to know, what means he muſt uſe, or what courſe to take, to eſcape the Damnation of Hell, and come to enjoy the Happineſs of Heaven. This is a Subject that employs his tho'ts day and night. And he frequently thinks with himſelf, What a miſerable Condition am I in? What ſhall I do in this ſad ſtate? How ſhall I get out of it? What Courſe ſhall I take for this end? And he is ready to ask theſe Queſtions of every one whom he thinks able to give him any Light and Direction in a matter of ſo great Importance.</p>
            <p>AND in hopes this is the Caſe with many of my Hearers at this day (having lately had the ſame loud call from GOD in His Providence, to awaken and rouſe you as the <hi>Jaylor</hi> had in our <hi>Context,</hi>) I ſhall conſider the Inquiry before us: And in the Proſecution of it, give the moſt full and ſatisfactory anſwer I can, to thoſe who make it in earneſt.</p>
            <p>BUT before I come to the Point in hand, I ſhall briefly conſider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003231_0008_0FF024BD87274C80"/>
and ſo lead you to the Occaſion of the Words themſelves. And here if we look back to the <hi>ninth verſe</hi> of this Chapter, we ſhall find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had been called by God in a viſion to go over into <hi>Macedonia:</hi> which call he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obey'd; and ſoon came to <hi>Philippi, the chief City of Macedonia, and a Colony,</hi> (ver. 10.12.) And being arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither, he improved the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he had to preach the Goſpel of CHRIST, <hi>(ver.</hi> 13.) Whereupon follows an account of the ſucceſs of his Miniſtry in the Converſion of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and his <hi>caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out an evil ſpirit that had poſſeſt a Damſel</hi> in thoſe parts, (<hi>ver.</hi> 14,— 19.) But her Maſters had made their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her heretofore by her Divination, (<hi>ver</hi> 16.) they were enraged at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle for the loſs they ſuſtained in her Converſion to Chriſtianity; and ſo raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a grievous Perſecution againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle and <hi>Silas,</hi> his Companion and Fellow-labourer. Upon which they were both cruelly ſcourged, and caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by order of Government (<hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23.) This being done; the <hi>Jaylor</hi> to make good his Truſt, <hi>thruſt them into the inner Priſon,</hi> or Dungeon, where none were uſually put but condemned Malefactors: but as if this were not enough, <hi>he made
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003231_0009_0FF024C0596E9308"/>
their feet faſt in the Stocks;</hi> reſolving to load them with all the indignity and miſery he could do. Under this cruel treatment thoſe Servants of CHRIST took Courage, and comforted themſelves in GOD; rejoycing, no doubt, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſuch ſhame for the ſake of their dear LORD. And therefore we read in ver. 25. <hi>At midnight Paul and Silas prayed and ſang praiſes unto God;</hi> and with ſo loud and chearful a Voice that <hi>the Priſoners heard them.</hi> Whereupon GOD immediately appeared in a very awful and ſurprizing manner, both to vindicate the Innocence of his ſuffering Servants, and to teſtify his great Diſpleaſure at their malicious Perſecutors. For we read in ver. 26. <hi>And ſuddenly there was a great Earthquake; ſo that the foundations of the Priſon were ſhaken.</hi> How far there might be the miniſtry of ſecond Cauſes in this amazing Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we know not: but yet this we are ſure of, there was the Hand of Heaven remarkably in it; and ſomething very extraordinary, if not miraculous, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Effects, or rather the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of it: For it is ſaid in this ſame verſe, <hi>And immediately all the doors were opened, and every ones bonds were looſed.</hi> It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable this opening the Doors of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003231_0010_0FF024C3DE9475F0"/>
Priſon, and looſing the bands of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were not by the violence of the Earthquake, but by the miniſtry of an Angel; as in <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.19. But yet they were effected at the ſame Inſtant when the Walls of the Priſon, and no doubt all the Houſes in the Town were tottering and ready to tumble into Ruins, by the dreadful Quaking of the Earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: And by this means the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation appeared more awful and amazing. And now as to the <hi>Effects</hi> of this ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Providence upon the Minds of Men: There is no Queſtion to be made, but all the People in the City were thrown into an amazing Fright by it; as we were t'other Night by the like Diſpenſation. But my Text leads me to conſider only the Caſe of the Jaylor; and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions it made upon him. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we read in ver. 27th. <hi>That the Keeper of the Priſon awaked out of ſleep;</hi> 'tis likely by the great Shock of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; and <hi>ſeeing the Priſon Doors open,</hi> he <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> at firſt, as well he might, <hi>that all the Priſoners were fied.</hi> And this fill'd him with new Terrors; for tho' the Earth had not opened her mouth and ſwallowed him alive, as a minute or two before he tho't it wou'd have done, yet now he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended himſelf in freſh hazard of loſing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003231_0011_0FF024C5709560C0"/>
his Life, and in a moſt ignominious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by the hands of the Magiſtrates; for the <hi>Roman</hi> Law was very ſevere in this caſe, and made it a Capital Crime for a Priſon-keeper to let any of his Priſoners eſcape. And accordingly the Severity of it had, not long before, been executed upon the Keepers, out of whoſe hands the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had eſcaped, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.19. And therefore to avoid that kind of Death, the Jaylor at firſt attempted in a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural manner to lay violent hands on himſelf: for <hi>he drew out his ſword, and would have killed himſelf:</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 27. But <hi>Paul</hi> perceiving the intended Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy <hi>cried out with a loud voice,</hi> and ſaid to the poor diſtreſſed Wretch, <hi>Do thy ſelf no harm: for we are all here,</hi> ver. 28. This voice of the Priſoner was Life from the Dead to the Keeper of the Priſon; whereupon he immediately laid aſide his vile Purpoſe of murdering himſelf; and being at once convinced of the Innocency of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas;</hi> of the truth of their Religion, and of the Almighty Power of that GOD who had ſo ſignally appeared for them, <hi>He immediately called for a Light, and ſprang in, and came trembling, and fell down</hi> before theſe Servants of the moſt HIGH GOD, in token of Reverence and Reſpect to them, And being at the ſame

time alſo convinced in a very wonderful manner of his own ſinful and wretched ſtate, and the hazard he was in of loſing his Soul forever; He puts this moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and important Queſtion to them in the words of my Text,— <hi>Sirs, What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> He was now in as great Concern for the Life of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul, as juſt before he had been in, for the Life of his Body: And he knew of none ſo fit, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> to apply to for Counſel and Direction in this moſt important Affair. And therefore apply'd to them, in the moſt reſpectful manner, for their ſpeedy Help &amp; Direction in this Caſe, <hi>Sirs, What muſt I do &amp;c?</hi> He was willing now to take any Advice, and to do any thing; yea, every thing in his power for the Salvation of his Soul: and therefore how to obtain this, was become his firſt and chief Enquiry. Thus the Providence of GOD, that had juſt before like to have coſt him and many more their Lives, prov'd a merciful Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him: GOD made it a means to awaken him to purpoſe; and brought him hereby to Inquire in earneſt after Eternal Life. And ſince (as I hope) this is the very Caſe with a conſiderable Number both here and elſewhere, at this Time;

I ſhall ſpeak to this DOCTRINE from the Text, as a Word in Seaſon to you,—</p>
            <p>Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> WHENEVER a Sinner is thoroughly Convinced of his Sin and Danger, he is won't to make this his firſt and great Inquiry, <hi>What muſt I do to be Saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So did the <hi>Jaylor</hi> in our Text; being brought into deep Convictions by the ſurprizing Providence of GOD, as you have heard. And ſo did the three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand that were Convinced, at one time, by an awakning Sermon of the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The ſtory of which we find in the <hi>ſecond Chapter of the Acts:</hi> Where we have a brief account of the Sermon he preach'd to them, from the 14<hi>th. to the</hi> 16<hi>th. verſe</hi> incluſively. And then we have an account of the impreſſion it made upon them in <hi>ver.</hi> 27<hi>th. Now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart,</hi> i.e. They were deeply convinced, by the Word, of their Sin and Guilt. And upon this it follows, <hi>They ſaid unto Peter, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and brethren, What ſhall we do?</hi> That is, What ſhall we do to be ſaved? The Queſtion is of the ſame import with that in the <hi>Text.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003231_0014_0FF024CF13FFC810"/>
They were now made ſenſible, they were ſinful, guilty, undone Creatures in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſtood in infinite need of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation: and upon this Conviction, the very firſt thing they inquire after, is, What they ſhall do to obtain the Pardon of their Sins, and the Salvation of their Souls. And we may obſerve the like Concern in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, in the <hi>ninth Chapter of the Acts.</hi> He was convinced of his ſin and danger, by a voice immediately from Heaven, <hi>ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul, why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me?</hi> ver. 4. And he was no ſooner made ſenſible from whence the voice came, and what the deſign of it was, but with trembling &amp; aſtoniſhment, at the proſpect of his Sin and Guilt, he cries out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, my way has been perverſe before thee; I have greatly diſhonoured and offended thee by my Sins; and expoſed my ſelf to thy dreadful wrath and vengeance; Oh, what ſhall I do? Lord, teach me what Courſe to take, to get my Sins pardoned and my Peace made with thee. Teach me how to live and walk that ſo I may glorify thee in this World, and enjoy thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World to come. And thus if you meet with any Sinner that has been
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003231_0015_0FF024D14E8792F0"/>
once thoroughly convinced of his Sin and Danger, either by the Word or Providence of GOD, you will ſoon find, that this is the great Inquiry he is in purſuit of; and what he deſires above every thing to be reſolved in; namely, <hi>What ſhall I do be ſaved?</hi> What Courſe ſhall I ſteer? What Steps ſhall I take? What Means ſhall I make uſe of, that may prove effectual for this End? This is enough to prove the Truth of the Point.</p>
            <p>HERE then in the Proſecution of this Subject, I ſhall obſerve the following Method.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I Shall ſhow, when a Sinner may be ſaid to be thoroughly Convinced of his Sin and Danger.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHAT is implied in that Salvation, which ſuch a Sinner ſo earneſtly inquires after.</p>
            <p n="3">III. SHOW the Neceſſity and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Sinners making this his firſt and great Inquiry. And then,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. SHOW what Steps a poor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Sinner muſt take to obtain Eternal Life, in anſwer to that Inquiry in the Text, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I Shall ſhow when a poor Sinner may be ſaid to be thoroughly Convinced
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003231_0016_0FF024D65BB0E9B8"/>
of his Sin and Danger: or what this CONVICTION implies in it.</p>
            <p>AND here there are theſe Four things principally included in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A deep ſenſe of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>accurſed Nature</hi> of Sin. Sin in it ſelf is the very worſt of Evils. There is nothing ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the nature of it, as Sin is. 'Tis far worſe than any Evil of Puniſhment can be: for tho' <hi>penal</hi> Evil be deſtructive of the Creatures Happineſs; yet, as it is a Correction for Sin, and never inflicted by GOD but when Sins calls for it, there is both Reaſon and Juſtice in it. But Sin can in no ſenſe be ſaid to be good: For, in the very Nature of it, 'tis directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to all that is <hi>holy, juſt and good.</hi> It is contrary to the moſt pure and bleſſed Nature of GOD; contrary to His juſt and righteous Law; and is followed with the whole train of <hi>penal</hi> Evils, as the proper Demerit of it. And therefore he that has a due Conviction of Sin, has been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by the Spirit of GOD to ſee ſomething of the odious and accurſed Nature of Sin, as it is in it ſelf. GOD has given him to ſee Sin in its horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to His moſt holy Nature &amp; Law; and that it deſerves to be hated &amp; ought to be abandoned on the account thereof. And accordingly, He is wounded to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003231_0017_0FF024D9AADEB758"/>
Heart to think how injurious Sin is to GOD; How it oppoſes His holy Will; affronts His ſupream Authority; Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours His ſacred Name; and ſo how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is to GOD on the account hereof. And from hence he can't but ſee and own the unreaſonable and odious Nature of Sin: and is ready at the Proſpect of it to cry out, <q>Oh, the accurſed Thing! I hate the Name, I abhor the Nature of it: I now loath the Garments ſpotted with it; and if it were poſſible, I would not have my Heart, nor my Hands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with it for ten thouſand Worlds. Nay, in the Mind I am now in, I would ſuffer any Affliction and Pain rather than touch the accurſed Thing.</q> And ſo under this Conviction the Sinner is put upon flying from Sin as far as he can, and upon eſcaping as many of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to it as he can do: And makes that Prayer to GOD, which CHRIST has taught us in this Caſe, Math. 6.13. <hi>Lord, Lead me not into Temptation, but deliver me from Evil:</hi> from the Evil of Sin, which is ſo hateful in thy ſight. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN this Conviction there is a juſt ſenſe of the <hi>dreadful Demerit</hi> and <hi>Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of Sin. For as Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law of GOD, and caſts all manner of Reproach upon His Sacred Name and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003231_0018_0FF024DD4F6AA3D8"/>
Ways: there is no Puniſhment too ſevere to be inflicted on the Guilty. For the Nature of Sin is ſuch, "that it deſerves the Wrath and Curſe of GOD both in this Life, and in that which is to come". And accordingly, they that are guilty of it, are curſed by the Law of GOD, Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> And they are doom'd to die on the account of it, Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> And Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is Death.</hi> This Death includes in it all outward Evils &amp; Miſeries in this World, from the leaſt Pain of a Finger to the Death of the Body. Again, it includes in it all ſpiritual Plagues and Judgments in this Life; ſuch as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of GOD; the Frowns of His Face; the Stings and Laſhes of the Sinners own Conſcience; and GOD's delivering him up into the Hands of His ſpiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be tyranized over, and hurried by them to Eternal Ruine. And therefore it alſo includes in it, the Everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Soul and Body in Hell; which is eternal Death, and the thing principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended in the Threatning and Curſe that is due for Sin. All this the convinced Sinner has an affecting Apprehenſion of;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003231_0019_0FF024DF18BD7B18"/>
and can't but own the Juſtice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of GOD in ordatning ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Puniſhment for the workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN this Conviction the Sinner has a deep Senſe of his own <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by Sin. For Sin is not only the moſt hateful Thing in itſelf, and ſo deſerves the Curſe of GOD: but we are all of us horribly infected with the Plague of Sin, and deſerve the Vengeance of Heaven our ſelves. For as the Prophet obſerves, <hi>We are all of us as an unclean thing,</hi> Iſai. 64.6. From the Crown of the Head even to the ſole of the Feet, there is no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſoundneſs in us; nothing but wounds and bruiſes and putrifying ſores, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.6. And our Lives are naturally among the unclean. And being thus polluted with Sin, we deſerve nothing but Wrath and Death on the account of it. And ſo are ſaid to be by Nature, <hi>the Children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. Now in true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, the Sinner has a deep ſenſe of this his Pollution and Guilt by reaſon of Sin. GOD has ſet his Iniquities in order before him; and bro't him to ſee what a vile Tranſgreſſor he has been. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Convinced Sinner is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Sins both of his Heart &amp; Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſees in ſome good meaſure what an
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003231_0020_0FF024E18F77B780"/>
evil Heart He has in him; an Heart full of mity to GOD, of Indiſpoſition to that which is Good, and inclined to all that is Evil. And as ſuch an Heart can bring forth no good Fruit; ſo he ſees that out of the evil Treaſure of his Heart, he has brought forth nothing but Evil in his paſt Life and Converſation: He ſees that his Days have been fill'd up with acts of Rebellion againſt GOD; that his Sins have been many and exceedingly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; that he has ſinned againſt the Light of his own Conſcience; ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Calls and Warnings of GOD, againſt His Mercies and Judgments, and the like. And ſo he ſtands ready to confeſs with the returning Prodigal, in Luk. 15.21. <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight.</hi> And as he ſees himſelf ſo great a Sinner, ſo he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends his own <hi>Pollution</hi> by Sin. He juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concludes himſelf a moſt vile and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Creature: and knows that GOD has infinite reaſon to abhor him forever And this ſenſe of his own vileneſs makes him to loath himſelf for his own Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and to confeſs with <hi>Job, Behold, I am vile — I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> Chap. 40.4.42.6. And with this ſenſe of Pollution he conceives his own dreadful <hi>Guilt</hi> by reaſon of Sin.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003231_0021_0FF024E6C852DFE8"/>
He knows that he juſtly deſerves Wrath and Hell on the account of his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: and ſees all the Curſes and Threatnings that are written in the Book of Gods Law ſtanding in full force againſt him: and ſo apprehends himſelf a Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condemned Wretch: one that has run a ſwift Race in Sin, and been ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apace for the Damnation of Hell. And ſo with the Jaylor in the Context, he trembles at the proſpect of that Wrath that is due to him for his Sins; and can truly ſay with <hi>David,</hi> in Pſal. 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee: and I am afraid of thy judgments.</hi> Thus in true Conviction the Sinner has a deep ſenſe of his own Pollution and Guilt by Sin.</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly. IN this Conviction the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is deeply ſenſible of his own <hi>utter Inability</hi> to Help and Save himſelf. For a true Conviction of the evil Nature and Deſert of Sin will ſoon bring a Sinner to ſee, that it is not in his own Power nor in the Power of any meer Creature to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone the Wrath of GOD for his Sins, and obtain his releaſe from the Condemning Sentence of the Law. And therefore when the Convinced Sinner makes that Inquiry of himſelf, as we find in Mich. 5.6, 7. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003231_0022_0FF024EA363F4888"/>
Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſand of rams, or with ten thouſand rivers of oyl? Shall I give my firſt-born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</hi> He preſently makes anſwer to himſelf, <q>Oh, no! all this can never be a proper Atonement for Sin. <hi>Lebanon is not ſufficient to burn, nor the beaſts thereof for a burnt offering.</hi> Nay, ſuch is the Nature of my Sins, and the Nature of that GOD againſt whom I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that a Sacrifice of the whole Creation, if I had it to offer, could not ſatisfy Divine Juſtice for the leaſt of my Offences.</q> And then beſides, would GOD accept the leaſt good at our hands as an Atonement for Sin; He that is thoroughly Convinced, ſees that he has nothing of his own, that has the leaſt value in it; and that he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf, that is any ways worthy of GOD's Acceptance. And therefore, he looks upon his own Righteouſneſs but as filthy Rags, and can ſee no Hope, no Help for him in the compaſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THUS I have given you ſomething of the Nature of true Conviction of Sin,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003231_0023_0FF024EDAAC4C6B8"/>
whether it be wrought more immediately by the Word, or by any remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of GOD. And whenever a poor Sinner is brought into this ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, his firſt and great Inquiry is that in the Text, <hi>Sirs, What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> And this would naturally lead me now, to ſhow, what is implied in that Salvation which ſuch a Sinner ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquires after: which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Thing I propoſed under the Doctrine. But I ſhall not enter into the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Point at preſent. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with a brief Reflection or two up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt general Head, which I have ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Infer.</hi> 1. DOES Conviction of Sin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it ſuch things as we have heard? Hence learn that this Conviction is the Work of the SPIRIT of GOD. Some are ready to impute their own Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sin and Danger, and the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, to the power of <hi>Melancholy within them,</hi> or to the <hi>Malice of Satan without them,</hi> and ſo are for ſhaking off, and diſcouraging ſuch Convictions in the beginnings of them, as much as they can. But, Sinner, Art thou Convinced in any meaſure, of the evil and accurſed Nature of Sin, — of the fatal Tendency of it,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003231_0024_0FF024F02AA27D60"/>
and of thy own Pollution and Guilt by reaſon of it: This can never be the Work of Corrupt Nature; for that is always in love with Sin: nor the Work of the Devil, for his main Buſineſs is to hide your Sin and Danger from you; that he may make the eaſier and ſurer Prey of you to your everlaſting undoing. Well then, it muſt be the Work of the Spirit of GOD. And whatever were the Means of thy Convictions, the Holy Spirit is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Efficient of them; and they are appropriated to Him in the Goſpel of Chriſt. Joh. 16.8. <hi>And when the Spirit is come he will reprove</hi> or convince <hi>the world of ſin &amp;c.</hi> And we ſhould accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aſcribe all our Convictions to the Holy Spirit, and make proper Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to Him on the account of them.</p>
            <p>Hence,</p>

               <hi>Infer.</hi> 2. IS every one that is thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Convinced of his Sin &amp; Danger won't to make this his firſt and great Inquiry, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Convinced Sinners ſhould then bleſs GOD for their Convictions, and purſue the Inquiry after Eternal Salvation, 'till they ſee where there Help is to be found, and are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to put their truſt in CHRIST for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life. Has GOD brought any of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003231_0025_0FF024F2EC1BE690"/>
you to a deep ſenſe of your ſinful and miſerable ſtate by Nature? Has He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened this ſenſe in you by His Word or Providence, or by both? Oh! Bleſs GOD herefor as the moſt merciful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of your whole Lives hitherto. And are you now brought to make that Inquiry, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Oh, keep on in the Inquiry, 'till you come to a comfortable Iſſue in the matter. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Inquiry by ſearching into the Word of GOD, which ſhews poor Sinners the Way to Eternal Salvation. And ask of your Miniſters and Chriſtian Friends that have found the Way, and are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way to Eternal Life, What you muſt do to be ſaved? And if you are but in earneſt and conſtant in this Inquiry, GOD will in His own Time enlighten and lead you in the Way Everlaſting.</p>

Every Sinner, as I ſaid, that is timely Convinced, is bro't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deep Concern for Eternal Salvation. This is what he longs for, Enquires and Seeks after, while his Convictions abide by Him. It is worth while therefore to Enquire a little into the Nature of this Salvation, to ſee whether ſuch a Sinner be Rational in his Deſires and Purſuits. And accordingly, if we conſider the Point a while, we ſhall find He has infinite Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the utmoſt Concern about it. For there are theſe two things in general im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003231_0027_0FF024F86C3FD1E0"/>1. A Deliverance from the Curſe of the Law, to which every Sinner is obnoxious, by the breach of the firſt Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſure Right and Title to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and invaluable Priviledges and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the New-Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This Salvation comprehends in it, a Deliverance from <hi>the Curſe of the Law,</hi> to which every Sinner is obnoxious by the Breach of the firſt Covenant. That God entred into Covenant with our firſt Parents before the Fall, is plain from the Hiſtory of our Creation. For therein we find that as ſoon as God made man in his own Image, which conſiſted in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true Holineſs, He gave him a Law to walk by; a Law ſuited to the Dignity of the Great Law-giver and the State of the Subject. This Law was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd at the ſame time with the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Sanctions</hi>: with the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Life on Condition of perfect and perſevering Obedience, and with the <hi>Threatning</hi> of Death and Miſery in Caſe of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence. And theſe Terms, without Doubt were cheerfully ſubmitted to by Man in a State of Innocency: and from hence re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſulted the Nature of a Covenant between God and Man. And this we call the <hi>firſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003231_0028_0FF024FB174EBC60"/>
Covenant,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi> Now this Covenant was no ſooner made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, but it was broken on our part. The way and manner in which it was thus violated, is expreſly declared to us in the Story of our ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apoſtacy from God: which you may read at large in the <hi>Third Chapter of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</hi> This Breach of Covenant expoſed poor Man at once to the whole Curſe of the Law: For 'tis written <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. The ſubſtance of this Curſe, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is Death of every kind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Evils contain'd in it are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably great and dreadful. It implies in it a forfeiture of all the Good, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has in Poſſeſſion, or ever had a Right and Title to; and a ſubjection to all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Evil. For he that is under the Curſe of the Law, has forfeited and loſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of GOD, and lies open to all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing ſtrokes of revenging Juſtice. And therefore the Sinner deſerves, and ſo the leaſt he has any Reaſon to expect from the Hands of an holy Sin-revenging GOD, is <hi>eternal Indignation &amp; Wrath, Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Anguiſh:</hi> and he has no other rational Proſpect before him, but <hi>a certain
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003231_0029_0FF024FE2964AA18"/>
fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</hi> See Heb. 10.27. This is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Condition of every one that is under the Curſe; and ſo the doleful ſtate of every one of us by Nature. And it is upon this deplorable account alone, that we ſtand in need of Salvation. For had we never violated the holy Law of GOD, we had for ever been ſecure in the Favour and Enjoyment of GOD, which is Life Eternal. But by the moſt perfidious Breach of GOD's Covenant, we have brought our ſelves into the depth of that Miſery, I have now deſcribed. And it is not poſſible we ſhould ever be happy without a compleat Redemption from it. And therefore the Salvation we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of neceſſarily implies this Redemption in it.</p>
            <p>Here then I ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS Salvation implies in it, a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Luſt.</hi> As Man's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from GOD, &amp; the miſerable ſtate he is fallen into, began with his Sin and Rebellion againſt GOD; ſo from that time Sin took a full Poſſeſſion of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſet up an abſolute Empire, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unregenerate Sinner. And therefore
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003231_0030_0FF02501C2AF0300"/>
all ſuch Sinners are ſaid to be <hi>the ſervants of Sin,</hi> Rom. 6.17. Now, tho' carnal Sinners themſelves are not ſenſible of it; this ſubjection to Sin and Luſt is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Miſery we are plung'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Fall. For as Sin at firſt brought down the Curſe of GOD upon us; ſo this ſubjection to Sin keeps us ſtill under the Curſe; and there is no getting free from the Chains of it, but by getting looſe from the Power and Dominion of Sin. And therefore a Deliverance in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is eſſential to the Sinners Salvation. And accordingly the Heirs of Salvation are ſaid <hi>to be made free from Sin,</hi> Rom. 6.18. i.e. They are delivered from the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power and Dominion of Sin, and in part from the Pollution of it, in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Sanctification by the Spirit of GOD, while they are in this World, and they ſhall be wholly freed from the Rage and Tyranny of Sin, from the Pollution and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of it, and from the very <hi>in-being</hi> of it, in the World to come. And this is ſo glorious a part of our Salvation, that the Saint longs for nothing more than to be thus entirely and everlaſtingly ſet at Liberty from Sin, and therefore he daily groans out his Deſires in that pathetical Language, Rom. 6.24. <hi>Oh, wretched man
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003231_0031_0FF0250369B99078"/>
that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT implies in it a Deliverance from the <hi>Power of our ſpiritual Enemies.</hi> While Sinners are under the Curſe of GOD's Law they are in ſlavery to the Powers of Darkneſs. And therefore are called <hi>the Children of the Devil,</hi> and ſaid to <hi>do his Luſts,</hi> Joh. 8.44. And the Devil himſelf is called, <hi>the Prince of the power of the Air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. Now this is a doleful part of that Miſery which the Apoſtacy has thrown us into. For while Sinners are in this ſlavery to the Powers of Darkneſs, they are Enemies to GOD, and are hurried on by the Devil in their Rebellion againſt Heaven, and ſo are ripening apace for the vengeance of Eternal Fire; where, without timely Repentance, the wicked Spirits that now rule in them, will be their Tormentors for ever and ever. And therefore a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the Power of theſe our ſpiritual Enemies, is a neceſſary part of the Sinners Eternal Salvation. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Saints of the moſt High, are ſaid <hi>to be ſaved from the hands of their ſpiritual Enemies, and from the hand of all
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003231_0032_0FF02507F7CD9948"/>
that hate them.</hi> And again, <hi>to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their hands,</hi> Luk. 1.71, 74. This Deliverance is begun in this World; and every true Believer is tranſlated, by the Grace of GOD, out of the <hi>Kingdom of Satan into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13. And therefore tho' Satan may aſſault and buffet him, by his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſometimes foil him in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with him, yet, he ſhall never more have Dominion over the Saint. For GOD will finally crown all His Children with everlaſting Victory and Triumph in His eternal Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. Now this part of our Salvation is what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Believer longs and prays for. For he meets with ſo great Oppoſition at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Powers of Darkneſs, and ſo much Difficulty and Diſtreſs from them in his Chriſtian Race, that he would give ten thouſand Worlds to be conducted ſafely beyond the reach of them.</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS Salvation implies a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the <hi>Guilt of Sin</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Sentence of Gods Righteous Law. Now the Guilt of Sin is nothing leſs than the Sinners Obligation to ſuffer the dreadful Penalty that is due for Sin.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003231_0033_0FF0250C573FBC88"/>
And accordingly while the Sinner is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of Guilt, he is under the Condemning Sentence of God's holy Law, and doom'd to ſuffer all the Plagues and Curſes that are written in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all unbelievers are ſaid to <hi>be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already,</hi> Joh. 3.18. Now in the Sinners Salvation, this Guilt is removed by a Pardon, and the Condemning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law is taken off in his Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. And agreeably, we read in Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> And this is ſo great and neceſſary a part of our Salvation that a poor convinced Sinner, who has a true ſight and ſenſe of his own Sins; and ſees what a guilty Condemned Wretch he is, wou'd freely give all he has in the World, to have any Aſſurance that his Sins were Pardoned, and that he ſhall not be Condemned for them at the awful Tribunal of Chriſt at the great Day.</p>
            <p>And accordingly,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, THIS Salvation implies in it everlaſting ſecurity from the amazing <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>vengeance</hi> of GOD in the World to come. As every unregenerate Sinner is under the Guilt of Sin and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003231_0034_0FF0250EDF3C9CD0"/>
Sentence of Gods Law; ſo he is every Moment in infinite Hazard of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the dreadful weight of His Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Indignation. And therefore ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are expreſly called <hi>the children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. And what a fearful thing is it, thus to fall into the hands of the living GOD! And what wou'd not a poor Condemned Sinner give, to obtain full ſecurity from this tremendous Wrath to come? Now in that glorious Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is offered to us in the Goſpel, this Security is contain'd, and every Saint ſhall eternally be delivered from the Wrath of GOD, and the Torments of Hell in the World to come. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the words of our Saviour Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Joh. 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation; but is paſſed from death to life.</hi> And thus you ſee in theſe Particulars, what the Sinners Deliverance from the Curſe of the Law implies in it; and how great and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a part it is of our Eternal Salvation. Nay, this Deliverance from the Curſe is the firſt and moſt proper notion we have of Salvation. But then as this Salvation is apply'd to the Caſe of Apoſtate Man's Recovery by JESUS CHRIST; it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003231_0035_0FF0251162882620"/>
in it all the Happineſs Believers ſhall ever attain to in and thro' Him.</p>
            <p>And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THE other great and Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Article in our Salvation, is, a Right and Title to all the <hi>Priviledges</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the New Covenant. It is no more certain, That GOD entred into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works with Man at his Creation; the Priviledges of which we forfeited and loſt by the Apoſtacy; than it is evident, He has graciouſly condeſcended to enter into a New Covenant with us, in &amp; thro' a Mediator: which we uſually call <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi> Now in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant we have not only the offer of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Security from all the Miſeries of the Fall (which we ſpake to under the former Head:) but there are many other glorious and ineſtimable Priviledges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it: which we call the Poſitive Bleſſings of the New Covenant; and are eſſential to eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>And agreably I ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. OUR Eternal Salvation implies in it the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> of our Natures. For every Sinner that is bro't
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003231_0036_0FF025132C6DD720"/>
into a ſtate of Salvation, is made a new Creature. All old things are done away, and behold all things are become new in him. Hence he is ſaid to <hi>put off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former Converſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts:</hi> and to <hi>be renewed in the ſpirit of his mind; and to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.22, 23, 24. And this is the Work of Almighty Power and Grace: and therefore they that are thus renewed are ſaid to <hi>be born of the Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3.5. And that Work which is ſo happily begun in Regeneration, is daily carried on to greater Degrees of Perfection in the renewed Sinners Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and this alſo being wrought by the Spirit of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, Believers are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. Now this Renovation and Sanctification of a Sinner is the beginning of Eternal Salvation. For the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Redemption by CHRIST begins in it. And when a Sinner is thus Created a new in Chriſt Jeſus, he is brought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to enjoy many of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Redemption, and obtains a ſure Title to all the reſt of them.</p>
            <p>Hence,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003231_0037_0FF02515AB497390"/>2. THIS Salvation implies in it <hi>Peace</hi> with GOD, in and thro' JESUS CHRIST. For as the Fall ſet Man at an infinite Diſtance from God, and bred an Enmity between them; which proves fatal to every Sinner, that dies in his Natural Condition: ſo whenever a poor Sinner is brought into a ſtate of Salvation, this Enmity between GOD and the Sinner is removed, and they are brought into a ſtate of Reconciliation one to another. For the renewed Man, having the Image of GOD ſtampt upon him, has no longer any reigning Enmity in his Heart againſt GOD, but loves and delights in Him from that Day forward; and accordingly, GOD pardons and juſtifies, and ſo is at Peace with the Sinner, from the moment he is enabled to cloſe in with Chriſt by Faith. Hence that in Rom. 5.1. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Peace is another glorious Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the Saint's Salvation, and fills him with Joy unſpeakable whenever he has a ſenſe of it. And then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS Salvation includes the Saint <hi>Adoption</hi> in it. For every one that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the Spirit of GOD, and bro't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003231_0038_0FF02518392FC158"/>
a ſtate of Peace with Him, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, is alſo taken into the Number of his Children. Joh. 1.12. <hi>But as many as received him to them gave he power to become the ſons of God: even to them that believe on his name.</hi> And this is a very comprehenſive Article in the Saints Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: For as ſoon as ever the Believer is bro't into the Relation of a Child to GOD, he has the Nature and Spirit of a Child given to him: He has the Holy Fear and Love, the Reverence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of a Child in him; and receives the Spirit of Adoption, whereby he is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to go to GOD as his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and open all the Wants, and Fears, and Burdens of his poor diſtreſſed Soul before him. And on the other hand, GOD has the tender Compaſſions &amp; Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of a Father towards thoſe whom he graciouſly Adopts. And accordingly, His Ear is always open to hear their Cries to Him for Mercy. He pities them under all their Diſtreſſes; Comforts them under all their Sorrows; Supports them under all their Weakneſſes; and ſupplies all their Neceſſities for them: and has more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over provided a Glorious Inheritance for them in His Eternal Kingdom. This with much more of the like Nature is included in the Saints <hi>Adoption.</hi> And
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003231_0039_0FF0251DA1049F18"/>
therefore this Article of Adoption is one of the moſt Glorious Privileges of the New-Covenant. And then,</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS Salvation implies all that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> that is neceſſary to help and aſſiſt the Saint to the end of his Chriſtian Race. For as the Saint has a great deal to do in the way to GOD's Kingdom: many Difficulties to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; many Temptations to reſiſt; many Enemies to conquer; many great and difficult Duties to engage in, and go thro' with; and no ſtrength of his own equal to the leaſt of them: He needs the ſpecial Preſence of the Holy Spirit, to direct, aſſiſt and carry Him thro' all, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Acceptance of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And accordingly, this is ſecured to the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the New-Covenant. As we find in Iſai. 41.10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not diſmayed for I am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> And in 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> And therefore tho' the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed the greateſt ſenſe of his utter Inſufficiency to perform any Du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty aright in his own ſtrength, as we find in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003231_0040_0FF02520B7B63500"/>
2 Cor. 3.5. yet elſewhere he is confident in this, Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. THIS Salvation implies in it the full and eternal Enjoyment of all the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of HEAVEN in the World to come. This is the laſt and principal Thing contained in Eternal Salvation, and the Perfection of it. And the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of thoſe that enjoy it, is ſo great that 'tis not poſſible for any one to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it: Nay, 'tis ſo glorious, that <hi>Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither has it entred into the Heart of man,</hi> in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtate, to conceive <hi>of the Things which God has prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. I will therefore only ſay, That the ſubſtance of it conſiſts in the immediate, full, and eternal ENJOYMENT of GOD and CHRIST, in the Kingdom of Heaven. And therefore the Happineſs flowing from thence muſt needs be an infinite Happineſs. And accordingly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> expreſſes it, by <hi>fulneſs of Joy, and Pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. And aſſures himſelf <hi>in the laſt verſe of the next Pſalm; As for me, I ſhall behold thy face in Righteouſneſs: I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:003231_0041_0FF025255B5BEFD0"/>AND thus, upon the whole, I have given you a ſhort and imperfect Account of that Salvation, which is the ſubject-matter of the Inquiry in our Text. And this was the <hi>ſecond Thing</hi> I propoſed to ſpeak to under the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">III. I proceed now to the <hi>next</hi> General Head: And this is to ſhow the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Importance</hi> of the Sinners making this Inquiry after Salvation his firſt and great Inquiry. And here I ſhall apply my ſelf chiefly to ſuch Sinners as are yet in a ſtate of Carnal Security; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by ſome proper Conſiderations, to awaken in them that Conviction, which was ſpoken to under the firſt Head: and hereby bring them to inquire in earneſt after that Salvation, which I gave you ſome Account of in the next place; and ſo make way for their cloſe and ſerious Attention to that Solemn Advice which is the principal Subject of theſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And there are theſe two or three Conſiderations, which I ſhall briefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and which, by the Grace of GOD, may very much ſerve my preſent Deſign.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:003231_0042_0FF0252BC3DFBEB8"/>1. THE <hi>Nature</hi> of Eternal Salvation is ſuch, that 'tis richly worth a while for every Sinner to be chiefly concern'd about it. For do but conſider the ſhort and imperfect Account I have given of this matter, under the laſt general Head; and then judge Whether there is any thing in the World to compare with this Salvation: Whether there are any <hi>Evils</hi> in this Life to compare with <hi>thoſe</hi> which this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion delivers us from: Or whether any of the <hi>good things</hi> here below may ſtand in Competition with <hi>thoſe</hi> which the Saint ſhall enjoy in the Poſſeſſion of Eternal Life. I am ſure there is no reaſonable or conſiderate Perſon will own there is any Compariſon between them. For whereas the greateſt outward Evils we are liable to in this World, are ſaid to be but <hi>light and moment any;</hi> the ſpiritual Plagues and Judgments the Sinner is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, are <hi>intolerable</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi> And whereas, on the other hand, the beſt things of time and ſenſe, are fading and tranſitory in their Nature, and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory in the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of them; the Spiritual Priviledges and Bleſſings of our Redemption by CHRIST are Eternal in their Nature and Duration, and afford infinite Satisfaction to the Poſſeſſors of them. And now ſince Men,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003231_0043_0FF0252E6C608CC8"/>
from the ſenſible Experience they have both of outward Proſperity and Adverſity, are agreed in this, as an eſtabliſhed Law of Nature, that 'tis both their Duty and Intereſt to eſcape as many of the Evils of Life, and enjoy as many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it as they can, while they live; and ſcarce think any Pains too much, to accompliſh their deſire in theſe reſpects: it muſt needs be a matter of vaſtly greater Importance to them to ſeek after Eternal Bleſſedneſs. And when they have once ſecured an Intereſt in it, this will beyond all Compariſon more richly Recompence their utmoſt Labour and Coſt in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of it. Nay, the very leaſt of all the peculiar Privileges and Bleſſings of the New Covenant, will be of infinitely greater Advantage to the Sinner, than if he had all the Riches, Honours, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Life at his Command. Where then ſhall we find the Tongue that has Eloquence enough to deſcribe, or the Underſtanding that has Largeneſs enough to conceive, what the Believers Gains are, when he has once paſt from Death to Life? and ſo comes to enjoy all the precious Privileges of a ſtate of Grace in this World? and has the Covenant Truth and Faithfulneſs of GOD to rely upon, for the immediate Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003231_0044_0FF02530B63F19A8"/>
of all the Glories of Heaven, in the World to come? Oh then, as you would be wiſe for your ſelves, and lay out your Time and Strength to your infinite Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, let this Salvation be the great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your beſt Inquiry &amp; Endeavours: and keep that Direction of the wiſe man always in your eye, Prov. 4.7. <hi>Wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get wiſdom: and with all thy getting, get underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Abſolute need</hi> we ſtand in of Eternal Salvation may ſerve to convince you of the great Neceſſity &amp; Importance of making this Inquiry after Salvation your firſt and great Inquiry. For Eternal Life is a matter of ſo great moment to every Sinner, that unleſs he obtains an Intereſt in it, he is undone for ever. For, as you heard before, by the Apoſtacy of our firſt Parents, we all of us fell under the dreadful Curſe of the Law, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately became ſlaves to Sin, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Powers of Darkneſs, in this World; and obnoxious to the Eternal Vengeance of GOD, in the World to come. And there is no getting looſe from the Chains of Guilt and Wrath, but by an Intereſt in that Salvation we are ſpeaking of. For as long as any Sinner
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003231_0045_0FF0253379F56700"/>
continues in his natural ſtate, his Heart is full of reigning Enmity againſt GOD and Holineſs: He lives in Sin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in nothing but Rebellion againſt GOD: and ſo daily treaſures up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD. And if he ſhould die in this ſtate of Nature, he'l die under the full weight of the Curſe, and ſink under the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Load, into endleſs, eaſeleſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medilous Torments, beyond all poſſibility or hope of Recovery. And therefore, if you can think it any ways neceſſary for you to eſcape the inſupportable Miſeries and Torments of the bottomleſs Pit, you muſt think it equally neceſſary to inquire and ſeek after Eternal Salvation. For 'tis this alone that can ſet you at Liberty from the amazing Curſe of the Law, and ſecure you from that Wrath of GOD which is infinitely more bitter than Death. This we are ſure of, from what I ſaid was contain'd in our Redemption by Chriſt. And now, Sinner, what do you think of the matter? Is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation neceſſary for you, or no? Or, are you ſtill indifferent, whether you are ever delivered or not, from the eternal Wrath and Curſe of an Almighty Sin-revenging GOD? I am ſure if you are not faſt
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003231_0046_0FF02536C5C1ADB8"/>
aſleep in Sin, you muſt have ſuch a ſenſe of the dreadful Wrath of GOD, that hangs over your Head, as to make you concern'd, above all things, to get out of the reach of it. And if your Conſcience is but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, as it ſhould be, you can't but cry out in agony of Soul, Oh, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? How ſhall I eſcape the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Vengeance that is ready to fall upon me? and ſink me down into Eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? And the rather for what I ſhall obſerve to you in the laſt place, Namely,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THERE is no obtaining an Intereſt in Eternal Salvation without making the Inquiry after it our firſt and great Inquiry. And this ſhows us the vaſt Importance, yea, the abſolute Neceſſity of this ſort of Inquiry. For as Eternal Salvation is a matter of the moſt weighty Concern in itſelf; GOD will never beſtow the Bleſſing upon any Sinners, unleſs they ſee the ineſtimable Worth of it, and have a due ſenſe of the abſolute need they ſtand in of it; and ſo are put upon Inquiring and ſeeking after it with the greateſt Care and Diligence. For if GOD ſhould beſtow the Mercy upon any elſe, they would but deſpiſe, abuſe, and even trample upon His Grace and Goodneſs therein; and ſo, in effect, He would but throw away the richeſt Gift
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003231_0047_0FF0253A27EF7AF0"/>
he has to beſtow, and not get the leaſt Glory to Himſelf, in ſo doing. We muſt not therefore imagine that any Sinner, while he continues in a ſenſeleſs, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned frame of ſpirit, can ever obtain an intereſt in GOD's Salvation. No; the poor Sinner muſt firſt be deeply ſenſible of his own miſerable ſtate by Nature, and ſee the abſolute need he ſtands in of Eternal Life; and ſo with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling inquire and ſeek in earneſt after this Salvation. And when the Sinner is once come to this, we have all the reaſon in the World, to hope, it won't be long, before GOD will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the miſerable Creature, where his Help is to be found. Now this may ſerve to convince us all of the great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Importance of being chiefly concerned about Eternal Salvation; and ſo of inquiring after it, as the One Thing needful. For I ſuppoſe there is ſcarce any Sinner under the Goſpel to blind and ſtupid in his ſins, but, in his cooler Thoughts, thinks, Eternal Life to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for him; and hopes to come to the Enjoyment of it at laſt. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lies the miſery and deceit of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of carnal Sinners. They think their Salvation may be obtain'd at an eaſy rate, at any time: and that they have no
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003231_0048_0FF0253F9546ABA8"/>
need to make it the main Inquiry and Buſineſs of their Lives; and ſo go on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in their Sins, till the Day of Grace and Seaſon of Salvation is over with them for ever. But, believe it Sinner, you muſt be made deeply ſenſible of the preſent need you ſtand in of Salvation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſeek after it, with as great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Soul, as ever you ſought after any one thing in the World. And by this means, you'l ſoon come into a fair way to have the moſt important Inquiry anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered to the ſatisfaction and comfort of your Soul.</p>
            <p>AND thus you ſee, in theſe Particulars, of how great Neceſſity and Importance it is, that every Sinner ſhould make the Inquiry after Salvation his firſt and great Inquiry. And this was the Third general Head, I propoſed to ſpeak to, under the Doctrine. I ſhall therefore cloſe this Diſcourſe with a Reflection or two on what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>USE. I. DOES the Salvation of a Sinner imply ſuch Things as we have heard in it? Oh, How ſtupid and blind then are ſuch poor Sinners who have little or no concern about this Salvation! Poor Souls! you ſee not the miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003231_0049_0FF02542306DCFD8"/>
you are in by Nature. You are upon the very brink of Eternal Ruine: There is but one ſhort ſtep between you and eternal Deſtruction; and yet you can eat, and drink, and ſleep, and enjoy your ſelves, with as much eaſe and ſatisfaction as if you were out of all Danger. And tho' you ſtand in as much need of this Salvation, as ever any poor Souls did, or can do: yet, you ſlight and deſpiſe it, and mind the mereſt Trifles in the World, more than you do the great Concerns of your precious Souls and Eternity. Oh! the amazing ſtupidity, the blindneſs, and the hardneſs of your Hearts! You have no pity or concern for your ſelves. But alas! your Miniſters and Chriſtian Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they pity and pray for you: their Hearts tremble for fear of what is coming upon you. And Oh! that the infinite GOD would have pity upon you, for the ſake of the great Redeemer, and pluck you as brands out of the Burning!</p>
            <p>USE. II. HENCE learn that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Sinners, in being ſo earneſt in their Inquiry after this Salvation, have all the Reaſon in the World on their ſide; and do that which is well-pleaſing in the ſight of GOD. And therefore poor diſtreſſed Souls! tho' you may poſſibly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003231_0050_0FF0254802BBA560"/>
meet with a great deal of Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, of Reproach and Banter, and be accounted mere fools by the Men of the World, for this great Concern you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for eternal Salvation: yet be not diſcouraged. For they are certainly the greateſt Fools, in the World, who treat you, and Eternal Salvation, at this rate. And, believe it, you never began to be really wiſe till you began in earneſt to make the Inquiry you are now upon. For the greateſt wiſdom, doubtleſs, conſiſts in a due Concern for the one Thing needful. And then beſides, the Inquiry you are upon is moſt pleaſing in the ſight of GOD. For it is in effect to Inquire, how you ſhall glorify GOD, and anſwer the great End of your Being. And therefore if you do but purſue this Inquiry with Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diligence, never fear; GOD will, in due time give you an anſwer of Peace: He'l ſhow you, by His Word and Spirit, what you muſt do to be ſaved, and make you wiſe to Eternal Salvation.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Diſcourſes I have ſhewn you, <hi>Firſt,</hi> When a Sinner may be ſaid to be tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>roughly Convinced of his Sin and Danger. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is imply'd in that Salvation, which ſuch a Sinner earneſtly inquires after. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I have conſidered the Neceſſity and Importance of every Sinner's making this his firſt and great Inquiry.</p>
            <p>And now,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I proceed to ſhew what Steps a poor Convinced Sinner, who is chiefly concern'd about Eternal Salvation, muſt take to obtain this Salvation: And this is the principal Thing I have to Diſcourſe upon: And I ſhall be the more particular in it. And here I ſhall not confine my ſelf only to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003231_0052_0FF0254BDD007040"/>
that anſwer to the Queſtion in the Text, which we find in the <hi>next verſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> For tho' Faith in Chriſt will certainly intereſt a poor Sinner in that great and glorious Salvation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt; and is, at leaſt, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Thing that is abſolutely neceſſary to that purpoſe; yet, there are other things, beſides an immediate and direct believing in Chriſt, which a poor convinced Sinner muſt give his Attendance to, if he means to be ſaved: and which indeed are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his cloſing in aright with Chriſt for Salvation. And therefor, I ſhall give my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> in the Text, under theſe <hi>three</hi> more general Heads: which I beg your moſt diligent attention to. And ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. YOU muſt carefully guard againſt all the Hindrances of a Sinners Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. YOU muſt diligently attend to, and improve all the Means and Helps of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. YOU muſt immediately and directly cloſe in with Chriſt by Faith, that ſo you may be ſaved by Him alone.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Heads at this time. And therefore,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003231_0053_0FF0254E53ADEB08"/>
Sinner, if this be the great Inquiry you are now upon, and would gladly receive an Anſwer to, namely, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Then hearken to what I am to ſay to you, in the Name and Fear of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> IF you would be ſaved, you muſt carefully guard againſt all the <hi>Hinderances</hi> of your Souls Salvation. And here, poor Soul, you have a great deal of Work to do; as much as ever you can turn your hand unto. Nay, more than ever you can do to purpoſe, unleſs you have the ſpecial preſence and aſſiſtance of the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD with you in this Affair: For ever ſince the Apoſtacy, Earth and Hell are engaged in a War againſt us; and unite in their endeavours to ruine and deſtroy us for ever. Nay all <hi>within</hi> and all <hi>round about</hi> us, in the World, are in this dreadful Combination againſt us: ſo that you have innumerable Enemies to conflict with on every ſide. And if I ſhould attempt to ſpeak particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every one of them, I cou'd not tell <hi>how</hi> to begin, or <hi>where</hi> to end. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall inſtance in <hi>four</hi> of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Hindrances of our Souls Salvation. And if you can but overcome theſe, in the Name of Chriſt, and by the Help of his Spirit, which you muſt humbly and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:003231_0054_0FF0255007BE8758"/>
earneſtly ask of Him in the firſt place; never fear, the Salvation of your poor Soul will be accompliſhed in due time. And theſe Hindrances are <hi>Sin, Self, Satan,</hi> and this <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. YOU muſt carefully watch &amp; guard againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> if ever you intend to be ſaved. Sin is the worſt and moſt dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my we have to conflict withal, and ſtands more immediately, than any other, in the way of our Salvation. It was this that at firſt brought us into ſo wretched and miſerable a Condition as to need Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Twas this that violated the holy Law of GOD, and expoſed us to the dreadful Wrath and Curſe of GOD, which we now lie open to by Nature. And 'tis this that at preſent ſtands between the Sinner, and the Salvation of his Soul. And therefore, were it not for this, the other Enemies of our Salvation, cou'd do little or no hurt to us, in the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern we have in hand. But, Sinner, this being an Enemy <hi>within thy ſelf,</hi> it is in league with all the other Adverſaries <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> and opens the paſſage for their more eaſy and ſucceſsful Aſſault upon thee. And therefore your main Concern, upon this head, ſhould be, How to watch and guard, and ſecure your ſelf effectually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin. And to this end, you muſt
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003231_0055_0FF025536959E060"/>
get as well acquainted as you can with your own Heart; and here you will ſoon diſcover the bitter Root and Spring of all Sin. For as the Prophet obſerves, Jer. 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> Yea, 'tis full of the moſt unnatural Enmity againſt GOD and his holy Law. Rom. 8.7. <hi>The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity againſt God; it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> And therefore the corrupt Heart is the Fountain of all thoſe actual Sins which pollute our Thoughts, Lips, and Lives, Math. 15.19. <hi>Out of the heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed evil tho'ts, murders, adulteries &amp;c. which defile the man.</hi> You muſt therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſee &amp; lay to heart the ſtrength and treachery of Sin, that dwells in you; and cry out under the burden of it, as he did, Rom. 7.24. <hi>Oh, wretched man, that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> And with this ſenſe of indwelling Sin, you muſt earneſtly apply to the Blood of Jeſus to cleanſe you from the Guilt and Pollution of <hi>this,</hi> and all your actual Tranſgreſſions; and you muſt carry the Body of Sin to the Croſs of Chriſt, and plead importunately that it may be Crucified and Slain there and that by the help of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT you may from this time forward
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003231_0056_0FF02556B9F0BF98"/>
be deliver'd from the Reign and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of it. And when you have taken this method to mortify and ſubdue the Root and Fountain of Sin in you, then careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch againſt all the <hi>workings</hi> of Sin in your Heart, and the <hi>out-breakings</hi> of it, in your Life and Converſation. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſuppreſs the very firſt motions to Sin in it. And whatever particular Luſts you have been more peculiarly inclined to, and that have been as <hi>a Right Hand,</hi> or <hi>a Right Eye,</hi> ſet your ſelf in a ſpecial manner againſt ſuch Luſts; and Pray and Watch, and ſtrive hard for the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Deſtruction of them. And in a word, ſee that you conſtantly Watch and Pray againſt all Sin, and all Temptations to Sin. So we are directed to do, in Mat. 26.41. <hi>Watch and Pray that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> Thus you muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guard and ſtrive againſt all Sin, if you really intend and deſire to be ſaved. And I pray, you would obſerve all that I have ſaid here concerning Sin, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the whole Direction. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an Awakened Sinner, for want of due Conformity to this Rule, has at laſt fallen ſhort of Eternal Salvation. For ſome Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners when they have been under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the HOLY SPIRIT, and in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003231_0057_0FF0255A22039C70"/>
great Concern about the ſtate of their Souls, and another World, have been full of terrour on the account of ſome <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> and <hi>Scandalous</hi> Tranſgreſſions they have been guilty of; and have taken a great deal of pains to reform themſelves in ſuch Particulars. And when they tho't they had done this, they concluded now they had done all that was neceſſary with reſpect to Sin; without ever coming to ſee the Monſtrous Vileneſs and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Hearts: and ſo have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their Days, and Dyed at laſt under the Reigning Power and Guilt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin. This ſeems to have been a fatal miſtake in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> of Old. And then again, many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when they have been in the like concern for Salvation, have confeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the Guilt, both of Original and Actual Sins, and begg'd of him the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of both; and with their Confeſſions have reform'd a great deal that has been amiſs in them: but then, they have had ſome ſecret Reſerves, ſome beloved Luſts, that they cou'd never be prevail'd upon to part withal: and ſo they have finally fallen ſhort of Eternal Life. A ſad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this kind we have in that Young Man, who came to Chriſt, with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Queſtion, Math. 19.16. <hi>Maſter,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003231_0058_0FF0255CB1155E60"/>
what good thing ſhall I do, that I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternal life?</hi> He appears, by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, to have been in ſome conſiderable Concern about his Salvation; and was willing to <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>had done,</hi> a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things for the ſake of it; but he cou'd not part with his <hi>Coveteouſneſs</hi> for the ſake of Heaven; and ſo fell ſhort of Eternal Life at laſt; as appears from that <hi>Context.</hi> And therefore, as I ſaid before, if ever you intend to be ſaved, you muſt ſet your ſelf againſt all and every Sin: againſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Actual Sins; againſt the Sins of Heart, Lip, and Life &amp;c. And if you can but get the victory over Sin, you'l remove the main obſtacle in the way to your Eternal Salvation. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. As you muſt carefully watch and guard againſt Sin; ſo you muſt, with the like care, watch and guard againſt <hi>Self,</hi> if ever you intend to be ſaved. This is another <hi>inbred Enemy,</hi> and inveterately ſet againſt the Salvation of our Souls, in the way and method which the Goſpel preſcribes. I confeſs, indeed, every Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has a principle of <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> whereby he truly deſires his own Happineſs, both in this World, and in that which is to come. But then, he has an accurſed principle of <hi>Pride</hi> in him, whereby he can't bear to think of going intirely out of himſelf to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:003231_0059_0FF02560F4E67330"/>
another, for that Salvation he ſtands in need of. And therefore many a poor Sinner, when he has been greatly Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the Spirit of GOD, and bro't into deep Concern about the ſtate of his precious Soul, has been willing to do a great many things in Religion; yea, every thing which he tho't was required of him in the Law of God: and hence he has ſet himſelf, with a great deal of Care and Diligence, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all known Evils, and to Diſcharge every known Duty. And, indeed, it is a great length which many an Awakened Sinner has gone in this way. And it would grieve any one to the Heart to think, that after ſo much Labour and Coſt in Religion; ſo much ſtriving againſt Sin, and unto Duty; after ſo many Prayers and Tears and Struggles, againſt many of the Enemies of our Salvation; and after an incredible deal of pains taken to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eternal Life, the poor Sinner ſhould in the End fall ſhort of Heaven and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. But ſo it has been with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the Chriſtian World; and, I doubt, will be ſo with a great many more. For tho' they are willing to go all this length in Religion; yet, they can't be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go one ſtep further, i.e. to go out of themſelves to CHRIST, and reſt upon Him alone for Salvation, which would
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:003231_0060_0FF0256283ADBDF0"/>
effectually ſecure their Eternal Well-being. But their own Obedience muſt be the price of their Future Happineſs. They are righteous in their own eyes: and think there is ſomething worthy of God's acceptance in their own Perſons and Performances; and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that GOD can, with any Juſtice, caſt them off at laſt, when they have done and ſuffered ſo much in his Cauſe and Service. This ſeems to have been the fundamental error of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> in the days of our Saviour: and therefore they are frequently condemned by him for their <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs,</hi> and threatned with eternal Damnation, after all their fair ſhow in Religion. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the generality of the more religious <hi>Jews</hi> ſplit upon this Rock, in the days of our Saviour and his Apoſtles. See Rom. 10.3. — <hi>For they being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs (ſays the Apoſtle) and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God.</hi> And ſo fell ſhort <hi>of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> i. e. of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; as we find in the cloſe of the preceeding Chapter. And therefore, if ever you intend to be ſaved, you muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently watch and guard againſt this Self-righteous Principle: and be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003231_0061_0FF025659753C958"/>
willing to do all you can in Obedience to the Law of GOD; but when you have done all, you muſt be willing to confeſs you are but an unprofitable Servant; and caſt your ſelf upon the free Grace and Mercy of GOD, and truſt alone to the Righteouſneſs of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for Juſtification to Eternal Life. This (as I ſaid before) is what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sinner is very hardly brought to, thro' the reigning Pride of his own heart: and therefore there is ſo much the greater hazard, from this Quarter, of your falling ſhort of the Grace of GOD at laſt. Well then, let me adviſe, and prevail with every Awakened Sinner, that is now inquiring in earneſt, What he muſt do to be ſaved, to take ſpecial heed of <hi>Self:</hi> That is, of truſting in your own Duties and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for the Salvation you are ſeeking after. And to this purpoſe, Let me far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adviſe and entreat you, to think ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with your ſelf, That you have a GOD of infinite <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as a GOD of infinite Mercy, to deal withal: And that the ſtrict Juſtice of GOD requires perfect Obedience to every <hi>Tittle</hi> and <hi>Iota</hi> of the Law, before any Perſon can be juſtified by the Deeds of it; and by conſequence, that full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction muſt be made for the Sinner's
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003231_0062_0FF025681BA39F60"/>
breach of the Law, before he can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from the condemning Sentence of it. <hi>Again,</hi> Conſider, what a vile Tranſgreſſor you have been: what Sin and Guilt you brought into the World with you; and how many thouſands of actual Tranſgreſſions may be juſtly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your own Account. Think <hi>alſo,</hi> how far ſhort you fall of the ſtrict De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the holy Law of GOD; even when you have done your beſt in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it: Think how many Duties you have totally neglected; and how defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive you have been in the <hi>manner</hi> of thoſe Duties you have beſt attended: what wrong <hi>Ends</hi> you have many times had in them, and what ſinful <hi>wandrings</hi> and <hi>diſtractions;</hi> what <hi>coldneſs, deadneſs,</hi> and <hi>formality</hi> in the Performance of them. And <hi>then</hi> think, whether a Righteouſneſs made up of ſuch lame and imperfect Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices can have any thing of real worth or merit in it: whether GOD can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the Sinner on the account of them; or, whether he may not juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, after all he has done, or can do, of this Nature: nay, whether He is not in Juſtice bound to do ſo, if the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have no other Righteouſneſs than this maimed Righteouſneſs of his own, to truſt unto. If you do but cloſely purſue ſuch
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003231_0063_0FF0256C38A10648"/>
Meditations as theſe, it will, by the Grace of GOD, quickly bring you to confeſs with thoſe, in Iſa. 64.6. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are as filthy rags.</hi> And ſo make you afraid to truſt to any Righteouſneſs of your own; yea, wholly to renounce it in the great Affair of your Souls Salvation. And if you can but once come truly and thoroughly to conquer and renounce Self in this great Affair, you'l then get over one of the main Hindrances to the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Soul. And now I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. YOU muſt carefully watch and guard againſt <hi>Satan,</hi> if you intend to be ſaved. Indeed <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> are the two moſt hazardous Enemies of our Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe they have their Seat and Reſidence in us, and have wrought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it were, even into the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Man, in his fallen ſtate; and ſo are preſent with us at all times, and in all places; and oppoſe every thing that tends to the Honour of GOD, and the Salvation of our Souls. But then <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> and this <hi>Evil World</hi> are as inveterate Enemies to us as Sin and Self. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in ſtrict League with the Enemies within, they have all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they can wiſh for to make the moſt ſucceſsful aſſaults upon us; and we
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003231_0064_0FF0256FB28818A0"/>
are daily in infinite hazard of being ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eternally by them. And therefore if you mean to be ſaved in the World to come, you muſt be careful and diligent in your Watch and Guard againſt them. But 'tis the firſt of theſe I am to ſpeak to under this Head. And here I ſhall obſerve, That <hi>Satan</hi> is a moſt Inveterate &amp; Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enemy. He is full of the moſt Implacable Hatred, Rage, and Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bleſſed God: and has been ſo ever ſince his Apoſtacy, and Baniſhment out of Heaven. And in conſequence of this, he has all along been carrying on a War againſt GOD, and doing all he can to Rob Him of the Glory that is due to His Name. And as he hates the Infinite GOD; ſo he hates every One that is in Favour with GOD, and envies the Happineſs of their ſtate. This mov'd him to aſſault our firſt Parents in their primitive ſtate of Innocency; which proved ſo fatal to them, and to all their Poſterity, as we find in <hi>the Third Chapter of Geneſis.</hi> And when GOD, to ſhew forth the Infinite Riches of His Sovereign Grace, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd and revealed the aſtoniſhing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our Redemption, by the <hi>promiſed Seed,</hi> as we find in <hi>the</hi> 15th <hi>verſe of that Chapter,</hi> this filled him ſtill with greater Rage and Hatred againſt GOD, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003231_0065_0FF0257233053FB0"/>
whom, by his Subtilty, he had drawn into the grand Rebellion againſt GOD. And he has ever ſince imploy'd his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Strength and Policy, to overthrow the method of our Redemption, and to keep poor Souls from enjoying that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which Chriſt has purchaſed for them. And therefore we read, in 1 Pet. 5.8. — <hi>Your adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lyon, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> And accordingly, we are in the utmoſt Hazard of being ruin'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by this moſt malicious Adverſary. For he is implacably ſet againſt us, and bent upon our Eternal Deſtruction. And then beſides, being of the <hi>Angelic</hi> Order, he is furniſhed with Powers vaſtly Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Man, at his firſt Creation; and greatly exceeds us in Natural Strength, and in his Policy, which has been much improved by long experience, in contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making uſe of ſuch ſnares and ſtratagems, as have the greateſt tendency to deceive and ruine poor Souls forever And more than all this, he has uſurpt at Empire over Mankind in their Natural Condition; and Sinners are by Nature willing to ſubmit to his accurſed Rule and Tyranny. And therefore he is call<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, in Eph. 2.2. <hi>The prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003231_0066_0FF02575A63B79C0"/>
the children of diſobedience.</hi> And many Millions of poor Souls daily run after him in the broad way to Eternal Deſtruction: All which may ſerve to convince us of the infinite Hazard we are in of being undone to Eternity by the malicious Powers of Darkneſs. And therefore every poor Sinner that deſires and expects to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt ſtand upon his watch and guard againſt the Devil, and his accurſed Legions. And let him appear in ever ſo beauteous a form, (as ſometimes he <hi>transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of Light,</hi> and puts the faireſt Colours on the fouleſt Deeds, yet) you muſt renounce him, and all his works, and have nothing to do with the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of darkneſs: for if you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your ſelf in any of them, they'l be the <hi>bane</hi> of your Soul forever. Yea, you muſt watch againſt his Snares and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of all kind. You muſt enquire into the Nature and Tendency of them, <hi>and not be ignorant of his Devices, leſt he get an advantage of you.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. And here I ſhall take liberty to warn you againſt two of his moſt Subtil and Comprehenſive Devices, whereby he has ruined many Millions of poor Souls. And theſe are <hi>carnal Security</hi> on the one hand, and our <hi>horrid Deſpair</hi> of the Mercy of GOD on the other hand.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:003231_0067_0FF02578E95275F0"/>(1.) YOU muſt watch and guard againſt <hi>carnal Security:</hi> againſt a tho'tleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned frame of Spirit, about the ſtate of your Soul, and another World. This is one of the moſt fatal Devices of Satan, whereby he has ruined the greateſt part of Mankind already. He has led them on blindfold in the way to Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; without any ſight of their Sin and Miſery; without any ſenſe of their Danger; and without any remarkable Concern about the World to come, till they have ſuddenly and unexpectedly been thruſt headlong into Eternal Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when any poor Souls are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by the Spirit of GOD and bro't into concern about their Spiritual ſtate, (as the Sinners I am now ſpeaking to, are ſuppoſed to be in) the Devil does all he can to ſtifle the Convictions they are under, and to bring them back again into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate of ſecurity. And thus if the convinced Sinner be Young and in Health, he'll tell him, 'Tis time eno' yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Eternity; and ſo tempt him to lay aſide this concern for the preſent. If he be ſtill tho'tful about his Eternal ſtate, he'll feed him up with tho'ts of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD, and tempt him to think 'tis an eaſy thing to be ſaved; and ſo lead him, if he can, unto a vain preſumption of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003231_0068_0FF0257A7238B468"/>
the Mercy of GOD, without doing any thing conſiderable in Religion. And when this will not do, but the Sinner ſees ſtill he muſt labour and ſtrive in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he intends to be ſaved, and ſo ſets about the Duties of it with ſeeming ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and diligence. Then the Devil tempts him to place his Duties in the room of Chriſt, and to patch up a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his own, and truſt to this for his Juſtification to Eternal Life. And by theſe means he has deceived many an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened Sinner, and lull'd him into his former carnal ſecurity, or into a vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which has prov'd his Eternal ruine. And therefore you that are now Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Convinced by the Spirit of GOD, muſt expect to meet with ſuch Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe: and you muſt carefully watch, and pray, and guard againſt them, or the Devil will certainly be too hard for you, and deceive &amp; undo you forever.</p>
            <p>And then again,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) YOU muſt watch and guard againſt <hi>horrid Deſpair</hi> of the Mercy of GOD in CHRIST. This is another accurſed Device and Snare of the Devil, whereby many an awakened Sinner has been ruined forever. For when the Adverſary ſees, that, by all his Strength and Subtilty, he can't reduce
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:003231_0069_0FF0257DE301CAC0"/>
the poor Soul to its former ſtate of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security, then he ſhifts the Scene, and ſtrives with all his might to drive the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into utter Deſpair of the Mercy of GOD. He ſhoots his fiery Darts into the Soul, and fills the mind with blaſphemous and unreaſonable tho'ts of GOD: as tho' GOD was an hard Maſter; and as if the terms of Salvation, as they are laid down in the Goſpel, were ſuch, that 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him ever to come up to them; yea, the Devil repreſents GOD to the poor Sinner, as an irreconcileable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Judge, as one reſolved upon his Eternal ruine: as one that will have no Mercy upon him, let him take ever ſo much pains, in any way, to make his Peace with GOD. And by the force of ſuch Temptations many an awakened Sinner has, with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> fallen into the moſt Black and Outrageous Deſpair of Mercy, and in the height of this Deſpair, has with an Heart full of Enmity againſt GOD and CHRIST, and his Mouth full of Blaſphemy againſt them, ruſhed headlong into Eternal Perdition. And therefore let every Convinced Sinner, when he finds his Convictions grow and preſs hard upon him, watch and pray againſt this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Device of Satan; this horrid Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of the Mercy of GOD. And labour
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003231_0070_0FF0258127196640"/>
to ſee that as great Sinners as you, have been ſaved (as doubtleſs, a multitude of ſuch have been) and that the Door of Mercy now ſtands open to the greateſt Sinner in the World, and ſtands open to you in particular, (ſuppoſing you are the greateſt Sinner that has ever yet been) if you are but willing now to caſt your ſelf upon the free Grace and Mercy of GOD in JESUS CHRIST. For Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>very chief of Sinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>And is able and willing to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God, in and through him.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37.</p>
            <p>BUT this for the 3<hi>d.</hi> Particular; you muſt carefully watch and guard againſt <hi>Satan</hi> if you intend to be ſaved. And now I proceed to conſider the laſt great Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of the Sinners Salvation, which I named unto you. And this is,</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF you intend or deſire to be ſaved, you muſt carefully watch and guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this <hi>Evil World,</hi> that we live in. Indeed, this World and the things of it, as they came out of the hands of GOD were <hi>very good.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. And GOD particularly created them for the uſe and comfort of Mankind. And therefore, if
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003231_0071_0FF02582AE9B3E70"/>
we had never ſinned againſt GOD, we had never been in the leaſt hazard of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury from our enjoyment of this World. But by our Apoſtacy from GOD, and as a puniſhment to Man for the ſame, the Curſe of GOD has fallen upon this whole lower World; whereby 'tis full of Snares and Temptations on every ſide: And has been a ſad means to ruine many Millions of poor Souls forever and ever. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it it expreſly called <hi>this preſent evil world.</hi> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4.) And Satan is called <hi>the God of it</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.) and his Evil Angels are called, <hi>the rulers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world, (Eph.</hi> 6.12.) And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, this World is now one of the greateſt Hindrances to the Salvation of our precious Souls. And <hi>Satan</hi> has, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, ruined more by the Snares and Enchantments of it, than by all his other Devices put together. And therefore we have many ſolemn Warnings in the Word of GOD againſt the Snares and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this Evil World. We are warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to the World and the things of it, and are told that a prevailing Love to them is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Love of God, and ſo will certainly prove the Deſtruction of our Souls forever. 1 Joh. 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:003231_0072_0FF0258550349710"/>
the world: If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Again, we are as ſolemnly warn'd againſt all Conformity to the ſinful Manners and cuſtoms of this World, as having a moſt fatal tendency in them. Rom. 12 22. <hi>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,</hi> &amp;c. And then beſides, Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>have given himſelf for our Sins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.</hi> See the forecited <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. By theſe, and many other places of the ſame importance, it evidently appears this World is one of the greateſt Hindrances that can be to the Salvation of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls. And therefore if you have any true deſires after Eternal Life, and are willing to do all that is needful to be done, that ſo you may be ſaved forever, you muſt &amp; will look upon this Evil World as an Enemy in the way to Heaven: and you muſt diligently watch and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Evils, Snares, Temptations, and Hazards of it. And in particular, you muſt thus watch and pray againſt the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> of this Evil World.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) YOU muſt watch and pray, that you be not ruin'd by the <hi>Men</hi> of this Evil
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:003231_0073_0FF02587C1A182D0"/>
and Sinful World. It is ſad, indeed, to think that any of our own Fleſh &amp; Blood; that any of the ſame Frame and make we are of, and who ſtand in need of the ſame Salvation that we do, ſhould be ſo vain and fooliſh, as to neglect their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, and be an hindrance to all about them in the way to Eternal Life. But ſo it has always been, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, to this day; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be ſo 'till <hi>the Wickedneſs of the Wicked ſhall come to an end;</hi> which we may not expect 'till the Concluſion of time. And therefore, as you deſire to be ſaved in the day of Chriſt Jeſus, you muſt arm your ſelves againſt the Men of this World, and have as little to do with them as you can. Indeed, it is utterly impoſſible for us in the preſent ſtate of things, to keep entirely at a diſtance from the Company and Converſation of the Men of this World; for we have oft times ſomething or other neceſſarily to do with them, in the way of our lawful Calling. And he that would avoid this, as the Apoſtle obſerves, in 1 Cor. 5.10. <hi>muſt needs go out of the world.</hi> And therefore that which I intend here, is this, if you truly deſire the Salvation of your precious Souls, you muſt not chuſe ſuch as are known to be Wicked Perſons, for your
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003231_0074_0FF0258BE2286668"/>
intimate Companions: you muſt not take delight in their Evil Converſation: you muſt not hearken to their Wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; nor follow the bad Examples they ſet before the World. For theſe things are ſtrictly forbidden to you in the Word of GOD. Prov. 1.10, 15. <hi>My Son, if Sinners entice thee, conſent thou not. Walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path.</hi> And again, Chap. 4.14, 15. <hi>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs away.</hi> And if you will not hearken to theſe ſolemn Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you are threatned with eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Prov. 13.20. <hi>A companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> And we find this awful threatning fulfilled in many ſad inſtances in the Word of GOD. And how many have we known or heard of in our day, who when they came to lie upon a <hi>Sick-bed,</hi> and a <hi>Death-bed,</hi> and ſaw themſelves juſt going into Eternity, then to cry out in the agony of their Souls, Oh! I am undone to Eternity! my evil Company which I have kept, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, has been the ruine of my poor Soul for ever! my wicked Companions have drawn away my Heart from GOD and Duty: They have been a means to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:003231_0075_0FF0258F20D56158"/>
ſtifle the Convictions of GOD's SPIRIT in me: and a means to draw me into all manner of Iniquity. And behold, now I muſt be ſeparated from them for a little while, and be thruſt down into Hell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the doleful Company of Devils and Damned Spirits, there to endure the dreadful Wrath of GOD to all Eternity. Oh, Curſed be their Perſons; Curſed be their Advice to me; and Curſed the Day that ever I ſaw the Face of any one of them. This has been the Heart-pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Language of many a vain Company-keeper, as he has paſt out of this World into an amazing Eternity: And therefore, as you would eſcape the dreadful Doom of theſe Sinners, and be prepared for the <hi>Comforts</hi> of a dying Hour, and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the future State; avoid the evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Converſation of the Men of the World; and ſee that you be able to ſay with <hi>David,</hi> in Pſal. 26.4, 5. <hi>I have not ſat with vain perſons, neither will I go in with diſſemblers. I have hated the congregation of evil doers: and will not ſit with the wicked.</hi> And this will have a good tendency to prepare you for the Mercy of GOD. For ſuch are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bleſſed, in Pſal. 1.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:003231_0076_0FF025918AC12898"/>
nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) YOU muſt with the like Diligence watch, and pray, and guard againſt the <hi>Things of this Evil World,</hi> if you intend to be ſaved. By theſe things, I mean the Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures of this Life. For tho' they are not ſimply ſinful in themſelves; yet, when Men ſet their Hearts and Affections inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately upon them, they prove a dreadful Snare and Temptation to them; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands and millions have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally undone by them. And therefore you muſt mortify all inordinate affection to theſe things, or they'l be the Ruine of you forever. Particularly, (1.) You muſt guard againſt all inordinate affection to the <hi>Riches</hi> of this Life, and get this corrupt Affection mortified in you. For, this is that <hi>Luſt of the Eyes</hi> which we are warn'd againſt, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. And which has been the eternal undoing of many a precious Soul. For as the Apoſtle obſerves, in 1 Tim. 6.9, 10. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while ſome have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted after, they have erred from the truth,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:003231_0077_0FF02593EF599118"/>
and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> The ſum of which is, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Deſires after the Riches of this World, have, tempted and prevailed upon many a poor Sinner to neglect the true Riches, for the ſake of them; and puſh'd him on to many unwarrantable Practices for the gaining of them; ſuch as Lying, Cheating, Stealing, and the like, which have involved him in a great deal of Guilt here, and cruſh'd him down into Eternal Perdition, in the other World. And thus they have proved a Snare to him, and his Ruine for ever. And therefore, if you would be ſaved in the World to come, you muſt carefully guard againſt this ſnare of Deſtruction. You muſt pray to GOD to ſhow you the <hi>vanity</hi> of Earthly Riches; and often think how uncertain they are. For as the <hi>wiſe man</hi> obſerves, in Prov. 23.5. — <hi>Riches certainly make themſelves wings, they fly away as an eagle towards heaven.</hi> And therefore, when Men dote upon them, <hi>they ſet their eyes upon that which is not.</hi> As you may ſee in this <hi>ſame verſe;</hi> and the poor <hi>Miſer</hi> enjoys little elſe in them, <hi>ſaving the beholding of them with his eyes,</hi> Eccl. 5.11. Oh then, ſee that you don't neglect your poor Souls, and the Riches and Treaſures of Grace and Glory, for
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:003231_0078_0FF0259576EF5EA8"/>
ſuch Trifles, as the Riches of this World are at the beſt. Again, (2.) You muſt guard againſt the empty <hi>Honours</hi> of this World, and learn to deſpiſe them. For, theſe are what the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>the Pride of Life,</hi> in the forecited 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.16. Becauſe the generality of thoſe who arrive to them, are proud and vain-glorious: They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain too high an opinion of themſelves, and too mean a conceit of the reſt of mankind. And they prove a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Snare and Temptation to Men, when they ſet their Hearts and Affections inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately upon them: For then they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Honour of GOD, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Religion, for the ſake of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Worldly Glory: and if this can't be come at any other way, they are tempted to take the moſt indirect and ſinful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by falſe Flatteries, by Bribery, and ſometimes by Blood-ſhed, to obtain them. And thus while they are <hi>clambering</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Honours of the World, their Souls are ſinking, by this means into the very depths of Hell. And therefore, as you wiſh and long for the Salvation of your poor Souls, Oh! guard againſt this Snare of Deſtruction. Pray to GOD to ſhew you how empty the Honours of the World are, and think how vain they be: That they depend only on the Breath of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:003231_0079_0FF02597DD4E6160"/>
thy Fellow-creatures, and are more in Name than in Reality; and that a few days, at fartheſt, will put an end to the outward Glory of the greateſt Men on Earth. For we read, in Pſal. 49.12. — <hi>Man being in honour abideth not.</hi> And in ver. 17. <hi>When he dieth he ſhall carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing away: his glory ſhall not deſcend after him.</hi> And then (3.) laſtly, You muſt carefully guard againſt the <hi>ſinful Pleaſures</hi> of this Life, &amp; learn to contemn them. For, theſe are called, the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. which I have named once &amp; again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And this (ſays one) is, <hi>ſubjectively,</hi> "the Humour and Appetite of indulging Fleſhly Pleaſure: and <hi>objectively,</hi> all thoſe things that excite and influence the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Fleſh". This Luſt (ſays he) is uſually called <hi>Luxury".</hi> And as theſe Pleaſures, when they are inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſired and purſued, are all of them <hi>ſinful Pleaſures.</hi> (See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.) So they have an immediate tendency to the Ruine of our Souls for ever. For while Sinners hunt after the Pleaſures of Senſe, and immerſe themſelves in them, they can have no true Deſire after the Enjoyment of GOD, and the Pleaſures of Heaven; nor find any time to take care of their precious Souls, and provide for the World to come. And agreably
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:003231_0080_0FF025996D8C81D8"/>
the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaking to theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuailiſts, ſays in Chap. 5. ver. 5. <hi>Ye have lived in pleaſure on earth, and been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; ye have nouriſhed your heart as in a day of ſlaughter.</hi> And thereby they treaſure up to themſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. See <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And therefore, poor Sinner, if you have any true deſire after Eternal Salvation, and are willing to do all that is neceſſary for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you muſt mortify your inordinate Deſires after the Pleaſures of Senſe, and get your Heart weaned from them. And to this end, Think how momentany theſe Pleaſures are: they being but <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> and a ſhort ſeaſon too. Think alſo how <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory</hi> they are; how unable to fill the enlarged and boundleſs Deſires of your immortal Soul. And then beg of GOD, that He would reveal to you the true and ſubſtantial Pleaſures of Religion, and give you to taſte of the Comforts of His Holy Spirit, which will make ſenſual Pleaſures the moſt inſipid and unſavoury things in the World to you.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have finiſhed the firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head in anſwer to that grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> namely, If you would be ſaved you muſt guard againſt all the Hindrances of your
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:003231_0081_0FF0259BA519CD80"/>
Souls Salvation: and more eſpecially, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sin, Self, Satan,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> in both the Men and the Things of it.</p>
            <p>AND now to conclude at this time, Let me intreat every poor Sinner that is in deep Concern for the Salvation of his own Soul, to hearken to what I have ſaid, and carefully Watch and Pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe <hi>Hindrances</hi> of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For they are the main <hi>Obſtacles</hi> you are like to meet with in the way to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. And if you can but ſurmount theſe, you will be more able and ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Directions that follow: and you will find the Ways of Wiſdom, that now appear ſo rough and difficult to you, to be Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths, the Paths of Peace.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am ſtill upon the Anſwer to that grand Inquiry in the Text, <hi>What muſt I do to be Saved?</hi> This Anſwer I propoſed to give you under theſe Three more general Heads. <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) If you intend to be ſaved, you muſt carefully watch and guard againſt all the Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Sinners Salvation. (2.) You muſt carefully and diligently attend all the Means and Helps of Salvation. And (3.) You muſt particularly and directly cloſe in with Chriſt by Faith, that ſo you may be ſaved by Him alone. I have ſpoken largely already to the firſt of theſe Heads. And proceed now to the next in order:</p>
            <p>And this is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> IF you intend or deſire to be ſaved, you muſt carefully attend to, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:003231_0083_0FF025A196488B48"/>
all the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Helps</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not ſufficient that you only ſteer clear of the Rocks; avoid the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and ſurmount ſuch Difficulties as lie in the way to Heaven, and have prov'd fatal to infinite numbers already: but you muſt ſet your Faces towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſteer your Courſe, as directly as you can, in the way that leads to it. And this you muſt do, by attending and improving aright all the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Helps</hi> of Eternal Life. And theſe I ſhall conſider either as Inſtituted, or Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. By the <hi>Inſtituted</hi> means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I intend ſuch, as GOD has appointed in his Word, and therein required us conſtantly to attend them in the working out our Salvation. And theſe are <hi>the ſtated Ordinances</hi> of the Goſpel. By the <hi>Occaſional</hi> Means and Helps of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I deſign ſuch <hi>Providences</hi> of GOD, which, in the Sovereignty of his Grace, He has frequently Bleſt for ſaving good to the careful Obſervers of them.</p>
            <p>Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF you wou'd be ſaved, you muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; conſtantly attend all the <hi>Inſtituted</hi> and <hi>Appointed Means</hi> of Salvation. Which, as I ſaid before, are the ORDINANCES of the Goſpel; and more eſpecially the <hi>Word,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:003231_0084_0FF025A320EF6968"/>
Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the New-Teſtament. Some of theſe are the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Ordinary Means, of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to <hi>beget</hi> Grace in the Hearts of Sinners; and all of them are ſuch means for the <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>increaſe</hi> of Grace in the Children of GOD. And every one that deſires to be ſaved, muſt make a right Improvement of them according as his State and Condition may be.</p>
            <p>And therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF you deſire to get into a ſtate of Grace, you muſt give the moſt Careful and Diligent Attendance to <hi>the Word of GOD.</hi> The Word of GOD is a ſpecial Means of Divine Appointment for the Converſion and Salvation of periſhing Sinners. And agreably we read, in Pſal. 19.7, 8, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the ſoul: the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple — the Commandment of the Lord is pure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the eyes.</hi> Indeed, the written Word of GOD is not ſufficient, of it ſelf, to give Life unto a dead Soul. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it has a <hi>moral</hi> tendency to Salvation; as it diſcovers to poor Sinners the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition they are in by Nature; the need they ſtand in of Salvation; and points out to them the SAVIOUR of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:003231_0085_0FF025A5B8E51810"/>
Souls: together with the Means and Method to obtain an Intereſt in Him. And then beſides, the Word of GOD is the ordinary Means which the Holy Spirit makes uſe of and bleſſes for the opening a Sinners eyes, and turning him from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD. And therefore, the Word of GOD is a Means you muſt carefully attend to, or you can never reaſonably hope to be ſaved. And here, that you may improve the Word to your ſaving Advantage,</p>
            <p>YOU muſt look upon the written Word which we have in our Bibles, to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> the Word of GOD; or that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Mind and Will to us, which contains in it, all that he would have us to Believe, and Practiſe to Salvation.</p>
            <p>AND accordingly, you muſt uſe all the Helps we have to come to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Mind and Will of GOD contained in his Sacred Word. To this end, you muſt beg of GOD, as <hi>David</hi> did, in Pſal. 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</hi> Pray to him that he would enable you to underſtand not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Letter, but the true Spirit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:003231_0086_0FF025AAC2512B90"/>
of his Holy Word. And with this Preparation, you muſt Daily <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Meditate</hi> in the Sacred Scriptures of Truth. You muſt ſet apart ſome time every Day to look into your Bible, and read a Portion in it. And whenever you do ſo, you muſt not content your ſelf with a bare Curſory reading of a Chapter or two, but ſpend a little time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, and meditate on the Mind and Will of GOD revealed in it, 'till you find your Hearts warmed and affected with it. And beſides this ſtated Reading the Scriptures; you muſt make them the Man of your Counſel at all times; and ſearch into them particularly, that you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Light and Direction, which they afford in the great Concern of Eternal Salvation. Look into them, and ſee what they ſay, concerning the Miſerable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done State the Sinner is in by Nature; how Obnoxious he is to the dreadful Wrath of GOD; how many Tremendous Curſes ſtand in their full Force againſt him, and muſt certainly be Executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, if he lives and dyes in a ſtate of Impenitency; and how unable the Sinner is ſaid to be, to afford any Relief to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the Ruines of the Apoſtacy. Look again into the Scriptures, and ſee
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:003231_0087_0FF025AD2510C8E8"/>
what Diſcoveries they make of a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saviour for loſt Sinners; what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they preſcribe, that we may obtain an Intereſt in him; and what gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements are ſet before us in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and Promiſes of the Goſpel, to fly unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and put our Truſt in him for Eternal Life. This ſearching into the Scriptures is expreſly required of us, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. And the Bleſſed tendency of it is manifeſt from Pſal. 1.1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man —whoſe delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as you muſt thus carefully Read and Meditate on the Word in private; ſo you muſt diligently attend to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſpenſation</hi> of it. For, the Preaching of the Word is an Ordinance of GOD. CHRIST, the Head of the Church, has inſtituted an Order of Men to explain and inculcate upon others the great Doctrines and Duties that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Sacred Writings. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. And he has commanded us to give the moſt careful Attendance to the Word diſpenſed, Luk. 8.18. <hi>Take heed how ye hear.</hi> And this is one Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Means to beget that Faith, and ſo the other Graces, which are neceſſary
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:003231_0088_0FF025AF8B15F788"/>
to Salvation. Rom. 10.17. —<hi>Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> You muſt therefore, improve your Opportunities to hear the Word Preached. You muſt watch at Wiſdoms Gates, and wait at the Poſts of her Doors, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. And whenever you go to the Houſe of GOD, you muſt go with an humble heart, ready to receive Inſtruction. And there you muſt give the moſt reverent, devout, and diligent attention to what is ſpoken to you, in the Name of GOD, and according to his Will. You muſt be willing to have your Sins detected and reproved, and your Duty explained and inculcated upon you, in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and <hi>receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word of God,</hi> Jam. 1.21. To ſuch Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as theſe, GOD has many times bleſt the Miniſtry of his Word, and made it the <hi>power of God to the ſalvation of their ſouls;</hi> as in Rom. 1.16.</p>
            <p>AND here, I ſhall take leave to add, as one ſpecial means to underſtand the Will of GOD, and to receive farther light, in the great Affair of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: 'Tis your Duty to go to the Miniſters of CHRIST, whoſe great Work and Buſineſs it is, to direct and aſſiſt your
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:003231_0089_0FF025B14845C858"/>
Souls, from the Word of GOD, in the way to Heaven and Happineſs. And therefore, when you are in Darkneſs and Diſtreſs about your Spiritual ſtate, and don't receive that Light and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Preached Word, which you are waiting and praying for; go to your Miniſters; acquaint them with the ſtate and circumſtances of your poor Souls. Don't be aſham'd or afraid to do ſo, as many have ſinfully been, leſt you betray your own Ignorance: but go, and give them to underſtand, as well as you can, what your ſad State and Fears are; and ask their Counſels and Prayers for you. So did the poor <hi>Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> in our <hi>Context.</hi> He ſprang in, and came trembling, with an Heart full of Conviction and Diſtreſs, to <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas,</hi> two <hi>eminent</hi> MINISTERS of JESUS CHRIST; and inquired particularly of them, <hi>what he muſt do to be ſaved?</hi> And GOD bleſt this method as a means for ſaving good to him. And many poor Souls beſides have received unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefit in this way. And for your Encouragement herein, I can aſſure you in the Name of every faithful Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, that he will receive you with all Tenderneſs and Compaſſion, and give you the beſt Counſel and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:003231_0090_0FF025B57287F578"/>
he can, from the Word of GOD. And now by theſe means; that is, by this Prayer to GOD to give you underſtanding in His Word; — by this Reading and Meditation in private; by this publick attendance to the Word Preached: and by asking Counſel and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Miniſters of CHRIST, under your dark and diſtreſſing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, 'tis to be hop'd you'l come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the mind and will of God, as it is made known to us in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>AND when you have gain'd this Light and Inſtruction from the Word of GOD, you muſt reſolve to make this WORD the RULE of your Faith, Worſhip, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the World. You muſt ſubmit your Reaſon and Underſtanding to the revelation of GOD, and receive the great Doctrines and Articles of Chriſtianity, as true and faithful ſayings, upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of GOD, who has revealed them to us: You muſt ſerve and worſhip GOD according to the directions of his holy Word: And you muſt ſtrive with all you might to order your Converſation in all reſpects agreable to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and herein keep a Conſcience void of offence both towards GOD &amp; towards man. By ſuch a careful and diligent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:003231_0091_0FEFD968D71247D0"/>
of the Word of GOD, it will, by the mighty influence of the Holy Spirit, become the Power of GOD to the Salvation of your precious Soul.</p>
            <p>But then again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF you deſire to get into a ſtate of Grace, you muſt be abundant <hi>in Prayer to GOD</hi> for this end. Prayer is a duty indiſpenſably required of all Perſons, both by the Light of Nature and Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. And it is an inſtituted Means for the Converſion and Salvation of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sinners: And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had plainly diſcovered the hypocriſy of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he was ſtill in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and in the bond of iniquity, gives him this direction, in order to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Act. 8.22. <hi>Repent of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> For tho', 'tis very evident, there can be no real vertue in the Prayers of an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Sinner; yet GOD delights to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his own Inſtitution, and has many a time beſtowed ſaving Grace upon a poor Sinner, when he has, in agony of Soul, from an apprehenſion of his miſerable ſtate by Nature, cry'd to him for his Mercy. And 'tis one of the moſt hopeful <hi>Symtoms</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:003231_0092_0FF025B966E70F88"/>
that GOD intends to give Grace to a poor Sinner, when, by the Convictions of his Holy Spirit, he has brought the Sinner to Pray earneſtly to him. And therefore, as you who are now making that Inquiry in the Text, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> are in deep Concern about the ſtate of your poor Souls, and wan't to be directed in the way to Heaven, I can ſcarce give you a more proper Direction thin this, <hi>Pray humbly to GOD, for the Salvation of your poor Souls.</hi> And that you may improve this Ordinance ſo as to reap ſaving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it:</p>
            <p>SEE that you do in the firſt place, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily bleſs and praiſe GOD for what he has done for you already. That is, you muſt bleſs GOD, that he has preſerved your Soul in Life, and not ſent you down into Hell, as he might juſtly have done, long before now. Adore his ſovereign Grace and Patience towards you, in this reſpect, and give him the glory of them. Again, Bleſs GOD for the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> there is of your Eternal Salvation, by his provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a glorious and almighty SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, for poor Sinners, as CHRIST is. And then again, Bleſs GOD for his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Mercy in ordering your Birth and Being, not in a Land of <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Darkneſs; but in a place where <hi>CHRIST
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:003231_0093_0FF025BDCCCEF228"/>
is revealed,</hi> and the <hi>Means</hi> of Grace and Salvation are, or may be enjoyed, in great Plenty, by all ſorts of Sinners. And then, in a particular manner, Bleſs GOD for the ſtrivings of His Holy Spirit; and the gracious Effects of them: For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and Awakenings you are under; and the deep Concern you are in at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, about the ſtate of your Soul and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World. Indeed, theſe Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they ariſe to any conſiderable Degree, are very oppreſſive and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to Nature; and many an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinner has look'd upon them only as the expreſſions of GOD's Anger; and ſo has been for ſhaking them off, as ſoon as he could: But believe it, poor Soul, There is a great deal of Mercy in them. They come with a gracious deſign to ſhow you the need you ſtand in of a Chriſt, and put you upon flying to him in time, as your only ſure Refuge for Eternity. And therefore they are a ſufficient Ground for Praiſe. And you ſhould in the moſt ſolemn and affectionate manner, bleſs and praiſe GOD, that he has not left you, as he has done thouſands and millions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to periſh in a dead ſleep of carnal ſecurity; but has in a great meaſure, ſhewn you your miſery by nature; and diſcovered the wants of your poor Soul;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:003231_0094_0FF025C02F3ADDB8"/>
and put you upon ſeeking after a remedy, if one may be found. And having thus bleſt GOD for what he has done for you already,</p>
            <p>PRAY humbly and importunately to Him for what you ſtand in need of. Oh, Beg of him, that, as he has begun to ſhew Mercy to you, in the Convictions of his Spirit; ſo that He would carry on this good Work, and cauſe his Convictions to take ſuch deep root in your Heart, that they may never wear off; but abide in the moſt lively Impreſſions, till the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious end of them is anſwered in a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Converſion to GOD. Plead with Him to waſh away the Guilt and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your poor Soul in the Blood of Chriſt. Intreat Him to renew &amp; ſanctify you, by his Grace and Spirit, throughout, in Soul, Spirit, and in Body. Beg of Him to create a clean Heart, and to form a right Spirit in you. Pray, that He would enlighten your dark Mind; renew your ſtubborn Will; purge your defiled Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience; and ſanctify your diſordered Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And for this purpoſe; Beg his Bleſſing upon all the means of Grace you enjoy. Pray that his Spirit may breathe in them; and in and thro' them, breathe Life into your dead Soul. And Oh, be in agony of Soul while you are in your
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:003231_0095_0FF025C29614D500"/>
Supplications to Him for Eternal Life; and uſe all the Arguments you can, in Prayer, to move his moſt tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions towards you. Lay open the Wants and Diſtreſſes of your poor Soul in the Duty. Lament the Miſeries of your doleful ſtate by Nature; and urge the Neceſſity of Eternal Salvation: Tell him what an undone Wretch you ſhall be forever; and how greatly you ſhall diſhonour Him to Eternity, unleſs he have Mercy on you. Declare to Him, what a Deſire you have after Eternal Life; and that you can't bear the thought of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing under the dreadful weight of his Eternal Wrath. Put Him alſo in mind of the great and glorious Proviſion He has made by CHRIST, for the Salvation of ſuch miſerable Sinners as you are; and how great his Glory will be forever in your Salvation thro' Jeſus Chriſt. Again, Put Him in mind of the many gracious Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations He has made to poor Sinners to come to Him in and through the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for Pardon and Salvation: Yea, urge this, that He has ſolemnly Commanded you to do ſo; and that 'tis in Obedience to his revealed Will, that you thus ſeek to Him, for the Mercy you need. And in a Word, Humbly declare to Him, that it is the ſtedfaſt Reſolution of your
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:003231_0096_0FF025C41FCFE3F0"/>
Soul, to caſt your ſelf upon Him for his Grace in and thro' Chriſt; and that if you muſt periſh at laſt, you will periſh at the feet of his Mercy. And while you are thus begging for the Mercy of GOD in Prayer: Oh, Give up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote your ſelf to Him in the ſame Duty. Say, <hi>Lord, I am thine; for thou haſt made me, and doſt daily preſerve me; and haſt paid down a price ſufficient for my Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption: And accordingly I deſire to be thine for ever; and do here upon my bended knees, preſent my ſelf, Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to thee, a living Sacrifice: and devote all I have, to be employed in thy Service and for thy Glory: 'This, I acknowledge to be but my reaſonable Service: Oh, therefore, accept of me in the Son of thy Love; and ſave me for ever, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies in Him.</hi> Prayer thus improved can't but be very helpful to poor Sinners, in the great Concern of their Souls Salvation.</p>
            <p>AND when you have thus improved the Word and Prayer; and GOD has Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed them ſo, that you begin to feel a mighty Change in you; and do now hate your Sins, and loath your ſelf for them; and find the Deſires of your Soul drawn forth after Jeſus Chriſt: and are
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:003231_0097_0FF025C77B195D30"/>
heartily willing to receive and embrace Him in all his Offices, and take your greateſt Delight in the Service of GOD and CHRIST. Then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. As you deſire to grow and improve in Grace, and ripen for Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you muſt carefully obſerve the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the New-Teſtament. Theſe are <hi>two, viz.</hi> BAPTISM and the LORD's SUPPER. And they are "holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances inſtituted by CHRIST, wherein by ſenſible ſigns, CHRIST and the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the New Covenant, are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſealed and applied to Believers". And they are moſt admirable Means for growth and increaſe in Grace. And therefore when GOD has bleſs'd the Word and Prayer, or any ſpecial Providence, ſo as to bring you to the happy Frame and Temper but now hinted, 'tis high time for you alſo to improve <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as ſpecial Means for your furtherance in the way to Salvation. And agreably, if you are come to adult Age, and have never yet been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, you muſt ſpeedily give up your Name Publickly to GOD in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; or if you were Baptized in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 'tis equally neceſſary that now you ſhould in the moſt ſolemn manner Renew
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:003231_0098_0FF025C9E0B8E078"/>
your Baptiſmal Covenant, and at the ſame time come up to the TABLE of the LORD: For if you can do one, you may do the other alſo, acceptably unto GOD. And therefore I put both together; and am grieved that ſo many weak Chriſtians make ſuch a groundleſs diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as they do. I mean, as to their Qualifications for them. But to go on, you muſt, as I ſaid before, come up to, and improve the viſible Seals of the New Covenant, one or both of them, as your caſe may require. They are both Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Duty. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſo; and is of great Importance to Salvation: As we find in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. where ſays <hi>Peter</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <hi>Jews,</hi> in anſwer to that great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of their's, in the preceeding verſe, <hi>What muſt we do? You muſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and be Baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is as ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required as Baptiſm. Luk. 22.19. — <hi>Do this,</hi> i. e. Take and eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> And therefore for any to live in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs neglect of them under this pretence, that they are not neceſſary to Salvation, is a bold and daring affront to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of GOD and CHRIST, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence of their unregenerate ſtate.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:003231_0099_0FF026841CA44680"/>
You muſt therefore ſay and do otherwiſe if you intend to be ſaved. That is, you muſt own the neceſſity of theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and carefully obſerve them. And they are (as I ſaid before) moſt admirable Means for a Chriſtian's Growth and Improvement in Grace. for in theſe Ordinances the Believer does, as it were, ſet his Hand and Seal to the Covenant of Grace; and confirm the Dedication of himſelf unto GOD; and GOD at the ſame time makes over His CHRIST and all the Bleſſings of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Believing Soul in them. And then beſides, the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is a precious means of intimate Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with CHRIST; and the Believer fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches new Life, Strength, and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Redeemer, every time he eats and drinks in Faith at the Table of the Lord. And this prepares him more and more the full Enjoyment of GOD and CHRIST in Eternal Glory. Thus I have conſidered the <hi>Inſtituted</hi> Means of Salvation; and ſhewn how you muſt improve them, if you mean to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE are the <hi>Occaſional</hi> Means and Helps of Salvation; which you muſt carefully obſerve and
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003231_0100_0FF025CC48065A10"/>
improve, if you deſire to be ſaved. And theſe are the REMARKABLE PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDENCES of GOD towards us in the World. And I call them Occaſional Means: For, tho' GOD has not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in His Word, as ordinary and neceſſary Means of Salvation; yet, He frequently makes uſe of them for the Conviction and Converſion of Sinners. And when we meet with ſuch Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, GOD commands us to obſerve them, and improve them to our Spiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: as I could eaſily make appear, if need were. And therefore, whenever you meet with any remarkable Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven, whether by way of <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Judgment,</hi> you ought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them ſo as to get Spiritual Good by them. Thus when you meet with any ſignal Mercies or Deliverances from the Hand of GOD, you ſhould improve them ſo, that by His Goodneſs you may be led to Repentance; for this is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial End why GOD beſtows His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon Sinners. Rom. 2.4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi> And ſo when GOD ſends his Judgments upon you, and awakens you by them; or, threatens you by any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:003231_0101_0FF025CDE8A82078"/>
Diſpenſation; as lately he threatned to deſtroy us all in a moment, when the Earth quaked under us, our Houſes ſhook over us, and our Hearts were ready to fail within us: Such Providences you ought to ſet a ſpecial Remark upon. And as GOD does convince you of your Sins and awaken his Terrors in you by theſe Means: ſo you muſt hearken to the Call of GOD in them. You muſt Repent of, and turn from, thoſe Sins, for which He is angry at you, and threatens you with ſuch ſeverity: and beg of Him that the good Impreſſions which ſuch awful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations are apt to make upon our Hearts, for the preſent, may not prove as <hi>the morning cloud and the early dew, which ſoon paſſeth away:</hi> but may prove abiding and ſaving Impreſſions: That the fruit of them may be to purge out Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and take away Sin: and be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to bring you nearer to GOD and CHRIST. And then, you'l have reaſon for ever to bleſs GOD for them.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have finiſhed the Second general Head in anſwer to the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Inquiry in our Text. And now I go on to the laſt general Head in anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the ſame Queſtion. And this is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:003231_0102_0FF025D14657A458"/>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> IF you would be ſaved you muſt particularly <hi>cloſe in with the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST <hi>by</hi> FAITH, as He is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us in the Goſpel. And now I come to the main Article I have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. For <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> is the very <hi>Hinge</hi> upon which the Eternal Salvation of a Sinner turns. And therefore, let a Sinner do ever ſo much in Religion: Let him be ever ſo diligent and conſtant in attending and improving all the other Means and Helps of Salvation; yet, if he neglects <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> 'tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould be ſaved, according to the tenour of the New-Covenant: For our Saviour himſelf is very poſitive in this, Joh. 3.18. — <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> And again in ver. 36<hi>th. — He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> But on the other hand; If a Sinner is once brought to cloſe in with Chriſt by Faith, upon Goſpel Terms, this will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually and infallibly ſecure his Eternal Salvation. This is evident from what our Saviour himſelf aſſerts in the places but now mentioned. Joh. 3.18, &amp; 36. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned.</hi> And again, <hi>He that believeth on the Son
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:003231_0103_0FF025D565228010"/>
hath everlaſting Life.</hi> And therefore, when the convinced <hi>Jaylor</hi> came to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas</hi> his Companion, with that moſt ſerious and important Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his mouth, — <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> as in the <hi>Text</hi>: They were at no loſs at all what Anſwer to give him, but immediately made that reply in the <hi>next verſe, — Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> As if they had ſaid to him, <q>Let your former Tranſgreſſions have been ever ſo many and great; your Guilt contracted by them, of ever ſo crimſon and bloody a Dye, and your Fears and Proſpects on the account of them ever ſo dark and diſtreſſing; yet, if you will but go to Jeſus Chriſt, whom GOD has given to die and riſe again for the Salvation of Sinners, and do but Believe in Him alone for Righteouſneſs and Salvation, you need not fear; your Sins, which are many ſhall be forgiven, and the Guilt and Pollution of them waſh'd away in His precious Blood: you ſhall be juſtified by His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and ſaved with an everlaſting Salvation, by His infinite Merit.</q> And thus you ſee that Faith in Chriſt is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that does Believe aright in Him,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:003231_0104_0FF025D6EC4EC600"/>
ſhall certainly be ſaved. But now, ſince many Convinced and Awakened Sinners are very much in the dark about the <hi>Nature</hi> of ſaving Faith, and the <hi>Manner</hi> of a Sinners cloſing in with Chriſt by Faith for Salvation, I ſhall ſpend ſome Time in opening and confirming this great Point, for the Direction and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of all ſuch as are in earneſt ſeeking and inquiring after Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And here, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall give you a ſhort Account of the Nature of Saving Faith. And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Show what courſe a poor Convinced Sinner muſt take, that ſo he may cloſe in effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with Chriſt by Faith for Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> I ſhall give you a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Nature</hi> of Saving Faith, as a proper Foundation to what follows.</p>
            <p>AND here I ſhall lay down this as a general Deſcription of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>SAVING Faith is that Grace of the Holy Spirit, whereby a Convinced Sinner, having had a true Diſcovery of CHRIST, as He is Revealed to us in the Goſpel, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Approves of the method of Salvation by Him, and ſo, Receives and Reſts upon Him alone for Salvation, as He is made known, and offered, to us in the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:003231_0105_0FF025D95E2CB758"/>THIS general Deſcription I ſhall briefly open to you in the ſeveral parts of it. And ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. SAVING Faith is a <hi>Grace</hi> of the HOLY SPIRIT. That is, Saving Faith is one of the free and diſtinguiſhing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of GOD towards thoſe that are endow'd with it: And 'tis wrought in the Heart, not by the Power and Virtue of any Means, in themſelves, but by the immediate Influence and Agency of the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD. And therefore, Saving Faith is ſaid expreſly not to be <hi>of our ſelves:</hi> but <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> in Eph. 2.8. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS Faith is wrought in the Heart of a <hi>Convinced</hi> Sinner. Not that every Convinced Sinner has ſaving Faith wrought in him: For many a one that has been Convinced and Awakened, for a time, has found means to ſhake off his Convictions; and ſo at length dy'd in a ſtate of Impenitency and Unbelief: But however, the Sinner muſt be Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and brought to a deep ſenſe of his Sin and Miſery by Nature, and the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute need he ſtands in of Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be willing to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Saviour by Faith. For before
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:003231_0106_0FF025DB00B70B60"/>
this Conviction the Sinner ſees no need he ſtands in of Salvation; and ſo, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſlight and contemn the offer of a Saviour; as they did, whom our Lord upbraids, in Joh. 4.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi> And therefore, this Conviction is neceſſary to prepare the way for Faith in Chriſt. And agreably, ſuch Sinners only are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon <hi>immediately</hi> to cloſe in with Chriſt by Faith; as you may ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however,</p>
            <p n="3">3. BEFORE the Convinced Sinner actually cloſes in with Chriſt by Faith, he has a <hi>Diſcovery of Chriſt,</hi> as He is revealed and offered to us in the Goſpel. For, the Holy Spirit, who firſt convinces the Sinner of his Guilt and Pollution by Nature, and of the need he ſtands in of Salvation, goes on to Reveal to him where his Help is to be found, and makes Chriſt known to his Soul. He ſhews the Sinner the glorious Contrivance of GOD for our Salvation by a Redeemer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the only SAVIOUR to him in the Glory and Fulneſs of his Perſon, Offices and Benefits. This is plain from what our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> upon his declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him to <hi>be the Chriſt, the Son of the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:003231_0107_0FF025DE60746150"/>
living God,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. For upon this ſays Chriſt in the <hi>next verſe, — Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee: but my father which is in heaven.</hi> And when the Sinner has once gain'd a true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Chriſt, Then,</p>
            <p n="4">4. HE highly <hi>Approves</hi> of the Method of our Redemption and Salvation by Him. For the Convinced and Enlightened Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, beholding the infinite Wiſdom and Grace of GOD in this Contrivance of Salvation by JESUS CHRIST; and ſeeing that it is wonderfully adapted beyond any other way whatever, to advance the great Ends propoſed in the Salvation of a Sinner; which are the Glory of GOD, and the Happineſs of the poor Sinner; he is bro't immediately to Receive this Revelation concerning Chriſt, <hi>as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and worthy of all Acceptation;</hi> as we find in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p>And upon this,</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE Sinner that has Faith wrought in his Heart, willingly <hi>Receives</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces</hi> CHRIST, as He is revealed in the Goſpel. That is, he freely accepts Him as His Lord and Saviour: He cloſes in with Him in all his Offices, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:003231_0108_0FF025E0C7081C20"/>
Prieſt and King of his Salvation; and embraces Him thus upon His own Terms; being ready and willing to <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> all that Chriſt requires, that he may be ſaved by Him. And upon his thus receiving Chriſt,</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE Believing Sinner <hi>Reſts</hi> and <hi>Relies</hi> upon Him alone for Salvation. That is, He wholly and forever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces all other Methods and Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Salvation, and has no Dependance upon any thing but Chriſt for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he needs. And he ſees ſuch a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in Chriſt, ſuch an infinite Fulneſs and Sufficiency in Him, that he finds he may ſafely depend upon Him; and ſo caſts the whole Burden, and leans all the Weight of his Eternal Salvation upon Him; hoping that <hi>Chriſt will be made unto him, of God, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. "And whatſoever fears he hath, yet he reſolves here he will lie, and go no whither elſe, for what he wants: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Joh. 6.68. — <hi>Lord, to whom ſhould we go? Thou haſt the words of eternal Life."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have given you a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of true and ſaving Faith, only as
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003231_0109_0FF025E32F52AF60"/>
a Foundation to what I am to conſider more largely under the next general Head. But I ſhall go no further at this time; but conclude this Diſcourſe, with a ſhort <hi>Reflection</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> on what has been ſaid concerning the general Nature of Goſpel Faith, and the Neceſſity of it for Salvation.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Infer.</hi> WE hence learn that <hi>true and ſaving Faith, is quite another thing,</hi> than moſt Men take it to be. For the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, even of thoſe who are favour'd with Goſpel Revelation, are ready to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, That Divine Faith conſiſts only in <hi>a bare Belief,</hi> or <hi>Aſſent</hi> of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings to the Truth of this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And therefore, if you Diſcourſe with them about the Nature of ſaving Faith; and inquire, whether they have any grounds to conclude they have this Faith in them? They'l readily reply; That they are no Infidels: For, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Scriptures are the Word of GOD, and that the Doctrines revealed in them are the Truths of GOD: And, in particular, That they believe that Chriſt, who is ſo much ſpoken of in the Goſpel, died for the Salvation of Sinners; and upon this, they expreſs a Confidence,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:003231_0110_0FF025E769D6B950"/>
that God, who is a merciful GOD, will ſave them for His ſake. And if you go on to Inquire, How they came by this Faith? They'l ſay, This is the Faith they were born and brought up in. And this is the beſt Account they can give of the matter: And therefore, this is all the Foundation they have to build their Hopes for Heaven and Happineſs upon. But, believe it Sinner, if you have no other notion of true and ſaving Faith than this, your Faith is no better, than <hi>the Faith of Devils;</hi> for, doubtleſs, they have as clear an underſtanding of the Scripture-revelation concerning Chriſt, and as firmly aſſent to the truth of it, as you can do. (See <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.) And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, all the Hopes you ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Faith are vain and preſumptuous. And 'tis very lamentable to think, how many poor Sinners go on, all their days, in this groundleſs preſumption; and won't ſuffer any one to rectify this <hi>fatal</hi> miſtake for them, nor be at any pains to do it themſelves, 'till they come to be convinced of their <hi>Error,</hi> in the Agonies of Death: And then their falſe Hopes vaniſh in a moment, and endleſs Deſpair ſeizes upon them: Agreable to that, in Prov. 11.7. <hi>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation ſhall periſh: and the hope of
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:003231_0111_0FF025EAB77328F0"/>
unjuſt men periſheth.</hi> O then! if you have any deſire at all to be Saved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this preſumptuous Faith and Hope: And while you have Time and Means for it, ſearch narrowly into the Nature and Grounds of true and ſaving Faith. Study the Holy Scriptures with care and diligence, to ſee what account they give of this Faith, and Pray to GOD to enlighten you in the knowledge of this Myſtery: And then, I am perſwaded you'l ſoon be convinced, that the <hi>Faith of God's Elect,</hi> contains much more in it, than the naked aſſent of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to the faith of the Scripture-revelation concerning Chriſt: And in particular, that it alſo comprehends in it, the Souls delightful Approbation of the Method of our Redemption by Him: and the hearty Conſent of the Will, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and Embrace Him, in all His Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and upon His own Terms &amp;c. as I hinted before, and ſhall more fully make out in the following Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Infer.</hi> SINCE this Faith is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, you ought to be <hi>greatly concerned</hi> how to obtain it. And muſt take the ſame pains to become
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:003231_0112_0FF025EC433749B8"/>
a ſincere Believer in Chriſt, that you would to ſecure your Title to Heaven and Glory. For there is an inſeparable Connection between them. That is, Faith <hi>unites</hi> the Soul to Chriſt; and this Union <hi>entitles</hi> the Believer to all the Benefits of Redemption by Him. And therefore, our Saviour aſſures us, in Mar. 16.16. <hi>He that believeth — ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Well then, ſince Faith is ſo eſſential to Salvation, let this be your next Inquiry, How ſhall I obtain this Faith? What Courſe muſt I take? What Means muſt I uſe for this End? And this will prepare the way, for a chearful Compliance with thoſe weighty Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are the Subject of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt Diſcourſe I gave you a ſhort Account of the Nature and Importance of Goſpel Faith, as a Means to Salvation.</p>
            <p>And now,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proceed to ſhow <hi>what Courſe</hi> a poor Convinced Sinner muſt take, to obtain this Faith in CHRIST, and be ſaved by Him.</p>
            <p>AND here I ſhall ſay, I. You muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to See and Know, what a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our CHRIST is. Upon which, II. You muſt conſent to Receive and Embrace Him, in all His Offices, and upon His own Terms. And when you have done this, III. You muſt have your whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Him alone for Salvation. Theſe are the three Principal DIRECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, that are to be attended in this Caſe:
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:003231_0114_0FF025F11D6FB4A0"/>
And every Sinner that is enabled, by the Grace of GOD, to comply with them, is a Believer in Chriſt, and has a ſure and unalienable Title to Eternal Life. I ſhall therefore ſpeak ſomething diſtinctly to each of theſe Heads. And ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">I. IF you deſire to obtain a true and ſaving Faith in JESUS CHRIST, you muſt endeavour to <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>know</hi> what a SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR He is. For, without an agreable Knowledge of Him, there can be no ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith in Him. This is evident from that of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. — <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks here by way of Interrogation: "which is the more convincing; becauſe it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it, a ſort of appeal to the perſons ſpoken to". And this kind of Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is equivalent to a negative Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: ſo that the ſenſe of the words is plainly this, <hi>viz.</hi> Men muſt hear of Chriſt, and ſo come to the Knowledge of Him, or they can never Believe in Him, ſo as to be ſaved by Him. And the Reaſon is evidently this, That Faith, which is not grounded upon ſome proper Knowledge of the Object of it, is Faith without a Foundation; and ſo is but a mere Fancy, or vain Credulity, rather
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:003231_0115_0FF025F497E6B2B8"/>
than true Faith. But, on the other hand, if the Sinner is once thoroughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt, and comes to know, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, what a Saviour is provided for us, he'll ſoon be brought to Believe and Truſt in Him for Eternal Life. For <hi>David</hi> aſſures us, in Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know the name of the Lord will put their Truſt in him.</hi> And agreably, this Knowledge is call'd <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 17.3. <hi>And this is Life Eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> i. e. there is an inſeparable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between the true Knowledge of Chriſt, and Salvation by Him. And that you may not be at a loſs to know what I intend by this Knowledge of Chriſt, which is eſſential to true Faith, and lays the Foundation for a Sinners cloſing in immediately with Him for Salvation, I ſhall give you this ſhort Deſcription of it, namely, <hi>This Knowledge of Chriſt is that inward and ſpiritual Acquaintance with the Doctrine of Chriſt, as revealed to us in the Goſpel, which gains the Aſſent of the Underſtanding to the Truth of this Revelation, and the Approbation of his Judgment to the Reaſonableneſs and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our Salvation by Him.</hi> In this Deſcription there are two principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:003231_0116_0FF025F61F286508"/>
contain'd; which (tho' you have had ſome Hints upon them, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Account of true and ſaving Faith) I ſhall more particularly open and explain in this place. And ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS Knowledge ſuppoſes <hi>a thorow Acquaintance with</hi> the DOCTRINE of CHRIST, <hi>as Revealed to us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> And therefore, every one that has this Knowledge, is ſo well acquainted with the Goſpel Revelation, that he is able to give a good account of what the Scriptures ſay concerning the Perſon, the Nature, the Offices, the Benefits of Chriſt, and other Articles of this kind; which the Scriptures reveal, and have made neceſſary to be known to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is what we uſually call, <hi>the Doctrinal Knowledge of CHRIST.</hi> And ſince theſe Lines may, probably, fall into the Hands of ſome awakened Ones, who are very <hi>ignorant</hi> of the Redeemer; and who, by reaſon of their <hi>unskilfulneſs</hi> in ſearching the Scriptures, and compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Text with another, muſt needs ſpend a great deal of Time and Pains, without ſome more compendious Help, to gain a competent Knowledge of Chriſt; I ſhall for the Information of theſe, give a <hi>ſummary</hi> Account of this
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:003231_0117_0FF025F7A912D0F8"/>
Doctrine, as it is revealed and made known to us in the Goſpel. And accordingly, you muſt know, That the Saviour, whom you are bound to believe in, "is both GOD and MAN in two diſtinct Natures and one Perſon forever". And therefore, He is ſometimes called GOD. See Joh. 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with GOD, and the WORD was GOD.</hi> And Rom. 9.5. <hi>CHRIST, who is over all, GOD BLESSED FOR EVER.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times He is called MAN, as in 1 Tim. 2.5. — <hi>The MAN CHRIST JESUS.</hi> And by the UNION of theſe two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in one Perſon, He is called EMMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUEL, <hi>which, being interpreted, is God with us,</hi> or, God in our Nature, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.23. And as Chriſt is both God and Man in one Perſon; you muſt know, that according to His DIVINE NATURE, He is <hi>the Son of God, and the only begotten of the Father.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.34. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.18. with many more places: and that this SONSHIP is by <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>ineffable</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: For the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him ſays, in Chap. 53.8. — <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generation?</hi> And being thus the SON of GOD, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that He is the Second Perſon in the adorable Trinity; the ſame in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:003231_0118_0FF025FA1D502A68"/>
and equal in Power and Glory, with the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST: For we read in Joh. 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt: and theſe three are One.</hi> And concerning this WORD, we are taught in Phil. 3.6 <hi>That being in the form of God, he tho't it not robbery to be equal with God:</hi> being <hi>the brightneſs of the Father's Glory, and the expreſs image of his Perſon:</hi> as we find in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. And then, as for the HUMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY of Chriſt, you muſt know, that this Glorious SON of GOD <hi>aſſumed,</hi> or took our Nature into, that which we call, a <hi>Perſonal Union</hi> with his Divine Nature: And the manner of it, was, by His <hi>being conceived by the power of the Holy-Ghoſt, in the womb of the virgin Mary,</hi> Math. 1.20. And by this means, He wholly eſcap'd the Guilt and Pollution we bro't into the World with us, in the way of natural Generation. This we learn from Luk. 1.35. <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto her,</hi> i.e. unto <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of our Lord, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the Higheſt ſhall over ſhadow thee: therefore that HOLY THING that ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called, the SON OF GOD.</hi> And agreably, He is ſaid, in Heb. 7.26. — <hi>to be holy, harmleſs, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:003231_0119_0FF025FE5BB2F140"/>
ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> Theſe are the things you muſt learn concerning the Nature and Conſtitution of Chriſt's Perſon. And by this means, you will ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how admirably He is fitted to accompliſh the great Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And accordingly, you muſt know, that this bleſſed <hi>Immanuel</hi> is the <hi>only</hi> Perſon, whom the Father has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to be the MEDIATOR of the New Covenant: As we find in 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And by conſequence, that He is the very Saviour that was <hi>promiſed</hi> to our firſt Parents, as ſoon as they ſtood in need of ſuch an one, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom, <hi>when the fulneſs of time came, the FATHER ſent into the world, made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law;</hi> as we read in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. And that He might more effectually diſcharge this high Truſt, you you muſt know further, that He is, more particularly, veſted with a threefold Office of <hi>Prophet, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> "which He executeth as our Redeemer, both in His ſtate of Humiliation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation". (1.) With the Office of a PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHET; as <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold of Him in Deut. 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:003231_0120_0FF025FFE4B49370"/>
unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thy brethren like unto me, unto him ſhall ye hearken.</hi> Which words are interpreted of Chriſt, in <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. And this Office He diſcharges "in his revealing to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by his Word and Spirit, the will of GOD for their Salvation". Again (2.) He is veſted with the Office of a PRIEST. Heb. 5.5, 10. <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an high Prieſt: but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. — Called of God an high Prieſt.</hi> And in the Execution of this Office, you muſt know, that when He was here, in our Nature, He did, in his Obedience unto Death, offer up Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to atone the Juſtice of GOD for our Offences; a Sacrifice that had infinite Merit in it, and ſo was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely pleaſing to the FATHER, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. And that after He had made this <hi>Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for us, by His Sufferings and Death, He <hi>aroſe</hi> out of the Grave <hi>for our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (Rom. 4.25.) <hi>aſcended</hi> into Heaven, <hi>leading Captivity Captive,</hi> (Eph. 4.8.) And is there <hi>ſeated</hi> at the Right Hand of GOD, where <hi>He ever liveth to make Interceſſion for us,</hi> (Heb. 7.25.) And then (3.) JESUS CHRIST is veſted the Office of a KING. For He is <hi>the King whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has ſet upon his holy hill of Zion,</hi> (Pſal.

2.6.) And being exalted to that Dignity, you muſt know that <hi>He has a name given him above every name: that at the name of JESUS every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, &amp; things under the Earth; and that every Tongue ſhould confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father,</hi> (Phil. 3.9, 10, 11.) And that, in the Execution of this Office, He now Over-rules and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all things in the Kingdom of Grace and Providence, for the good of His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8.) And will finally come <hi>to Judge the World in Righteouſneſs,</hi> (Act. 17.31.) And ſo <hi>render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deeds: to them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and Immortality; Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: But unto them that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; Indignation &amp; Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh</hi>— (Rom. 2, 7, 8, 9.) And as neceſſary <hi>Inferences</hi> from all that has been ſaid concerning the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Chriſt, you muſt farther know, that this JESUS is an ALMIGHTY SAVIOUR; <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by Him,</hi> (Heb. 7.25.) Again, That He is a moſt WILLING and COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PASSIONATE SAVIOUR; and will never reject any that go to GOD in and thro'
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:003231_0122_0FF02605B57EDAD0"/>
Him, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 7.27.) And finally, That He is the ONLY SAVIOUR of Sinners: For we read in Act. 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other: for there is none other Name under Heaven, given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have given you a brief Account of the Principal Things, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us in the Scriptures concerning Chriſt: And they are, every one of them, of very great Importance, if not of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity, to be known, that ſo you may obtain true and ſaving Faith in Him. But then, as this ſaving Knowledge according to the Deſcription I have given, implies ſomething more than a Doctrinal Acquaintance with the Scripture Revelation concerning Chriſt, I add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS Knowledge muſt be <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> ſo as to gain the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the UNDERSTANDING to the Truth of this Revelation, and the <hi>Approbation</hi> of the JUDGMENT to the Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of our being Saved by Chriſt. And herein conſiſts the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of true and ſaving Knowledge: or, <hi>that,</hi> whereby the Knowledge of the Believer, is diſtinguiſhed from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:003231_0123_0FF02609C95C54F0"/>
of all other Men whatever. For many Unconverted Perſons, under the Light of the Goſpel, are as well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Scripture-revelation of Chriſt, as any of the Children of God; and can give a more diſtinct account of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt, as it is taught us in the Goſpel, than many true Believers can do. But then, They, either look upon all that is ſaid concerning Chriſt, in the Goſpel, to be but a mere <hi>Fable,</hi> and ſo believe not one word that is ſaid concerning Him; as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and ſuch like Infidels do: or elſe, they are deeply prejudiced againſt this way of Salvation by Chriſt; and can't bear to think that HE ſhould have all the Glory, and <hi>Men</hi> ſo little of the Credit of a Sinners Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And this is the Condition of all ſuch who are building their Hopes for Heaven upon a Righteouſneſs of their own. And therefore, this true and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge is ſomething more than <hi>Speculative,</hi> which floats only in the Head and Imagination: it <hi>ſinks deeper into the Heart,</hi> and takes faſt hold of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and leading Powers of the Soul. And for this reaſon, I call it an <hi>inward</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Doctrine of Chriſt. And I add <hi>Spiritual,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from that carnal Knowledge, which only puffs Men
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003231_0124_0FF0260D1E924B40"/>
up with Pride, and becauſe the Spirit of GOD is the Author of it; as you will preſently here. And every one that has this Knowledge, gives in the real and unfeigned <hi>Aſſent</hi> of his Underſtanding, to all the great and fundamental Truths, which the Goſpel has revealed to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, and is fully perſwaded, not only of the certainty of their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but alſo that the Salvation of a Sinner is to be obtain'd only by Chriſt, as the Goſpel aſſerts. And to this firm aſſent of the Underſtanding, he joyns the hearty <hi>Approbation</hi> of his Judgment; and is really Convinced, upon the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Conſideration, that the whole Contrivance of our Redemption by Chriſt, as it is made known to us in the Goſpel, is the moſt Wiſe and Reaſonable, the moſt Juſt and Gracious, the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to GOD, and the ſafeſt for the Sinner, that could poſſibly be thought on: And ſo receives it as <hi>a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. And with the Apoſtle in Phil. 3.8. <hi>He accounts all other things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus I have given you the moſt clear and diſtinct Account I can, of that Knowledge of Chriſt, which is neceſſary to Faith and Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:003231_0125_0FF0260F8D8A1850"/>AND now, that you may gain this <hi>ſaving</hi> Acquaintance with Chriſt, <hi>You muſt be careful to improve the Appointed Means, which GOD has been won't to bleſs for the Communication of it, to Convinced and Awakened Sinners.</hi> And they are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, the WORD and PRAYER. Theſe, indeed, I conſider'd before, as ſpecial Means, of Divine Appointment, to bring a Sinner out of a ſtate of Nature into a ſtate of Grace: but here I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them only in their <hi>Aptitude</hi> or <hi>Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to bring a poor Sinner to the ſaving Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt: or, to that ſpiritual Acquaintance with Him, which will bring the Sinner to Receive and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Him alone for Salvation, as He is offered to us in the Goſpel. And therefore, I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF you would know Chriſt ſo as to believe in Him, you muſt <hi>carefully Attend</hi> to the WORD of GOD, both in the <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> of it. Now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very plainly, from what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon the Doctrinal Knowledge of Chriſt, That the SACRED SCRIPTURES contain the whole External Revelation of Chriſt, as a Saviour; and that there is no one Article, that is neceſſary to be known concerning Him, but what is
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:003231_0126_0FF0261242A62190"/>
therein clearly Revealed to us: And therefore, in themſelves conſidered, they are the moſt proper and natural Means, we can make uſe of, to come to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Knowledge of the Doctrine of Chriſt. But then, as we can never juſtly expect to be the Maſters of this Knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we take Pains for it, in the way of Divine Appointment; that is, by <hi>Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures,</hi> to ſee what they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal and Teſtify concerning Chriſt: as God commands us to do, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. And <hi>by giving a due Attendance</hi> to the Publick Diſpenſation of the Word, as He alſo directs us, for this End. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. and <hi>onwards.</hi> I ſay here, if you would lay the very Foundation of this true and ſaving Knowledge aright, you muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently apply your ſelves to the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of the Holy Scriptures, and carefully attend upon the <hi>Publick Diſpenſation</hi> of the Word, in the manner you were directed to do under a former Head: And by this means, you can ſcarce fail of gaining that <hi>Doctrinal Knowledge</hi> of CHRIST, which is neceſſary to Faith and Salvation. But ſince, as I ſaid before, the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this Knowledge alone, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring a Sinner to cloſe in with Chriſt by a true and ſaving Faith, I add,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:003231_0127_0FF0261684B84468"/>2. YOU muſt humbly and earneſtly <hi>Pray</hi> to GOD, that He would <hi>Reveal</hi> CHRIST to your Souls, and give you the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Underſtanding of that Way and Method of Salvation by Him, which is Reveal'd to us <hi>outwardly</hi> in the Goſpel. For obſerve it, whatever Convictions and Terrors of Conſcience you may be under, from that ſight, which the Law may help you to, of your miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition by Nature; you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be brought to Receive and Reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt alone for Salvation, 'till your Underſtandings are enlightened, and Chriſt be <hi>Revealed in you,</hi> by His Holy Spirit For we read in 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God: for they are fooliſhneſs to him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that you may gain that Knowledge of Chriſt which is Life Eternal, you muſt, particularly, Pray to GOD, That He would, by a powerful act of His Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Spirit, <hi>Firſt,</hi> open the eyes of your Underſtanding, that you may be able to <hi>diſcern ſpiritual things after a ſpiritual manner;</hi> and work ſuch a mighty Change in your Heart, as to turn the corrupt <hi>byas</hi> of it from Sin to Holineſs; and thereby enable you to <hi>Diſcern</hi> and <hi>Approve the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:003231_0128_0FF02618E85FE448"/>
things that are moſt excellent.</hi> And when you have Pray'd thus for the Illumination and Sanctification of the Faculties of the Inner Man: <hi>Then,</hi> Plead with GOD, That He would <hi>unveil</hi> the GLORY of CHRIST, and ſhow you that ſweet HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONY there is in the way of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Him: that ſo your Hearts may be fill'd with Admiration &amp; Praiſe, at the Wiſdom and Grace of GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in them. For, to this effect the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> pray'd, on behalf of the Chriſtian <hi>Epheſians;</hi> as we find in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. &amp; onwards. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I ceaſe not — to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of you in my Prayers; That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and revelation in the Knowledge of Him; the eyes of your Underſtanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints, and what is the exceeding greatneſs of his Power to us-ward, who believe according to his mighty Power &amp;c.</hi> And now, to cloſe this Head, if, by ſuch Means as theſe, you once come to know Chriſt, and the Power of his Reſurrection, and the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of his Sufferings, you can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with-hold the <hi>Conſent</hi> of your Souls
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:003231_0129_0FF0261A70D73C20"/>
from Him; but you'l run to Him as your only Refuge, to ſhelter you from the Storm of Divine Vengeance which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues you; and, with open Arms, you'll Receive Him in all His Offices; and, by an Act of Recumbency, caſt all the Cares of your Souls, and lay the whole ſtreſs of your Salvation upon Him.</p>
            <p>AND this leads me now to the <hi>next</hi> thing I propoſed in Directing, what Courſe you muſt take, that ſo you may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cloſe in with Chriſt for Salvation. And this is,</p>
            <p n="2">II. IF you would believe in Chriſt to the ſaving of your Soul, you muſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily CONSENT to <hi>Receive</hi> and <hi>Embrace</hi> Him in all His OFFICES, and upon His own TERMS, as He is offered to us in the Goſpel. For, the Faith of a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> is not, like the Faith of the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> confined to the Head, but it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the Heart alſo: It takes poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> yea, 'tis <hi>eminently</hi> ſeated in the <hi>Heart.</hi> For tho' there can be no ſaving Faith in Chriſt without a Doctrinal Knowledge of Him; yet (as I ſaid before) the largeſt Degrees of this Knowledge alone, will not ſecure a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt. Whereas on the other hand, if any poor
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:003231_0130_0FF0261CB834C758"/>
Soul, who has but a competent Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Doctrine or Chriſt, does but heartily Conſent to take Him for his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as He is offered in the Goſpel, he has that Faith in the Redeemer, which will immediately entitle him to Eternal Life. And therefore, this <hi>Conſent of the Will,</hi> to receive and embrace Chriſt, <hi>is an Eſſential Act of SAVING FAITH;</hi> and of infinite Importance in the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner. And accordingly, we frequently read of it in the Goſpel of God our Saviour. 'Tis expreſs'd to us in one place under the notion of <hi>Receiving</hi> Chriſt, Joh. 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God; even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> This <hi>Receiving</hi> is a relative Term, and neceſſarily ſuppoſes a previous Offer of Chriſt to us. For, (as One <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Taylor's</hi> Diſcourſe on Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</note> well obſerves) "what is not ſent, or offer'd me, I may ſnatch at, or ſeize by violence; but I can't properly he ſaid to <hi>Receive</hi> it". Now this offer of Chriſt is made to us in the Goſpel, and the true Believer Receives Him, not <hi>phyſically</hi> but in a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, i. e. He gives in the full Conſent of his Will, that Chriſt ſhould be his upon Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Terms. <hi>Again,</hi> This Conſenting Act
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:003231_0131_0FF026201C4AF738"/>
of Faith is expreſſed by Believing in Chriſt <hi>with all the Heart.</hi> Thus 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by <hi>Philip</hi> in his Anſwer to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> when he requeſted Baptiſm of him, Act. 8.38. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayſt be baptiſed.</hi> And ſo 'tis expreſs'd again, in Rom. 10.10. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs.</hi> And in many other places to the ſame purpoſe. And therefore, if you truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſaved, you muſt and will give in the free and full Conſent of your Soul to take Chriſt for your Saviour, juſt as He is made known and offered to us in the Goſpel. And agreably, you muſt be heartily willing to Receive Him, (1.) In all His Offices. And (2.) Upon His own Terms: For ſo the Goſpel reveals and offers Him to us.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) YOU muſt be heartily willing to receive and embrace Him in <hi>all his OF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICES.</hi> I obſerved to you, under the firſt Head, when I Diſcourſed of that Knowledge which is neceſſary to Faith and Salvation; that Chriſt is Revealed and Offered to us in the Goſpel in a threefold Office, which He has taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Himſelf, by the ſpecial Appointment of GOD the Father, and executeth as our Redeemer. And theſe (I ſaid) are the Offices of a Prophet, Prieſt and King.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:003231_0132_0FF0262286CF7820"/>
And therefore you muſt heartily Conſent to take Chriſt in <hi>all,</hi> and in <hi>each</hi> of theſe Offices.</p>
            <p n="1">1. YOU muſt heartily Receive and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace HIM in His PROPHETICAL OF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICE. Jeſus Chriſt is the Great Prophet that was foretold and promiſed in the forecited, Deut. 18.5. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee &amp;c.</hi> This Promiſe GOD has long ſince fulfilled, as we find in <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. Where the Apoſtle cites this Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and applies it particularly to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And He is One every qualify'd <hi>to give the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Salvation to his People.</hi> He is perfectly acquainted with all the Secrets of GOD, and ſo knows His whole Will concerning our Salvation: For <hi>He came forth from the Father,</hi> as He teſtifies of Himſelf, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.28. Yea, <hi>He is the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father;</hi> and ſo has ſeen Him, and makes One with Him in all His Counſels concerning us. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. And being thus perfectly acquainted with the Mind of GOD, He is able to reveal to us, by His Word and Spirit, the whole will of GOD for our Salvation. And does by theſe Means enlighten every one of the Heirs of Salvation. Hence He is called, <hi>The
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:003231_0133_0FF0262410EB5068"/>
Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> in Mal. 4.2. And, <hi>The day-ſpring from on high, — to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace,</hi> Luk. 1.78, 79. And therefore, as you are by Nature full of Darkneſs and Ignorance, and need ſuch an Inſtructor as Chriſt, you muſt be heartily Willing to Receive and Submit to Him, as a Teacher ſent from GOD, to give you the Knowledge of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And you muſt give in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> of your Soul to take Him in His <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi> Office after this manner,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O LORD, I am a poor miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Nature. And that which renders my Caſe the more ſo, is, I am naturally full of Blindneſs and Ignorance. I was born into the World in a ſtate of Darkneſs; and ſo have by Nature no Power to behold any ſpiritual Object after a ſpiritual manner. Indeed, I have read in thy Holy Word, and been many times told by thy Miniſters, that I am in a ſinful, miſerable, undone ſtate by Nature: That there is no Hope nor Help for me in any but thy ſelf: And that thou art a moſt Glorious Saviour, and every way able and willing to ſave poor Sinners to the uttermoſt: But ſuch is the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful darkneſs and ignorance of my mind, that I can't, of my ſelf, ſee the evil of
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:003231_0134_0FF02625AD7851E0"/>
Sin, nor the miſerable Condition I am in, on the account of my Tranſgreſſions: nor can I ſee the Glory, Beauty and Fulneſs, I have been told there is in Thy ſelf: no, nor the need I ſtand in of an Intereſt in the Merits of thy Obedience unto Death, that ſo I may be ſaved: But on the other hand, I am exceeding apt from this Ignorance of mine, to entertain high thoughts of my ſelf, and but low thoughts of the Grace of the Goſpel. But after all, I am convinced, I need to have other and righter Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe things, than I have ever yet had: And I know not whether elſe to go, but unto Thee, O LORD, for that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Illumination and Inſtruction I want. For I have often heard that Thou art a great</hi> Teacher ſent from GOD, <hi>and ſent on purpoſe, to enlighten poor Sinners, that are willing to be taught by Thee, in the way to Salvation. I deſire therefore now to come to Thee, and to put my ſelf under the Teachings of thy Word and Spirit. I chuſe Thee for my</hi> Prophet, <hi>Oh! Reveal to me the whole will of GOD for the Salvation of my poor Soul. Open my blind Eyes, and turn me from Darkneſs to Light. Renew and ſanctify the Powers of my Soul, that I may be able to diſcern ſpiritual things after a ſpiritual manner. Give me a true ſight of my own ſinfulneſs
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:003231_0135_0FF026292AE6AE68"/>
and vileneſs: and help me to ſee,</hi> How wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked I am; <hi>and how unable to redeem and ſave my ſelf. LORD, I deſire to ſee and know the</hi> worſt <hi>of my ſelf. Oh! That all my Sin, and Guilt, and Miſery, may be laid open before me! Give me alſo to ſee the Vanity &amp; Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World, the falſe Glory of which has dazled my Eyes and captivated my Heart. But above all, Diſcover thine own Glory and Fulneſs to me. Give me to ſee what an Almighty and Compaſſionate Saviour Thou art: and help me to ſee the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute need I ſtand in of an Intereſt in thy ſelf. Give me ſuch a ſight hereof that I may go no whither elſe but to Thee alone, for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. LORD, open to me the</hi> New Covenant <hi>way to Salvation. Thou haſt plainly laid down the Doctrine of it in thy Holy Word: but I earneſtly deſire, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to thee, to give me an inward, Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al underſtanding of the Reaſonableneſs, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and Excellency of that way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And whereas, I am bound to Love, and Fear GOD, and keep all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, give me ſuch a ſenſible diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Infinite Being and Perfection of GOD, that I may Love and Fear Him above all. And give me ſuch a Spiritual underſtanding of the Mind and Will of
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:003231_0136_0FF0262AB3B53E60"/>
GOD contain'd in His holy Word, that I may truly account his</hi> Precepts concerning all things to be right, <hi>and to deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World ſo much, as to lead a Life of</hi> New-Obedience <hi>to His ſacred Commandments. And, LORD, I chuſe Thee for my</hi> Inſtructor; <hi>Oh! Give me a ſpiritual Underſtanding in all theſe Things, and in every thing elſe that Thou ſeeſt needful for me to know; and mine Ear ſhall be open to all thy ſacred Inſtructions. There are no Teachings like the Teachings of thy Word and Spirit; I am reſolved therefore, by thy Grace, always to hear what my God and Saviour has to ſay to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, if you do but thus heartily Conſent to take Chriſt for the Prophet of your Salvation: If you do but humbly and earneſtly apply to Him, after this manner, for ſpiritual Illumination and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and Reſolve thus, by the Grace of GOD, to Hear and Receive all that He has to ſay to you, by His Word and Providences, by His Spirit and Miniſters: then have you received Him aright in His Prophetical Office. And He'll teach you the whole Will of GOD, as far as 'tis needful for you to know it: and make you <hi>wiſe to Eternal Salvation.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="132" facs="unknown:003231_0137_0FF0262D1C42F470"/>2. YOU muſt heartily Receive and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace JESUS CHRIST in His PRIESTLY OFFICE. Jeſus Chriſt is the Great High-Prieſt of our Salvation. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. And as ſuch, <hi>He appeared once, in the end of the world, to put away ſin, by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.26. And when He had thus paid down the Price of our Redemption, by His Obedience unto Death, He aroſe again from the Dead for our Juſtification; and is aſcended into Heaven, where <hi>He ever lives to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7.25. Now this Office of Chriſt is of the greateſt account, both with GOD and the Believer. For herein is laid the very Foundation of our Eternal Redemption; and the other two Offices of Prophet and King, are built upon it: For <hi>hereby</hi> that Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for us, which Chriſt as a <hi>Prophet</hi> makes known to us, and as a <hi>King</hi> brings us to the Enjoyment of. And therefore it is of the greateſt Neceſſity to Salvation, that the Sinner heartily Conſent to take Chriſt in His <hi>Prieſtly Office.</hi> Without this there can be no Atonement for Sin, no Peace with GOD to be obtain'd; and conſequently, no Salvation to be hoped for. And therefore, as you deſire to be ſaved, you muſt chearfully Receive &amp; Embrace Chriſt, as the High-Prieſt of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:003231_0138_0FF026315CDA3330"/>
And you muſt give in the Conſent of your Soul to take Him in this Office, after this manner,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O LORD, I am a poor Guilty, Condemned Creature. I came into the World under the Guilt of the firſt Tranſgreſſion, and deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a corrupt Nature from my firſt Parents, whereby my Heart is naturally full of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt Thee, and thy holy Law. On theſe Accounts, I am</hi> by Nature a Child of Wrath; <hi>and lay open to the dreadful Wrath and Vengeance of GOD, from the firſt moment I had a Being. And as I was</hi> born <hi>in Sin, ſo I have</hi> lived <hi>all my Days in Sin and Rebellion againſt GOD: And been guilty of many Millions of Sins, of Heart, Lip and Life; of Omiſſion &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; of Knowledge and Ignorance; and</hi> theſe <hi>againſt both the firſt and ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of GOD's holy Law; and alſo againſt the very</hi> Goſpel <hi>of our Salvation. And theſe Sins do</hi> all <hi>and</hi> every one <hi>of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Damnation of Hell: and I am every moment expoſed to that Damnation in the moſt amazing Aggravations of it. And I tremble at the thoughts of that Wrath that is ready to fall upon me. O LORD, How ſhall I make my Eſcape? I am no ways able to Atone Divine Juſtice for my manifold Offences. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal ſhall I come before the LORD for
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:003231_0139_0FF02632E720C110"/>
this end?</hi> Lebanon it ſelf is not ſufficient to burn, nor the Beaſts thereof ſufficient for a burnt-offering. <hi>And therefore, if I could offer thouſands of Rams or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of rivers of Oyl, if the fruit of my Body for the ſin of my Soul, there would not be merit enough in all to procure the Pardon of the leaſt Sin. No, nor could a Sacrifice of the whole Creation yield a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Satisfaction for anyone of my manifold Tranſgreſſions. But, Oh Dear LORD JESUS, I have heard of thee, that Thou haſt loved poor Sinners, and given thy Self an Offering and a Sacrifice to GOD, of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour. Thou haſt laid down thy precious Life for our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a Life that is worth infinitely more than the Lives of all the Angels in Heaven and Men on Earth. And therefore, that Sacrifice had infinite Merit in it; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, Thou doſt ever live to plead the Virtue of it on the account of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Thee: and if ever I obtain Pardon and Salvation, it muſt be on the account of that Sacrifice alone. I fly to Thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O LORD, for an Intereſt in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sacrifice. I wholly renounce the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of my own Perſon and Services, and account my own Righteouſneſs as filthy rags, and heartily ſubmit to Thee as</hi> the Lord my Righteouſneſs. <hi>Oh! that my
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:003231_0140_0FF02637220BF140"/>
Sins may be waſh'd away in thy precious Blood! That the Merit of thy Sacrifice may be my Atonement! and thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone be the Covering and Ornament of my naked Soul! My great deſire is to obtain Pardon of Sin, Peace with GOD, Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Him here, and Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World to come, only on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what Thou haſt done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the ſake of ſuch miſerable Sinners as I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, if you thus Conſent to take Chriſt in His Prieſtly-Office, and can uprightly ſay with the Apoſtle, in Phil. 3.8, 9, 10. <hi>Yea, doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt; and be found in him not having my own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith. That I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his ſufferings, being made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto his death &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, if you do but thus Conſent to take Chriſt, you have truly received Him in His Prieſtly-Office: and you need not fear: you ſhall certainly obtain Pardon, Peace, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life through Him. And having thus
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:003231_0141_0FF02638ACB71CF0"/>
accepted Chriſt for the Prophet &amp; Prieſt of your Salvation; I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. YOU muſt heartily Receive and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace HIM in His KINGLY OFFICE. For, JESUS CHRIST is not only the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Prieſt; but He is alſo the KING of our Salvation. Hence He is call'd a King; and a King by GOD's own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, Pſal. 2.6. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion.</hi> And as ſuch, He has the Kingdoms of Grace and Providence put into His Hands: And in the Adminiſtrations of them, He gains Subjects over to Himſelf, and over-rules all things for the Glory of GOD, and the beſt Good of thoſe that put their Truſt under the ſhadow of His Wings. Now this is an Office you muſt <hi>own</hi> and <hi>ſubmit</hi> to, if you expect to be ſaved by Chriſt. This is expreſly required of you, in Pſal. 2.11, 12. <hi>Serve the Lord,</hi> i. e. the Lord Chriſt <hi>with fear, and rejoyce with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> And here, you muſt give in the free and full Conſent of your Soul to take Chriſt in His Kingly Office after this manner,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:003231_0142_0FF0263A5C098550"/>
               <hi>O LORD, Thou art King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: Thou haſt the right of Dominion over all. The Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Worſhip Thee, the Saints on Earth Praiſe and Adore Thee: and all thy reaſonable Creatures ought to ſerve and obey Thee. But alas! I am a poor ſinful and rebellious Creature. I was born an Enemy to thee, and have play'd the Rebel againſt thee all my Days. I naturally belong to the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and have been a vile Slave to Sin and Satan: and was never better pleaſed than while I was ſerving them, and diſhonouring thy Name. But now I plainly ſee I muſt ſhift ſides, and change my Maſters, or I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done to Eternity: For the Service of Sin and Satan, if perſevered in, will certainly end in Death and Deſtruction. But Oh, What ſhall I do! The Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have faſt hold on me: They have for a long time had the Dominion over me: and I am bound Hand and Foot with the Cords of Sin and Luſt, and have no power of my own, nor indeed, any Inclination by Nature, to ſhake them off. But, LORD,</hi> Thou art ſtronger than the ſtrong man armed: <hi>and art able to break the Yoke of Thoſe, I would now account my ſpiritual Adverſaries. Oh, Deſtroy the Power of Sin in me, and make me a Captive of thy
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:003231_0143_0FF0263CF7B1EB58"/>
Grace. And accordingly, I now renounce all other Lords, and chuſe Thee this Day for the King of my Salvation. Oh! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that Enmity there is in this vile Heart againſt Thee, and ſet up thy Throne and thy Kingdom in me. Thou haſt ſaid in thy holy Word,</hi> That thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 110.3.</note>. <hi>Oh! That ſuch a Day of Almighty Power may now paſs over me! I Pray and long for it. Oh, when ſhall it once be! LORD, make me one of thy willing and obedient Subjects. Give me the Heart of a true Diſciple, the Heart of a ſincere Follower of thine; and make thy Yoke eaſy, and thy Burden light to me: ſo ſhall I delight to do thy Will at all times. And LORD, take me under thy ſpecial Care and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I deſire to put my Truſt under the ſhadow of thy Wings. Oh! Deliver me from the power and rage, and malice of my ſpiritual Enemies. Strengthen me againſt all my Temptations; Support me under all my Weakneſs; Comfort me under all my Sorrows. Aſſiſt me in a Courſe of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thy holy Commandments; and lead me under thy Banner in the way to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. O LORD, make bare thine Arm, and do all this, and much more, for
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:003231_0144_0FF026411C7727B8"/>
me: for all my Deſire is before thee, and all my Expectation from thee. And in Token hereof, I do this Day and at this Time, take my Oath of Allegiance to Thee, and Promiſe, by thy Grace, to be true and faithful to Thee all my Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, if you can but thus acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge CHRIST, and give in the free and full Conſent of your Soul to Him, after this manner, in His Kingly Office, you then cloſe in with Him aright by Faith: and ſhall certainly be ſaved for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of that Great <hi>Captain of our Salvation.</hi> For <hi>He is the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey Him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. And thus I have ſhown, how you are to cloſe in with Chriſt in all His Offices, if you would Believe in Him ſo as to be ſaved by Him.</p>
            <p>AND now the next thing I am to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve is, That this Reception of Chriſt in all His Offices muſt be alſo upon His own Terms. But <hi>this,</hi> with ſomething more of the like importance, muſt be reſerved for a concluding Diſcourſe upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

            <head>SERMON VI.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt Diſcourſe I propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three general Directions for the obtaining that <hi>Faith</hi> in CHRIST, which will entitle a Sinner to Eternal Life. And they were, I. You muſt See and Know what a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt is. II. You muſt Conſent to Receive and Embrace Him in all His Offices, and upon His own Terms. And III. You muſt Rely upon Him alone for Salvation. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Directions has been fully ſpoken to: and I have in <hi>part,</hi> conſidered the <hi>ſecond</hi> of them; which I divided into theſe two Branches. And ſaid, (1.) You muſt Receive Chriſt in all His <hi>Offices.</hi> And (2.) Upon His own <hi>Terms.</hi> And I have told you already, how you are to Receive Him in the firſt Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. And therefore, the <hi>next</hi> thing I am to obſerve is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="141" facs="unknown:003231_0146_0FF02645E8ACB458"/>2. You muſt be heartily willing to <hi>Receive</hi> and <hi>Embrace</hi> CHRIST, <hi>upon His own</hi> TERMS. There are indeed, many Sinners who would willingly accept of Chriſt and His Salvation, if they could but have them on their <hi>own</hi> Terms: But this can never be: becauſe Chriſt has ſtated and fix'd His Terms in the Goſpel, and will not be the Saviour of any Sinner, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he approves of, and Conſents to them. And agreably, it is in the Nature of Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith to cloſe in with Chriſt upon the Terms of His own propoſing. For Faith ſees theſe Terms to be abſolutely beſt in themſelves. And therefore if you would cloſe in with Chriſt by Faith for Salvation, you muſt freely Conſent to take Him for your Saviour upon His own Terms. And they are ſuch as theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. YOU muſt Conſent to take Him for your ONLY SAVIOUR. We read in Act. 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other: for there is no other name under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven given among men whereby we can be ſaved.</hi> That is, There is no One elſe that has undertaken the Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us; nor any one elſe that GOD will accept in this Affair. And therefore, Chriſt propoſes Himſelf to us as the only Saviour of miſerable Sinners. Iſai.
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:003231_0147_0FF0264932D96138"/>
45.21, 22.— <hi>There is no God elſe beſides me, a juſt God and a Saviour — Look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the Earth: for I am God and there is none elſe.</hi> And accordingly, if you would be ſaved by Chriſt, you muſt not ſhare the Honour of your Salvation between Chriſt and another. No, not between Chriſt and your ſelf; as the proud Sinner is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding apt to do. But you muſt ſay as the Pſalmiſt did, in Pſal. 62.5, 6. <hi>My ſoul, wait thou</hi> only <hi>upon God: for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is from him. He is my rock and my ſalvation; He is my defence: I ſhall not be moved.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. YOU muſt be <hi>content to part</hi> with every thing in the World, that is dear to you, and <hi>patiently ſubmit</hi> to any Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Sufferings, when the HONOUR and INTEREST of CHRIST call for them. This is what the Goſpel calls <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>taking up the Croſs,</hi> and our Saviour has made them a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mark of his true Diſciples, and ſo a neceſſary Condition of Eternal Life, in Mar. 8.34. — <hi>Whoſoever will come after me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, i. e. Whoſoever would become one of my real Diſciples, and expects to be ſaved by me, <hi>Let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:003231_0148_0FF0264B99E79F50"/>
me.</hi> (1.) He muſt <hi>deny himſelf.</hi> "By which (as a noted Expoſiter <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Burket</hi> in loc.</note> obſerves upon the place) we are not to underſtand the denying and renouncing our Senſes in matters of Faith, not yet the renouncing our Reaſon in matters of Religion; but by <hi>Self-denyal</hi> is meant, that we ſhould be willing to part with all our Earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and quit all our Temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the ſake of Chriſt and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion." i. e. when the Honour of Chriſt and the credit of Chriſtianity plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls us to do ſo. And then, (2.) He muſt <hi>take up his Croſs.</hi> Which Expreſſion (as the forecited Expoſitor obſerves) is, "an Alluſion to a <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtom that the Malefactor, who was to be Crucified, took his Croſs upon his ſhoulder, and carried it to the place of Execution." And we find this exemplify'd in our Saviour Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when He was unjuſtly Condemned to dye on the Croſs. (See <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.17.) And therefore, the ſenſe of the <hi>Phraſe</hi> is evidently this, viz. That the Diſciple of Chriſt, tho' he may not, by an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Zeal,</hi> run himſelf into any needleſs Trouble, and ſo make a Croſs for himſelf; yet, he muſt be diſpoſed and firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, patiently to bear any Affliction,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:003231_0149_0FF0264D24376C60"/>
which GOD in his Providence ſhall ſee meet to lay upon him: and in particular, if GOD ſees it moſt for His own Glory, he muſt chearfully ſubmit to the loſs of all that is dear to him in the World; to the loſs of his Earthly Eſtate, Friends, and Reputation among Men: and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to endure any kind of Sufferings in the Body, even to the laying down of his Life, for Righteouſneſs ſake. And we have many very noble and <hi>Heroic</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>bearing the Croſs,</hi> Recorded in the Sacred Scriptures; and particularly, of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>who took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, and ſuffered the loſs of all things,</hi> for the ſake of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. But of all the examples of this kind, thoſe of the Bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were the moſt noted, and ſo the moſt worthy our Imitation; as we find by the account which one of them has given of the matter, in 1 Cor. 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>Even unto this preſent hour, we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, and labour working with our own hands: being reviled, we bleſs: being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, we ſuffer it: being defamed, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi> And their Sufferings in theſe
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:003231_0150_0FF0264EAFFFD780"/>
reſpects, were ſo many and great, that the Apoſtle draws this Concluſion from them in the 9<hi>th</hi> v. of this Chapter. <hi>For I think that GOD hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were appointed to death. For we are made a ſpectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</hi> And tho' it does not fall to the ſhare of every true Chriſtian to endure ſuch a Variety, and ſuch Extremity of Sufferings, for the ſake of Chriſt; yet, every one muſt endeavour to bring his Spirit to ſubmit to them, if GOD ſhould call him thereunto. For Chriſt has made it neceſſary that we ſhould do ſo: and has plainly told us, that unleſs we have ſomething of this holy <hi>Temper</hi> in us, we cannot be His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Luk. 14.26, 27. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and ſiſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple. And whoſoever doth not bear his croſs, and come after me, cannot be my diſciple.</hi> Which <hi>Hatred</hi> is not to be underſtood in an <hi>abſolute</hi> but <hi>comparative</hi> ſenſe. And accordingly, our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains this ſevere paſſage after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Math. 10.37, 38. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me: and he that loveth ſon or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more than me, is not worthy of me. And
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:003231_0151_0FF02653F3383690"/>
he that taketh not his croſs, and followeth After me, is not worthy of me.</hi> So that the meaning of both together is this, <hi>viz.</hi> We muſt love Chriſt and His Intereſt ſo much more than we do the deareſt of our Enjoyments in the World, that we muſt be willing to part with them all, if He ſhould call us to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ANOTHER <hi>Term</hi> upon which you muſt Receive Chriſt is this, namely, You muſt chearfully <hi>ſubmit</hi> your ſelf to the <hi>Yoke of</hi> GOSPEL OBEDIENCE, and <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the</hi> EXAMPLE of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. This is a Term of Chriſt's own propoſing; as you may ſee, in Math. 11.29. <hi>Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me.</hi> By the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt here, we are to underſtand Goſpel Obedience to His holy Commandments: and to <hi>learn of Him,</hi> is to learn by his <hi>Example,</hi> to tread in his Steps, and be Imitators of him as dear Children. And this he propounds as a neceſſary Condition of Eternal Life, Math. 12.17. — <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments.</hi> And again, Heb. 5.9. <hi>He is the author of eternal ſalvation unto all them that obey him.</hi> And, indeed, to none elſe: for we read in the Twelfth Chapter of this Epiſtle, ver. 14. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> So that, you
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:003231_0152_0FF026557AE0DC58"/>
ſee, this Goſpel Obedience is neceſſary to Salvation: Not as the <hi>meritorious</hi> Cauſe of it; for ſo Chriſt alone has <hi>purchaſed</hi> Eternal Redemption for us: but as it is the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> of our Faith in Him. For, as I obſerved before, in Receiving Chriſt by Faith, you accept of Him in His <hi>Kingly Office;</hi> and therein take the Oath of Allegiance to Him, and <hi>ſware to keep all his righteous Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.106. And if you are ſincere in what you do, that Faith, whereby you ſo receive Chriſt, will produce this holy Obedience in your Life and Converſation. And that you may not be at a loſs to know what is meant by this Obedience, I ſhall ſay in a Word,</p>
            <p>BY this Obedience, we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>a ſinleſs and perfect Obedience to the whole Law of GOD: but a ſincere Purpoſe and Endeavour, by the help of the Spirit, to reach as near to that perfect Obedience as 'tis poſſible for one in this ſtate of Imperfection to do.</hi> So that in yielding this Obedience, the Heart is firſt fully <hi>Reſolved</hi> upon the Duty; and this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution becomes a fix'd &amp; governing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Mind. And agreably, <hi>in the next place,</hi> this Reſolution is brought forth into <hi>Act,</hi> and is expreſs'd in the Chriſtians uniform, ſteady and diligent
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:003231_0153_0FF02658C2589218"/>
Endeavours to walk in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the LORD blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to his Heavenly Kingdom: And <hi>in all,</hi> he has dependance upon the SPIRIT of CHRIST, for the <hi>Pardon</hi> of his many defects in Duty, and for the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of his Perſon and Services with the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER. And that you may not be at a loſs to know what RULE to go by, in yeilding this Chriſtian Obedience, you muſt be ſure to make the Goſpel of Chriſt the only Rule and Meaſure of it; and ſee that in all things <hi>your Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel.</hi> And in particular, ſince Chriſt has left us a moſt perfect <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of holy Obedience to GOD, and Commanded His Diſciples to be <hi>Followers of Him,</hi> (Math. 16.24.) you muſt be ſure to have His ſpotleſs Example as much as poſſible in your Eye, and ſtrive to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> Him in all his <hi>imitable</hi> Perfections. And more eſpecially, in His Meekneſs and Humility; in his Patience under Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; in his Love and Compaſſion to Mankind, which expreſs'd it ſelf in his readineſs to do Good to them upon all Occaſions: In his Zeal againſt Sin, and for the Glory of GOD; in his fervent Devotion to the FATHER; in his entire Submiſſion to His Will under all his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Temptations; in his unſhaken
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:003231_0154_0FF0265B28961748"/>
Faith and Dependance upon Him; and finally, in his unwearied Diligence to work the Works of Him that ſent him while the Day of Life laſted.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have finiſhed the Second general Direction, I propoſed to ſpeak to, for the obtaining true and ſaving Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; viz. <hi>You muſt heartily Conſent to, Receive and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt in all his Offices, and upon his own Terms.</hi> And here I have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſhown you, How you are to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and Walk in Him, in both theſe Reſpects. And now there remains but one Important Direction more of this kind: And this is,</p>
            <p n="3">III. IF you would believe in Chriſt to the Saving of the Soul, you muſt put your <hi>whole</hi> TRUST <hi>in, and</hi> RELY <hi>upon</hi> HIM ALONE, for Salvation. I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed, this Act of <hi>Reliance</hi> is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt unworthily by many in the World: And by thoſe in particular, of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles, who make a Banter of it, both in the Pulpit, and from the Preſs; as they do of the whole Doctrine of a Sinner's Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation <hi>by Faith in Chriſt without the Deeds of the Law:</hi> though
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:003231_0155_0FF0265D912E3568"/>
therein, I think, they expreſly contradict the inſpired Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. And therefore, whatever any Men may ſay to the contrary, This Reliance upon Chriſt is a moſt noble and neceſſary Act of true and ſaving Faith. It is a moſt <hi>noble Act</hi> of Faith, and greatly glorifies the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. "For in thus doing (as One ſays well) we practically declare, in deſpite of all Diſcouragements, that we are firmly perſwaded of Chriſt's Love and Grace, Faithfulneſs and Power, — of the merits of His Blood, the value of His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and the truth of His Promiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſet our Seal to the Record given of Him in the Word, that <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come to God thro' Him;</hi> and <hi>will not caſt out any,</hi> that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly apply themſelves to Him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vation". And as it is a moſt noble, ſo it is a moſt <hi>neceſſary Act</hi> of true and ſaving Faith. That is, Let Men think and ſay what they pleaſe of it, there is no obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eternal Life, but by having our whole Dependance upon Chriſt for it, as we are directed to have in the Goſpel. And therefore this Act of Faith is frequently ſpoken of, and great ſtreſs laid upon it, in the Holy Scriptures. And I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give you ſome underſtanding of the Nature of it, by conſidering a few
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:003231_0156_0FF0265FF50EEE78"/>
of the Expreſſions whereby 'tis made known to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Particularly,</p>
            <p>'TIS expreſſed by <hi>Truſting</hi> in CHRIST for Salvation. Pſal. 2.12. — <hi>Bleſſed are all they that Truſt in him.</hi> And ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. and in many other places. Now this ſuppoſes, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinner, who has received Chriſt in all His Offices, ſees enough in Him to anſwer all his Wants and Neceſſities: that is, He ſees all that Pardon, Peace, Grace and Salvation in Chriſt, which, when once obtained, will make the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sinner in the World, happy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and ſo depends upon Him alone, as an All-ſufficient Saviour, for all that he ſtands in need of. Again,</p>
            <p>'TIS expreſs'd in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. by <hi>fleeing for refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</hi> And this ſuppoſes, That the poor Sinner has, <hi>firſt,</hi> a deep ſenſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent hazard he is in of being ſeiz'd by the Juſtice of GOD, and Condemned to Eternal Death, which his Soul trembles at the proſpect of: and <hi>then,</hi> that he has had a diſcovery of Chriſt as the only Saviour from the Wrath to come; and ſo haſtens away to Him, as the Man-ſlayer of old fled to the City of Refuge, to ſave his Life, from the Avenger of Blood that
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:003231_0157_0FF02661ABBB4830"/>
purſued him. And ſo lays hold on Chriſt and Truſts in Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his only Hope and Refuge. Once more,</p>
            <p>'TIS expreſs'd by <hi>committing our Souls</hi> into the Hands of CHRIST. 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi> And agreably, Every poor Sinner has a precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul to take care of, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, againſt the Time when it enters into the Eternal World: and it needs to be put into ſafer Hands than his own. And therefore, the Believer, having ſeen what a merciful and faithful Redeemer Chriſt is, he commits his Soul by Faith, and all the Concerns of it, that reſpect Eternity, into His Almighty Hands, and hopes that by His infinite Power and Grace He will preſerve it, and bring it forth richly adorn'd with the Robes of Glory at the Great Day. And then,</p>
            <p>Finally, THIS Act of Faith is expreſs'd by <hi>Leaning</hi> upon Chriſt. Cant. 6.5. <hi>Who is this coming out of the wilderneſs, leaning upon her beloved.</hi> Theſe words have doubtleſs a reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt, and true Believers on Him. Chriſt is the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved One</hi> here ſpoken of, and true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are they that come out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs <hi>leaning upon him.</hi> And here we
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:003231_0158_0FF0266336389D80"/>
have (1.) The natural Condition of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſcribed to us: 'Tis a <hi>wilderneſs</hi> ſtate. i. e. a loſt, indigent and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſtate. And (2.) The Believers Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon Chriſt to bring him out of this ſad Condition: expreſs'd by <hi>leaning</hi> upon Him. And accordingly, every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that is ſenſible of his loſt eſtate by Nature, has alſo ſeen that there is no one can direct and lead him out of it but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And being ready to faint and die under the Apprehenſions of his ſad Condition, He lays hold on Chriſt by Faith, as one that is faint lays hold on the firſt Support he can meet with: and here he depends, both for Wiſdom to direct, and for Strength to help him along thro' the Darkneſs and Difficulties that lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. And this proves a Cordial to his fainting Soul.</p>
            <p>AND now from theſe, and ſuch like Expreſſions, whereby the Act of Reliance upon Chriſt is deſcribed to us, we may eaſily gather, that the Nature of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Soul's <hi>Adventuring it ſelf by Faith upon Chriſt alone, for all that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it needs.</hi> And ſo, on the one Hand, it ſhuts out all <hi>Confidence in others,</hi> either in <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part.</hi> And ſays to Chriſt at they did, Iſai. 26.23. <hi>O Lord
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:003231_0159_0FF0266678F04758"/>
our God, other Lords beſides thee, have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</hi> And as they, in Pſal. 20.7. <hi>Some truſts in chariots, and ſome in horſes: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</hi> And on the other hand, it ſhuts out that black and raging <hi>Deſpair,</hi> which ſome Reprobates have gone out of the World under the Anguiſh of; as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did.</p>
            <p>INDEED this Act of Reliance is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo <hi>Strong</hi> and full of <hi>Comfort</hi> as the Saint could wiſh for; and as ſome Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have had experience of. For in ſome it has grown up to <hi>full Aſſurance;</hi> as it did in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as we find, in the forecited 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>whom I have believed, and am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> or aſſured, <hi>that he is able,</hi> and willing too, <hi>to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi> And the like we read concerning many more of the Saints in Scripture. But in many others this Act of Faith runs at a very low ebb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It does ſo in moſt on their firſt Believing in Chriſt; "and ſometimes a great while after, in an Hour of ſpiritual Darkneſs and Diſtreſs". But then, when the true Believer is reduced to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Straits in his own Mind, and queſtions
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:003231_0160_0FF0266806DC5900"/>
whether he has the leaſt degree of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith in him, he is wont to expreſs his Humble Reliance upon CHRIST by Faith after this manner,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O LORD, I am in a moſt miſerable loſt Condition by Nature. My Sins are many and greatly Aggravated. I deſerve thy dreadful Wrath and Vengeance on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them: and I am afraid I ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh forever under the intollerable weight of my Sin and Guilt. But I find, in thy Holy Word, with Thee there is Mercy, and with Thee there is plenteous Redemption, that thou mayſt be feared. And thou haſt ſhown forth the Riches of thy Grace, in providing an Almighty Saviour for periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners; yea, even for the chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſuch as I have juſt reaſon to account my ſelf. But whether I have yet an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Him, or am ever like to obtain one, I am ſadly at a loſs. I meet with all manner of diſcouragements in the way, both from within and from without. Within I have a wicked and deceitful Heart, that oppoſes all that is good, and I am ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Spiritual Enemies, who are much too hard for me in my own ſtrength; and I fear I ſhall one day fall and periſh by the hands of them. But, LORD, Thou canſt help me if thou pleaſeſt; and I ſee eno' in thy CHRIST for my Relief and Salvation.
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:003231_0161_0FF0266A69062E98"/>
Oh, that I cou'd once obtain a ſaving Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Him! Well, I will make what haſte I can towards him, tho' I fear I ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the way: I am reſolved, for this once, to try what Almighty, Sovereign Grace</hi> can <hi>and</hi> will <hi>do. And what tho' I am the vileſt Sinner that ever was, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the very Hotteſt Place in Hell; yet, will not thy Mercy be ſo much the more magnify'd in my Salvation? Yea, LORD, it will: and Heaven will ring for ever with the Praiſes of it. I will therefore venture into thy Preſence: I have no whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elſe to go; and I will humbly caſt my ſelf down at the Feet of thy Merry, and wait upon thee for thy Mercy in Him. If I don't do this, I know I muſt Periſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: for I am ſure there is no other Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our but CHRIST; nor any other way to Salvation but by Him. And if I do this; who knows but there may be Mercy in ſtore for me. But if not, I can but Periſh after all. And if I do Periſh, it ſhall be at the Foot of Mercy. Yea,</hi> I will truſt in the LORD tho' he ſlay me.</p>
            <p>THIS is the Language of a poor Soul relying upon Chriſt by Faith, when 'tis fill'd with the greateſt Darkneſs and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs about its everlaſting State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And by this means the Believer is kept, at ſuch times, from falling into
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:003231_0162_0FF0266C027FC928"/>
utter Deſpair. And now, tho' this be a very uncomfortable ſtate, for any one to be in; yet, every one that thus <hi>relies</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt in his Diſtreſs, is in a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For theſe are the Breathings of true Faith. And if he does but "conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thus looking towards Chriſt, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, and reſigning to him, he ſhall be dealt with as a true Believer." And tho' he may ſeem to himſelf to have no Faith, and others may think he has but little of it; yet, ſince his Faith bears ſome proportion to his Diſcouragements, which are evidently great, his Faith alſo muſt be great, when it can thus prevail over them.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have ſhewn you how or after what manner a poor Convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt cloſe in with Chriſt, and rely upon him by Faith, that ſo he may be ſaved by him. And now that you may obtain this Faith from GOD; (For as I told you before, Faith is <hi>a Grace of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the gift of GOD</hi> to thoſe that have it) and be able to exerciſe it to the ſaving of the Soul, you muſt wait upon GOD for the Beſtowment of it, in the uſe of Appointed Means. That is, you muſt give your <hi>Careful</hi> and <hi>Diligent Attendance to the Word,</hi> for this End. You muſt improve all the Opportunities you
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:003231_0163_0FF026705DF046B0"/>
well can to read the Word in Private, and to hear the Word Publickly diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to you. For ſays the Apoſtle in Rom. 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the word of God.</hi> And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you muſt <hi>Pray humbly</hi> and <hi>earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to GOD to beſtow this Grace upon you. For ſince 'tis the <hi>Gift</hi> of GOD, He juſtly expects to be ſought unto for it: And ſince 'tis ſo eminent and uſeful a Grace, as we are all of us ready to own, we can never be too importunate in our Supplications to GOD for it.</p>
            <p>AND if by theſe Means you can but obtain Faith, as no doubt you may; and can but exerciſe it in Receiving and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon Chriſt, as you have heard; you will certainly obtain Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this way. For this Faith in the very <hi>Condition of the New Covenant</hi> on Man's part, and gives the Sinner an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, and a Title to that Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which He has purchaſed and wrought out for poor Sinners. And therefore, by the Grace of GOD, we are ſaid <hi>to be ſaved by Faith,</hi> Eph. 2.8. And then beſides, this Faith has, many times over, the <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of Eternal Salvation made unto it. But this one place may ſerve inſtead of all at this
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:003231_0164_0FF02673D3F09D40"/>
time, Joh. 6.40. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life; and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> And therefore, if you have but true Faith, tho' it be but <hi>ſmall,</hi> like the <hi>grain of muſtard ſeed,</hi> and but <hi>weak,</hi> like <hi>the bruiſed reed;</hi> yet never Fear: You are paſſed from Death to Life, and ſhall never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Condemnation; but be ſaved in the Day of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>AND thus, I have gone thro' the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral general Heads I propoſed to ſpeak to, in Anſwer to that moſt important Enquiry in the Text, viz. <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> And have given ſuch particular Directions under each of them, which if any Sinner in the World, can but find an Heart fully to comply with, Let his paſt Sins and Hazards be what they will, he ſhall certainly be ſaved with an Everlaſting Salvation.</p>
            <p>AND now I ſhall Conclude this Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Subject, with a few brief <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Infer.</hi> MUST we do ſo many things, as I have ſaid, to obtain Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:003231_0165_0FF02676564CB1C8"/>
Then 'tis not ſo <hi>eaſy</hi> a thing to be ſaved, as Multitudes in the World are ready to imagine. Indeed, 'tis ſad to think what <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>deluſive</hi> thoughts carnally ſecure Sinners do forever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on this Head. But ſo it is; They don't ſee the worth of Eternal Salvation in it ſelf, nor ſee the abſolute need they ſtand in of it: but prefer the Service of Sin, and the forbid Pleaſures of it, to the Service of GOD <hi>here,</hi> and the Enjoyment of Him <hi>forever.</hi> And when, at any time they are put in mind of Death and Eternity, and are call'd upon to prepare for the Happineſs of the World to come, They think 'tis the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt thing they have to do, to provide for it. They think that a few broken Prayers, and a little lifeleſs Devotion, in <hi>Old-Age,</hi> or upon a <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> when they can no longer enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, will effectually anſwer the end: And ſo wholly lay aſide all their Care and Concern for the preſent. But, O vain and preſumptuous Sinner, whoſe Caſe this is, Eternal Salvation is quite another Thing than you have ever yet taken it to be. For, it is of infinite worth in it ſelf, as you have oft-times heard. And then beſides, 'Tis the <hi>One
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:003231_0166_0FF0267A551310B8"/>
Thing needful</hi> for us; and that without which you are like to be undone to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And as it is ſo excellent in itſelf, and ſo needful for us, 'tis richly worth all the Labour and Pains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you can take in ſecuring an Intereſt in it. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, it is not to be obtained at ſo Cheap a rate as you vainly dream it is. But GOD expects and requires of every one that would be ſaved, that he make a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>working out his Salvation;</hi> and the main Buſineſs too of his whole Life. Read and conſider the following Places, Math. 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof.</hi> Luk. 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: for many I ſay unto you will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> Phil. 2.12. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Rom. 12.11. <hi>Be not ſlothful in buſineſs; but fervent in ſpirit; ſerving the Lord.</hi> And in 2 Pet 1.5. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, giving all diligence, add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge &amp;c.</hi> And in ver. 10. <hi>Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence to make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure.</hi> And ſo in many more places: whereby you may plainly ſee that GOD calls for the Improvement of all your Time and Strength and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in this Important Affair. And
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:003231_0167_0FF0267EA0996DB0"/>
therefore, all ſuch Sinners as entertain theſe light thoughts of Salvation, and think 'tis ſo eaſy a matter to be ſaved, are certainly great ſtrangers to this Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They have no Right or Title at all to it; and are every moment in hazard of falling into the Pit of endleſs Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſo long as you continue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely in the ſtate you are in, deſpiſing and neglecting Chriſt and his Salvation, thoſe awful words may be apply'd to you. Math. 23.33. <hi>Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Infer.</hi> MAY Salvation be obtain'd upon ſuch Terms as we have heard? <hi>How glorious and wonderful does the Grace of GOD appear herein?</hi> Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contains ſo many great and excellent Things in it, as you heard in a former Diſcouſe, that there appears to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite worth and value in it. And by Conſequence, there can be no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Gift of this Salvation, and what GOD requires we ſhould do for the obtainment of it; and ſo there is a moſt glorious Diſplay of Divine Grace, in the offer and Grant of Salvation upon theſe Terms. Indeed, if we conſider all that has been done for the purchaſe of
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:003231_0168_0FF0268028A1EAA0"/>
this Salvation, there has been a ſufficient Price paid down for it. For Jeſus Chriſt who has undertaken for our Redemption, has ſhed His moſt precious Blood, and laid down His moſt precious Life, for this End: And this is a Price of infinite value; and ſo worth all the Happineſs the Believer can poſſibly come to the Enjoyment of: For Chriſt was an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perſon. And, indeed, the Juſtice of GOD Required ſuch a Satisfaction of our Surety, before He could, with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Himſelf, releaſe any one Sinner from the Chains of Guilt, and advance Him to the Dignity and Priviledges of His Children. But then, as the Matter concerns us immediately, There is no manner of Proportion, between the weight and worth of Eternal Salvation, and all that GOD Requires and Expects from us, for the obtaining of it. For what are the beſt Services we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in this ſinful State, but mean and imperfect in themſelves? And then beſides, the Things which GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us for this End; ſuch as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our Sins and Luſts, which have brought all our Ruine and Miſery upon us; — Our turning our feet into the Paths of His Commandments, which carries its own Reward with it; and our
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:003231_0169_0FF026828FBFA590"/>
cloſing in with Chriſt by Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are brought into a Life of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Him: Theſe Things, I ſay, in themſelves, tend as much to our own Happineſs, as they do to the Honour and Glory of GOD. And yet, Theſe are all that GOD requires of us that ſo we may come to enjoy Eternal Life in Jeſus Chriſt. Here then is a moſt marvellous Diſcovery of infinite Grace. And well might the Apoſtle ſay, as in Eph. 2.8. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved.</hi> And this Grace will be the Subject of the Saints Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Praiſe to Eternity.</p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Infer.</hi> HERE is Ground of great Encouragement to every Convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is ready to Deſpair of Salvation. For if Salvation is to be had upon ſuch Terms as you have heard, then you may have it upon thoſe Terms as well as any elſe. And to make you ſenſible of it, I ſhall offer two Things briefly to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'TIS a very <hi>Remarkable</hi> Day of Salvation with you, and the Offer of Salvation is <hi>immediately</hi> made you. This your preſent Hears and Jealouſies make
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:003231_0170_0FEFD96C9E357988"/>
you to call in queſtion: And you are ready to think your Day of Grace is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that the Door of Mercy is ſhut againſt you for ever. But, poor Soul, why ſuch hard thoughts of GOD and His Grace! I am ſure thou art infinitely miſtaken in them: For GOD has ſaid the direct contrary in His Holy Word. He has told us all plainly, in 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>Behold, now is the accepted Time; now is the day of Salvation.</hi> And therefore, there is not one Sinner in this Aſſembly; no, nor one Sinner in the whole World, that has any Knowledge of Chriſt, and breathes after an Intereſt in Him, as you now do, but GOD is now waiting upon him in a way of Grace; and ſtands with the Arms of His Mercy open, ready to embrace Him, as ſoon as ever He gives in the Conſent of his Soul to take Chriſt in all His Offices, and upon the Terms of the Goſpel. And then beſides, The Offer of Chriſt and Salvation by Him, is more immediately directed to you than to any other Sinners in the whole World, that have not yet actually embraced Him. For are you not weary and heavy laden with a ſenſe of your Sins? Then that gracious Invitation and Promiſe, is directed to you, as tho' by Name, Mat. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:003231_0171_0FF0268768E033F0"/>
and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Again, Don't you thirſt and long for an Intereſt in Chriſt, and the Grace of the New-Covenant. If ſo, that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Invitation is directed to you in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Joh. 7.37. — <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi> And that in Rev. 22.17. <hi>And the ſpirit and bride ſay, come. And let him that heareth ſay, come. And let him that is a-thirſt come: And whoſoever will, let him take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely.</hi> So that you never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had ſuch a remarkable Seaſon of Grace as the preſent Day is.</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD <hi>offers</hi> His HOLY SPIRIT to you, to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> you in all that He Requires of you to Salvation. This your preſent Diſtreſs makes you to doubt: and you are ready to think you have ſo long reſiſted and grieved the Bleſſed Spirit that He has taken His farewell of you. But there is nothing more evident to all that have a right Underſtanding of your Caſe, than that the Holy Spirit is now powerfully at Work upon your Heart; and by the Fears and Terrors you are in, He is every Day more and more humbling and emptying you out
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:003231_0172_0FF02688F122EB20"/>
of your ſelf. And if you do but cheriſh theſe ſtrivings of the Spirit; and are thankful to GOD for them; and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry for the more plentiful Effuſions of it, GOD ſtands ready to hear and anſwer your Requeſt. See Luk. 11.13. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?</hi> So that upon the whole, every Convinced and Awakened Sinner, whoſe Sins are a Burden and Grief to Him, has all the Reaſon he can deſire, to lay aſide all Deſpairing tho'ts of the Mercy of GOD, and to follow the Directions that have been ſet before him; and in this way to Hope for Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>And now,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Infer.</hi> WHAT we have heard ſhould Awaken all Careleſs and Secure Sinners, and ſtir them up to Inquire and Seek in earneſt after Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You have heard what this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion implies in it, and how neceſſary 'tis for you. And can any thing more be ſaid to awaken and rouſe, and fill you with Concern about it? You have alſo heard what Courſe you muſt take
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:003231_0173_0FF0268A81AC92D8"/>
if you intend ever to obtain it. And can't you be prevail'd upon yet to fall in with theſe gracious Directions? which are all plainly laid before you in the Word of GOD. Well then, I have but two Things more to offer to your Conſideration; and ſo muſt leave you to the Mercy or Judgment of GOD.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHILE you continue in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent careleſs and wilful neglect of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, you every Day run further from it, and ripen more and more for the Damnation of Hell. For while you keep out of the narrow Way which leads to Life, you are in the Broad Way that leads to Deſtruction: and Satan and your own Luſts hurry you down Hill towards the Pit of endleſs and irremedileſs Miſery. And therefore, thoſe awful Words are ſpoken to you, and ſuch as you are, Rom. 2.4, 5. <hi>Thou deſpiſeſt the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance. But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Conſider, YOUR Day of Grace <hi>paſſes ſwiftly away,</hi> and will quickly come to <hi>an end</hi> with you. Your Days are like a ſhadow that quickly paſſeth away; and you can have but a little while, at the longeſt, to live in the World; and you may Die before the Light of another Morning advances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And whenever you Die, whether ſooner or later, this will put an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Period to your Day of Grace. And if your Salvation is not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, you will be undone to Eternity, and the Damnation of Hell muſt be your Everlaſting Portion. Oh, Then, <hi>awake thou that ſleepeſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Dead,</hi> ariſe quickly, <hi>that Chriſt may give thee life.</hi> And hearken to that compaſſionate Call that is now renewed unto you, Ezek. 18.31, 32. <hi>Caſt away from you all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, wherewith ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit; for why will ye die,</hi> O miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinner? <hi>For I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the LORD GOD: wherefore turn your ſelves, and live ye.</hi> And to all that are

willing to do ſo, I will leave that word of Encouragement, with which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe Diſcourſes, Iſai. 55.6, 7. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts; and let him turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> AMEN.</p>
