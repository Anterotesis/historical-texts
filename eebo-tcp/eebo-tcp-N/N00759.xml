            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Were not theſe Children ſweet Children, which feared God &amp; were dutiful to their Parents? Did not their Fathers &amp; Mothers, &amp; every body that fears God, love them &amp; praiſe them? What do you think is become of them, now they are dead and gone?

                     <p n="2">2. She was wont to be much in ſecret Duty, and many times come off from her knees with Tears.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. She was greatly afraid of Hypocriſie, and of doing any thing to be ſeen of men, and to get commendation and praiſe; and when ſhe had heard one of her Brothers ſaying, <hi>That he had been by himſelf at prayer,</hi> ſhe rebuked him ſharply, and told him how little ſuch prayers were like to profit him, and that was little to his praiſe, to pray like a Hypocrite, and to be glad that any ſhould know what he had been doing.</p>

                     <p n="14">14. She took great Delight in reading of the Scripture, and ſome part of it was more ſweet to her than her appointed food; ſhe would get ſeveral choice Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

She anſwered, <hi>The Lord hath told me, that I am one of His dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> And thus ſhe ſpake with a holy Confidence in the Lords Love to her Soul, and was not in the leaſt daunted when ſhe ſpake of her death; but ſeemed greatly delighted in the apprehenſion of her near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her Fathers Houſe. And it was not long before ſhe was filled with joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in believing.</p>

A Certain very poor Child, that had a very bad Father, but it was to be hoped a very good Mother, was by the Providence of God, brought to the ſight of a Godly Friend of mine, who upon the firſt ſight of the Child, had a great pitty for him, and took an affection to him, &amp; had a mind to bring him up for Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. At the firſt, he did with great ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and kindneſs allure the Child, by which means it was not long before he got a deep intereſt in the Heart of the Child, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this a Door was opened for a farther Work, &amp; he had a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to inſtil Spiritual principles into the Soul of the Child, which he was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, as the Lord gave opportunity, and the Child was capable of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It was not long before the Lord was

pleaſed to ſtrike in with the Spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of this good Man, ſo that the Child was brought to a liking to the things of God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He quickly learnt a great part of the Aſſemblies Catechiſm by heart, and that before he could read his Primer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Book; and he took a great delight in learning his Catechiſm.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He was not only able to give a very good account of his Catechiſm, but he would anſwer ſuch Queſtions as are not in the Catechiſm, with greater underſtanding than could be expected of one of his Age.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He took great delight in diſcourſing about the things of God; and when my Friend had been either praying or reading, expounding or repeating Sermons, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very attentive, and ready to receive the truths of God, and would with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible gravity, diligence and affection, wait till duties were ended, to the no ſmall joy and admiration of them which obſerved him.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>JOhn Sudlow,</hi> was Born of Religious Parents, in the County of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> whoſe great care was to inſtil Spiritual Principles into him, as ſoon as he was capable of underſtanding of them;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000914_0072_0FACA245262E79A0"/>
whoſe Endeavours the Lord was pleaſed to Crown with the deſired ſucceſs: So that (to uſe the Expreſſion of a Holy Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him) <hi>Scarce more could be expected or deſired from ſo little a one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. When he was ſcarce able to ſpeak plain, he ſeemed to have a very great awe and reverence of God upon his Spirit, and a ſtrange ſence of the things of another world, as might eaſily be perceived by thoſe ſerious and admirable queſtions which he would be oft asking of thoſe Chriſtians that he thought he might be bold with.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The firſt thing that did moſt affect him, and made him endeavour to eſcape from the wrath to come, and to enquire what he ſhould do to be Saved, was the Death of a little Brother; when he ſaw him without breath, and not able to ſtir, and then carried out of doors, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Pit-hole, he was greatly concerned, and asked notable queſtions about him; but that which was moſt affecting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, was, <hi>Whether he must Dye too,</hi> which being anſwered, it made ſuch a deep impreſſion upon him, that from that time forward, he was exceeding Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; this was when he was about four Years old.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:000914_0073_0FACA245E6C92360"/>4. Now he is deſirous to know what he might do that he might live in another World, and what he muſt avoid, that he might not Dye for ever, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his Godly Parents, he ſoon la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to avoid whatſoever might diſpleaſe God; now tell him that any thing was Sinful, and that God would not have him to do it, and he is eaſily kept from it, and even at this time of day, the apprehenſions of God, and Death and Eternity laid ſuch a reſtraint upon him, that he would not for a World have told a lye.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He quickly learned to read exactly, and took ſuch pleaſure in reading of the Scriptures and his Catechiſm, and other good Books, that it is ſcarce to be parallell'd; he would naturally run to his Book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bidding, when he came home from School, and when other Children of his age and acquaintance were playing, he reckon'd it his Recreation to be doing that which was good.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When he was in Coats, he would be ſtill asking his Maid ſerious queſtions, and praying her to teach him his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, or Scriptures, or ſome good thing; common Diſcourſe he took no delight in,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000914_0074_0FACA246AD4F5D80"/>
but did moſt eagerly deſire to be ſucking in of the knowledge of the things of God, Chriſt, his Soul, and another World.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He was lingely taken with the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and would be ready to leave his Dinner to go to his Book.</p>
                     <p n="8">8.

                     <p>She was one remarkably grave, devout, ſerious; very inquiſitive about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Eternity; and in her particular Calling very diligent.
