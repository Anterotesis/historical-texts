            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The fir≈øt thing that did mo≈øt affect him, and made him endeavour to e≈øcape from the wrath to come, and to enquire what he ≈øhould do to be Saved, was the Death of a little Brother; when he ≈øaw him without breath, and not able to ≈øtir, and then carried out of doors, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Pit-hole, he was greatly concerned, and asked notable que≈øtions about him; but that which was mo≈øt affecting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf and others, was, <hi>Whether he must Dye too,</hi> which being an≈øwered, it made ≈øuch a deep impre≈ø≈øion upon him, that from that time forward, he was exceeding Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; this was when he was about four Years old.</p>

Now he is de≈øirous to know what he might do that he might live in another World, and what he mu≈øt avoid, that he might not Dye for ever, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed by his Godly Parents, he ≈øoon la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to avoid what≈øoever might di≈øplea≈øe God; now tell him that any thing was Sinful, and that God would not have him to do it, and he is ea≈øily kept from it, and even at this time of day, the apprehen≈øions of God, and Death and Eternity laid ≈øuch a re≈øtraint upon him, that he would not for a World have told a lye.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He quickly learned to read exactly, and took ≈øuch plea≈øure in reading of the Scriptures and his Catechi≈øm, and other good Books, that it is ≈øcarce to be parallell'd; he would naturally run to his Book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bidding, when he came home from School, and when other Children of his age and acquaintance were playing, he reckon'd it his Recreation to be doing that which was good.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When he was in Coats, he would be ≈øtill asking his Maid ≈øerious que≈øtions, and praying her to teach him his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi≈øm, or Scriptures, or ≈øome good thing; common Di≈øcour≈øe he took no delight in,

He was very mode≈øt while≈øt any ≈øtranger was pre≈øent, and was loth to ask them any que≈øtions: but as ≈øoon as they were gone, he would let his Father know that there was little ≈øaid or done, but he ob≈øerved it, and would reflect upon what was pa≈øt in their di≈øcour≈øe, and de≈øire ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in what he could not under≈øtand at pre≈øent.</p>
