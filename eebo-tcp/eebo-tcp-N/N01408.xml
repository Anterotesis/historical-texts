         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE State of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when this Pſalm was Penned, was very Calamitous (as appears from the Matter of the Pſalm it ſelf) both with reſpect unto <hi>Sins and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And the whole Pſalm is a Prayer in the Name and Behalf of the Church, unto God for Deliverance. In the Verſe before us, we may conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Deſcription of the <hi>Church Prayed for,</hi> by that Metaphor of a <hi>Vine.</hi> To Explain which we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) THAT Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf as Mediator, God-Man, and as Head of the Church is <hi>the True Vine,</hi> Joh. 15.1. Chriſt compares Himſelf to a Vine
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001674_0004_0FB4E08B82FE6B20"/>
according to His uſual Cuſtom of taking Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes from things Common and Obvious; ſuch were Vines in <hi>Judea, Deut.</hi> 8.8. Planted by the ſides of their Houſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.3. Probably of that Houſe where Chriſt was when He ſpake thoſe words. Chriſt is the <hi>Principal Vine,</hi> for whoſe ſake the Church of Iſrael was compared to a Vine or Vineyard, becauſe out of that Church the Meſſiah was to come who is the True Vine. Chriſt is that Vine, as God-Man, Mediator, to whom the Father hath given this Prerogative to have Life in Himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26.</p>
            <p>AND to be a quickning Spirit unto thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into Him, and who are given to Him to be His Members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. Chriſt is therefore likened to that which is the chief part of a Vine, Namely <hi>the Root and Stock,</hi> when as His Members are but like the <hi>Branches.</hi> Chriſt as He is Man is of the ſame Nature with the Branches, as He is God He ſupplies the Branches with Spiritual Life and Grace. The Humane Nature of Chriſt is as the Conduit through which the Gifts of the Holy Spirit flow unto His People. As Mediator He both Merited Grace for Men, and Infuſes Grace into Men; and more truly and perfectly nouriſhes Believers unto Eternal Life, than a Vine doth its Branches; as an Head of influence unto them. Chriſt is then the true and proper Vine, others but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily ſo; and depending on Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving all their Spiritual Life from Him; and obtaining all they have, for His Sake: And that they are Vines in any ſenſe is becauſe God the Father to Glorify His Son, hath given them to Him in an Everlaſting Covenant, to be brought unto Union and Communion with Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001674_0005_0FB4E08EDCF3C228"/>MANY Phraſes in this Pſalm, may be referred to Chriſt; He is Gods <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Verſe 1. to whom belongs the Right of Primogeniture; to be the Firſt born of every Creature. He is the Man of Gods Right Hand, <hi>v.</hi> 17. Gods <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who is Exalted to ſit at Gods Right Hand, and if this glorious <hi>Benjamin</hi> were not there, we ſhould not be admitted to ſee Gods face. He it is whom God the Father hath made Strong for Himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>v.</hi> 15, 18. Who did ſtand and feed in the Strength of the Lord and in the Majeſty of the Name of the Lord his God, <hi>Micah</hi> 5.4. And as Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make His Church conformable to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo in ſome reſpect, He would be like to His Church; therefore He would be the Branch, the Vine, the Fruit of the Earth, and would be brought out of <hi>Egypt, v.</hi> 8. <hi>Math.</hi> 2.15. So that Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations to His Church were Typical of the Meſſiah in many things: Therefore alſo the ſame Title of a Vine, comprehends both Chriſt and His Church; as the Name of Chriſt is alſo given to His Myſtical Body the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</p>
            <p>NOW God the Father hath Engaged Himſelf to be the Husbandman, when Chriſt condeſcends to be the Vine; the Father will and doth always manifeſt His gracious Preſence with Chriſt as Head of the Church, to Aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t and Help Him and Strengthen Him: and out of Reſpect and Love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt it is, that the Father takes any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in a way of Pity, Compaſſion and Grace, of any Men or Societies of Men upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>THE Inviſible Church of the Elect are likened to a Vine or Vineyard:</hi> The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Vineyard; The Myſtical Paradiſe of God, partly in Heaven, and partly on Earth. As God Planted an Earthly Paradiſe in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which did excel all the reſt of the Earth; ſo ſince the Ruine of Mankind by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Apoſtacy, God will have a Remnant among fallen Mankind in every Age and Generation, to be His Vineyard, Garden, Orchard (or <hi>Eden,</hi> Eccl. 2.5.) depending on and United unto Chriſt, the Second <hi>Adam</hi>: For God in His Infinite Wiſdom ſo ordered the things of the firſt Creation, that they might be Natural Types of what He would do in the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things by Chriſt.</p>

The great Work of God in all Ages is to be Planting Vineyards or Churches, where there are none; and to Preſerve thoſe Churches which He hath already on Earth, and to reſtore them where they are under decays. Tho' Chriſts Church on Earth be a Weak and Feeble People, yet He makes them Strong for Himſelf, defending them againſt the Gates of Hell, keeping an Hedge of Protection about them, and guarding them by Armies of Angels, and ſo caring for them that the whole World may diſcern, that His ſpecial Care and gracious Providence is concerned for their Good, more than for the reſt of Mankind.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

On whom the Church might depend for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when all Earthly Helps failed them.</p>
            <p>THE Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> placed all their Hopes in the Meſſiah (when their Caſe was moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,) that at His Coming He would reſtore all things; And as God the Father who ſent Chriſt, is called, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Zech. 2.8. So alſo is Chriſt Himſelf, who was ſent by His Father. He ſits between the Cherubims, Noting that His Throne is in the Third Heavens Surrounded with Angels; yea the Angels themſelves partly conſtitute His Throne, on which He Sits.</p>
            <p>THUS in our Prayers unto God for His Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard on Earth, Our Faith ought to be acted diſtinctly on God the Father, the Husbandman, Vine-dreſſer, and Owner of the Vineyard; On the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Root and Head of Influence to His Church; And on the Holy Spirit, by whom the Father and Son do Work peculiarly for the good of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Matter or Subſtance of their Petitions.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Return.</hi> Gods promiſe to dwell in the midſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was on Condition that they kept His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. When they neglected this their Duty, they were liable to be forſaken of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. Upon their Apoſtacies, God with-drew from them, turned away from them, hid Himſelf from them, carryed Himſelf as if He took no Notice of their Afflictions, took no Care of them, and had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Regard to them.</p>
            <p>THE Church then Prays here for the Tokens and Evidences of Gods Returning unto them in a Way of Pity, Favour and Mercy. Its call'd, <hi>Gods Coming to Save them,</hi> verſ. 2. Unleſs God did after a Sort Come from Heaven to Save them by His

Efficacious Preſence on Earth, they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be delivered out of the Depth of Apoſtacy and Calamity which they were fallen into.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>LOOK down from Heaven and behold this Vine.</hi> Hitherto God ſeemed to be ſo Angry with them that it ſeemed as if He would not deſign to Look on them, nor would give them a good Look, and would not Look after them, as if He cared not what would become of them.</p>
            <p>THE Thing Prayed for then, is, A Gracious Look of Divine Providence, and Look of Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, as in Iſai. 63.15. <hi>Look down from Heaven, and behold from the Habitation of thy Holineſs and of thy Glory: Where is thy Zeal, and thy Strength, the Sounding of thy Bowels and of thy Mercy towards me? Are they Reſtrained?</hi> God is ſaid to Look down from Heaven when He Pities their Caſe, who are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Afflicted beyond all Meaſure, and gives them ſuch Remarkable Help, that None can doubt but that their Deliverance comes from Heaven: Pſal. 102.19. <hi>For He hath Looked down from the Height<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>SO great is the Inſolency and Cruelty of the Enemies of the Church; that Believers know if they could but prevail with the God of Heaven to turn His Eyes towards them, and Look upon their Diſtreſſed Caſe, He could not refrain from Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Pitying them, when no Eye is left on Earth to Pity them; and they know that One Look from Heaven is ſufficient to turn their Enemies into Confuſion.

And to pay their Duty, and Reverence to their Superiours. But Superiours Viſit their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours in <hi>a way of Pity and Care</hi>: So the Apoſtles Viſited the Churches, and the Shepherds Viſit their Flocks, to provide for them, and to redreſs what is amiſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.2. Now the Viſit here Prayed for, is requeſted of Him who is called the <hi>Shepherd of Iſrael,</hi> v. 1. The great Owner of the Vineyard, who in and by His Covenant with them had Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Office of a Shepherd, to Feed, Lead and Govern them, and to Rectify and Reform what was amiſs among them.</p>

            <p>INDEED ſometimes a Day of Divine Viſitation ſignifies, a Day of Calamity and Deſtruction which comes upon the Wicked and Impenitent, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.14. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.7.

Strange and Unuſual Deaths, and by Deſolating Judgments, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.9, 29.</p>
            <p>BUT in our Text is meant, A <hi>Merciful Viſit</hi> for the Reſtoration and Recovery of the Church from Sins and Judgments. Thus God is ſaid to have Viſited <hi>Hannah,</hi> when She bare Three Sons, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.21. And to Viſit the Earth, when He Waters and Enriches it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.9. The Viſit Prayed for is that of a Father afforded to his Children, which is with Pity and Compaſſion, with Care and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as well as with Power to Help them. Such a Viſit <hi>Joſeph</hi> promiſed that God would give to <hi>Iſrael</hi>: Gen. 50.24, 25. <hi>God will ſurely Viſit you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring you out of this Land, unto the Land which He Sware to</hi> Abraham, <hi>to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.16. <hi>I have ſurely Viſited you and ſeen what is done to you.</hi> Exod. 4.31. <hi>When they had heard the Lord had Viſited the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and that He had Looked on their Affliction, then they bowed their Heads and Worſhipped.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. A DIVINE Viſit oftentimes ſignifies, <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and ſometimes a Miraculous Appearance of God,</hi> in beſtowing Mercies on His People; or in Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them out of Trouble. A Divine Viſitation is Real and Efficacious, an Actual Accompliſhment of Mercy for them; and not a bare Preparation for Action. The Ordinary, Common Viſitation of God doth preſerve Mens Life and Spirit, <hi>Job</hi> 10.12. But there are more Special and Peculiar Viſits of God afforded to His People by the more than Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Emanations of the Power, Wiſdom, Grace, and Spirit of God; when their Caſe, as to Men, Means, and ordinary Helps, ſeems deſperate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS Phraſe of Viſiting is Eſpecially uſed to Expreſs the Gracious Actings of God towards His Church, <hi>in and by CHRIST, who is GOD Incarnate.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. THAT which the Church hoped would be <hi>the Happy Effect of ſuch a Gracious Viſit</hi> from Heaven, may be collected from ſeveral Requeſts made in this Pſalm. As,</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHEN the God of Hoſts works <hi>by the Hosts of Heaven, the holy Angels,</hi> for the good of His Vine; That is a remarkable Viſit. Thus after <hi>Rabſhakehs</hi> Railing and Blaſphemy, the Churches Enemies were found all dead Corpſes, being deſtroyed by an Angel. Alſo when by the holy Angels God ſtirs up good Motions in the Hearts of Men, and Spirits them to Engage in, and Perform ſome work for God. An Angel aſſiſted <hi>Darius</hi> in wielding his new gotten Empire, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.1. Angels aſſiſted in raiſing up and afterwards raſing to the ground thoſe mighty Empires of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Grecia,</hi> Dan. 10.13, 20, 21. All which changes on the Empires were ultimately for the ſake and benefit of the Church of God: for God can readily part even with an Earthly Kingdom, and give it for His Churches good: So dear and precious is His Vine unto Him: And God hath Inviſible State-Miniſters (even the Holy Angels) to bring about the Fates of Kingdoms and Empires.</p>

God remarkably Viſited <hi>Iſrael</hi> in raiſing up <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be their Inſtrumental Saviour, and in preparing him for Civil Government by a Learned Education; alſo in raiſing up <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be a Father and Shepherd unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>; So He raiſed up Judges in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to deliver them, who were filled with the Spirit in a more than ordinary meaſure. <hi>David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Aſa, Jehoſophat, Hezekiah, Nehemiah, Ezra, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robbabel</hi> were raiſed up to promote Temple-work, and to ſet forward the Work of Reformation with all their might. In New-Teſtament times the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were in an Extraordinary manner acted by the Holy Spirit, and made willing and able to Undertake that great Work of Goſpellizing the World, which was then over-ſpread with Paganiſm and Idolatry. In ſuch Inſtruments Gods People ſee the Face of God ſhining Mercifully upon them.</p>
            <p>ALSO when God ordaineth Praiſe and Promotes His Own Glory, even <hi>by Inſtruments as unlikely as Babes and Sucklings,</hi> Pſal. 8.2. And by things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted fooliſh by Carnal Men, and things Weak, and Baſe, and by things which are not, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Wiſe and the Mighty, and doth bring to nought things which are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25—29. And by Men of a Modeſt and Meek Spirit carries on His Work Succesfully, ſo that they are not daunted and diſcouraged from their Duty, by the brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beatings of Imperious Spirits; which ſhews that they are Acted and Aſſiſted by a Spirit beyond their own, and that God is with them of a Truth.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch a Day of Divine Viſitation God is wont to Communicate <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> in an Eminent Manner on Goſpel Miniſters, in Increaſing the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of Preachers, and Increaſing their <hi>Abilities,</hi> and Increaſing their <hi>Forwardneſs</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> in their Work.

Army of them that Publiſh it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.11. An Army of Labourers are ſent forth into Gods Vineyard when He hath a great Harveſt to gather in. In ſuch a Day His Spirit is not meerly <hi>Given,</hi> but <hi>Poured forth,</hi> in the Gifts of it, moſt plentifully on ſuch as are to carry on His Work, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. And they have a Spirit of forwardneſs to double their Diligence in the Work of Chriſts Kingdom in ſuch a Day and Seaſon, and to act with more than uſual Preſence, Courage and Vivacity; their Hearts being Lift up in the ways of the Lord; They are preſſed forwards and go bound in the Spirit about Gods Work; They ſet forth with full Sail, having the freſh Gales of the Wind of Gods Holy Spirit to carry them along through moſt Arduous Affairs to promote the Glory of God, and the Good of His Vineyard: And ſometimes even Youths or Young Men are ſo ſtrengthned with Might in the Inner Man, as that they faint not in the Work of God. Even in great, and almoſt Apoſtolical Enterprizes and Services for God; as in Planting of Religion where it was not before.</p>

            <p n="1">(1.) AT ſuch a time God is wont to make a People <hi>Willing to be Reformed,</hi> by the Efficacy of His Spirit on their Hearts. They are made to be of a Teachable Spirit, and deſirous to know and be Inſtructed wherein they have offended God, and provoked Him to with-draw from them, and what it is that God would have them to do, that they may obtain the Returns of His Preſence unto them again; Now <hi>Pars eſt Sanitatis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Work of Reformation will go on with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light when the People are generally <hi>Willing</hi> to be Healed and to Turn from the Error of their Ways, being Convinced of the Neceſſity of it to prevent the Total Ruine of this Vine. It was a Viſit of God to the Hearts of the People, which made them readily to fall in with the Leaders and Rulers in proceeding to a Publick Reformation in the Days of <hi>Joſiah, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ſo that they would Excite the Rulers to ſet about this good Work, and Strengthen their Hearts and Hands therein, Saying, <hi>Ariſe, this matter belongeth unto thee, be Strong and do it.</hi> Where-upon,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>ALL Ranks and Orders</hi> of Men that Fear God are <hi>made to Unite in Promoting the Welfare of this Vine,</hi> when God thus Viſits them from above. Its a remarkable Work of God to <hi>Unite</hi> the Hearts of good Men in determining what ought to be done for the Promoting of Religion, the Reforming of Vice, and Encouraging Virtue, and in Practiſing what they have agreed upon for the good of the Lords Vineyard; that as they ſee Eye to Eye, ſo they draw all one Way; and readily to bury all leſſer Jarrs and Animoſities, rather than the Glory of God and the Work of Chriſt ſhould be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed or Neglected.</p>
            <p>AND in ſuch a time Men of an Inferiour Rank have been Signally Animated to give good Advice and ſeaſonable Reproofs unto Others, ſo far as became their Stations: Yea in ſuch a Day of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, even Infants have had ſuch Impreſſions on their Hearts as to cry out <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Son of <hi>David</hi>: And Young Perſons on their Death-beds have been Extraordinarily aſſiſted to give moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and profitable Warnings and Advice to their Companions, for their Awakening to Repentance.</p>

THIS Succeſs of the Labourers in Gods Vineyard conſiſts, <hi>in the Upholding of Religion</hi> where it is Set up, and <hi>in Planting and Propagating of it to other Places.</hi> It is the good Hand of God Working for His People, which provides Paſtors after His Own Heart for His Church, Succeſſively from Age to Age; ſo that when Fathers in the Miniſtry have left the World, yet the Churches of Chriſt on Earth have not been left deſtitute of Qualifyed Perſons to Feed them with the Bread of Life, and to Lead and Guide them according to the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, It is a gracious Viſit from Heaven that Cauſes this Vine to Propagate; ſo that as People are Multiplyed, Churches alſo ſhould be Multiplyed: and more Miniſterial Vineyards and Gardens En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, for our Lord Jeſus to take delight in, and to walk in the midſt of.</p>

Day of a Merciful Viſit by the God of Heaven, which Quickens and Revives Grace in the Hearts of Old Diſciples, doth commonly gain home ſome Others unto Chriſt, which were not Converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: As that Sermon which much Affects an Old Chriſtian, is likely to be a Means of Converting Sinners unto God. And the Increaſe of the Church by New Converts doth tend to freſhen and quicken Grace in Old Diſciples, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.12, 13. When the Vineyard flouriſhes, and the tender Grape appears and the Pomegranate buds forth, which is a Proof of Chriſts Special Preſence with His People, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving His Work among them; then the Affections and Delights of Gracious Souls are abundantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and drawn forth after Chriſt, ſo that they want words to Expreſs how dearly they Love the Lord Chriſt.</p>
            <p>AND the Propagation of Religion to Plantations formerly Ungoſpellized is Preparatorily attended with the Revival and Freſh Springing up of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Places where it was before; The Church (like a Mother) hath many Thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001674_0024_0FB4E0C2C316CD50"/>OH! what luculent Evidences of a Viſit from Heaven are given forth in Planting the Goſpel in Places where it never was before Setled, ſo that all muſt Confeſs, Verily God hath wrought this, and not Man! When the worſt ſort of Sinners are changed into Saints Suddenly and Surprizingly; and of Oppoſers become Promoters of Religion. Was it not ſtrange that <hi>Iſrael</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be willing to lay themſelves under Bond and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Engagements to Keep and Obey all Gods Commandments, before they knew in particular what God would Enjoyn them?</p>
            <p>AND altho' in this Age, we expect not Apoſtles to be raiſed up, acted by an infallible Spirit; yet it is Eaſy to grant that unto remarkable Succeſs granted to Men in the uſe of ordinary Means, there is often required a greater Concurrence of Gods Communicative Power, than in thoſe that are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. The Weakneſs of Inſtruments tends to ſet forth the Greatneſs of the Power of God put forth by them.</p>

And this was a Day of Viſitation to them. Hence its ſaid, Heb. 3.7. <hi>To Day if you will hear his Voice,</hi> &amp;c.

who would ſtop Gods <hi>Jacobs</hi> in their Purpoſes to build Altars to the Lord, and Set up His Worſhip. There is ſometimes a Day of <hi>Judicial</hi> Viſitation, wherein the Chaff, Bryars, Thorns and Weeds; the Sticks and Stones, which offend the Vines, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their growth, are Pickt up and thrown out of this Orchard and Garden of the Lord; Thoſe who are obſtinately bent to oppoſe Gods Work, God hath a Day wherein to Remove them, and by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in Righteouſneſs doth ſometimes anſwer the Prayers of His People for the flouriſhing of His Vine on Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. Alſo God doth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Wrath, Bound and Limit the Malice of His Enemies, and Diſappoint their Crafty Projects whereby they Endeavour to Circumvent, Prevent, and Obſtruct all good Deſigns. The Wiſdom of God herein, is in theſe Latter Ages eſpecially Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted rather than His Power. And the aſtoniſhing <hi>Hardneſs of Heart</hi> judicially inflicted on ſome at ſuch a time, is alſo a ſign that it is a Day and Seaſon of a Divine Viſitation.

The Preremptory Oppoſition which ſuch make to the Ways and Truths of God is a proof that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are ſcorched with it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IN ſuch a Day of Divine Viſitation of the Vineyard, God is won't <hi>to Prune and Lop off the Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berancies and Excreſcencies of the good Vines,</hi> which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Growth and Fruitfulneſs. God Sanctifies thoſe Afflictions to them which He Exerciſes His Vineyard with, to Humble them and to cauſe Grace

to take the deeper Root down-wards in their Hearts, that they may bring forth more and better Fruits Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Some forward Humourſome Saints, after God hath taken them in hand, and Pruned and Purged them by Afflictions, do become very Humble, Patient, Meek and Holy Chriſtians: Others almoſt ruined by a Worldly Spirit, after Divine Purgations become of a Publick Spirit, and forward to do Service for God; The Contentious are made <hi>Peaceable,</hi> yea become <hi>Peace-Makers</hi>; and the Selfiſh made Generous, and the Slow and Dull and Sluggiſh Chriſtian quickned and made forward and ready to every good Work. At ſuch a Time when there is a Revival of Religion by gaining New Converts unto Chriſt, Aged Chriſtians are wont to Experience a New and Second Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their Souls, wherein the whole Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith is Repeated and Exerciſed over again in them.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

But the Virtue and Power of Man is Weakneſs it ſelf, yea, Nothing; It is God who brings all to paſs, which is done for the good of His Vine.

The Sins of Gods Viſible People Provoke Him to hide Himſelf from them, yea to forſake His Vineyard; we firſt forſake God by our Sins, before the Lord forſake us; and when we looſe the gracious Preſence of God, we ſoon looſe both our Piety &amp; Proſperity.

OUR Prayers ſhould be conjoyned with <hi>Holy Purpoſes and Endeavours to Reform our Evil Ways, by the Help of God.</hi> Would we have the Great GOD come and Viſit our Hearts, &amp; our Houſes, and our Churches, we ſhould then Prepare for His Coming, by cleanſing our Hearts, Houſes &amp; Societies, from all that is filthy and ungrateful to Him; from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit: Put all things in Order, if we intend that the King of Glory ſhould come in and walk &amp; dwell among us. Let us find out what the Sins are which keep God at a diſtance from us, which Separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our God and us, and Provoke Him ſo much, that He will not give us a good Look. We ſhould ceaſe from doing Evil, and learn to do well, that ſo the Lord without diminution of the Glory of His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, may Return unto us in Mercy. Thoſe who continue Obſtinate Sinners and hate to be Reformed, inſtead of Praying in a Right manner to the Lord to Return to us, do practically ſay to the Almighty, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

would Look from Heaven and behold them, and their behaviours? Thoſe who are going on in a Courſe of Sin, care not that a God of Infinite Holineſs ſhould behold and obſerve their Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) OUR Prayers for a Divine Viſit ſhould be <hi>Fervent and Importunate.</hi> Wreſtle with God in Prayer, take no denyal at His Hand: Oh! let us Cry mightily to Heaven for One Good Look more, the Smiles of His Countenance upon us, and that He would Return to us and leave a bleſſing behind Him; Plead with God, <hi>Lord, Haſt Thou no Mercy in Store for this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Haſt Thou Utterly cast off and abhorred them? Art Thou reſolved not to beſtow of Thy Spirit upon them?</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>How</hi> ſhall we plead in Prayer for ſuch a Viſit?</p>
            <p n="1">1. PLEAD we <hi>for the Soveraign Grace of God to be Exerted towards us,</hi> that which is undeſerved by us, and for which we can make no Recompence: Let us Plead thus, <hi>O Lord, will it not Glorify Thy Soveraign Grace and Mercy, to Revive Thy Work among ſuch a Degenerate People, to remove the Iniquity of our Land in One Day</hi>? Zech. 3.9. Will not that be a Glorious Days work indeed? Will not the Lord gain as much Glory to His Great Name, by Pardoning our Sins, giving us Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and by Pruning &amp; Purging His Vineyard, as He can gain to His Juſtice by giving us up to our own Hearts Luſts, thereby to ripen our Selves for Ruine?</p>
            <p n="2">2. LET us Plead for a Divine Viſit, <hi>in the Name and for the Sake of the Son of Man, the Son of Gods Right Hand; who is the Root and Head of the Vine, yea moſt properly He is the Vine it Self.</hi> Let us Exerciſe Faith in our Lord Meſſiah, our Great Friend in the Court of Heaven, to Intercede with God for us, that ſuch a gracious Viſit from Heaven may be afforded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us on Earth. The Reaſon why Chriſt did no migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works in ſome Places, during His Bodily Preſence

on Earth, was becauſe of their Unbelief, who dwelt in thoſe Places; Let us ſtrive againſt Unbelief &amp; Labour for a Lively Exerciſe of Faith on the Promiſes of the Covenant &amp; on Chriſt in the Promiſes; for God hath engaged to Return again to His People when they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Him, and Seek Him with their whole Hearts: So in Prov. 1.23. <hi>Turn ye at my Reproof; and then Behold</hi> (beyond your deſerts, and beyond your hopes, and to your Admiration) <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon you.</hi> Let us plead that Promiſe made by God the Father unto Chriſt, <hi>That He ſhall ſee His Seed,</hi> or have a Viſible Vine upon Earth in all Ages, notwithſtanding all the Power &amp; Policy of Hell whereby it is oppoſed. Let us plead the Intereſt which the Lord Chriſt hath in the Church on Earth, and the Glory that redounds to Chriſt the Mediator, by the Preſerving, Propagating &amp; Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of His Vineyard on Earth: It is the only Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Orchard (or Eden) which Chriſt hath on Earth, wherein He takes delight to Walk, and Recreate Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. LET us plead with God that it is the <hi>Vineyard, which His Own Right Hand hath Planted, v.</hi> 8, 15. It is ſuch a Work, wherein the Glorious Power of Gods Own Right Hand appears in every Age, to Plant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion where it was not, and to Preſerve it where it hath been Planted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to Revive it where it is Decay'd and Languiſhing. Let us then plead with God that He would not forſake the Work of His Own Hands, That that Work (which above all other Works He appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates to Himſelf, to be His <hi>Own Work</hi>) may appear to His Servants; that Work which He is pleaſed to call <hi>His Glory,</hi> may appear to the Children of His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; that Work of Eſtabliſhing Religion among us, which is the Beauty &amp; Comelineſs of the Lord our God put upon us; may flouriſh more and more as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Divine Viſit granted unto us <hi>Pſal</hi>

Let us plead with God and put Him in Remembrance of this, That it is the great End &amp; Deſign of Divine Providence in diſpoſing of Kingdoms, and in all the Turns &amp; Fates that attend them, to promote the good of His Vine upon Earth; and were it not for Gods Vineyard upon Earth, what would the whole World be but an <hi>Hell</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi> Where Religion flouriſhes, all other good Intereſts Proſper: But as Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, ſo a People may conclude that things will go ill with them. This Vineyard of the Lord on Earth He hath an Eye and Regard to, in all other of His Works, and as it were lays aſide all other Works, that He may Mind the good of His Vine; Yea He diſpences Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and Curſes to Men, according to that regard or diſregard which they have to His Vineyard on Earth. Gen. 12.3. <hi>I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe him that curſeth thee.</hi> Let us then plead with God thus, <hi>Lord, Thou knoweſt how few there be in the World that Fear Thy Name, that Profeſs Religion, that bring Honour to God their Creator, to Chriſt their Redeemer; Thou haſt reſerved to Thy Self but a Little Spot of Ground on Earth to be Thy Garden Incloſed; and all the Reſt of the World are ſuffered to go on in their Own Ways to Thy Diſhonour; and wilt Thou not Stand by thoſe that Stand for Thee? Wilt Thou not Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them that Honour Thee? Shall Satan prevail &amp; leave Chriſt no Garden-Spot on Earth to Walk in? For Thy Name Sake, Let it not be ſo!</hi>

            <p n="5">5. CONSIDER, Some <hi>Motives to Excite us in our Prayers to God for ſuch a Gracious Viſit.</hi> We have the <hi>Command of God</hi> given forth to us, to put up this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition Daily, <hi>Thy Kingdom Come</hi>! Unto which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we ſhould manifeſt our ready Obedience. We have <hi>the Example of the Church</hi> in our Text ſet before us for our Imitation, to Pray for the Lords Vineyard the Church, when under greateſt Diſtreſſes &amp; Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies. We have the <hi>Promiſes &amp; Prophecies of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:001674_0035_0FB4E0E30B702D48"/>
wherein Mercy is Stored up for the People of God; we have the Predictions of the future Glory of the Church, and ſome Pledges of it before Hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6, 7, 8. In the Days of Chriſt the True <hi>Solomon, The Righteous ſhall flouriſh, there ſhall be abundance of Peace, He ſhall have dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River to the Ends of the Earth.</hi> The taking down the Partition-Wall between Jews &amp; Gentiles whereby the Vine of the Church was made to ſpread its branches over the Wall; did not take in the whole World into the Lords Vineyard, at Once; but there is ſtill a diſtinction to be made between the Church and the reſt of the World which lies in Wickedneſs; between a Religious People by a Viſible Profeſſion, and the reſt of the World that are Periſhing for want of Viſion; therefore Gods dealings with ſome particular Nations and People may yet in times to come reſemble His Diſpenſations towards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in taking them to be a Select People to Himſelf, in Forming them to be a People peculiarly for Himſelf to ſhew forth His Praiſe, by Erecting His Viſible Kingdom in all the Privileges, Ordinances &amp; Worſhip thereof among them. Let us then be moved to Pray in Faith, and with Hope and Expectations of the Glorious Things which are Spoken of, concerning <hi>Zion</hi> the City of our God.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Motive may be turned into an Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with our own Souls. <hi>Are we Willing that Gods Myſtical Paradiſe, His Garden of Pleaſure upon Earth ſhould be quite Defaced, Razed &amp; Extinguiſh'd?</hi> Are Aged Chriſtians willing that Religion ſhould dye with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? No ſure, we dare not harbour ſuch Cruelty in our Hearts! Let us then Cry mightily to God for the Preſervation of His Vineyard, that Religion may be Propagated to the Succeeding Generation, by new Deſcents of the Lord God of Hoſts from Heaven, by new &amp; plentiful Effuſions of His Spirit on all Fleſh!
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001674_0036_0FB4E0E40DACF230"/>
We can't find in our Hearts, to be willing that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould take its flight from our Land, or that the Vineyard of Chriſt here ſhould be under a Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction! Let us then Cry fervently to God to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive His Work among us in the Midſt of the Years: that it may not be charged on us, that we by our Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> warmneſs, &amp; Slothfulneſs &amp; other Sins Contributed to the Ruine of theſe Churches, and drove away the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Preſence of God from this His Vineyard.</p>
            <p>LET me add Another Motive; Namely, That <hi>we might Enjoy more of Heaven upon Earth were it not our own Faults.</hi> We might have more Viſits from the Lord God of Hoſts and the Man of His Right Hand, did we fervently Pray for them; For Chriſt hath promiſed to give His Holy Spirit to thoſe that Ask it of Him; <hi>What God has wrought by ſome Glympſes of His Gracious Aſpect from Heaven in ſome</hi> Perſons, Families &amp; Plantations for the Reviving of Religion, demonſtrates what He could and would do more generally and abundantly, when there is a general Application in a right manner made to Him for this Mercy. May we not eſteem it a good Omen that the God of Hoſts will lengthen out the Day of His gracious Viſitation unto us (unleſs by our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacies perſiſted in we refuſe His Company) even in this Century alſo, ſeeing He hath ſo ordered in His Providence, that this New &amp; Famous Houſe ſhould be Erected, wherein we now Aſſemble, in the Metropolis of our Province, for that beſt of Uſes, the Celebration of Divine Worſhip; and that this Houſe ſhould with ſuch Expedition &amp; Succeſs be Completely finiſhed, in a Day of many &amp; great Diſtreſſes upon us, whereby Occaſion has been given to many to ſhew their Love to God &amp; His Houſe by their Liberal Donations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Building; withal Exerciſing their Faith and Hope that God will ſtill build up His Myſtical Houſe and Vineyard in this Land, and that in this Houſe we
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001674_0037_0FB4E0E5ACE6C810"/>
ſhall Enjoy much of Heaven upon Earth, the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God to our Souls, and thoſe delights appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to His Myſtical Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. AND Laſtly, Conſider, Who they are that ſhould more eſpecially concern themſelves for the Obtaining ſuch a Viſit from Heaven to be made to His Vineyard upon Earth, and more particularly to the Vine which the Lord of Hoſts by His Own Right Hand, (working by remarkable Providences) hath Planted in this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Now all Sorts of Men are Ranked into <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi>: and ſomething might Pertinently be Spoken from this Subject to them all.</p>
            <p>AS to thoſe in Chief Rank among us in the State and in the Church, My Innate Modeſty forbids me, to ſay much; Yet I ſhall not wholly Pretermit the uſual Cuſtom of ſaying ſomething with ſuitable Brevity.</p>
            <p>AND in the Firſt Place, My Speech may be directed <hi>to His Excellency, Our Governour in Chief,</hi> who hath been betruſted with the Care of the Lords Vineyard in this Land for many Years paſt.</p>

Propagation of Religion, the Planting it in the dark Corners of our Land, and the Upholding of it where it was Planted. We heartily render our Thanks to Your Excellency for theſe Favours; and believe Your Excellency doth Eſteem it Your Glory, and a Sufficient Reward of it Self, that the Lord of Hoſts is Pleaſed to Accept of ſuch Your Deſires &amp; Endeavours to Promote the Flouriſhing of His Vineyard in this Land: and that on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Proſperity. God grant we may have always ſuch a GOVERNOUR, who like <hi>Moſes</hi> is daily Lifting up his Hands &amp; Heart to GOD in the Heavens, for the Proſperity of theſe Churches: For the Fervent Prayers of Rulers keep off diſmal Strokes from a People.</p>
            <p>NEXTLY; TO <hi>the Honourable Members of Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties COUNCIL, and of the Houſe of Repreſentatives</hi>: I would only add, That as You have hitherto, ſo We truſt you will ſtill, hold on and continue in your Pious Endeavours to Promote the Flouriſhing of Religion in this Land, the Suppreſſion of Vice, the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Virtue, the regulating of Diſorders, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Differencies, that Ariſe; that you may be able to ſay, That All that could be done by Men in your Stations, according to the beſt of your Abilities, for the good of this Vine, You have Endeavoured to be found in the Performance thereof: May the Lord God of Hoſts Accept of your Endeavours, and give them Succeſs through His bleſſing upon them!</p>
            <p>THIRDLY; TO <hi>My Reverend Fathers &amp; Brethren in the Miniſtry:</hi> I take leave in all Humility to ſay, That when the Lord of Hoſts intends a Remarkable Viſit to His Vine on Earth, He is wont to Raiſe up Miniſters and fill thoſe that are the Standing Miniſtry in His Churches, in a more than Common Meaſure with His Holy Spirit; ſo that they are carryed forth with more
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001674_0039_0FB4E0EC975AA340"/>
than uſual Courage, Forwardneſs, Diligence &amp; Activity in their Station, for the Reſtoring &amp; Preſerving Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in their ſeveral Charges; they have at ſuch a time peculiar Impreſſions from Above, both as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they are to handle, and as to the manner of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them; Their Faculties &amp; Abilities are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; enlivened, their Miniſterial Gifts &amp; Graces En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, their good Affections and Zeal Encreaſed, and their Watchfulneſs over their Flocks to Promote their Spiritual Good more abundant than before; and a Spirit of Prayer is in ſuch a Day of Viſitation Poured out upon the Miniſtry in a High Degree, and the Bent of their Souls is to Promote Religion, to Convert and Edify Souls, and they are made Reſolute in this Work, to Purſue &amp; Proſecute it, notwithſtanding all the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions &amp; Diſcouragements that attend them therein. And they are forward and ready to Reform what-ever is amiſs in themſelves, that they may become Patterns to the Flocks of Chriſt, Exemplary in Good Works, and as Shining Lights in a dark World. Bleſſed be God who hath Supplyed His Churches with ſuch a Miniſtry hitherto; and let us all Cry to Heaven that ſuch a Miniſtry may be continued unto theſe Churches Succeſſively; and that God will be pleaſed to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their Labours with His bleſſing.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY; TO <hi>Aged Chriſtians</hi>: Give me leave to ſay; You are the Peculiar Friends &amp; Ancient Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the God of Heaven, who are yet left on Earth; Oh! therefore Improve your Intereſt in God to Prevail with Him to Look down, and Come down, and Viſit this His Vine!</p>
            <p>FIFTHLY; TO <hi>the Churches of New-England</hi>: who have been &amp; are yet the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts, who enjoy the Privileges of His Viſible Kingdom the Tokens of His Preſence, the Ordinances of His Houſe; and in that reſpect have from the firſt Founding of our
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001674_0040_0FB4E0EEECCE8908"/>
Churches, and firſt Planting of this Vineyard, enjoy'd a Day of Divine Gracious Viſitation; and altho' we have Experienced great Decays &amp; Declenſions, the loſs of our Firſt Love, and the Withdrawings of Gods Spirit; ſo that the Churches ſometimes Complain of their Barrenneſs, that Few are Converted &amp; New Born to Chriſt, and the Work of Chriſt is ſometimes under Senſible &amp; Viſible Languiſhments; yet we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Bleſs God who gives ſome Revivals of His Work, ſometimes in One Church, and ſometimes in Another; and from thence ſhould be Encouraged to plead with God for a more General Effuſion of His Spirit upon all His Churches, that all Parts of His Vineyard may Flouriſh; even the dark Corners of our Vineyard, that they may have Wiſdom to Know the Day of their Viſitation, and to Accept of the Goſpel Offered to them, and bid Welcome to Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who Offers to come &amp; dwell among them; leſt they ſhould Provoke God to Viſit them in Judgment &amp; Fury.</p>
            <p>LASTLY; TO <hi>Impenitent Sinners and Hypocrites:</hi> Let me ſay, What will you do in the Day of Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For when God gives His Vineyard a Viſit in <hi>Love,</hi> in order to its Fruitfulneſs; Oh! what danger are they in who are as Dry &amp; Withered Branches; they are as Thorns &amp; Bryars in the Vineyard, that hinder the Flouriſhing of Religion in the Places where they Live? They may juſtly expect to be pluckt up by the Roots, Cut down and Caſt into the Fire; unleſs ſpeedy Repentance &amp; Reformation prevent it.</p>
            <p>Having thus after my Weak manner, given you the Explication of the Text, with ſome Application, as by Divine Leave and Help, Let us all as One Repeat it in way of Supplication; <hi>Return, we beſeech Thee, O God of Hoſts: Look down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and behold, and Viſit this Vine.</hi>
