            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>"PRAY what does the author mean?" is the firſt queſtion moſt readers will aſk, and the laſt they are able to anſwer. Therefore in a word I will explain the ſubject and deſign of the following poem.</p>
            <p>The ſubject is the ſtate of the times in regard to literature and religion. The author was prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write by a hope that it might be of uſe to point out, in a clear, conciſe, and ſtriking manner, thoſe general errors, that hinder the advantages of education, and the growth of piety. The ſubject is inexhauſtible; nor is my deſign yet completed. This firſt part deſcribes the principal miſtakes in one courſe of life, and exemplifies the following well-known truth, That to the frequent ſcandal, as well of religion, as learning, a fellow, without any ſhare of genius, or application to ſtudy, may paſs with credit through life, receive the honors of a liberal education, and be admitted to the right hand of fellowſhip among miniſters of the goſpel. That, except in one neighbouring province, ignorance wanders unmoleſted at our colleges, examinations are dwindled to mere form and ceremony, and after four years dozing there, no one is ever refuſed the honors of a degree, on account of dulneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency. That the <hi>meer</hi> knowledge of antient
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013050_0004_0F8FF665397EA0C0"/>
languages, of the abſtruſer parts of mathematics, and the dark reſearches of metaphyſics, is of little advantage in any buſineſs or profeſſion in life. That it would be more beneficial, in every place of public education, to take pains in teaching the elements of oratory, the grammar of the Engliſh tongue, and the elegancies of ſtyle, and compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That in numberleſs inſtances throughout theſe colonies, ſufficient care hath not been taken to exclude the ignorant and irreligious, from the ſacred deſk. That this tenderneſs to the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, tends to debaſe the dignity of the clergy, and to hinder many worthy men from undertaking the office of the miniſtry. And that the virulent controverſies of the preſent day concerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, or in many caſes, meerly ſpeculative opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſavouring ſo highly of vanity and oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and breathing a ſpirit ſo oppoſite to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian benevolence, have done more hurt to the cauſe of religion, than all the malice, the ridicule, and the folly of its enemies.</p>
