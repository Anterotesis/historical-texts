            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>I Doubt not but a Variety of Cenſures will be paſs'd upon this Diſcourſe, and its Author, by thoſe who are diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Work of GOD. Some may ſay, It can be nothing but Pride and Self-Conceit that engages a Youth to appear in Print: Or perhaps they will ſay, <hi>Raw Novice;</hi> or, How knoweth this Man Letters? Others may ſay, I puſh the Matter a little too far in many Things; that my Doctrine is too harſh; and may call it a Piece of Railery. But neither ſo do their Witneſſes agree; for if the Doctrine be too grating and galling to the Generality of Mankind, how then can I expect to raiſe my Reputation, and gratify by Pride, by making it publick? And tho' I do ſo with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Deſire of and Love to thoſe who oppoſe themſelves; yet they will be ready to conclude, that it proceeds from Paſſion and Rage. But let the Reader carefully obſerve the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Arguments are chiefly founded; and ſee whether the ſame Objection might not have been made to our LORD by the Phariſees, when he reaſoned with them upon the ſame Subject. And I ſhould in vain look for a better Reception than he met with, from the ſame Ranks of Perſons, if I deal faithfully with them. Yet I muſt not forbear. It may leaſe GOD to make it uſeful to ſome. I would earneſtly recommend a ſerious Peruſal of that Book, entitled, <hi>The fulfilling of the Scriptures,</hi> to ſuch as call this a <hi>New Scheme.</hi> I am perſwaded, that a new Impreſſion of ſaid Book might be very ſerviceable to the preſent Age: It is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

I need make no other Apology for the Method or Stile of this Sermon, but only, that it is better to be underſtood by all, than admired by any. However 'tis not generally ſo flat as to be nauſeous. I hold it a good Rule, to judge of any Treatiſe from the Notions which the Strain thereof ſeems naturally to convey and inſill; and not from ſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> defenceleſs Expreſſions, or Sentences dropt by the by. But there is a Club lately formed, who call themſelves <hi>Queriſts,</hi> that ſeem pleaſed with the contrary. Method: If they c<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> find on unguarded Word or Sentence, they preſently deduct a Doctrine from it, which the Author's general Strain ca<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> prove was never by him intended. When a figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, in a Book to them diſpleaſing, will bear a fix Witticiſm, or ſatyrical Jeer; if it cannot be call'd <hi>unſound Doctrine,</hi> they will make it <hi>horrid Non-ſenſe;</hi> and ſometimes ſtrive to perplex Things that are plain enough; and ſeem deſirous to perſwade the World, that ſuch forced Meanings are the Author's Principles. Thus they have dealt by Mr. <hi>Whitefield;</hi> and thus they may, perhaps, deal by this Sermon. For many will hate and contradict, what they are unable to confute. But the Reader may ſee, what a perverſe Way of Reaſoning at would be, to affirm that a Kingdom is weak, becauſe there are ſome depopulated Villages in it: Yet after this Manner do the <hi>Queriſts</hi> reaſon. I can truly ſay, that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Taſk to me, thus to cenſure any: But the Neceſſary of it, in the preſent Caſe, is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> That none may be impos'd on to think a Book is conſuted, when ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiens are cenſured in the of reſaid Manner. Either let the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

There is one Thing further I would obſerve to the Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> That Religion has frequently been traduc'd by its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ies, as the procuring Cauſe of common Calamities: And accordingly, ſome of our Oppoſers do invidiouſly ſpeak after this Manner; <q>That the Miſery of an hard Winter has been ſent upon the Land as a juſt Judgment for ſuch a <hi>Deviliſh Work</hi> as has been amongſt us.</q> I mention this the rather, becauſe it is exactly parallel to a Calumny which <hi>Heathen</hi> Oppoſers caſt upon <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the primitive Ages. When a ſore Famine was in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they boldly ſpoke to this Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>the GODS</hi> (for ſuch was their Dichect) <hi>had ſent the Famine as a Puniſhment on account of the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</q> and hence they thought it Juſtice to ſacrifice them, and appeaſe their angry Deities by utterly deſtroying the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Race. By ſuch Suggeſtions the Devil ſirives to imbitter the World againſt the Power of Godlineſs: We are not ignorant of his Devices. <hi>Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, for the Devil is come down with great Wrath, becauſe he knows his Time is ſhort.</hi> No doubt he will ere long, upon ſome ſuch Pretence, perſwade his Servants that it is not fit ſuch Follows as we ſhould live. For thus has he always done. Oh that GOD may convince Oppoſers who reaſon thus! For, if they perſiſt, they will find to their ſad Experience, that GOD will ſend, not only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Calamities, but eternal Woes, on thoſe who continue to deſpiſe his Work: And will <hi>give his Witneſſes Power to ſmite the Earth with all Plagues, as often as they will.</hi> Rev. <hi>xi. 6.</hi> And that not becauſe of the Progreſs of vital Piety, but for the Contempt and Rejection of it: Tho' the ungodly World, as they wreſt the Scriptures, ſo alſo they wreſt the Providences of GOD, to their own Deſtruction. Thus were the <hi>Jews</hi> infatuated to interpret all the Prognoſticks of their final Deſolation, as Tokens of their compleat Victory.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Brethren, If we look back into the Hiſtory of the Church, we may ſee that CHRIST's Coming to it has not been ſo clear and evident, as not to be miſtaken and rejected, even by his own profeſſing People; <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</hi> Joh. I. 11. And becauſe this is the very Hinge whereon our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs turns, every one muſt ſay, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all to ſtudy the ſureſt and cleareſt Light in this Matter. It deſerves the moſt ſolemn and ſerious Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the moſt calm and deliberate Conſideration; the moſt impartial and unprejudiced Examination: Becauſe it is an Affair of eternal Moment. It is no ſleeveleſs Errand I come to you about this Day; what I ſpeak, will be in Remembrance to all Eternity. I come to ſpeak for GOD, who is here preſent as a Witneſs of my Intentions, and a Judge of the Truth of my Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and a Witneſs of the Reception you give it. In the Fear of this Great GOD let us both ſpeak and hear. And do not miſtake me, as if I were ſpeaking for myſelf. No; I aſk not your Silver or Gold; I value not your Applauſe or Diſpraiſe; nor do I deſire from a Party-Zeal, to wed you to an Opinion. I deſire none,

That whoever are hypocritical Pretenders, either Miniſters or People, will, ſooner or later, take Offence, and be a Diſhonour, and a Wound to Religion, as <hi>Demas</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> If you will miſtake me, to your own Loſs it will be, and your Blood will be upon your own Heads; for I have endeavour'd to prevent it.</p>
            <p>THE Occaſion of the Words of my Text you will ſind by looking back to the 22. <hi>v.</hi> where is recorded a great Miracle wrought by our LORD, <hi>viz.</hi> Healing a Perſon poſſeſs'd by the Devil, blind and dumb: So evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was it, that he both ſpake and ſaw; it could be no Deluſion. In <hi>v.</hi> 23. is obſerv'd the Effect of this on the Multitude; they were amazed, and ſaid, <hi>Is not this the Son of</hi> David? They ſeemed well affected, and juſt ready to acknowledge this to be the Work of GOD, and to embrace CHRIST as the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> until the <hi>Phariſees</hi> jumbled them all again. For, no doubt, they concluded, that if it were the <hi>Finger of GOD,</hi> ſurely the pious <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who knew the Law beſt, and expounded it to them, would not oppoſe it. And therefore they turn their Eyes from the Miracle to hear the angr<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>What could any think, but that this Miracle would have put 'em for ever to Silence, and have made even the Devil aſhamed to oppoſe what was ſo evident? Or at leaſt have ſatisfied the People about CHRIST, ſo as they would not give Heed to the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> But, from the following Hiſtory we find it did neither. For when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> perceived the People's Readineſs to embrace JESUS as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> they were afraid of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for they knew their Credit muſt then ſink, perceiving that as many as were his <hi>wa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

And to prepoſſeſs, and imbitter the People effectually againſt him, they call him, <hi>This Fellow.</hi> A bitter Scoff, a ſatyrical ſeer, Mocking, Laughing at the Work of GOD, or its Promoters, calling it <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> or <hi>Fally,</hi> will readily turn carnal Hearts againſt it; and make 'em ſhrink from it as a ſhameful Thing. <hi>This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> ſay they, tho' 'tis true he has caſt out a Devil, yet that will not prove him to be the Son of <hi>David;</hi> for the Devil himſelf can caſt out Devils; do not think the more of him for that; for we can prove from the Scriptures that he is not the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he muſt be an <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Fellow,</hi> in League with the Devil, and to obtain the Applauſe of ignorant People, he gets the Aſſiſtance of the Devil to caſt out Devils. Oh how would this ſhock the People, and raiſe their Averſion againſt CHRIST! to hear their own beloved Teachers painfully warn them againſt him as a <hi>Deviliſh Fellow!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alas! thus it has been with many at this Day, when the Power of GOD has appear'd in the Aſſemblies. They have been put into ſome Amazement, and ſtunn'd about their own Caſe; have entertain'd a favourable Opinion of the Work of GOD, until they have heard other Miniſters ſpeak againſt it; and by their Means, and the Devil's Temptations, joined with the Plague of an unſanctified Heart, have not only been jumbled, and turn'd from it, but have turn'd actually againſt it. They who to-day cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> to-morrow, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd by the Chief Prieſts, cry, <hi>Crucify him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 25. we have our LORD's Reply in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Work from the falſe and malicious Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Oppoſers. And hence his Ambaſſadors are taught to do the ſame Thing; to juſtify his Work, tho' they ſhould thereby caſt Contempt on all the Miniſters on Earth. Why then, will any make it an Objection
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004716_0006_100DCC921CFDB120"/>againſt the Work of GOD, that we ſpeak againſt the Miniſters who oppoſe it; ſince its being his Work, will not only juſtify us in ſo doing, but alſo make it a neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty? Therefore, after CHRIST's Example I ought to vindicate his Work; nay, there is a Wo to me if I do not, tho' it ſhould coſt me my Life; tho' it ſhould be to the everlaſting Diſgrace of all that oppoſe it, whether Miniſters or People, Friends or Enemies, Relations or Strangers. Do not then, miſtake me, as if I ſpoke from any perſonal Prejudice againſt any, while I profeſs the Contray, while I ſhow a better Reaſon for my ſo doing. No; the Perſons of many, who are now Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, are dear to me, and never did me any Harm.</p>
            <p>Our LORD refutes the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> 1. From the <hi>Inconſiſteney of their Argument with human Policy.</hi> For whoever has a Kingdom, and deſires to preſerve it, would certainly take the moſt probable Means for that End: And ſince the Safety of a Kingdom conſiſts in the Unity of its Members, conſequently the Contrary tends to its Overthrow. For if it were divided againſt itſelf, it would deſtroy itſelf by inteſtine Broils, and become an eaſy Prey to a foreign Enemy. Now, as <hi>Satan</hi> has a Kingdom, ſo he has Policy enough to preſerve it, and his Malice againſt GOD and Mankind is not leſſen'd. But if he would forcibly caſt out Devils in Confirmation of a Doctrine directly ſabverſive of his Kingdom, ſurely we muſt think he has forgot his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, has laid aſide his Malice, is divided againſt himſelf, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They ſhall bear Witneſs againſt your Partiality, ſo that you ſhall be condemned: [As we commonly ſay, Such an Evidence <hi>condemn'd</hi> a Man.] But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if what you ſay will not bear Examination, then it will follow, That <hi>I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God;</hi> and if ſo, then it alſo follows, That <hi>the Kingdom of God is come unto you.</hi> The Kingdom of GOD, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Kingdom, the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, the Day of GOD's Power: <hi>The LORD whom ye ſought, is come to his Temple,</hi> and inſtead of Rejoycing thereat, you reject his Kingdom againſt yourſelves; inſtead of praiſing GOD for it, you are grieved that it is come, and wiſh it away again: Wo to you that deſired the Day of the LORD; to what Purpoſe is it for you? You thought it would be clear Day that you could not miſtake it, whereas it is Darkneſs, and not Light. It come not with Obſervation: Yet it is come <hi>unto you;</hi> but that is all, the Kingdom of GOD is not <hi>within you.</hi> It is come <hi>into</hi> the Hearts of others, but is only come <hi>unto</hi> your Ears. However, what you ſo long look'd for, and prayed for, is come; if ye will receive it, receive it.</p>
            <p>Obſerve. The Argument by which our LORD proves that the Kingdom of GOD is come, is his <hi>Caſting out Devils.</hi> And having proven, that this could not be the <hi>Work of the Devil,</hi> he infers, that it muſt be the <hi>Work of GOD's Spirit.</hi> And hence coucludes, That the Kingdom of GOD is come to them.

O Sinner! look at thy Picture, and ſee what a deformed Creature thou art; but withal conſider, that the half is not told. Now, to whom ſhall we attribute theſe Works? Would not any of you ſay, that GOD never implanted ſuch curſed Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in you as theſe? and would you not rather aſcribe them to the Devil, than to yourſelves? And if theſe Things be in you, what is the Conſequence? Surely <hi>his Servants ye are, to whom ye yield Obedience.</hi> If you are angry, and hate me for telling you ſo, do you not prove what I ſay? For, he that <hi>hateth</hi> another Man, is a <hi>Murderer,</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 15. And is not Murder a Work of the Devil, who was a Murderer from the Beginning?

            <p>But tho' you have not been actually guilty of <hi>all</hi> theſe; yet of <hi>as many</hi> of them, as will prove all that I ſay.

            <p>Now, ſince theſe are the Evidences of a Soul poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Satan;</hi> the contrary Characters muſt be engraven on it by the Spirit of GOD, when <hi>Satan</hi> is caſt out.</p>
            <p>And hence we may the more eaſily know, in The <hi>Second</hi> Place, <hi>By what Marks it will be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able when a Soul is freed from the Poſſeſſion of</hi> Satan.</p>

            <p>And 1.

By this Means they perceive theſe Things to be Sins, which they little thought of before. They ſee they have never given the Law its Due in any one Inſtance of Life, in Thought, Word, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The Ignorance, Pride, Selfiſhneſs, Hypocriſy, Slothfulneſs, &amp;c. that were mix'd with their beſt Doings, are opened to their View, and they behold a whole World of Iniquity. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſee the heinous Nature of Sin, how hateful, how contrary to the Nature of GOD. Alſo the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequences of it; the infinite Power and Juſtice of GOD engaged againſt 'em for it; the burning Hell they are expoſed to on account of it; the glorious Heaven they loſe by it; and with all their own utter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to expiate the Guilt of the ſmalleſt Sin. Their natural Stupidity and Careleſneſs is alſo remov'd; they are exceedingly diſtreſſed, and can be no longer eaſy; nothing will quiet them but an aſſured Token of GOD's Favour and pardoning Grace. Thus he convinces of Sin; and they muſt needs know what they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of.</p>
            <p>Then the Holy Ghoſt opens up the Scriptures, and reveals to their fainting Souls the Scripture-Method of Falvation by the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Further, their native Pride is broken down; their hard Hearts are melted, and their obſtinate Wills made pliable, and cheerfully conſent to take CHRIST for <hi>Wiſdom, Rightrouſneſs, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption.</hi> Then he is lovely above all Things, the Chiefeſt among ten Thousand in their Eſteem.

2. This will be diſcernable to other Chriſtians, and that by Analogy, or Compariſon of Experiences: For, tho' the Work of GOD may differ in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Beginning; yet in Subſtance it is the ſame; and when it is wrought, is juſt the ſame in all; there is but one Faith, and one Spirit. Real Chriſtians have all the ſame Deſires, the ſame Fears, the ſame paſſionate Breathings of Love to GOD and CHRIST; the ſame Purſuits after Holineſs, and Mortification of Sin; the ſame Complaints, the ſame Joys and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; the ſame Supports and Encouragements: Cat down and raiſed up on the very ſame Accounts; have the ſame Savour, Taſte, and Reliſh of divine Things. There is an Oneneſs among them, a Fellow-Feeling of one another's Grievances, a Bearing of one another's Burdens. This endears them to one another above the deareſt graceleſs Relations. Now, 'tis from this Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Experiences that their Knowledge of one another proceeds. When they tell each other what GOD has done for their Souls, they underſtand one another ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the one ſees himſelf in the other's Heart when it is told him. As a Traveller (making Allowance for Similitudes) will know that another has travell'd the ſame Road, by his exact Deſcription of particular Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and can diſtinguiſh between him, and another that has only read the <hi>Geographical</hi> Deſcription of it, by the different Remarks they will unavoidably make. And what tho' ſome Hypocrites may be taken for Chriſtians, and ſome weak Chriſtians miſtaken too; Yet <hi>particular Exceptions do not break general Rules:</hi> The Body of Hypocrites and Chriſtians will not be for eaſily miſtaken by experienced, judicious Chriſtians, as carnal People imagine. For tho' many graceleſs Perſons may learn to talk of Chriſtian Experiences, yet they will generally bewray their Ignorance in ſome thing or other, that every real Chriſtian knows, when they come cloſe to the Point. But ſtill they will want that

And hence the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 19, 30. ſays, <hi>I will know, not the Words</hi> of ſuch an one, <hi>but the Power; for the Kingdom of GOD</hi> conſiſts <hi>not in Word, but in Power.</hi> So every real Chriſtian can diſtinguiſh between <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> or elſe the ſame Apoſtle would have in vain directed them to <hi>turn away from ſuch as had the</hi> FORM, <hi>but deny'd the</hi> POWER <hi>of Gadlineſs.</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 5. Now, if in expreſs Words the Power were deny'd, the Form would be wanting; and therefore it muſt be ſuch as have the Form, and in Words confeſs that Power of Godlineſs, from whom Chriſtians muſt turn away, only becauſe they <hi>have not</hi> this Power. But how could this be done, unleſs they could diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Form,</hi> and the <hi>Power?</hi> But this they can do; for, whoever has had the Spirit and Preſence of GOD, cannot but know when he wants it, and when he has it; and knowing what Emotions of Heart he has in ſuch and ſuch Frames, he will the more readily diſcern, when another ſpeaks, prays, or preaches with the ſame Reliſh of divine Things; as he that has felt the Paſſions of Anger, Love, or Joy, will the more readily obſerve the Symptoms of them in another. And a ſpiritual Object is as diſcernable to a ſpiritual Man, as a natural Object to a natural Man. But the natural Man, who is ſpiritually blind, cannot poſſibly perceive the ſpiritual Object, cannot ſavour the Things of GOD. But a Chriſtian cannot but know, when another ſpeaks ſkilfully, feelingly, and diſtinctly of his own Caſe; and alſo when it is ignorantly, inſipidly, indiſtinctly, and powerleſly ſpoken of. And hence the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The ſpiritual Man judgeth all Things, yet he himſelf is judged of no Man.</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 15. That is, He can diſcern ſpiritual Things, and is beſt able to judge of ſpiritual Perſons; yet he is not to be judged, as to his Experiences, by a natural Man; becauſe the natural Man is not a fit or proper Judge of ſpiritual Things, ſeeing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004716_0011_100DCC9AE67CDFF0"/>them not. —Now, theſe internal Evidences of a Work of GOD can never be repreſented to the Underſtandings of ſuch who have never felt them, any more than Light or Colours to one born blind; he wants Proof that there is Light, and aſks how we can know it; we can only tell him that the Light comes attended with its own Evidence, and by the Light we ſee Light. Juſt ſo it is here: Carnal Perſons have a great many Exceptions againſt this Doctrine; they wonder how we can pretend to judge of the State of others; and will tell us, <hi>We take GOD's Prerogative upon us to judge the Hearts of Men;</hi> whereas we only judge them from what appears to us, in ſo far as we know of their Manner of Life, and Chriſtian Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And hence it is, that whenever GOD opens the Eyes of any, they ſoon ſee what Company to join with. Hence likewiſe it is, that Chriſtians cannot but judge theſe to be graceleſs, who oppoſe, diſlike, or ſhow Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of thoſe Things, which they know to be the Things of the Spirit of GOD. When they tell them ſo, they call it Hatred and Rage; but this Doctrine proves that it is not.—Hence we may alſo infer, That theſe Perſons, who have ſufficient Opportunity of knowing the Lives of Profeſſors, and yet ſee no Difference among ſuch as ſeem to have an equal Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Morality, and Head-Knowledge; I ſay, this Doctrine will prove theſe to be blind themſelves.

Nay, according to their own Principles they are obliged to believe it: For their profeſſed Principle is, to judge every Man a Chriſtian who is Moral and Orthodox: And tho' they be not competent Judges of Chriſtian Experiences, from whence they might have a <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Work of GOD; yet there are other Marks that are level to their Capacities, from whence they may have a <hi>Probability.</hi> As, when he that was formerly a Drunkard, lives a ſober Life: When a vain, light, and wanton Perſon becomes grave, and ſedate: When the Blaſphemer becomes a Praiſer of GOD: When Laughter is turn'd into Mourning; and carnal Joy into Heavineſs; and that profeſſedly on account of their Souls Condition: When the Ignorant are fill'd with Knowledge in divine Things, and the Tongue that was dumb in the Things of GOD, ſpeaks the Language of <hi>Canaan:</hi> When the Erroneous are become Orthodox in fundamental Points: When ſuch as never minded any Religion, do make Religion their only Baſineſs: When buſy <hi>Marthas,</hi> and covetous Worldlings, do neglect their worldly Concerns to ſeek after GOD's Ordinances. Now, theſe Things, and ſuch like, are diſcernable to thoſe who are graceleſs; and according to their own Rules they ought to judge that the Devil is caſt out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It will be eaſy from hence, to <hi>prove the Doctrine,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is a ſure and infallible Proof of a gracious Work of GOD's Spirit, when the Devil is caſt out by Means of true Goſpel-Doctrine.</hi>

For, if the Devil poſſeſſes every carnal Heart, in the Manner as has been proven; then he muſt caſt be out by One ſtronger than himſelf; but Man is not ſtronger.

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004716_0013_100DCC9EC2518D38"/>there was Midnight-Darkneſs, and little Faith to be found on the Earth. Thus it was when he came in the Fleſh; when he ſent St. <hi>Athanaſius, Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and at the Reformation of <hi>Scotland.</hi> We find the graceleſs <hi>Jews</hi> prayed for the Day of the LORD, in <hi>Amos</hi> 5.18. And hence were our Pulpits filled with ſeemingly devout Prayers for a Revival of Religion, and Confeſſions of its decayed State. And what had we lately but a dry Formality? Did not all in general ſeem to be at Eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> and in much Peace about the State of their Souls?

And this is a neceſſary Conſequent of the State of the Church: For ſince he comes in a dark Time, we may eaſily conclude, that the Manner thereof is unobſerv'd at firſt.

And as a Conſequence of this, the Miniſters by whom He works, have always at firſt been few: And thus the Work appears the more eminently to be his own, the leſs probable that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments appear. Thus it was when he came in the

               </gap> according to the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fathers; for we find they were ſurprized, in <hi>Luke</hi> iv. when he began to expound the Scriptures, being neither a Scribe nor Phariſee. And the People not being uſed with ſuch cloſe and particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could not bear his new Methods. Paſſing by the eſtabliſhed, but proud, bigotted, gainſaying Clergy, he chuſes Twelve unlearned, unpoliſhed Men, moſt of them Fiſhers; and gave them a Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel, without conſulting the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> about ſuch <hi>unprecedented</hi> Proceedings. Thus was his Coming dark, and croſs to them. — Now, in our Days the Parallel is plain, for ſuppoſing the preſent Commotion to be the Work of GOD: Every one knows how croſs it is to the Inclinations of the Clergy. Surely, our Oppoſers will confeſs, they neither did, nor do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Religion to be reviv'd in ſuch a Manner; while there are ſo many Things, in their Opinion, wrong. Surely, it is a dark Day to them, and no Light in it; many of them know not what to make of it, by their own Confeſſion. We all know how few its Propagators are; and they ſay, that moſt of us are unlearned: But do they not, by the by, bewray themſelves herein? For, if unlearned, they muſt have the leſs Rhetorick and Oratory; and conſequently the leſs able to bring ſuch Things to paſs. If it were the Work of Man, a ſuperior Power of Man would overthrow it. — In a Word, the Parallel holds in every Thing, only our Manner of Licenſing is not <hi>unprecedented.</hi>

And as a Conſequence of his being diſown'd by theſe, he was chiefly followed by what we call the <hi>Mob,</hi> the <hi>Rabble,</hi> the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>meaner Sort.</hi> And being diſown'd by the ſelf-righteous Moraliſts, was follow'd by the openly Profane, the <hi>Publicans,</hi> and <hi>Harlots:</hi> For he is ſtill ſet for the <hi>Riſe and Fall of many in</hi> Iſrael; and many who thought themſelves <hi>firſi,</hi> and were eſteemed ſo by others in the Dark, did ſhow themſelves to be <hi>laſt.</hi> Thus it was when he came in the Fleſh; rejected by the Clergy ſo generally, and by the Noble and Wiſe, that it was ſaid, <hi>Have any of the Rulers or Phariſees believed on him?</hi> No: <hi>But this People who know not the Law, are accurſed.</hi> — Juſt ſo is he treated by the ſame Ranks of Perſons at this Day. May I not aſk, Have any of the Rulers, have any of the Miniſters embraced the preſent Work? Do they not rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs and imbitter the carnal People againſt it? And many who ſeemed <hi>firſt</hi> in Religion, are they not become the very <hi>laſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt, firſt?</hi> For our Oppoſers confeſs of their own Accord, That <hi>it is only the ignorant Rabble that embrace it; many of which never minded any Religion, and ſo do not know the Law.</hi> Sure they who know the Law, might know, that it is a good Proof of a Day of GOD's Power when <hi>the Poor have the Goſpel preach'd to them,</hi> and do receive it. <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 5. Might they not know that our LORD uſed this Argument? And alſo that <hi>GOD chuſes fooliſh Things to confound the Wiſe?</hi> But they muſt confeſs, that tho' there be not <hi>many,</hi> yet, Glory to GOD! there are <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Mighty,</hi> and <hi>Noble,</hi> on our Side.</p>

               <hi>new Methods;</hi> and were then caught in the Goſpel-net: <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal Life, believed.</hi> Thus in <hi>Joh.</hi> vii. 11, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> the Phariſees ſpeaking againſt him, put him in the People's Minds, who began to talk of him. His Audiences were often deeply affected; and frequently divided between him and the Clergy: And hence we ſo often read, that <hi>there was a Diviſion among the People.</hi> He never came to ſend Peace on the Earth, but a <hi>Sword,</hi> and <hi>Diviſion.</hi> Luk. xii. 51—58. — Juſt ſo it has been in our Day. Many can ſay by Experience, that their Attention and Curioſity was raiſed by Means of the Contradictions of their Miniſters. And hence we have ſeen unuſual Numbers going to hear the Word like thirſty Flocks: And heard a great Mourning, like the Mourning of <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Megid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Alſo there has been a Diviſion among the People; ſome praiſing GOD for what their Eyes have ſeen, and their Ears heard, and their Souls felt; others going way mocking, contradicting, blaſpheming.</p>
            <p>Another Effect was, the Breaking down of Bigotry; partly as a native Conſequence of the Attention of all Parties being raiſed to come and hear; and partly by the Example and Directions of CHRIST, and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Thus he freely converſed, eat, and drank, with different oppoſite Parties, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans, Publicans</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and juſtified his ſo doing from the Need there was of it, that all might come freely, and reap Benefit. And the Apoſtle, in <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 15, 16. adviſes real Chriſtians who hold the Foundation, to walk together in ſuch Things as they are agreed in; for in Things wherein they are diſagreed, they cannot. — And juſt ſo our Oppoſers confeſs it to be now, while they accuſe us for holding Communion with different Societies, and would inſinuate, that we do ſo from ſome politick Deſign: Indeed there is this Policy in it, To gain ſome by any Means, and make a Party for JESUS CHRIST.</p>

5. The Attempts; As a Conſequence of the People's following CHRIST or his Ambaſſadors, and diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clergy, the latter always attempted to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the <hi>new Scheme:</hi> Were (1) unwearied in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchievous Devices againſt him; would tell the People, they had an Impoſture, and were deluded, and deceiv'd; followed him for no other End but to find ſomething to cavil at; wreſted both his Words and Actions to find Matter of Accuſation. (2) They were unſatisfied; for after they had been buſy all along, they ſay, <hi>What do we?</hi> q. d. We have been too ſlack and cowardly; come, let us beſtir ourſelves, and not ſuffer all to be overturn'd; we have prevail'd nothing as yet. (3) Their Attempts were ſtill unſucceſsful, and always tended to promote the Cauſe they were ſet to baffle: Tho' they are ſtill buſy, yet are conſcious they prevail nothing. Thus when the Scribes and Phariſees ſought Chriſt at the Feaſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> vii. 11. they put him in the People's Minds, who ſtraight began to talk of him, ſome good, ſome evil: When the Phariſees perceived this, they ſorbid them to ſpeak of him either good or ill; for ſo much is imply'd in theſe Words, <hi>Howbeit no Man ſpoke openly of him, for Fear of the Jews.</hi> They hoped that the Thoughts of Chriſt would wear out of the People's Minds thro' Time. — Juſt thus do the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers now to a tittle It can be made appear, how Companies of Miniſters and People, have met together in a private Manner, to conſult how they might ſuppreſs the <hi>new Scheme,</hi> and what they could ſay againſt it: And indeed, their Cavils, and the Spirit with which they are urged, do plainly ſhow, that they rather deſire Matter of Accuſation, than that they really have it. How do they twiſt and wreſt both the Words and Actions, and magniſy the Blemiſhes, of thoſe who ſtand up for the Work of GOD?

And now ſome of them beg for Peace, and would have us be ſilent about theſe controverted Things, that they may wear out of Mind. Their aſking Peace and Quietneſs has an Aſpect pleaſing to the Fleſh, and looks plauſible: But GOD forbid that we ſhould ceaſe to proclaim his wondrous Deeds, to humour the Enemies of his Work! No; let us tell them abroad more loudly, tho' it gall the Conſciences, and torment the Minds of all the Oppoſers on Earth. <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 10.

                  <item>(1) The Phariſees objected Diſorder to our LORD, and his Apoſtles. How often are they accuſed of not walking according to the Traditions of the Elders? And our Oppoſers ſay, This cannot be the Work of GOD, becauſe not according to their Order: But they have not proven, that GOD is oblig'd to work by their Rules.</item>
                  <item>(2) When our LORD and his Apoſtles pleaded for free Grace, they were called Enemies to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Law; and he was often call'd a Blaſphemer. So the preſent Oppoſers of GOD's Work, accuſe ſome of us of ſpeaking againſt the Law, and call us <hi>Antinomians;</hi> and tug and ſtrive, by wreſting both the Words and Intentions of ſome of our Brethren, to prove them Blaſphemy. <note n="†" place="bottom">See the <hi>Quariſts p.</hi> 9.</note>

(3) It was objected to our LORD and his Apoſtles, that they held Communion with Perſons of different Societies. Hence they ſtumbled, becauſe he kept Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Publicans,</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi> And thought, had he been ſo much as a common Prophet, he would have known better what Company to keep; and hence concluded he could not poſſibly be the CHRIST. — So our Oppoſers ſay, that we bring the Church into Confuſion by a mixt Communion of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſwaſions; who yet hold the Foundation. And further they aſk, Why theſe who were of no religious Society, are fond of this <hi>new Scheme?</hi>

                  <item>(4) It is objected to us, that this Commotion rends the Church; divides Congregations and Families; ſets People at Variance; makes them harſh and cenſorious. So we hear <hi>Tertullus, Act.</hi> xxiv. 5. accuſe <hi>Paul</hi> as a <hi>peſtilent Fellow, a Mover of Sedition, a Profaner of the Temple.</hi> The Phariſees, <hi>Joh.</hi> ix. 44. aſk in a ſour Manner, <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> Doſt thou judge us to be blind too ſo raſhly? And <hi>Elijah,</hi> becauſe a Son of Thunder, tho' he was the moſt peaceable, yet he muſt needs be call'd a <hi>Troubler of Iſrael,</hi> in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xviii. 17. And, in a Word, both they and we are Turners of the World upſide down, Subverters of Peace and Church-Government, and the like. Read <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 51—57. <hi>Suppoſe ye,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>that I am come to ſend Peace on the Earth? I came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword — to divide a Family againſt itſelf. — Why cannot</hi> our preſent Oppoſers <hi>diſcern the S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>(5) The preſent Oppoſers ſay, they do not quarrel with the Work of GOD; no, far be it from them;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004716_0016_100DCCA50249FFA0"/>but only with theſe Diſorders. So, in <hi>Joh.</hi> x. 33. the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, <hi>For a good Work we ſtone thee not:</hi> No; far be it from us, do not ſo miſtake us, we would be ready to encourage every Thing that has the Appearance of Piety; 'tis not for thy good Works, <hi>but for Blaſphemy.</hi> But his good Works, inſtead of procuring their Favour, did raiſe their Envy: And though they would not be ſo barefaced before the People; yet they could willingly have embrued their Hands in his Blood, for no other Crime but his good Works; becauſe he ſo far out-ſhined them. But on account of the People, they muſt firſt find ſome plauſible Pretence againſt him. They took no Notice, or laid no Streſs on his Miracles; were never ſatisfied with all the Evidences he gave them; their common Queſtion was, <hi>What Sign ſheweſt thou?</hi> Tho' they ſeemed reſolved not to be ſatisfied with any Sign. They ſtill found Exceptions againſt all his Works; and when they could not deny the Matter of Fact, they aſcribed it to the Devil ſometimes. How often do they aſk the Man born blind, how he receiv'd his Sight? and would willingly have deny'd that he was blind: How earneſt were they to find ſome Flaw or other? And when they could find none, they put a religious Face upon their Envy; exhort the Man to give GOD the Glory, but not to mind JESUS; for they were ſure he was a Sinner. — Juſt ſo it is now a-days to a tittle. Our Oppoſers have no End of aſking for Evidences; without taking Notice of the Power of GOD, that has appear'd in the Aſſemblies, or on the Lives of Men: They ſtill muſter up Objections, and harp only on what they call Diſorder. They gather a great many of their Exceptions together, and then aſk, if theſe Irregularities be the Work of GOD. Without obſerving the deep Concern that Souls ſeem to be under, they only aſk about the <hi>Fits</hi> and <hi>Convulſions</hi> that their Sorrow throws them into; and which they would be ready to allow for, in worldly Reſpects, as the ſudden
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004716_0017_100D8796AB0DF518"/>News of the Death of Friends, or the like. And if ſome unexceptionable Evidence of the Power of GOD be alledged againſt them; they ſtrive to evade its Force ſome Way or other, by ſaying, That poſſibly GOD may bring Good out of Evil; but yet do ſpeak againſt the Whole, as a Deviliſh Work. They ſeem glad to get any Objection againſt it; not willing that it ſhould be the Work of GOD. They fix their Eyes only on the Failures and Blemiſhes of thoſe who defend it, and magnify Mole-hills into Mountains: And if they can get nothing that has the Appearance of a Fault, they are induſtrious to forge, and ſpread ſlanderous Reports, and falſe Inſinuations; and ſeem as fond of them, as if they had got a Victory. In a Word; they appear as if their greateſt Deſire was, to blind their own Eyes, and ſtop their own Ears, that hearing they might not underſtand, and ſeeing they might not perceive, leſt they ſhould be <hi>Converts</hi> too, as they call us by way of Ridicule.</item>

            <p>Thus the Parallel runs clear and undeniable. The ſame Attempts and Objections, from the ſame Ranks of Perſons, do prove the ſame Diſpoſitions to be in graceleſs Perſons now, as formerly; the ſame Blindneſs and Enmity. And why ſhould it be thought ſtrange that CHRIST'S pretended Ambaſſadors are his bittereſt Enemies, ſeeing it has been always ſo? The LORD always reform'd his Church contrary to their Deſires. There is the ſame kind of Oppoſition, and Oppoſers too, in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> at preſent, as here in <hi>America.</hi> And had I Time, I could ſhow that all Things, in every Period of the Church, anſwer and agree with this, as Face anſwers Face in a Glaſs. But the Coming of CHRIST in the Fleſh, will be found to be analogous to his Coming at other Times; and the Parallel from that, is moſt level to the Capacity of every one; and trac'd with leſs Difficulty, and more Certainty by common People: And therefore I have chieſly compar'd that Period, and our preſent Day.</p>

But laſtly, if <hi>Satan</hi> be caſt out, <hi>It</hi> will be inſtead of all Proofs, that the Kingdom of GOD is come unto us. For, ſays CHRIST, <hi>if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of GOD, then the Kingdom of GOD is come unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſhown under the <hi>Second</hi> Head, how the People of GOD may know this to be true of themſelves; and how they are ſatisfied of each other, by Analogy of Experiences; and accordingly they believe, and are ſure, that the Kingdom of GOD is come. They know the Voice of their Beloved. And therefore I ſhall only inſiſt on ſuch Evidences now, as can appear to the World.</p>
            <p>And here it is evident, that a peaceful World has been rouſed with a Witneſs about the State of their Souls. <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 21, 22. Theſe who were ignorant, can ſpeak ſkilfully about religious Things; and even the Graceleſs are increaſed in Knowledge: Which is a Proof, That <hi>Light is come into the World.</hi> Some <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> are become ſound in the Faith; and Drunkards have become ſober; Swearers and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers drop their Oaths, and ſpeak reverently of GOD: Vain Perſons who minded no Religion, but frequented Taverns, Plays and Frolicks, paſſing their Time in Filthineſs, fooliſh Talking and Jeſting, or ſinging paltry Songs; do now frequent Chriſtian Societies, ſeek Chriſtian Converſation, and talk of Soul-Concerns; and chuſe to expreſs their Mirth in Pflams, and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs. They who were too ſprightly to be devout, and eſteemed it an unmanly Thing to ſhed Tears for their Souls State; have mourned as for an only Son, and ſeemed to be in Bitternerneſs as for a Firſt-born. <hi>Zech.</hi> xii. 10. Worldlings have quit their Labour, and earneſtly followed the Ordinances of GOD. Pious and Soul-ſearching Books, that ſormerly lay neglected, are now in great Requeſt. And, which is yet more, Perſons who only came to mock at the Lamentations of others, have been convinced ere they
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004716_0018_100DCCA984413008"/>went away, and by free Grace profelyted to ſuch Ways as they formerly deſpiſed. Miniſters have been ſtrengthned, and ſtirr'd up, to preach every Day for ſome Time conſiderable. — And that all this is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon the Preaching of true Goſpel-Doctrine, the printed Writings of thoſe Miniſters, by whom the Work is carried on, will prove. Their Doctrine is plainly ſubverſive of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Kingdom; tho' they be ſlanderouſly reported of, by ſome, who ſtrive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Things that are plain, and make an unguarded Expreſſion to be unſound Doctrine: Yet, if their Doctrines be compared with thoſe of our pious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, it will be evident, that they harmonize in the ſame Truths in experimental Things; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt think, That <hi>the Hearts of the Children are turn'd to the Fathers,</hi> from whom they had degenerated.</p>
            <p>Now, let it be obſerv'd, that I do not lay down theſe outward Evidences as infallible Marks of true Grace: Let none judge himſelf Gracious from them alone, without the internal Evidences formerly deſcribed. I only urge theſe, becauſe graceleſs Perſons cannot judge from the other Marks; and becauſe Oppoſers of God's Work, are obliged, by their own profeſſed Principles, to acknowledge, That <hi>Satan is caſt out,</hi> when ſuch Things appear. — And were it neceſſary, I could produce many Inſtances of ſuch Reformations as I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>And how ſhall any now account for their Oppoſition to this Work? I deſire to ſpeak to ſuch with Bowels of Love.</p>
            <p>My Dear Fellow-Mortals! Let me a while expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Matter with you. Why do you not act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your own Principles?

Why do you not conſiſt with yourſelves? Why do you ſay the one is of GOD, and the other of the Devil, who is a zealous Pleader for the Work of GOD? Do you not ſee, that GOD can condemn you by your own Rules? One Man diligently attended GOD's Ordinances all his Days, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed out of the Law, and accuſtomed to approve of the Things that are more excellent; and you would allow he does ſo by the Power of GOD, becauſe he is an orderly Man, and is very orthodox in Mint, and Aniſe, and Cumin. Another that was heedleſs of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a Publican, Harlot, Sabbath-breaker, Erroneous, does now take much Pains to wait upon GOD, and begins to obſerve the divine Law; and yet you ſay, it is the Work of Men or Devils: Therefore, theſe very Perſons, whom you approve of, ſhall be your Judges, and witneſs againſt your glaring Partiality. Theſe deſpiſed Publicans and Harlots, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before you, and ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when you, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Children of the Kingdom, ſhall be thruſt down to utter Darkneſs, except you repent.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>plainly the unpardonable Sin. And why will you accuſe me for judging thus, until you prove what I contend for to be the Work of the Devil? Why do you make that Practice an Argument that it is not the Work of GOD, ſince its being his Work will juſtiſy the Practice? It I ſhould judge Oppoſers of GOD's Work to be gracious, as well as thoſe who plead for it; then I would, like you, be inconſiſtent with myſelf; then I would make it, not the Work of GOD, but ſome indifferent Thing, where Men might be good, and hold either Side. — It is no new Thing to hear Zeal for GOD, and Oppoſition to the Enemies of his Cauſe, miſtaken for Paſſion and Rage, by ſuch as never have felt the Love of GOD in their Hearts. And if ſome Chriſtians, when provok'd by your blaſphemous Railery, do ſpeak paſſionately with Indignation, I think ſomething of it is very juſtifiable, when I conſider <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words to <hi>Elymas,</hi> Act. xiii. 10. <hi>O ſuil of all Subtilty, and all Michief, thou Child of the Devil, thou Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right Ways of the LORD?</hi> But, no doubt, their Zeal may ſometimes be as raſh as <hi>Peter</hi>'s, when he cut off <hi>Malchus</hi>'s Ear: The LORD does not approve of this, neither do we: Young Chriſtians have often too much Wild-Fire, mixt with true Zeal. And if ever your Hearts had been warm with Zeal for GOD and his Cauſe, if you had ever had a <hi>Firſt Love;</hi> (Rev. ii. 4.) then you would know it to be as I ſay; and would be ready to make Allowances, eſpecially in ſome warm Tempers. — But I ſuppoſe you would have them be perfect, all Spirit, and no Fleſh. — They themſelves long to be ſo. But if they were, it would not ſcreen them from your Malice, more than our LORD from the Phariſees. <hi>Malchus</hi> had as good an Argument, as you, to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> had no Grace; that CHRIST and all his Followers were quarrelſome and ſeditious: And it is probable he did improve it to the ſame End
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004716_0020_100DCCAE14BAD2E0"/>as you do other Things; aſking, if that was any Fruit of the Spirit to cut off his Ear? No doubt he might ſay, <q>If that be Converſion, may God keep me from it; theſe that pretend moſt of all to it, are the moſt bitter and outragious; one of the Gang cut off my Ear, from a religious Pretence; there's none of them better; they are all embarqued in the ſame Ship, and have the ſame ſour and harſh Turn of Mind.</q> Juſt thus you blind yourſelves by poring only on the black Spots of GOD's People, and ſtrive to make them more ſo: Where then is your boaſted Charity? Do you not ſee that all your Cavils and Objections prove you to be ignorant of the Things of GOD, and Enemies to his Work? Do you not ſee that your very Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prove it to be his Work, and always will? For thus has GOD always overſhot the Devil in his own Bow. Perhaps ſome of you will ſay, We are not againſt it. But do you not ſhow, that you are not for it? Are you not more cordial with its Enemies, than its Friends? Are you not ſtill making Exceptions againſt it? I look upon all Neuters, as Enemies, in Affairs of Religion. Away with your carnal Prudence! And either follow <hi>GOD</hi> or <hi>Baal. He that is not</hi> actually <hi>with us, is againſt us; and he that gathereth not with us, ſeattereth abread.</hi> Mat. xii. 30.</p>
            <p>I know there will be no End of your Objections, and calling for Evidences, until GOD open your Eyes, if ever he do it. The Queſtion is likely ſtill to be, <hi>What Sign, what Proof do you give us, ſeeing ſo many Things are wrong?</hi> I will anſwer, as our LORD did on the ſame Occaſion, <hi>An evil and adulterous Generation ſecketh after a Sign, and there ſhall no other Sign be given to it, but</hi> only the <hi>POWER of GOD's WORD</hi> on the Hearts and Lives of Mankind. This is the laſt, and greateſt Evidence; and if you reject this, you reject the laſt Means of your Conviction.</p>

Indeed I am afraid, leſt I hear, to my Sorrow, that ſome of you die in a <hi>fearful Looking for of Wrath and fury Indignation.</hi> But whoever of you do theſe Things ignorantly, as <hi>Paul,</hi> who verily thought he ſhould do many Things againſt <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> there is yet Hope concerning you. I beſeech you then, ſear and tremble to proceed further: Pray to GOD, if, perhaps, the Thoughts of your Hearts, and Words of your Mouths, may be forgiven you. And do not reſiſt theſe Evidences that are as clear as you are capable of, until GOD give you to know the Things of his Spirit. If you will reſiſt, I tell you in the Fear of GOD, it will be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> in the Day of Judgment, than for you: <hi>Ninevels</hi> together with them, ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt you, and ſhall condemn you; becauſe you have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of greater Light than they. And tho' you be exalted nearer Heaven, yet wo to you, for with a more dreadful Vengeance will you be plunged deeper into Hell. And every Word you ſpeak againſt the Work of GOD, you ſhall give Account thereof in the Day of Judgment. Your falſe and malicious Slanders againſt GOD's Servants, will be ſet in Order before the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hled Univerſe. And how will you then make good your Party againſt GOD? Neither will the Miniſters,

How will they eaſe your afrighted Souls, your diſturbed, awakened Conſciences, on a Dying-Bed? Tempters never prove good Comforters. No, you ſhall fall in the Day, and the falſe Prophet ſhall fall with you in the Night, and GOD will deſtroy, you both; you ſhall go down with them into the Sides of the Pit, and make your Beds in Hell; both ſhall fall together into the burning Gulf of eternal Wo, unleſs you repent. And then you will curſe them to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and yourſelves too. Beware then of ravening Wolves, tho' they come unto you in Sheeps Clothing: They come for no other End but for to ſteal, and to kill, and to deſtroy the Sheep.

And all that is remarkable of ſome ſuch, is, that they have been remarkably worſe than ever before. And even ſo it is like to be with many in this wicked Generation.
