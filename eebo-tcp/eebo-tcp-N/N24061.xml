            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> ADDRESS you with a mixture of pleaſure and embarraſſment. It is impoſſible not to participate the general ſatisfaction which this anniverſary affords; though a want of ſufficient leiſure and opportunity has, I fear, prevented my coming forward prepared to ſatisfy the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this reſpectable auditory, or juſtify the partiality of thoſe who placed me here. But the fields of Science have lately been ſo thoroughly explored, and the choiceſt productions ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully collected, that to expect a new and rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt at this time, would be like looking for the bounties of Nature in fields where the harveſt had been gathered.</p>
            <p>It is a cuſtom with the Society which is here aſſembled, on the occaſion of this anniverſary, to delegate one or more of its members to deliver a public harangue. In diſcharging this duty, the performer has the choice of his theme. It muſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031824_0004_0FEEBF3DF30CE0D0"/>be proper on ſuch an occaſion, when friends and ſtrangers out of the Society oblige us with their attendance, to unfold and diſcuſs the motives which led to this eſtabliſhment; the principles which have governed the members of it, in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting the deſign; and the conſequences that may probably reſult therefrom. As this has never yet been done, ſo far as my knowledge extends, with your permiſſion I will attempt it.</p>
            <p>The form of this Inſtitution originated in a Siſter Seminary to the South, and from thence was <hi>mediately</hi> communicated to this. It was not adopted here with an idea of attaching to its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſuperior privileges, or arrogating to them an invidious diſtinction. No expectations were formed that the connexion would afford a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from any of the duties of ſcholaſtic life, or independently inſure ſucceſs in the world. But it was well underſtood that reſpectability here, and eminence and good fortune through life, were excluſively attached to ability, informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and merit. To improve and increaſe theſe important qualities, give complete effect to the endeavors of our inſtructors, more fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the purpoſes for which we were placed here by our friends, as well as to cultivate harmony and eſtabliſh a durable friendſhip, the plan of the Inſtitution was approved and carried into effect. Experience has confirmed theory; and the util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſcheme has equalled the expectations of its advocates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:031824_0005_0FEEBF40D2A3F130"/>
In its proſecution, objects of purſuit and the modes of inveſtigation have been pointed out. Theſe have been ſuch as were either uſeful in themſelves, or as they tended to invigorate and extend the reaſoning faculty. A literary account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to the whole is naturally expected of each of the members; and hence reſults, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, but a circumſpection of mind, an endeavor at claſſic purity and correctneſs, which might otherwiſe have been neglected. Free communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on all proper ſubjects is encouraged; and accurate diſcuſſions of particular points enjoined. By this expedient, the ſtock of information is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, the ideas are afforted and arranged, and pedantry and heſitation give place to eaſe and ready reſource. The ſtudent who confines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his cloſet, and collects his information wholly from the dead letter of his authors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out improving the faculty of communication or an interchange of ſentiments and obſervations, may acquire much learning; but the maſs will be of little more uſe to him than a treaſure depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the baſe of a pyramid.</p>
            <p>As the Society was not excluſively connected with one ſeminary, it was neceſſary, to prevent miſtakes and impoſitions, as well as for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, to preſerve thoſe myſteries and <hi>arcana,</hi> which had been attached to it from its origin. Independent of the many precedents which exiſt in point, to which we might appeal for an apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy, we truſt that this conſideration will afford to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031824_0006_0FEEBF43AC5EBFD8"/>the candid a ſufficient juſtification. But a tree, it is ſaid, is to be known by its fruit; and, as we have <hi>endeavored</hi> to approve ourſelves to the world, we feel a modeſt aſſurance that our Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not ſuffer by an application of the rule. Fifteen years have already elapſed ſince its firſt eſtabliſhment here: During all which time, irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularities of conduct, riot, tumult and diſorder have uniformly been diſcountenanced; and due ſubordination and a regard to order have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined and practiſed. Many advantages therefore have reſulted to the Univerſity, and perhaps to ſociety itſelf. From a conviction of the utility of the ſcheme, on all theſe and various other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the Government of this Seminary have, with great propriety, afforded their patronage and countenance to the Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Some of the general conſequences that may probably flow from this eſtabliſhment are obvious and apparent. The intereſts of the community are undoubtedly advanced by the information and ability of its members. Nay, a general diffuſion of knowledge and literature is thought eſſentially neceſſary to the preſervation of a free government. This benefit, however, does not fully reſult to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, unleſs the powers of the head are connected with goodneſs of heart. In what conſiſts the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a civilized man and a ſavage? Certainly not more in the improvement of mind, than diſpoſition. Let one, therefore, be enlarged, without a proportional correction of the other,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031824_0007_0FEEBF4C1AD93310"/>and the man will be but a ſavage ſtill, with greater ability to gratify his uncorrected propenſities. Thoſe ſocieties, therefore, muſt be importantly uſeful, which make a reciprocal friendſhip a part of their conſtitutions. For, it is from the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of private attachments, that we learn to extend our affections to a general philanthropy. It is not to be denied, that ſome of the benefits which they would produce are happily ſuperſeded by the tranquil ſtate of our country, and the mild manners of a poliſhed and enlightened age. Such inſtitutions, eſpecially if they become extenſive, are admirably calculated to ſoften the manners, and ameliorate the condition of mankind, in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or tumultuous times.</p>
            <p>The Maſonic Eſtabliſhment, which is of this deſcription, from its antiquity and univerſality, furniſhes the beſt illuſtration of this doctrine. Avoiding all the chimerical, or at beſt, doubtful accounts of a very high antiquity; it is certain that their order exiſted, and was held in reſpect, during the latter part of the dark ages. In addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the refinement of diſpoſition, which the cheriſhing the mild virtue of friendſhip always induces; hiſtory affords us many inſtances of the beneficial effects which that eſtabliſhment produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The exile, whom differences in religious opinions, revolutions in government, or the chances of war had driven from his country to a foreign land; inſtead of there finding himſelf friendleſs and alone, inſtead of being expoſed to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031824_0008_0FEEBF4EE7790E88"/>the inſuits and abuſe of the unfeeling, or redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the ſad alternative of menial ſervice, or ſoliciting a cold charity to obtain a pitiful ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; no ſooner did he make known his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion to any of the fraternity whom he might chance to meet, than he found the boſom of friendſhip open to receive, the arm of power ſtretched forth to protect, and the hand of a lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral charity unfolded to ſupport him. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy captive who had fallen into the hands of a ferocious and exaſperated enemy, inſtead of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that cruel death, or being condemned to the ſtill more cruel bondage which he expected, is diſcovered by a brother of the order among the conquerors: Forthwith the fetters are ſtruck from his limbs, the balm of conſolation is copiouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, and he is relieved from his fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. This generous relief was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Maſonic Brethren, but often extended to their friends and fellow-ſufferers. How grateful is it to obſerve ſuch inſtances of humanity and benevolence, breaking forth in times of general barbariſm and depravity of manners! The gem of friendſhip ſhines with a brighter, a diviner ray, in proportion to the general gloom of the times in which it is found.</p>
            <p>Unacquainted with the ſecrets of Maſonry, I ſtate no other inſtance of analogy between that order and ours, but that of a fraternal attachment to each other. But certain I am that a cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tender and ſocial affections, and the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031824_0009_0FEEBF5070208E80"/>conſequent extenſion of our benevolence to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral philanthropy, is the moſt important, the moſt honorable principle that any fraternity can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. If ever this was a ſecret, thank God, it is now rapidly developing, or is already unfolded to ſociety at large.</p>
            <p>Comparing the ſtate of mankind with what it was ſcarce more than a century ago, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely is it improved! In many countries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of laws which authoriſed the governments to ſeize the property of an unfortunate ſtranger, who ſhould die within their juriſdiction, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever juſt the claims of his relations or others might be; or to ſtrip from the wretches who were wrecked on their coaſts, the remnant of their property which the rage of the elements had ſpared; inſtead of the barbarous cuſtom of coolly murdering or condemning to ſlavery the unhappy captives, whom the fortune of war, or even a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the rights of hoſpitality had brought within their power; we find laws providing for the ſupport of the diſtreſſed of every deſcription; ſocieties eſtabliſhed and countenanced by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the relief of the unfortunate. In times of peace, moſt countries are open for the free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and departure of ſtrangers; and their equal right to protection and relief is acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged: And in time of war, excepting ſome partial inſtances of cruelty, which have unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſtained the hiſtory of our own times; if any one fall into the hands of his enemy, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031824_0010_0FEEBF51F92FA600"/>of his life ceaſes with his reſiſtance; he is treated with politeneſs, and allowed all the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies and comforts of life. In a ſhort time he is liberated on his ſimple parole, or exchanged unhurt; or, on the concluſion of a peace, is diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a ranſom. Wars in general are no longer perſonal, but national: And though indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduale diſcharge their duty with gallantry in the field; yet they have none of that private animoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and rancor which formerly armed that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive evil with double terror.</p>
            <p>In this picture, which is undoubtedly juſt with reſpect to much the greater part of what is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the civilized world, it muſt be highly ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to obſerve that our own country ſtands in the foreground. Mildneſs and benevolence are ruling principles in all our governments: Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy is both honored and practiſed by the great body of our citizens. The poor are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by ſtanding laws; and the unfortunate often relieved by particular acts of munificence. Individuals alſo have uniformly diſcovered alac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and zeal to avert the dangers with which oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were threatened, and have liberally contributed to repair unmerited misfortunes. Societies have been formed for the kind reception and friendly treatment of ſuch foreigners as ſeek an aſylum in our happy country; others, to reſtore perſons apparently dead to life and the embraces of their anxious friends. Many ſimilar eſtabliſhments do honor to our country. When engaged in war,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031824_0011_0FEE929B1380A148"/>no American was ever known to take the life of the unreſiſting or unarmed; and the kindneſs and humanity with which our magnanimous armies, though often exaſperated by cruelties which had been practiſed on their countrymen, always treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their priſoners, extorted praiſes from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies themſelves. What other people can exhibit an example of a complete revolution achieved, both in the form and the adminiſtration of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, or of rebellions effectually ſuppreſſed, where no blood has been ſpilled on account of the opinion of individuals, or the ſide of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy merely, which they eſpouſed? Far hence be the time, when either foreign war or internal commotion ſhall again call for the exerciſe of theſe magnanimous virtues; but ſtill let us cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and be ready to put them in practice, if the ſad neceſſity ſhould ever re-exiſt.</p>
            <p>Though humanity and benevolence be juſtly a part of our national character; yet, as other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are behind us, ſo we have not arrived at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. There ſtill remains a wide field for the exerciſe of a generous ambition. To reviſe, and mitigate in many caſes, our codes of criminal law, by endeavoring to make a reformation of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, inſtead of his extirpation, the object of puniſhment; to transform our common places of confinement from ſeminaries of wickedneſs and villany into ſchools of morality; to liberate the unhappy Africans from the horrors of a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very equally unjuſt and inhuman; to promote
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031824_0012_0FEEBF5BB7D28AE8"/>an interchange of good offices, and a mild and pacific diſpoſition among mankind; objects like theſe are worthy the purſuit of the nobleſt minds. Some of them have already immortalized the names of PENN, HOWARD, and WILBERFORCE. Shall we be deterred, ſhall we ſhrink in deſpair from objects of ſuch magnitude? Is it chimerical to indulge a hope that even we may bear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous part in this noble purſuit? No; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering that, in ſuch a cauſe, it is much more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable to lead than to follow; we will lend our individual aſſiſtance, as circumſtances may permit, and endeavor to give a tone to the public opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. If one man, by his perſonal exertion, could alleviate the diſtreſſes of thouſands, ſcattered through all the countries of Europe, nay, could gladden even the horrors of the Eaſt; what may not numbers achieve? It is true we are yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively few: But our number, both here and elſewhere, is continually increaſing. Our Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is now confined to a few ſeminaries in this country: But what obſtacle exiſts to its fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extenſion? or even to a communication of it to foreign univerſities? in many of which, eſtabliſhments of this kind have heretofore found a cordial ſupport. Let us remember alſo, that in the practice of philanthropy, which is far from being the leaſt important object of our aſſociation, we ſhall act in concert with many other reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtitutions, and meet the concurrence of a generous public. With due exertion, therefore,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031824_0013_0FEEBF5D4E8744D0"/>even of a few, in various places and different walks of life, the great current of opinion may be directed into proper channels, and its raraifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reach every object of compaſſion. When the beneficial effects of a general ſpirit of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſhall be obſerved here, it will readily be adopted abroad. Our country has already taught the world the true ſcience of government, and the art to be free. She exhibits the example of a great people flouriſhing and happy, among whom, to the ſurpriſe of other nations, gradations in rank, and excluſive rights, are entirely unknown. Why then ſhall we not inſtruct the ſpecies in the arts of humanity, and the ſcience of univerſal friendſhip? Is this general diffuſion of philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy mere chimera and extravagance? If it be, I could almoſt wiſh that we might ſtill cheriſh the deluſion. For what but the reality could be more grateful to benevolent minds, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident anticipation that the whole world would become a common country to each individual; that mankind would be but one family, by practice, as well as extraction; and thereby taſte on Earth, the joys of Heaven itſelf?</p>
