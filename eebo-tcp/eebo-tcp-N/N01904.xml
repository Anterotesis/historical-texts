            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Servant of GOD, here maintains this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; That <hi>perpetual Pain is the Portion of a Wicked Man.</hi> The Life of a Wicked Man is all ſpent in continual <hi>Throws,</hi> to bring forth, nothing but that ugly Monſter <hi>Sin</hi>; which when it is <hi>Finiſhed brings forth Death.</hi> We La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Condition of ſome who are <hi>ſeveral Days in Travail:</hi> But Oh! how Lamentable the Condition of a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> who <hi>Travaileth in pain all his Days</hi>! Yea, the <hi>Pain</hi> of a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> is in this point, worſe than the <hi>Pain of a Woman in Travail.</hi> For <hi>when ſhe is Delivered, ſhe remembreth her anguiſh no more,</hi> for the <hi>Joy</hi> of what is <hi>Born into the World.</hi> But ſo far is the <hi>Pain</hi> of a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> from <hi>ending in Joy,</hi> that it hath no End at all. He <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth in Pain all his Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text is a Demonſtration and an Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of what is thus aſſerted. A <hi>Dreadful Sound,</hi> or a Sound of Terrors, is in <hi>his Ears.</hi> And this is the awful DOCTRINE to be now inſiſted on,

            <p>A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> does not always hear the <hi>Dreadful Sound.</hi> There is a <hi>deep ſleep</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent prevailing on a <hi>Wicked Man.</hi> Though the <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> be in his <hi>Ears,</hi> yet he ſtops his <hi>Ears</hi> againſt it.

               </gap>e a <hi>Wicked Man. Eliphaz</hi> does not ſay or every Man who may fall into a Sin, A <hi>Dreadful Sound is in his Ears.</hi> For, <hi>There is not a Juſt Man upon Earth, who doeth good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not.</hi> It has been truly obſerved, The <hi>Beſt of Saints</hi> while here on Earth are <hi>Sinners</hi>; but the <hi>worſt of Saints</hi> are not <hi>Wicked.</hi> Indeed, There can be no Sin committed, but there iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues from the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> unto the Sinner. No Man can <hi>Sin,</hi> but the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD will upon it ſay unto him; Ezek. XVIII.4. <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> But then, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> quells the <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> by leading us to that which <hi>ſpeaks better Things.</hi> And tho' the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is not preſently barred from all Falls into <hi>Sin,</hi> yet the <hi>Guilt</hi> of the Sin into which he falls, is taken from him; and he is reſcued from that <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates a <hi>Wicked Man.</hi> When he falls into <hi>Sin,</hi> he falls into that which he <hi>Loves not.</hi> He may ſay with him; Rom.

            <p>Wherefore, Secondly; and more Poſitively. A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is a <hi>Sinner,</hi> who <hi>Loves</hi> to be a <hi>Sinner.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> that is the <hi>Mark</hi> which diſtinguiſhes a <hi>Wicked Man.</hi> 'Tis that <hi>Wicked Love</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent

with the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD, and with the diſpoſitions of <hi>Piety,</hi> by which the true <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> is to be diſtinguiſhed. This will be diſcovered in ſeveral Properties of a <hi>Wicked Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is one under the <hi>Reigning Power</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> We read, Rom. IV.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are under Grace.</hi> If <hi>Sin</hi> have <hi>Dominion</hi> over a Man, he is not <hi>under Grace,</hi> or in good Terms with GOD; No, but he is a Subject of that <hi>Wicked Kingdom,</hi> in which every <hi>Subject</hi> is a <hi>Vaſſal.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> has not the <hi>ſteps</hi> of his Life, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Word of GOD</hi>: He leads a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Life, becauſe <hi>Iniquity has Dominion over him.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is one of thoſe who are called, <hi>The Servants of Sin,</hi> and <hi>The Servants of Corruption,</hi> and <hi>The Captives of the Devil.</hi> It may be ſaid of him, <hi>He ſerves divers Luſts.</hi> His Luſts have an abſolute Command over him. The Motions of His <hi>Luſts</hi> have an irreſiſtible Force upon him He can't Reſiſt his <hi>Criminal Propenſities.</hi> He can't mortify his <hi>Carnal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</hi> His unmortified paſſions for <hi>Vile Things</hi> are too Potent for him. His <hi>Vices</hi> lay Chains upon him; draw him hither and hither to his Confuſion. Tho' he knows it will confound him to Sin in ſuch and ſuch things, yet he <hi>muſt needs go,</hi> when he feels himſelf driven into it. He is entirely governed by vicious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Sin</hi> has the <hi>Full Conſent</hi> of a <hi>Wicked Man.</hi> We read, Hoſ. 5.11. <hi>He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

walked after the Commandment.</hi> That is to ſay, Commanded <hi>Idolatry.</hi> When <hi>Sin</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and a Man <hi>goes willingly</hi> into the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, this <hi>Willingly</hi> is <hi>Wickedly.</hi> Indeed, there is no <hi>Sin</hi> without ſome degree of <hi>Conſent.</hi> There goes a <hi>Conſent of the Will</hi> unto ever, <hi>Act of Sin.</hi> But then there is a difference between the <hi>Conſent</hi> which a <hi>Godly Man</hi> yields unto Sin, and the <hi>Conſent</hi> given by a <hi>Wicked Man.</hi> When a <hi>Godly Man</hi> Sins, his Fault rather lies in this, that he does not <hi>Deny,</hi> than that he does <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> As when a thing is put unto the <hi>Vote,</hi> a Man who does not <hi>oppoſe,</hi> but only <hi>ſuſpend</hi> his <hi>Vote,</hi> in ſome ſort, yields his <hi>Conſent.</hi> As our <hi>Caryl</hi> expreſſes it;
<q>A Child of GOD, when a Temptation comes, he does not give a direct, <hi>Yea,</hi> of <hi>Conſent</hi>; but when he Sins, he does not give his, <hi>No,</hi> ſo livelily as he ought to do.</q>
His <hi>Conſent</hi> unto <hi>Sin</hi> is a kind of a <hi>middle Act</hi>; it lies in his <hi>not Refuſing</hi> to Sin, his not Refuſing, Rejecting, Repelling the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with ſuch <hi>Vigour</hi> as he ought to do. But now, a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> Sins with a <hi>Full Conſent</hi>: He is one who <hi>Chuſes to Sin</hi>: Yea, He is one who <hi>prefers</hi> a <hi>way of ſin.</hi> The <hi>Will</hi> of a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> fully cloſes with Sin. He has his <hi>Will</hi> when he does a ſinful Thing. If his <hi>Underſtanding</hi> remonſtrate unto the Folly of what he is going to do, yet his <hi>Affection</hi> thoroughly eſpouſes it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> does <hi>Reſolve</hi> to <hi>Sin.</hi> We read, Eccl. VIII.11. <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> There
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002251_0008_0FDADAABEAB62888"/>
are thoſe who have an <hi>Heart fully ſet,</hi> upon ſinning; ſuch <hi>Sons of Men</hi> are the <hi>Children of Wickedneſs.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> if he make <hi>Prayers</hi> againſt Sin, yet he brings not <hi>hearty Deſires</hi> againſt Sin. A <hi>Reſolved Sinner</hi> is a <hi>Wicked Man.</hi> His <hi>Reſolutions</hi> are, <hi>To morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundantly.</hi> A Godly Man is one who <hi>Cleaves</hi> to GOD with a <hi>Full Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Heart.</hi> The <hi>main purpoſe</hi> of his Heart is for <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in all the Exerciſes of it. When he <hi>Sins</hi> 'tis beſide his <hi>purpoſe</hi>; his <hi>purpoſe</hi> was to have done otherwiſe. He is out of his way when he <hi>does amiſs</hi>: The well meaning Traveller has <hi>miſſed his way.</hi> As it has been Remarked, <hi>Peter</hi> denied the Lord, it was not becauſe he <hi>Reſolved</hi> ſo to do; but rather becauſe he <hi>Reſolved</hi> ſo much in his own ſtrength to do otherwiſe. A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is one who <hi>Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly</hi> ſets himſelf in a <hi>way that is not Good.</hi> He can <hi>Sin</hi> on <hi>Deliberation,</hi> and he does it with <hi>Reſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, 'Tis the <hi>Delight</hi> of a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> to <hi>Sin.</hi> We read, Prov. X.23. <hi>It is a ſport unto a fool to do miſchief.</hi> When Men can <hi>ſport</hi> themſelves in <hi>Sin,</hi> then miſchievous is their <hi>Wickedneſs</hi>; 'tis <hi>miſchievous Madneſs.</hi> To a <hi>Virtuous Man, Sin</hi> is the <hi>greateſt ſorrow:</hi> To a <hi>Wicked Man, Sin</hi> is the <hi>greateſt pleaſure.</hi> The Man who <hi>pleaſes</hi> GOD, is one who <hi>takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in doing ſo. He <hi>Chuſes the things that pleaſe</hi> GOD. The <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is one who <hi>pleaſes himſelf</hi> rather than GOD, and never more than in <hi>ſinning</hi> againſt GOD. We have been told,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002251_0009_0FDADADE4CC97BB8"/>
That there are ſuch Things as, <hi>The pleaſures of ſin.</hi> 'Tis the guiſe of a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> to count them ſo. A <hi>Wiſer Man</hi> counts them Torments, Horrors, <hi>bitter</hi> Miſeries. The Rule is, <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thy heart.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is one who does <hi>Delight in ſinning againſt the Lord.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has the <hi>Deſires of his Heart.</hi> It is a <hi>Grief</hi> unto a <hi>Good Man</hi> to <hi>Sin.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is <hi>glad</hi> when he <hi>Sins; Glad</hi> when GOD is <hi>griev'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Cuſtom in Sin</hi> is the conſummation of <hi>Wickedneſs</hi>; the finiſhing ſtroke in a <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man.</hi> He is, as I may now agreeably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> in Wickedneſs. We read of ſome, Jer. XIII.23. <hi>Who are accuſtomed to do evil</hi>; and can leave it off no more than the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> can <hi>Change his skin.</hi> They that are <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to do evil</hi> are <hi>Wicked Men.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is one who <hi>makes a Trade of Sin.</hi> A <hi>Gracious Man</hi> may <hi>Sin</hi> and may <hi>Repeat</hi> the Sin. But then, he breaks off the <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> with begging &amp; pleading for help againſt the Sin. He makes many a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint</hi> againſt the Sin. He never gives over <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,</hi> till he has got the <hi>Victory.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is <hi>Cuſtomarily</hi> ſo: He is one who is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly</hi> overtaken with ſuch Things as he knows to be <hi>Abominable Things, hated by the Soul of GOD.</hi> It is the <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> the <hi>Courſe,</hi> the <hi>Way</hi> of a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> to do thoſe Things, which he knows are Forbidden by GOD, and Offenſive to Him. Tho' he knows that he <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> in what he does, yet a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> will <hi>go on
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002251_0010_0FDADAAE05E05948"/>
ſtill in his Treſpaſſes</hi>; and make a <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Things which he does <hi>not think to be Right.</hi> When theſe <hi>Five Brands</hi> are ſet upon a Sinner he may be turned looſe into the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to graze among <hi>Wicked Men.</hi> This is a <hi>Lover of Sin,</hi> and muſt <hi>go in the company of wicked Men</hi>; which is alſo what he <hi>Loves</hi> to do: 'Tis the Note of ſuch an one, That he <hi>Loves</hi> to do ſo; <hi>Loves</hi> to Flock with the <hi>Birds</hi> of his <hi>Feather,</hi> though never ſuch <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>hateful</hi> ones. This, This is the Man, that muſt have in his Ears, a <hi>Dreadful Sound.</hi> This before we go any further muſt be ſpoken to him, than which there cannot be a more <hi>Dreadful Sound; <hi>Thou art a Wicked Man;</hi> And the Portion of the Wicked belongs unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are now come to our ſecond Inquiry,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHAT are the Things which make a <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound</hi> in the Ears of a</hi> Wicked Man?</p>
            <p>In general, There is this <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in the Ears of a <hi>Wicked Man</hi>; Man, <hi>Except what thou heareſt in the Tenders of the Goſpel, there is nothing that makes a Joyful Sound unto thee.</hi> A <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is one under the <hi>Curſe</hi> of GOD. Now, as it was of old ſaid, <hi>How ſhall I curſe, whom God hath not curſed?</hi> So it may be ſaid, <hi>How can they be bleſſed, whom God hath curſed?</hi> None can ſpeak a Comfortable thing unto the <hi>Curſed</hi> of GOD. There is this <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in the Ears of the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Iſa. LVII.21.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002251_0011_0FDADAE1601E03F0"/>
               <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, unto the wicked.</hi> Every Thing is a <hi>Micajah</hi> to a <hi>Wicked Man</hi>; it <hi>Prophecies</hi> nothing but <hi>Evil</hi> unto him. All the <hi>Objects</hi> which ſurround a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> ſay this unto him, I <hi>am ſent with heavy Tidings unto thee.</hi> All the <hi>Creatures</hi> are up in Arms againſt them, who perſiſt in Rebellion againſt the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious GOD. <hi>Hear ye Rebels</hi>; were ye not very deaf, you might hear this <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> from all the <hi>Creatures</hi> unto GOD crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, <hi>Shall we ſmite them, O GOD, ſhall we ſmite them</hi>! Yea, The <hi>whole Creation</hi> is <hi>groaning</hi> againſt you for the Abuſes you put upon it. There is a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in the <hi>Groans</hi> of the <hi>whole Creation,</hi> to be <hi>delivered</hi> from your Abuſes.</p>
            <p>But more particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> The <hi>Threatnings</hi> which are denounced in the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD againſt every <hi>Wicked Man:</hi> Certainly, theſe muſt needs make a <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound</hi> in the Ears of a Wicked Man. When the <hi>Commandments</hi> of GOD were given from the Flaming Mountain, there was a <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound</hi> in the Ears of the People. We read, Exod. XIX.16. <hi>There were Thundrings and Lightnings, and the voice of a Trumpet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loud, ſo that all the people that were in the camp trembled.</hi> The <hi>Commandments</hi> of GOD are armed with Tremendous <hi>Threatnings</hi> againſt the Breaches of it. The <hi>Law</hi> has its <hi>Penalties</hi> for the Breakers of it The <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the

Word of GOD, againſt the <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> wherein the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD is violated, what are they but <hi>Thundrings</hi> and <hi>Lightnings</hi>; and the <hi>Voice of a Trumpet exceeding Loud,</hi> making a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in the Ears of a <hi>Wicked man.</hi> O moſt Hard hearted one, why doſt thou <hi>Tremble</hi> ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle under the Fulminations? We read, Rom. I.18. <hi>The wrath of GOD is revealed from Heaven, againſt all Ungodlineſs &amp; Unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> 'Tis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed &amp; Proclaimed, &amp; Publiſhed in the <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of His <hi>Word.</hi> But, What a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> is made by theſe <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the Ears of all <hi>Ungodly</hi> and <hi>Unrighteous</hi> men? Hearken to the <hi>Dreadful Sound,</hi> which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD makes, in the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of it. <hi>Hear attentively, the Noiſe of His Voice, and the Sound that goeth out of His Mouth. The Voice roareth; He Thundreth with the Voice of His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. He Thundreth marvellouſly with His Voice</hi>; the <hi>Dreadful</hi> Things which He will do unto the <hi>Wicked: Things which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi>! Is there not a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in that word of GOD! Eccl. VIII.13. <hi>It ſhall not be well with the wicked.</hi> Is there not a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in that word of GOD! Pſal. XXXII.10. <hi>There ſhall be many Sorrows to the wicked.</hi> Is there not a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in that word of GOD! Prov. XIII.21. <hi>Evil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth ſinners.</hi> In the Predictions of what was to befal a <hi>wicked World,</hi> we read of a Treble <hi>Wo-Trumpet</hi>; whereon, Rev.

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002251_0013_0FDADAE2A54AA180"/>
Even ſo, The <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, make this <hi>Dreadful Sound, <hi>Wo, wo, wo to the wicked lovers of Sin.</hi>
               </hi> Some little Rumbling of the <hi>woful Sound</hi> ſhall be now heard among you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is in the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> of <hi>Temporal woes</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the <hi>Wicked.</hi> What a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> may the <hi>wicked</hi> hear in that word! Deut.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is in the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> of <hi>Spiritual woes</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the <hi>wicked</hi> What a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> may the <hi>wicked</hi> hear in that word!

            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> The <hi>Voice</hi> of a <hi>Guilty Conſcience</hi> cannot but make a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in the Ears of a <hi>wicked men.</hi> We read, Prov.

            <p>Truly, The whole <hi>Portion of the Wicked</hi> in Both Worlds, is that which makes a <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound,</hi> in the Exhibitions of it. The Roaring of the New <hi>Volcano</hi> among the Weſtern Iſlands, or the Noiſe made by all the reſt of the Ignivomous Mountains is nothing to the <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound</hi> of GOD from Heaven declaring what ſhall be done unto the <hi>Wicked.</hi> The Cataracts of <hi>Niagara</hi> make not ſuch a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi>; The <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> of the Waves that ſtrike aganiſt the Mountains of <hi>Angamannia,</hi> that not only <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens</hi> but even <hi>Sickens</hi> the Approaching Mariners, &amp; frights them out of their Wits; I ſay unto you, It is not a thouſandth part ſo forminable.</p>
            <p>But now the Intention of all theſe Exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Admonitions. This is, My Friends, to Save you from the <hi>Dreadful Sound.</hi> We read, Pſal.

            <p>The Advice to you, is, Let none remain any longer among the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Souls, <hi>Depart from the Tents of the Wicked men, leſt ye be conſumed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002251_0021_0FDADAEAC908B2C8"/>
in all their Sins.</hi> 'Tis done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By Conſidering, by Acknowledging, by Bewailing of all your <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi>: O Bemoan your ſelves; <hi>I have Sinned,</hi> and <hi>I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> 'Tis done, By Repairing to the <hi>Blood</hi> which will waſh away your <hi>Wickedneſs</hi>; O make this Plea, take this Hope; <hi>The Blood of JESUS CHRIST the Son of</hi> GOD, <hi>cleanſes from all Sin.</hi> 'Tis done, By abandoning every way of <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi> O <hi>ceaſe to do Evil,</hi> and <hi>learn to do Well</hi>; and Remember, <hi>'Tis he who Confeſſeth and Forſaketh, that ſhall find Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Serious and Thorough <hi>Repentance,</hi> is the Thing, whereto all the <hi>Wicked</hi> are to be Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. But, Oh! what a <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> is there now to be in your Ears for your Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement! <hi>Behold I bring you Good Tidings of Great Joy</hi>! There comes from Heaven unto you this <hi>Joyful Sound; <hi>Be you never ſo Wicked, You may turn to</hi>
               </hi> GOD, <hi>and upon your doing ſo, you ſhall find a Pardon.</hi> O the <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> of that word; Iſai. LV.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, &amp; Return unto the Lord, who will have Mercy, and unto our</hi> GOD, <hi>for He will abundantly Pardon.</hi> There comes from Heaven unto you this <hi>Joyful Sound; <hi>Be you never ſo Wicked, there is a Great SAVIOUR willing to Receive you, and Redeem you, if you come unto Him.</hi>
               </hi> O the <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> of that word! Joh. VI.37. <hi>Him that comes unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Let this <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> melt and break your very Hearts within you. There is not one of you all that has yet fallen into the

               <hi>Unpardonable Sin.</hi> If you had, you would not be here. There is not one of you all, whoſe <hi>Day of Grace</hi> is yet over with them. If it were, you would not feel ſuch Motions in your Souls as you do. The worſt of you all, may yet <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> to GOD, and in doing ſo, He will be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto you; yea, He does <hi>Beſeech you to be Reconciled unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, O you, whom the <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> has driv'n, and this <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> has drawn, unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> and, ye Converts of <hi>Zion,</hi> who begin to Live unto GOD, Hear, Hear the <hi>Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound,</hi> which you are now to be diſmiſs'd withal.</p>
            <p>You are now to have in your Ears that <hi>Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound, <hi>Be of Good cheer, Thy Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee</hi>.</hi> That <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> is now for you, <hi>This is a dear Son, This is a pleaſant Child, I will ſurely have Mercy on him.</hi> That <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> is now for you; <hi>All things ſhall work together for Good unto them that Love</hi> GOD. Yea, To you there belongs that <hi>Joyful Sound,</hi> O <hi>Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, O you that Live unto GOD, and <hi>hate every falſe way</hi>; After your paſſing thro' the <hi>valley of Death,</hi> &amp; again coming out of the <hi>Grave,</hi> you ſhall hear this <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> from the Mouth of the Glorious Lord; Math. XXV.34. <hi>Come, ye Bleſſed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! may the <hi>Sound</hi> thus heard from the Two Mountains of <hi>Ebal</hi> and of <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> have a due Impreſſion upon you!</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002251_0023_0FDADAE99AC3AF40"/>¶ BUT that the Deſigns of REPENTANCE may be the more Effectually proſecuted, there muſt be made more Audible, a <hi>Dreadful Sound,</hi> which the Providence of the Glorious GOD has lately produced among us, and which requires to be moſt ſeriouſly attended to.</p>
            <p>There is a Remarkable One, in the Condition of that <hi>Son of Death,</hi> who appears in <hi>Chains</hi> this Day among us, and who is within theſe Two or Three Hours to <hi>flee down to the Pit</hi>; there may be <hi>no ſtaying</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> there is in the <hi>Ejulations</hi> of this poor Creature, upon the View of what he has <hi>done,</hi> and of what he is now to <hi>Suffer</hi> for it. His <hi>Weeping &amp; Howling</hi> for the <hi>Miſeries</hi> that <hi>Come upon him,</hi> do make this <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in our Ears; <hi>Wickedneſs! What will it bring to! What will it End in!</hi> Oh! Let <hi>all Iſrael Hear and Fear,</hi> and let none do any more ſo <hi>Wickedly!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt, it makes a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in the Ears of this <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> to be told;
<q>
                  <hi>Man,</hi> within a <hi>few Hours</hi> the <hi>Lamp</hi> of thy <hi>Life,</hi> is to be put out with Shameful, Painful, Tragical Circumſtances.

            </p>
            <p>The Ghoſt of his Murdered Wife; This too muſt needs make a <hi>Dreadful Sound</hi> in his Ears. It crys, <hi>Vengeance, Vengeance upon the Murderer</hi>!

All the Country hears the Cry; and the <hi>Sword</hi> of GOD in the hand of His <hi>Miniſters,</hi> is drawn upon it.</p>
            <p>It adds doleful Murmurs to the <hi>Dreadful Sound,</hi> That this Wretched <hi>Ethiopian</hi> has been ſo diſtinguiſhed from the moſt of his Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and been admitted unto ſuch very <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Privileges.</hi> He was favoured with a Religious Education, which Enabled him to Read the <hi>Oracles</hi> of GOD, and learn the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of Chriſtianity; and then had an Eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation into a <hi>Liberty,</hi> which he has been too unthankful for. He made a Profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and was <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> and ſtood a Candidate for <hi>Communion</hi> in the Church; which indeed the Faithful <hi>Paſtors,</hi> fearing that <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> in him, which is now diſcovered, wiſely delay'd unto him. Now, for One who ſo <hi>Knew the Will</hi> of our Glorious Maſter, to do as he has done; for One under ſuch Obligations, to be a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all Goodneſs unto other <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> to prove of ſo Doubly and ſo Deeply <hi>Black</hi> a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; Oh! how <hi>Many</hi> &amp; how ſevere <hi>Stripes,</hi> in the Infernal Priſon muſt ſuch an One be worthy of! <hi>Ungrateful Wretch</hi>! What art thou worthy of!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miſerable Man</hi>; I hope, you take Notice of what I ſpeak to the People of GOD concerning you. But, Oh! Be aſtoniſhed at what I muſt after all ſpeak unto <hi>You</hi> upon it. In the midſt of all this <hi>Dreadful Sound,</hi> there is a <hi>Joyful Sound,</hi> which you are to be adviſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of: That <hi>Joyful Sound</hi>; There is a SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR,

in whoſe <hi>Blood</hi> there is, <hi>A Fountain ſet open for Sin and for Uncleanneſs.</hi> You may come to that <hi>Open Fountain</hi>; and Plead the <hi>Blood</hi> of your SAVIOUR for your <hi>Pardon.</hi> The moſt <hi>Bloody</hi> Sinners may do ſo; They that have a <hi>Blood-Guiltineſs</hi> upon them, are Allowed, yea, Commanded, ſo to do. Even His own <hi>Murderers</hi> did it, and found Mercy with Him! Do it; and Beg at the ſame time, <hi>O my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, Change my Heart; Beſtow a New Heart, a Soft Heart, a Clean heart, a Good and Honeſt Heart upon me!</hi> Thy Soul ſhall become as <hi>White</hi> as the <hi>Snow</hi> and the <hi>Wooll,</hi> upon thy doing of it.

               <p>Look you; <hi>Sin</hi> muſt be puniſhed. You have <hi>Sinn'd,</hi> and the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of your Sin is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable. The <hi>Law</hi> of GOD has aſſigned a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> for it, which there is no avoiding of. The <hi>Puniſhment</hi> has thoſe Miſeries in it, which cannot without Horror be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You muſt either undergo this <hi>Puniſhment</hi> your ſelf, and the <hi>Smoke of your Torment</hi> under it <hi>aſcending for ever and ever:</hi> Or elſe you muſt find One to undergo the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> for you; One to be ſuch a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for you, as GOD ſhall be <hi>well-pleaſed</hi> withal; the Infinite <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD Satisfied withal.

now, a Glorious CHRIST coming as the <hi>Head</hi> of His People, He did for them <hi>Fulfil all Righteouſneſs</hi>; He had a moſt <hi>Holy Heart</hi>; He led a moſt <hi>Holy Life.</hi> Such was His <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that the <hi>Pure Eyes</hi> of the Infinite GOD, could never tax any thing <hi>amiſs</hi> in it; could never ſee any elſewhere that <hi>Equall'd</hi> it.
