            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' I was earneſtly deſired to print the following Diſcourſe; and could not be without hopes that ſo plain an attempt to magnify Chriſt, might be followed with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; what determined me was an apprehenſion that it might ſerve, with ſome enlargements, in lieu of my <hi>Examination</hi> of Mr. <hi>Cumming</hi>'s <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi> on my letter to himſelf, and Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s remarks upon it. The great deſign of which was to bear teſtimony againſt that doctrine which I had oppoſed in the ſermon, without the leaſt thoughts of printing, viz. That men love God and truly repent of their ſins, <hi>before</hi> they believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THE piece would have been printed in Mr. <hi>Cumming</hi>'s life time, had I not waited for his <hi>ſecond part</hi> which he promiſed the public. The printer's going away laſt winter for the ſmall pox, prevented its being publiſhed then. Providential hindrances have had their weight: And beſides, tho' Mr. <hi>Cumming</hi> was treated with decency, there were ſome things in it, that would not read ſo well as if he were now living. I never differ'd with that Gentleman in anger; and when he died, I mourned for him as a brother. Nor did the death of any one ever ſo throughly convince me of that ſolemn truth, viz. that the <hi>graves were ready for me.</hi> However, when death hath appear'd moſt near I have thought I ſhould ſin
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:009945_0004_0F7B3AF46C72BD08"/>againſt the God of my life, if I did not endeavour to remove the vail which he hath caſt over the <hi>glorious goſpel of the bleſſed God.</hi> They are but poor friends to Jeſus Chriſt, who are not willing he ſhould be magnified, without any regard to <hi>man.</hi> Were the faints in heaven to know what is done on earth, they would rejoice at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of any tenets, which they once, thro' miſtake, thought for the glory of the Lamb <hi>that was ſlain.</hi> 'Twas hoped, as was ſaid, that print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this</hi> would make the <hi>Examination</hi> needleſs; ſince oppoſing the beforementioned doctrine was the only thing that ſeem'd to make it neceſſary for me to write at all. My character did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſuffer: The writings of thoſe divines could never convince people that it was blaſphemy in me to hold no <hi>man can love God while he looks upon him as his everlaſting enemy.</hi> The little odium of my being a ſeparatiſt is removed in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have only to add my prayers, that God's bleſſing may accompany what is agreeable to his word, and that we all may be heartily convinced of theſe truths, viz. <hi>That all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God;</hi> and <hi>that we are juſtified freely by his grace thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>ALL of us ſtand in need of juſtification; for, as Paul ſaith, all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God: And then comes in the ſweet goſpel—we are juſtified freely by God's grace, thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt. He knew that he himſelf was juſtified freely by God's grace thro' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and was forever harping on that divine ſtring. When miniſters <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>therefore ſpeak;</hi> when they know that juſtification is quite free; 'tis ſweeter to them than the honey, and the honey-comb, to bear witneſs for God, that great ſinners, even the chief of ſinners, are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to juſtification thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:009945_0006_0F7B3AF5C8DD9F70"/>
IN ſpeaking to theſe words, I propoſe to obſerve the following method, viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. To ſhew that God made man for his own glory.</item>
               <item>II. THAT all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God.</item>
               <item>III. THAT we are therefore by conſequence in a ſtate of condemnation.</item>
               <item>IV. THAT tho' we are naturally in ſuch a miſerable ſtate, we are juſtified freely by God's grace thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt. And,</item>
               <item>V. TO improve and apply what ſhall have been ſaid under the foregoing heads; bringing all home to our particular caſes, and to our hearts and conſciences too by the bleſſing of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>According to this method—</p>
            <p n="1">I. I AM to ſhew that God made man for his own glory. 'Tis implied, that God made man for his own glory in the text. Coming ſhort of God's glory, is coming ſhort of the end for which man was made; and God's glory is his end in all things. He can have no higher end than his own glory. Reaſonable creatures ſhould aim higher than their own glory, even at the glory of God. But God himſelf can aim no higher, than that he himſelf ſhould be glorified. All things were made to glorify him. For his own glory he made angels, archangels, and all the hoſts of heaven. For his glory he made the firmament, the ſun, moon and ſtars, the earth and the ſeas, and all things therein, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther animate or inanimate; and particularly for this end did he make man the lord of this lower creation—that he might ſhew forth his creator's glory. He made him little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honour, expecting that man would honour him, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009945_0007_0F7B3AF648B8C1F0"/>of his honour, and give him the glory due to his name. Not that man, or any creatures, even the moſt exalted, can make God more glorious than he is. For his glory is eſſential and eternal; and can neither admit of increaſe or diminution. And beſides, creatures receive their all from him: For <hi>of him and through him and to him are all things,</hi> to whom be glory forever. But man, as other beings, glorifies God by owning him to be ſuch a glorious being as he is, poſſeſſed of infinite excellencies and perfections. Nor doth God want to be praiſed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the works of his hands, from any thing analagous to what there is in man, which makes him pleaſed with the praiſes and acclamations of others; but he would be glorified and praiſed, becauſe <hi>praiſe is comely,</hi> reaſonable and decent; and becauſe glorifying him is enjoying him: The fruition of God, and giving him glory, are joined together on earth as well as in heaven. I am now,</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly, To ſhew that all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God; which are the very words of inſpired Paul. God's creatures, as was obſerved, glorify him by owning him to be ſuch a being as he is. So <hi>the heavens ſhew forth the glory of the Lord, and the firmament his handy work: Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, night unto night ſheweth knowledge.</hi> The <hi>inviſible things</hi> of him, <hi>from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</hi> The heavenly hoſts actively glorify their maker; by doing his will, and by their ceaſeleſs hallelujahs they own him to be poſſeſſed of infinite wiſdom, juſtice, holineſs, power, goodneſs and truth. And as thoſe beings honour and glorify God actively, and paſſively, who own and acknowledge his glorious perfections; ſo they come ſhort of his glory, who will not aſcribe to him the glory that is his due. This is the caſe of devils, and of the children of men by nature. Both men and devils have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God. The angels
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009945_0008_0F7B3AF703CF1900"/>who kept not their firſt eſtate, but fell by tranſgreſſion, denied the God above to be ſuch a glorious being as he is. Our firſt parents alſo, by the inſtigation of the <hi>evil one,</hi> ſinned againſt God, and in effect denied him to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe, holy, juſt, powerful, good and true. And as did Adam and Eve, ſo do all their poſterity, by ordinary generation. We derive not only guilt from them (by one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners) but an impure and ſinful nature, a bent and byaſs to depart from the living God. As a fountain caſteth forth its waters, ſo our hearts caſt forth their wickedneſs. We rob God of his glory; inſtead of glorifying God with our bodies and ſpirits which are his; we improve the powers of our ſouls, and the members of our bodies, as inſtruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto wickedneſs: We virtually deny all the glorious perfections of his nature. This is the caſe as Paul ſuppoſes of all; for he ſaith all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God; and elſewhere that the whole world are guilty; that God hath concluded all under ſin; and that every mouth muſt be ſtopped.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I AM now to ſhew that <hi>having ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> man muſt neceſſarily by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be in a ſtate of condemnation. This is implied: For if all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God; and if we ſtand in need of juſtification by the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, then man is in a ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obnoxious to the divine wrath. And accordingly the apoſtle ſaith, men are all by nature the children of wrath, Eph. II. v. 3. So we read, that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven <hi>againſt all unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs of men;</hi> and <hi>that for ſuch things ſake cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</hi>— As the angels who did not keep their firſt eſtate, but ſinned and came ſhort of the glory of God, are reſerved in chains under darkneſs, and ſuffer the divine wrath; ſo all men naturally, and without Chriſt, are expoſed to ſuffer the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009945_0009_0F7B3AF7CA306600"/>wrath and vengeance of God with them. Hence the doom of thoſe who live according to the byaſs of nature, and die in their ſins, will be, depart ye curſed into <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi> The</p>
            <p n="4">IVth POINT is to make it appear that tho' all have ſinned and come ſhort <hi>of the glory of God, we are juſtified freely by his grace, thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>OH! this is good news. There is not one of you who hath ſeriouſly attended to what hath been ſpoken, but he muſt have a deſire to hear about free juſtification by God's grace thro' the redeemer. Tho' God had thoughts of mercy for poor ſinners from eternity, he was reſolved to be merciful to them in ſuch a way as might not be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to his juſtice; for juſtice is eſſential to God as well as mercy: He will by no means clear the guilty, without ſatisfaction to his juſtice: He had rather the whole world ſhould have periſhed eternally, than any one ſhould be juſtified and ſaved in ſuch a way as would in the leaſt reflect upon his juſtice. <hi>To declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he might be juſt,</hi> &amp;c.—God was determimed to juſtify and ſave ſinners ſo that he might declare himſelf to be a <hi>juſt God and a Saviour.</hi> The Father and Son were equally engaged in the redemption of ſinners—And 'twas determined that the redeemer ſhould come to Zion, and in a body prepared for him make atonement for ſin by dying on the croſs—And accordingly when the fulneſs of time was come, the Son of God became the ſon of man; being made of a woman and made under the law, after he had perfectly obeyed the law for us, he was made a curſe for us, by dying the accurſed death of the croſs, that he might redeem us from the curſe of the law, and reconcile us to God: The blood of one who was God as well as man, and (hence called <hi>the blood of God,</hi> Acts xx. 28.) being of <hi>infinite merit.</hi> Accordingly we read the Meſſiah was cut off, <hi>but not for himſelf;</hi> that <hi>God laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009945_0010_0F7B3AF8D65A1778"/>that <hi>he made him ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> that we have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thro' his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſin, according to the riches of God's grace.</hi> And ſo in our text Paul ſaith we are juſtified freely by God's grace <hi>thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that it appears now, we are welcome to juſtification for Chriſt's ſake, without bringing any thing of our own to recommend us to God. We are juſtified only by Chriſt; and tho' our juſtification coſt him his heart's blood, he having paid the utmoſt farthing for it; yet this glorious priviledge comes freely to us; it comes of <hi>meer grace;</hi> not by the grace that is wrought <hi>in us,</hi> as papiſts teach, confounding juſtification with ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but by the gracious favour of God to us, without any worthineſs at all.</p>
            <p>'TIS ſaid Joſeph <hi>found grace in the eyes of his</hi> maſter, Gen. xxxix. v. 4. But there was a reaſon for it: <hi>He ſaw that every thing that he did proſpered.</hi> There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Joſeph to invite that grace. But the favour of God comes to us thro' Chriſt <hi>freely: freely:</hi> Freely and grace ſignify the ſame thing: The truth is <hi>doubled</hi> that it may be the more <hi>eſtabliſhed.</hi> There is not a ſweeter paſſage in the whole bible; 'tis enough to make the heart of any one that believes it <hi>leap for joy.</hi> That alſo which I mentioned before is ſimilar: We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thro' his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of God's grace; i. e. according to the exceeding, abundant and overflowing grace and mercy of God. Agreeably hereto, Iſaiah ſaith, chap. lv. v. 1. in the name of God, Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters—and in Rev. xxii. v. 17. we read—Whoſoever will <hi>let him take of the water of life freely.</hi> So that it is plain that as things now are, as Chriſt hath wrought out redemption<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſt redeems us by power as well as price, but the latter is here chiefly ſpoken of.</note> for us, we are all of us welcome to the pardon
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009945_0011_0F7B3AF94D6DDDC0"/>of ſin, and the juſtification of our perſons, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of our own to recommend us to the divine favour. Nor, let any perplex the doctrine of free grace with the divine decree. We muſt not blend the grant and the decree together. But conſider the grant abſtractedly from the decree, otherwiſe we ſhall make confuſion, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, tho' the apoſtles held the divine decree, they preached juſtification as freely as if there had been no decree at all. And, in imitation of them, we may ſay to every one who comes to hear the goſpel, <hi>to you is the word of this ſalvation ſent; thro' this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> and the juſtification of your perſons. Nor let any one think that the goſpel is to be preached thus; that men are welcome to be juſtified for Chriſt's ſake <hi>if they have</hi> faith. If they know they have not faith, they are welcome <hi>now,</hi> believing our text to be true, to apply to themſelves <note n="†" place="bottom">Great oppoſition hath been made of late, to the appropriation of faith; and that not only from the <hi>Arminian</hi> quarter, but from ſome who <hi>moſt clearly</hi> maintain juſtification by <hi>Chriſt alone.</hi> And yet it muſt needs be that there was appropriation in Abraham's faith; and if in his, then in our's. For Paul inſiſts (Rom. IV.) that all believers are juſtified the ſame way with father Abraham But if he appropriated, and we do not; then he was juſtified one way, and we another; there is an eſſential difference between his juſtifying faith and our's. If the divinity of our opponents is true, it don't appear that the goſpel of peace will, when believed, bring any rational peace into the ſoul. If, as the author of the letters on <hi>Theron and Aſpaſio</hi> ſaith (Vol. II. p. 83.) When a man hath juſtifying ſaith in the higheſt degree, he ſees himſelf entirely at the ſovereign mercy of God, <hi>without any claim on God whatſoever,</hi> by virtue of his promiſes; what ground will he have for peace? For when a reaſonable creature is in danger, it is but reaſonable to be afraid. <hi>I will truſt and not be afraid,</hi> ſaith Iſaiah xii. v. 2. implying, that till a man ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſafe, he muſt be <hi>afraid</hi> or <hi>ſtupid.</hi> 'Tis obſervable, that theſe writers are ſo far from treading in the footſteps of the flock, that one may challenge them to find, if they can, in the writings of any learned divines from the beginning, <hi>their</hi> doctrine of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free juſtification,</hi> and yet <hi>no ground</hi> for <hi>appropriation.</hi> They will ſay, 'tis enough that it is in the bible. But if it were really there (as I am perſuaded it is not) it would be ſtrange, if it were to be found only in the bible and in their writings. For 'tis not eaſy to believe that the true goſpel of Chriſt hath been hid from ſo many ages and generations, but in theſe laſt days hath been revealed to Mr. <hi>Glas</hi> and his adherents.
<p>I finiſh with noting, ſo great is the force of truth, that the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned writer is ſometimes very friendly to that doctrine, which at other times he takes ſuch pains to confute. But no where more ſo than in the ſimile (which muſt be underſtood as giving his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) of a rich man's cauſing to be proclaimed in a time of famine: <q>Whoſoever will, let him come and take corn at my granary freely; and the ſtarving perſon's ſeeing himſelf meant by the proclamation, and encouraging himſelf, that he ſhould not ſtarve or want, becauſe he was faithful who had promiſed.</q> Vol. II. p. 306. Neither Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> nor any of us, ever held any other appropriation, than what is evidently contained in this ſimile.</p>
               </note> the redemption purchaſed by Chriſt,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009945_0012_0F7B3AFA01559D20"/>or to expect juſtification from God for his ſake. For all things are now ready; the chief of ſinners are welcome; and him that cometh to God for juſtification, encouraged by God's word, <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I NOW proceed to improve and apply the diſcourſe, And</p>
            <p n="1">I. HENCE we learn the woful depravity of man by the fall of Adam, for <hi>all have ſinned</hi> and come ſhort of <hi>the glory of God.</hi> Indeed God made man upright; he made him little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honour. But how is the gold become dim, and the fine gold changed! Man, once almoſt angelick, is now become lower than the beaſts that periſh: For they have not <hi>come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> but praiſe their maker, and anſwer the end of their creation. Some deny this original depravity derived from Adam the ſinner; and ſay men learn wickedneſs of one another, and are depraved by examples. And indeed evil examples are corrupting; but this will not account for the world lying in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—Mankind could never have univerſally corrupted
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009945_0013_0F7B3AFC635E8CD8"/>their ways, had they not derived a vitiated nature from their firſt progenitor. The wiſer heathens ſaw this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to ſin, contrary to the light of nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but were puzzled to find the origin. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture informs us, that being deſcended from fallen Adam, we are tranſgreſſors from the womb, and have a natural propenſity to ſin againſt God, and ſo to <hi>come ſhort of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. WE learn hence, the adorable condeſcenſion and love of God, that ſuch depraved and periſhing creatures ſhould be redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt! That God ſhould <hi>ſo love the world as to give his Son to die for us;</hi> that he ſhould <hi>make him ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him!</hi> That the juſt ſhould die for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God! Such mercy, love and grace, are amazing and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all the heavenly hoſts. And were it not for the ſlowneſs of our hearts to believe, we ſhould every one of us, before we went out of this houſe, begin the holy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and join with the innumerable company of angels and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, ſaying, ſalvation, glory and honour be to him that ſitteth on the throne, and alſo the lamb: for worthy is the lamb that was ſlain, who hath waſhed us from our ſins, and redeemed us unto God by his blood.</p>
            <p n="3">III. IF we are juſtified freely by God's grace thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Criſt; then thoſe doctrines which are inconſiſtent with this free juſtification are to be rejected. Tho' we are told ſo much of free juſtification, thro' the riches of God's grace in Chriſt Jeſus, in the word of God, yet the chriſtian world are <hi>bewitched</hi> with the doctrine of juſtification by works, which is the religion of nature.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Si pietate meremur,</hi> is natural religion; and 'tis to be feared the greater part of chriſtians join with Aeneas, ſo far as to hold, that 'tis by our own holineſs we are recommended to the divine favour.</note> The papiſts are notorious for this: And would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009945_0014_0F7B3AFD30A0BEE8"/>to God proteſtant countries were ſtrangers to it! But, alas, there is ſuch a byaſs to the old covenant in men's hearts, and the blood of Chriſt not appearing precious as the ſcripture ſaith it is, 'tis thought ſafer to preach juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as it were by the works of the law: So that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are often taught to believe, that if they do as well as they can, what is wanting in their own righteouſneſs ſhall be made up by Chriſt's righteouſneſs; and having the obedience of <hi>two</hi> to depend upon, Chriſt's obedience and their own, they may with humility expect juſtification from God. This divinity is as contrary to Paul's in the text, as darkneſs is to light. We may learn hence alſo to reject that <hi>new goſpel,</hi> which hath lately been maintained from the preſs, <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> ſaith, a ſinner apprehending God's wrath, looks on the law as amiable and glorious, and conſequently loves the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver <hi>before</hi> he believes the goſpel to be true. <hi>Dialog. p.</hi> 27. So Theron, when converted by Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> the ſecond time, is ſuppoſed to love God ſome time before he believes. Page 194. And 'tis his ſtanding divinity in all his writings, that repentance is <hi>before</hi> faith. And all the Calviniſts who differ from him in this, muſt wear the name of <hi>Antinomians.</hi> As Mr. <hi>Cumming</hi> preached love before faith, ſo this is what he inſiſts upon in his <hi>Animadverſions.</hi> He ſaith, p. 12. that all true religion begins with men's loving God as an abſolute God, i. e. without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to, or dependance on Chriſt's attonement. Afterwards, p. 14. A perſon is repreſented to be reconciled to an abſolute God, and alſo to be <hi>truly</hi> penitent, but is not entitled to God's favour: He ſees it needful to be united to Chriſt by faith; and after ſome proceſs, believes, and then God is reconciled <hi>to him thro' Chriſt,</hi> who was before reconciled to God <hi>without Chriſt.</hi> P. 5.
<p>Undiſcerning perſons may deny this—But it would be a reflection on the underſtandings of the judicious, to ſuppoſe they could attentively read his piece, and not plainly ſee he held the doctrine of love and true repentance before faith. There are ſome other divines who embrace the ſame divinity.</p>
               </note> viz. That men love God, and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſins, <hi>before</hi> they believe in Jeſus Chriſt. According to this divinity, the firſt thing the awakened ſinner hath to <hi>do,</hi> is to love God, the next thing he hath
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009945_0015_0F7B3AFDC902A7E8"/>to <hi>do,</hi> is to repent of all his ſins; and when he hath done theſe <hi>two great works,</hi> then he is prepared for free juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith. But what ſort of a perſon is he who hath loved God and repented of his ſins, but hath not yet believed in Chriſt? The ſcriptures know but of <hi>two</hi> ſorts of perſons, ſaints and ſinners. But the patrons of this divinity are forced to create a <hi>third</hi> ſort, who are neither <hi>ſaints</hi> nor <hi>ſinners,</hi> but <hi>between both.</hi> Regenerate <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſcripture ſpeaks only of <hi>regenerate ſaints:</hi> But abſurd and unſcriptural expreſſions are the genuine offspring of abſurd and unſcriptural doctrines.</note> ſinners is the name given to the beings they have created: Tho' the pious Mr. Firmin in his zeal againſt the abſurdity, calls ſuch perſons <hi>damned ſaints.</hi> Paul ſaith that all lovers of God have a title to heaven, 1 Cor. ii. v. 9. And heaven is certainly open to thoſe who truly repent, Acts iii. v. 19. So that die when they will, heaven muſt be their portion. And yet as unbelievers, they muſt be excluded, Mark xvi. 16. Query, what would become of a man who ſhould die when he was neither a <hi>ſaint</hi> nor a <hi>ſinner,</hi> but one of thoſe <hi>middle ſort</hi> of perſons of whom theſe divines ſpeak.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. bellamy virtually owns, (Rem. p. 28.) that according to his plan, a man may be in ſuch a ſituation, that if he died <hi>then,</hi> he could neither go to <hi>heaven</hi> nor <hi>hell.</hi> But he thinks that when any one hath got ſo far in religion as to be an holy perſon; there is a promiſe that he ſhal live long enough to be a believer. If this is not what the ſchools call <hi>reductio ad abſurdum;</hi> it will be hard to tell what is.</note> And as this divinity appears ſhocking at firſt view, 'tis utterly inconſiſtent with the doctrine of Paul before us, viz. that we are juſtified freely by God's grace thro' the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is in Jeſus Chriſt. For it makes it neceſſary for men to be regenerated, lovers of God, true penitents, i. e. real ſaints, or godly perſons, in order to their being qualified for juſtification. 'Tis as a ſlaming ſword to keep poor ſouls from Jeſus Chriſt: It bids the miniſter cry out in the language of <hi>Sybil</hi> in <hi>Virgil;</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Procul O procul eſte prophani:</hi> Away, away from Chriſt, all ye who are not yet holy. You muſt not think of coming to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009945_0016_0F7B3AFEDF4AFC80"/>Chriſt for juſtification till ye are ſanctified: You muſt be healed firſt, and then apply to the phyſician: Get holy hearts before you come to Chriſt, and then come and welcome</q>—So that at this rate, the hope ſet before the ſinner in the goſpel, gives no encouragement: Inſtead of looking out of himſelf to Chriſt the end of the law for righteouſneſs; he muſt keep looking into his heart to ſee whether he is an holy perſon, and ſo qualified to believe; and not being able to find the impoſſible attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he muſt pine away in melancholy and deſpair—A number of ſuch perſons I have ſeen within a twelve month paſt, brought to the brink of this gulph by ſuch horrible divinity: As no doubt others have been led by it hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to chuſe ſtrangling and death rather than life. <note n="*" place="bottom">The following line of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> with the addition of one ſyllable, is both innocent and applicable.
<p>—<hi>Tantum</hi> haec <hi>relligio potuit ſuadere malorum.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> O how different is this from the goſpel preached by Paul; that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them; that he died for the ungodly; and as in our text, that tho' all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, we are juſtified freely by his grace thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt; that we need not bring any holineſs with us, but only our ſins and miſery, and yet be welcome to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his ſake. But ſo much of Chriſt and free juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication would not ſerve the cauſe ſuch divines are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting. I mean men's loving God as an abſolute God while he appears as a conſuming fire with regard to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>With regard to themſelves.</hi> For this is a true idea of the divinity of Meſſirs. <hi>Cumming</hi> and <hi>Bellamy.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> in his forementioned converſion of Theron, repreſents him as loving God, tho' he ſhould periſh forever. And he teaches us, that as the boy is not qualified for his father's favour, till he accepts the puniſhment of his iniquity, i. e. is reconciled to his father's whipping him; ſo neither is the ſinner, till he accepts the puniſhment of his iniquity, qualified for God's favour: i. e. till he is reconciled to the thoughts of eternal deſtruction from him. Rem. p. 23.35. Some have thought what is contended for, is only that the ſinner ſhould ſee the juſtice of God in his condemnation. But this is not the point: We own that when a ſinner believes, he ſees the <hi>juſt</hi> condemned for the <hi>unjuſt.</hi> And accordingly Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> lets us know (p. 19.) that he don't think it enough for us to ſee God juſt in condemning; becauſe the devils and damned have ſuch conviction in their conſciences. But we muſt have an accord of heart, a ſort of acquieſcence in thinking of our own deſtruction. So Mr. Cumming tells us a man will never believe, till he acquieſces in his own deſtruction, as a righteous and <hi>becoming,</hi> and conſequently amiable act in God. Animad. pag. 8. He ſuppoſes there is no material difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his and Meſſirs. Hooker's and Shepherd's doctrine on this head. The reader may ſee their doctrine in Mr. Firmin's <hi>Real Chriſtian,</hi> reprinted about twenty years ago, as I am informed, to prevent people's running into deſpair. After all, 'tis but juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to theſe divines and to Meſſirs. <hi>Bellamy</hi> and <hi>Cumming,</hi> to own their doctrine is not that men ſhould be reconciled to the thoughts of their own deſtruction, ſo as not to deſire and ſeek after ſalvation; but only upon ſuppoſition that God ſhould leave them, and let them periſh for ever; looking on what <hi>may</hi> be, to be <hi>really</hi> their caſe, they muſt acquieſce in this as a righteous and becoming act of God, as a good man acquieſces in affliction, without heart riſings, or objections to the contrary. Nay, Mr. Shepherd argues thus—<q>Why art thou quiet and ſtill, when God denies thee any common mercy, but becauſe the Lord will have it ſo?</q> And he endeavours to prove, that for the ſame reaſon we ought to be quiet with God's will, if he denies us ſpiritual mercies, and ſuffers us to periſh eternally. With Mr. Firmin we may bleſs God there is no ſuch divinity in the bible.</note> and returning to him as ſuch. Chriſt muſt be,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009945_0017_0F7B3AFFB1756468"/>kept out of ſight to make the work go on. For if the ſinner ſhould have the leaſt glimpſe of the preciouſneſs of that blood by which we are juſtified, he would continue what they call an impenitent perſon: nor would it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them ever after, to bring him to repentance. And I pray God they may always meet with this impediment in the work they are carrying on: May they be divinely hindered in all their attempts to bring ſouls to God <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mediator.</hi> Nay, they themſelves are not inſenſible, that another ſort of preaching beſt promotes their deſign:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009945_0018_0F7B3B0055F598E8"/>And therefore, inſtead of the glad tidings of great joy which Paul was forever harping on, they inſiſt continually on vindictive juſtice; as if the Almighty's glory conſiſted chiefly in pouring out his wrath on ſinners;<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Beveridge quoting that remarkable paſſage in Exod. xxxiv. v. 6.7. where God anſwers the requeſt of Moſes to <hi>ſhew him his glory;</hi> ſaith, the jewiſh writers obſerve here are no leſs than thirteen properties of God, and but one only, and that the laſt, <hi>vindictive.</hi>
               </note> and ſay but little of Jeſus who delivers from the wrath to come. I myſelf have heard a miniſter of that way preach a moſt amazing ſermon upon hell and damnation, without ſaying one word about Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I KNOW it is pretended that the impleaded divinity is contained in the doctrine of thoſe Calviniſtical divines who hold regeneration is, in <hi>order of nature,</hi> before faith. If I might, with deference to theſe divines, give my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I would ſay that thoſe (and I think the current of the proteſtant reformers were of this mind) appear to be nearer to the ſcripture, who hold that a man is <hi>regenerated in believing.</hi> However, the beforementioned divines who explain this differently, don't hold that a man is regenerated <hi>before</hi> he believes, ſo as <hi>actually</hi> to love God, and repent of his ſins <hi>while an unbeliever.</hi> Perhaps there was hardly ever a divine but would diſclaim the doctrine of <hi>true</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before faith: For partial repentance cannot be true repentance; and the repentance that is before faith is but partial. The damning ſin of unbelief <hi>muſt</hi> be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, while a man is an unbeliever.— And as for loving an abſolute God before faith, and without Chriſt, whom the ſcripture repreſents as the <q>medium of love, thro' whom God loves us, and thro' whom alone we dare to love God,<note n="†" place="bottom">Henry's Expoſition.</note>
               </q> it is ſo abſurd, that tho' the papiſts virtually embrace ſomething like it in their <hi>faith formed by charity; Antonia Bourignon,</hi> a deiſtical and enthuſiaſtical writer of the laſt century, is the only one I know of, who in a bare-faced manner ever maintained that a man may
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009945_0019_0F7B3B01172A38B8"/>attain to the love of God, from a view of his eſſential per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, without any regard to Jeſus Chriſt and his attonement. <note n="†" place="bottom">The learned <hi>Blackwell</hi> confutes her tenet in his <hi>ratio ſacra,</hi> which being ſo pertinent to the preſent diſpute, I ſhall give it to the reader in his own words:—He ſaith, <q>Whatever high and great eſſential perfections be in God, rendering him in himſelf infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely glorious; yet all mankind being now guilty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being naturally endued with a conſcience in his breaſt, impreſſed firſt with guilt, and next with the holineſs, juſtice, power and omnipreſence of the Deity, as the ſupream being and judge who will certainly render to every man according to his works: I ſay, conſidering theſe things, it is evident, that till once guilty man is perſuaded of ſome way to get the eſſential perfections of infinite juſtice and power in the Deity reconciled to him, he can never love God, nor delight in him; but on the contrary, with guilty Adam, will run trembling away from him. So that it is clear to reaſon, that the more excellencies guilty man ſeeth in the Deity, ſo much the more terrible, inſtead of amiable, doth God become unto him.</q>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is true, the doctrine of loving God, abſolutely conſidered, upon the account of his eſſential excellencies, diſplayed in creating and preſerving goodneſs, would indeed do well for man, were he now <hi>innocent Adam,</hi> without guilt, or the leaſt ſenſe of it, and had withal God gloriouſly diſplaying his eſſential perfections, in an unſpoiled and beautiful univerſe, crowning him as the head and lord thereof, and tranſacting covenant with him as ſuch. But to preach the divine perfections, out of Chriſt, to be lovely or engaging to guilty, unconverted man, is plainly to ſay, that the great wiſdom, power and faithfulneſs of the judge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth him ſo much the more to the guilty pannel: Which how far reaſon can believe, ſeemeth not hard to determine.</q>— He goes on—<q>To ſet this matter in a clearer light—let it be conſidered, that all mankind is guilty, loveth ſin naturally, and goeth on in it; and on the other hand, bears an impreſſion of the divine juſtice and power: So from theſe two, there naturally riſeth a ſtrong enmity in man, againſt the Deity; as ſeeing that he cannot pleaſe himſelf, without incurring at the ſame time the diſpleaſure of God, as we are plainly told, Coloſſ. I. 21. that man becometh an enemy in his mind to God. And if it be aſked how this enmity ariſeth? it is anſwered, by wicked works. As if the apoſtle had ſaid, that man by his natural love to ſin, and daily practicing of it, firſt makes his conſcience guilty, and then his guilty conſcience cauſeth an holy, juſt and powerful God to become terrible to him.

THE truth is, this doctrine, make the beſt of it, hath a deiſtical aſpect; and 'tis pity any of Chriſt's miniſters ſhould attempt to <hi>chriſten</hi> it. Oh how revived would <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Deiſts</hi> be to find chriſtian divines harmonize with them ſo far, as to hold a man may be a true lover of God from a view of his eſſential perfections without any regard to that Meſſiah whom they hate? This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly doing the infidels a pleaſure; and they muſt be <hi>very ſtupid,</hi> if they are not <hi>very glad,</hi> when ſuch affronts are offered to the Son of God. Here 'tis natural to aſk ſuch divines a queſtion, viz. Where are men to get that love and repentance, which they are ſuppoſed to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith? Not out of the <hi>fulneſs</hi> that there is in Chriſt, in <hi>whom it hath pleaſed the Father that all ſulneſs ſhould dwell.</hi> For they are at a diſtance from him yet.<note n="†" place="bottom">They have come to God, but not to Chriſt: They have honoured God by love and repentance, but they diſhonour the Son by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and yet Chriſt tells us, John V. v. 23. <hi>That he who honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the</hi> Son <hi>honoureth not the Father:</hi> This ſhews that what they call love and repentance, before faith, are good for nothing. God is not honoured by them, becauſe his Son is diſhonoured— Here again the doctrine ſhews its <hi>Deiſtical</hi> face!</note> And as they are ſuppoſed to get love and repentance, not from Chriſt's fulneſs; they return to God thereby, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him as the <hi>way to the Father.</hi> So that Chriſt is put out of his office.</p>
            <p>
               <q>MAY I be permitted on this occaſion, to ſay with ſuitable reſpect to the miniſters of Chriſt: Ariſe, this matter belongeth to you. Conſider and ſpeak your minds: Now is a time to ſpeak and not to keep ſilence. The honour of your Saviour is called in queſtion: The diſpute is whether he is the way to God or not: Whether ſinners return to God <hi>thro'</hi> the Mediator, or <hi>without</hi> him? We have a ſtrange goſpel obtruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, which tells the ſinner, he muſt have nothing to do with a God in Chriſt, but with an abſolute God only—And that when he hath by love and repentance
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009945_0021_0F7B3B049E528708"/>returned to him; it may be ſaid <hi>hic Chriſtus nihil fecit.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Alluding to what one ſubjoined to that proud inſcription of a Roman pontiff —<hi>Trajectum plantavit, Louvanium rigavit; Caeſar dedit incrementum</hi>—viz. Hic Deus nihil fecit.</note> This was all done without Chriſt, without once looking to him as the way to the father. Is this magnifying Chriſt? Is this making Jeſus all in all? My ſoul come not thou into their ſecret. Were the ſame mind in us that was in Paul; were Chriſt precious to us as he was to him, how ſhocked ſhould we be at the divinity which teaches men to return to God, as if no Saviour was provided for them; without the leaſt dependance on his merits. The ſpirit of Chriſt in miniſters, muſt make them zealous againſt this Chriſtleſs divinity: And when the witneſſes of one generation are fallen aſleep, others ſhall be raiſed up in their ſtead: The zeal of the Lord of hoſts ſhall perform this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it is time to return—</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſaid much more againſt this doctrine than I intended at firſt: But I did not know how to leave off; becauſe it appeared to me that while I was ſpeaking <hi>againſt</hi> that tenet I was ſpeaking <hi>for</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. HENCE let every one of us be exhorted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ourſelves, whether we have been juſtified freely by God's grace thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt. Have we believed this report? Have we received it not as the word of man, but as the word of God, that tho' all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, we are juſtified freely by his grace thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt? And have we thereupon went to God in our hearts for juſtification? All that believed the freeneſs of juſtification in primitive times, expected to be juſtify'd for Chriſt's ſake: They had not learned that language, <q>I am a poor creature, I have got an hard heart, I am afraid ſuch an one as I, ſo unfit, ſo unworthy, cannot be welcome to ſo great a privilege.</q> This is thought
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009945_0022_0F7B3B054474E268"/>to be conſiſtent with believing the goſpel to be true. But 'tis a miſtake. As ſoon as God appears to be the author of it, all this faſhionable humility, which is only ſpiritual pride, vaniſhes away, like darkneſs before the ſun. Then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſees it is ſafe for him to come to God as an ungodly ſinner, becauſe Chriſt died for the ungodly, and God ſaith he juſtifies the ungodly for his ſake. Rom. 4.5. He that never dared to preſent himſelf before God with confidence, as an ungodly perſon, never yet believed to juſtification.</p>
            <p>AND have our diſcoveries of Chriſt and free juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification purified us inwardly and outwardly, making us like unto Chriſt the righteous; for only he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous, even as he is righteous: For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh; how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who thro' the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge our conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God? This precious blood ſprinkled by faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways influences men to anſwer the redeemer's end in ſhedding it, by <hi>dying unto ſin and living unto righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONCE more: Know we any thing of that divine peace, which juſtified ones are the ſubjects of? Rom. V. v. 1. Nay, 'tis reckoned the common experience of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they joy in God thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, having received the attonement. V. 2. I know that now a days perſons are looked on as eminent chriſtians, tho' they are eminently ſtrangers to that joy which is the fruit of the ſpirit: Nay, I once heard it declared by a man of ſome note, of a certain woman; <q>that for forty years, ſhe had been looked on as the beſt chriſtian in the pariſh; and that for the whole time ſhe appeared to be caſt down and void of comfort.</q> There is no doubt that a real chriſtian may have an horror of darkneſs fall upon him, as fell on Abraham the father of the faithful; and freſh guilt will bring trouble into the ſoul. But as for thoſe who go on habitually under legal darkneſs, being afraid of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009945_0023_0F7B3B0662C72ED8"/>hell and the wrath to come, miniſters of the goſpel are authorized to tell them, that they do not <hi>walk humbly with God;</hi> that their gloomineſs is the effect of deſpiſing the blood of Chriſt, by which we are juſtified; that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any one ſhould believe the glad tidings of the goſpel to be true, without having ſome gladneſs in his heart at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>IF, according to what hath been ſaid, you have reaſon to think you are juſtified freely by God's grace, thro' the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt; praiſe God, who by his ſpirit hath influenced you to believe what naturally a man can no more believe <hi>with his heart,</hi> than he can make a world, viz. that there is free juſtification for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinners thro' Jeſus Chriſt. Before you were divinely enlightened, you could not help <hi>ſtumbling at this ſtumbling ſtone:</hi> For it ſeems impoſſible to be true. The law ſaith <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die;</hi> and reaſon can ſee no further than God's <hi>juſtifying the godly.</hi> But God, by raiſing up his ſon Jeſus from the dead, hath given us a new idea of himſelf, which no man can heartily be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to, till God who cauſed the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhines into his heart by his holy ſpirit. This in the apoſtles time was called the fooliſhneſs of preaching: And all who have faithfully preached it ever ſince, have been accounted fools for Chriſt's ſake. If we preach juſtification only for <hi>the godly,</hi> the offence of the croſs ceaſeth; and men who ſcorn the thoughts of being juſtified as ungodly ſinners, may call us rational preachers, and their mouths be filled with our praiſes. But the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men. We glory in the croſs of Chriſt. The applauſes of all the men upon earth are contemned. This is our divine joy, our glory and honour, that we are counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame, for preaching <hi>free juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for ungodly ſinners, thro' the redemption there is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to return: If we are juſtified freely by God's grace, then let us live holy and godly lives. Shall we ſin
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009945_0024_0F7B3B06CCE2FEF8"/>becauſe grace abounds? God forbid! Yea, rather let the abounding of grace be the killing of ſin in us. Let us be jealous over ourſelves with a godly jealouſy: Bleſſed is the man who feareth always. The ſoul is never ſafe but when afraid; afraid of being left to itſelf, and leaning on Jeſus Chriſt for help: When we have this fear, we are ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Remember we were made to glorify God; and let our diſhonouring him in times paſt, and eſpecially ſince we taſted that the Lord was gracious, influence us to make it the buſineſs of our lives more than ever to glorify him in the world; whereby we ſhall anſwer his end in redeeming us alſo; for he gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works. And 'tis of ſuch livers, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am glorified in them.</hi> O how ſtrong this argument to one who hath the love of Chriſt in his heart! And in this way, be exhorted to take the comfort that belongs to you: Let the righteous rejoice? rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion, ſhout for joy; ye are bleſſed; and ſhall be bleſſed forever: for whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified. And indeed if you live lives of holineſs; if you live in all good conſcience; confeſſing Jeſus Chriſt, aiming at his honour and glory; having an holy diſregard for your own; he will ſend the comforter into your hearts; he will manifeſt himſelf unto you; ye ſhall eat of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den manna, and drink of the water of life; the peace of God which paſſes all underſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and minds thro' Chriſt Jeſus; you will not only enter into the joy of your Lord when you die; but ſhall have the joys of heaven in you while you live.</p>
            <p>I would now addreſs myſelf to thoſe who have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think themſelves in a ſtate of juſtification. And here, what ſhall we ſay to theſe things: We have all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and come ſhort of the glory of God. This is our character given by God; and our conſciences muſt aſſent to it: Every mouth muſt be ſtopped—But be aſtoniſhed O ye heavens at this! We are juſtified freely by God's grace
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009945_0025_0F7B3B078B088238"/>thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt. O may not any of you receive the grace of God in vain; turn not the grace of God into wantonneſs. Believe the heavenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: Go to God tho' ſinners, tho' ungodly; and receive the pardon of your ſins, and the juſtification <note n="*" place="bottom">When a man firſt flies to Chriſt by faith, he don't believe he is juſtified <hi>already,</hi> or in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of juſtification. Mr. <hi>Cumming</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> frequently charge me with this tenet: And a <hi>Piece</hi> lately printed in <hi>New Hampſhire,</hi> ſhews I am taxed with it by an European writer. We hold it no more than our opponents; but <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>print</hi> againſt it as well as <hi>they.</hi>
               </note> of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as a free gift for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. There are no conditions for you to fulfill to make you welcome; you need not trouble yourſelves about coming up to any terms of the goſpel; <note n="†" place="bottom">What zealous indignation would have fired the breaſt of <hi>Paul.</hi> had any one of his fellow-labourers preached that the way for ſinners to be juſtified was to <hi>come up to the terms of the goſpel?</hi> This phraſe, tho' undoubtedly invented by thoſe who held juſtification by works, is now adopted by ſome who deny it: And yet, were it their real deſign to teach their hearers to ſeek juſtification by the works of the law, they could hardly do it more effectually any way, than by urging them to come up to theſe <hi>goſpel terms.</hi> The expreſſion naturally bears this meaning, that a number of good works muſt be done by a man before he can be juſtified; and people are led by it to flatter themſelves that they have already come up to theſe terms <hi>in part;</hi> and to preſs forward in the ſame <hi>legal track,</hi> that ſo they may be <hi>perfectly</hi> juſtified.</note> only <hi>ſet to your ſeals that God is true,</hi> and take him at his word.</p>
            <p>BUT ſome one will be ready to ſay, muſt I not get a principle of faith firſt, that ſo I may believe? and is it not my duty to live in the uſe of means, and to do all the good works that lie in my power, in hopes of obtaining this principle? I anſwer, the apoſtles tell us, that when a man believes, there is in him a principle of every thing that is good: But they no where exhort perſons to ſeek after a good principle firſt, that afterwards they be enabled to believe. Works of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> and of <hi>ſubordination,</hi> are equally <hi>unapoſtolical.</hi> Tho' a man who knows he is without faith ſhould do good works, yet he muſt not think of doing <hi>good works without faith,</hi> in hopes that hereby he
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009945_0026_0F7B3B08CBA59CF8"/>ſhall be helped to get faith. When he hears, reads, or prays, &amp;c. he ſhould conſider the divine report of a mediator, and as the <hi>Scots</hi> divines ſay, <hi>mint</hi> at Chriſt in everything he does.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS another may ſay within himſelf, I am afraid I have not been under convictions long enough;<note n="*" place="bottom">Some writers give ſuch long and gloomy accounts of the ſoul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes requiſite to faith, as have made multitudes tremble at the thoughts of being <hi>altogether chriſtians.</hi> The <hi>preparatory terrors</hi> have <hi>made them afraid.</hi> For they have been given to underſtand, that they muſt be in miſery (which all men neceſſarily hate and ſhun) for a long time; that 'tis probable the <hi>arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> will ſtick in them, weeks and months, if not years. Nay, a certain divine tells awakened ſinners, they muſt not think much of it, if they are under a <hi>ſpirit of bondage</hi> ten or twenty years, before they find mercy, if ever they find mercy. Such evil and diſgraceful accounts of the chriſtian religion are owing partly to a ſort of legal zeal againſt ſin: Chriſt and his attonement and free grace being out of ſight, it ſeems agreeable to vindictive juſtice, that the ſinner, eſpecially if he hath been a great ſinner, ſhould ſuffer a great deal for his ſins in his own perſon. But chiefly to men's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own experiences the rule, inſtead of the word of God. For 'tis as clear as the meridian ſun, from the preaching of the apoſtles, that they were ignorant of this <hi>preliminary divinity.</hi> They knew nothing of the art of getting people thro' the ſeveral ſtages of attrition, contrition, and humiliation; of worrying them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtep by ſtep, from lower to higher degrees of horror and diſtreſs: And one may be <hi>bold in God</hi> to ſay, that treatiſes of this kind, however pious and learned the authors were, ſerve to <hi>guide</hi> ſouls away from Jeſus Chriſt.</note> 'tis but a few days, or perhaps a leſs ſpace, that I have been in earneſt about religion; ſurely I am not yet prepared for juſtification. Conviction of ſin is needful: Were there nothing elſe, that deſcription of believers would prove it; where they are ſaid to have <hi>fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before them.</hi> Heb. vi. v. 18. But how long a time were thoſe thouſands under convictions, who were wrought upon by Peter's preaching? How long the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the jailor, or <hi>Zaccheus?</hi> The latter had only a deſire to ſee what ſort of a man Chriſt was, that he might deſcribe him to others—How ſoon did he believe to ſalvation? A man may go into a chriſtian aſſembly ſtupid and unconcerned about the one thing needful, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009945_0027_0F7B3B09453DDF88"/>yet go home to his houſe juſtify'd, and an heir of heaven. The ſcripture don't at all encourage this round about way: <hi>To-day, while it is called to-day,</hi> we are to <hi>hear God's</hi> voice: <hi>Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> Hear Paul—<hi>The righteouſneſs which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven? (that is to bring Chriſt down from above) Or, who ſhall deſcend into the deep? (that is to bring Chriſt up again from the dead)—But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is the word of faith which we preach. That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs. Believing with the heart, we are juſtified in a moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if we begin with believing what the God of truth hath ſaid, the foundation is divine, and our religion will be laſting: Otherwiſe, it will be as <hi>the morning cloud and as the early dew, which ſuddenly paſſeth away.</hi> Hence it is, that ſo many of late years, who made <hi>a fair ſhew in the fleſh,</hi> and even boaſted of their <hi>aſſurance of eternal life,</hi> have returned like the <hi>dog to his vomit, and like the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> Nay, too many of them are ſome of the moſt hardned and wicked people in the land. Theſe perſons never <hi>knew any thing yet as they ought to know.</hi> Their religion was made up of <hi>diſtracting fears</hi> and <hi>enthuſiaſtical joys.</hi> They never yet believed that <hi>Jeſus was the Chriſt.</hi> They attained to what they themſelves, and others, thought <hi>more ſpiritual and ſublime.</hi> But this <hi>low experience</hi> they were ſtrangers to—otherwiſe they would have <hi>been born of God,</hi> and have kept the commandments of Jeſus Chriſt. 1 John V. 1.5. If you receive the goſpel <hi>as the word of God,</hi> it <hi>will work effectually;</hi> you will put your truſt in Chriſt alone for juſtification; and <hi>the lives you live in the fleſh, you will live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved you and gave himſelf for you:</hi> Which precious faith, God of his infinite mercy, beſtow on us all, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. AMEN.</p>

            <p>HAVING ſhewn, in a printed letter to Mr. <hi>Cumming,</hi> that there was no blaſphemy, in my ſaying <hi>no man can love God while he looks on him as a being that will damn him:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Cumming</hi> owned that was the point in diſpute between him and me.</note> Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> in his Remarks upon it, attempts to prove by four formal ſyllogiſms, what no body will deny, viz. <q>That God is amiable and to be loved by us, tho' he deſtroys impenitent ſinners.</q> And to ſhew the greatneſs and danger of my error in differing from him (tho' I had told him and the world, that in this point, I was like-minded) he makes the following ſuppoſition, viz.—<q>That when Chriſt at the day of judgment, hath pronounced <hi>depart ye curſed</hi> upon the wicked: after this final ſentence, I am admitted to heaven, to hear the hallelujahs of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and preach as a <hi>Separatiſt,</hi> the ſame doctrine that I preached on earth; that hereby I ſhould raiſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible indignation in the world above; and all heaven would cry out at once, begone you blaſphemer, down to hell, your proper place.</q> Rem. p. 7.8.—Tho' it were eaſy to make many remarks on this abſurd ſuppoſition; my deſign is only to take notice of that part of it where he repreſents me as a <hi>ſeparatiſt</hi> in heaven, which was no doubt occaſioned by my being in his judgment, a <hi>ſeparatiſt</hi> on earth. And inaſmuch as ſome others, for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per information, have run into the ſame miſtake, I have thought fit to ſet the matter in a clear light. And for this purpoſe, would have it obſerved, that when my people (the ſecond ſociety to which I preached in Boſton) called me, they declared their deſign was to be only a diſtinct, but not a ſeparate church; and that after ſome time I gave
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009945_0029_0F7B3B0A822587B0"/>a public anſwer, teſtifying, that it was in <hi>that view,</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted their call. And (which ſhewed our deſign) we applied to two of the churches in town, to aſſiſt at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalment. The old ſouth church, inſtead of aſſiſting, choſe a committee to draw up articles to prevent it. 'Tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to ſuppoſe, they omitted nothing which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thought to be of weight: tho' the main thing they had againſt me, was my holding the Proteſtant and Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical doctrines of faith and repentance.<note n="*" place="bottom">Any one who knows what the proteſtant and Calviniſtical doctrines of faith and repentance are, and reads our <hi>Narrative</hi> printed on the occaſion, will ſee there is no miſrepreſentation. Tho' I hardly think that at this time of day, they would vote thoſe doctrines to be erroneous, and dangerous to the ſouls of men.</note> A reply was made (and afterwards printed) which gave full ſatisfaction to Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> the moderator, and all the other worthy miniſters and meſſengers of the council—as they teſtified after the inſtalment in their letter to ſaid church—They alſo let them know that they ſaw no difficulty in their proceeding, becauſe the church aſſured them, <q>That their deſign was only to be a <hi>diſtinct</hi> church, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of holding communion with other churches; there being no objection made to the council as to the moral character of any one of them, or that any of them were under cenſure; and their articles, and church covenant being agreeable to the conſtitution of the churches of this country.</q> Such was our beginning. And from that period, there hath not been the leaſt appearance of a ſeparation on our ſide. Nor can I think there is any man who thoroughly underſtands the affair, and is withal honeſt and upright, who will ever publickly or privately bring the charge of ſeparation againſt us. 'Tis not humility to lie under an odium that don't belong to one: And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears but juſtice to myſelf and people, to wipe off an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which from the beginning we took care to avoid.</p>
