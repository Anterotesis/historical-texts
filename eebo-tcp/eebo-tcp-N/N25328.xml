            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AT a period like this, when the great maſs of the people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears entirely devoted to Political purſuits; when ancient preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, or Utopian plans, actuate the views and engroſs the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all; and ſchemes of ſupporting or reforming our ſyſtem of Government, ſupply a thouſand requiſites to fill up the blank ſpaces in the minds of men; but to which requiſites there are ſo many objections; a publication which ſhould attempt a part in diveſting the general purſuit of ſubjects, ſo petulant and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory, might neither be unneceſſary nor unacceptable. A Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle like this, ſeems long to have been wanting to concenter in one point of view, the ſcenes of wickedneſs and criminality, of brutality and luſt, of farcical abſurdities, and ridiculous propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which have, during the courſe of later years, ſo ſtrangely attracted the notice of the Public, and demanded the interpoſition of the law: various publications have, indeed, given many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>details of theſe important circumſtances to the world, but every one in ſuch a mode as to be liable to the greateſt objection. The form of Depoſition, is the way in which every Trial, however unintereſting, has been given; a mode which the fanciful ſcenes of the moſt amuſing ſubject could hardly enliven, but which muſt be peculiarly cold and repulſive, when employed as the vehicle of facts neither extraordinary nor important. The minuteſt occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, ſo circumſtantially repeated, the ſame ground ſo frequently traverſed, and the perpetual recurrence of the dull ſtile of legal procedure, form objections invincible againſt the imperfect col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection we at preſent poſſeſs of Trials for the violation of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneal vow. The largeſt collection we have at preſent, is totally inadequate to a full comprehenſion of the ſubject, as it compriſes at moſt only the courſe of twenty years, viz. from 1760, to 1780. The inexhauſtible fund of intereſting matter contained in the State Trials, the ſtriking occurences of various Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:033585_0004_0FF78F79D0CB1E38"/>
and the vaſt number of Trials, ſince the year 1780, which exiſt only in a fugitive ſtate, call loudly for a completer mode of collection, than has as yet been attempted. Our grand object will be to preſent to the Public, a ſeries of circumſtances of ſuch mingled ſeriouſneſs and abſurdity, ſuch criminal turpitude and ſuch ridiculous weakneſs, compriſing ſcenes ſo wildly ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſo extravagantly abſurd, as muſt arreſt every attention, and furniſh food for every diſpoſition; and this we ſhall convey in the eaſy mode of <hi>Narrative,</hi> by which we ſhall ſimplify the moſt intricate occurrences, and obviate that complaint of dulneſs and langour, which has ſo long and ſo juſtly been urged againſt theſe compoſitions. That neighbouring nation, which led the way to poliſhed grace, and obſequious gallantry in modern Europe, which eſtabliſhed the ſcience of ſuperior breeding, and matured the refined eloquence of Courts, introduced, with her faſcinating influence, the contempt of thoſe ties of connubial love which are really ſo ſacred; and, before ſhe uttered her political metaphyſics, contaminated private life by the leſs laboured doctrines of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed men of faſhion and courtiers. Royalty and elegance ſeem to have yielded, in that country, to the ſtern virtues of haughty Republicaniſm; and England poſſeſſes devotees of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſeemingly reſolved to wear the glaring laurel of profligate fame, which France has reſigned: You know it, (meaning the diſhonour of your bed) ſaid a celebrated French moraliſt and wit, it is but a trifle, if you are ignorant of it, it is nothing. We ſeem, in many inſtances, to have improved on this conſolatory ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iom: to have conſidered the knowledge, nay, it might be nearly ſaid, the damning ſight of our moſt infamous diſhonour as nothing: of this the ſtores of novel information, we have to bring forwards will afford deciſive proof, and the whole arrangement of curious matter, furniſhes heroines amongſt the ladies, not unworthy of being ranked with an Errington or a Newton, though as yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fame and characters among the Gentlemen deſerving of being ranked in the higheſt claſs of ſeducers, although capricious fortune has denied them their well earned celebrity.</p>
            <p>To the youthful, the gay, and the faſhionable, the ſcenes of frolic and amuſement, of ſubterfuge and intrigue, of art and of temptation, now intended to be laid before them, will ſupply an
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:033585_0005_0FF78F7BB0271660"/>
inexhauſtible fund of amuſement, and afford a ſpecies of relaxation, conveying more inſtruction for the uſe of domeſtic life, than the moſt auſtere dogma of morality can offer. To men of a ſerious and contemplative turn, this Work will not be without its uſe: the leſſons of morality we ſhall occaſionaly interſperſe, will, in concert with their own reflections, ſupply a fund of argument highly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying to philoſophical minds; if there are perſons who aſſert that we have nearly run the career of human affairs, that we have trod over the ſteps of Rome, Athens and Sparta, and attained the climax of national depravity: to ſuch men it will ſurely appear highly neceſſary, to exhibit the aggregate view of what lengths we have gone in the commiſſion of crimes, which, by ſtriking at the root of domeſtic felicity, endangers the whole religion and moral character of the State. From ſuch men, we naturally muſt expect the warmeſt patronage, and conſider their approbation of our plan, as the beſt evidence of the warmth they feel for the welfare of their country.</p>

               <head>The Trial between the Right Hon. Sir Richard Worſley, Bart, and George Maurice Biſſett, Eſq. Defendant, for Criminal Converſation with the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff's Wife, on Thurſday 21ſt of Feb. 1782,</head>
               <p>THIS Trial, not more celebrated in the annals of gallantry, than in the records of judicial proceeding; quoted alike by the gay amateurs of diſſipated pleaſure, and the ſedulous inveſtigator of legal buſineſs, we have choſen for the opening of theſe intereſting Memoirs. The volatile indifference of this modern Meſſalina, the deſpicable meanneſs of her wretched Huſband, and the evidence of her Gallants, now directly pointed, and now curiouſly evafive, furniſh a ſource of ſuch mingled amuſement and inſtruction, as few inſtances poſſeſs the power of ſurpaſſing, or indeed of equalling.</p>
               <p>This cauſe was tried before the Right Honourable Willlam, Earl of Mansfield, and a Special Jury.</p>

               <p>The Declaration ſtated, that the defendant, on the 19th of November, 1781, and at other times between that day and the 24th of the ſame month, at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in the county of Middleſex; with force and arms, made an aſſault on Seymour, the wife of the plaintiff, and then and there debauched, deſlowered, lay with and carnally was connected with her, the ſaid Seymour, to the plaintiff's damage of 20,000l.</p>
               <p>To this declaration the defendant pleaded not guilty, and thereupon iſſue was joined.</p>
               <p>The cauſe was opened by Mr. Attorney General, who ſtated, that the plaintiff lived at Apuldurcomb, in the Iſle of Wight, and was worth about 5000l. a year; that Lady Worſley was the daughter of Sir John Fleming, and that Sir Richard had a fortune of about 70,000l. or more with her: the plaintiff and ſhe were married on the 15th of September 1775, and had iſſue two children, a ſon and a daughter, that the defendant was an officer in the Hampſhire Militia, of which the plaintiff was Colonel, and that their acquaintance had been only from the end of February, or commencement of March, 1781; and that it originated in conſequence of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage tenure Mr. Biſſet poſſeſſed in the Iſle of Wight, and which, added to an eſtate of 800l. a year in Somerſetſhire. made his income about 1500l. a year; this burgage-ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, Sir Richard, impelled by parliamentary motives, wiſhed to purchaſe: this occaſioned their firſt meeting, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033585_0008_0FF78F841A001508"/>
regularly viſited him there. That after the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the camp, they came to Lewes, where Sir Richard had a houſe; and Mr. Biſſett lodgings; and the greateſt friendſhip ſubſiſted between them, till that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy event, the ground work of this action, took place.</p>
               <p>After this opening, the evidence for the plaintiff was brought forwards. The marriage of the 15th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1775, was admitted. Captain Leverſage, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the Hampſhire Militia, and an acquaintance and neighbour of Sir Richard's, declared, that he had no knowledge of Captain Biſſett, previous to his ſeeing him on the parade a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> High Wickham, after his receiving his commiſſion from Sir Richard; that he recollected Sir Richard Worſley and Captain Biſſett's being at Coxheath together: and that there ſeemed to be the greateſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy between Sir Richard and his Family, and him; Mr. Biſſett, Captain Leverſage ſaid, ſeemed to him a man of faſhion, and extenſive intimacy with the brighter circle of ſociety. At the breaking up of the camp, he came with Sir Richard's family to Lewes, and viſited alſo at Maidſtone. Mr. Biſtett had lodgings at Lewes, and was frequently at Sir Richard's houſe there. On Sunday the 18th of November, Lady Worſley drank tea and ſupped at the houſe of Captain Leverſage, at Lewes, on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the Captain and his family; Captain Biſſett came with her. Sir Richard Worſley did not come in purſuance of the invitation, but about ten o'clock in the evening, ſent an apology by Captain Worſley, that he was not well and wiſhed to be excuſed; that he could not attend that evening, and was then taking ſome ſack whey for his indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>This invitation to Captain Leverſage's houſe was gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral: married ladies, as well as their huſbands, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited. Lady Worſley came about ſeven o'clock in the evening. This friendly aſſembly, Lady Worſley was the firſt who attempted to break up: ſhe intimated a deſire to part between twelve and one o'clock. Mrs. Lever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was apprehenſive, that the company was not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to her, by her eagerneſs to go, and wiſhed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033585_0009_0FF78F85DC8B2100"/>
her not to urge her departure; Lady Worſley ſat down again, and Captain Biſſett looking at his watch, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to her Ladyſhip, ſaid, Don't go yet; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſhe ſtaid till a quarter paſt one.</p>
               <p>On their departure, Captain Leverſage took a light, intending to accompany them home, Sir Richard's houſe being nearly oppoſite; he went within a few yards of the door, when Captain Biſſett begged he would not give himſelf any further trouble; on this, Captain Leverſage wiſhing them a good night, returned home. About four or five o'clock in the morning, he was awaked by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rapping at his door: he aroſe directly, and going to the window, found it was one of Sir Richard's ſervants, who brought his maſter's compliments, and a polite meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, deſiring Lady Worſley would come home; the Captain told him Lady Worſley had been gone ever ſince one o'clock: in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Sir Richard himſelf appears; Leverſage, ſays he where is Lady Worſley?</p>
               <p>When Captain Leverſage came to this occurrence, the Attorney-General, actuated, no doubt by a laudable zeal for his client's intereſt, ſtopt him, and after aſking one or two queſtions not very material, left him to the croſs-examination of Mr. Bearcroft, from which as little remarkable occurred.</p>
               <p>A Mr. Sadler proved the hand writing of Captain Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett, in two letters; the firſt evinced the friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which ſubſiſted between the plaintiff and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; it congratulated Sir Richard on his Lady's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py delivery of a daughter, and expreſſed the writer's great anxiety for Lady Worſley's health, and his earneſt deſire for her return to quarters: the ſecond letter was wrote the morning of the elopement; incloſed the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's commiſſion, which Sir Richard was deſired to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and named Lord Deerhurſt's Cleaveland Row, as the place where an anſwer would be expected.</p>
               <p>Francis Godfrey, a ſervant of Sir Richard Worſley's remembered Lady Worſley's going to Captain Lever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage's; ſhe told him at going out, that if any body called
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033585_0010_0FF78F88F82EFAF8"/>
for her, ſhe ſhould not ſup at home that evening: he ſat up for her till between five and ſix o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; about five Sir Richard called him, and ſent him to Captain Leverſage's; Sir Richard, he ſaid, appeared to be much diſturbed; after repeated enquiries after Lady Worſley, he was told that ſhe had left Captain Lever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage's at one in the morning, accompanied by Captain Biſſett. This man had only lived with Sir Richard one day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stubbs, the landlord of the houſe where Captain Biſſett lodged, did not remember his coming home on this memorable morning; but between three and four, the Captain knocked at his chamber door, and begged to light a candle; in this he was accommodated: he was then in his bed-gown, and directly returned to his room; in a ſhort time he came out of his room and called the ſervant, Conolly, and begged him to go down ſtairs; in a little time he called the man again, and then the man or ſome other perſon went out of the door; in about ten minutes the ſaſh was thrown up. Mr. Stubbs go out of bed to know if the Captain wanted any thing, but was anſwered in the negative: ſoon after the perſon, whoever it was, came in again, and juſt afterwards a chaiſe arrived at the door: it did not, however, ſtop, but went on to turn about, and ſome time after, the Captain and ſome other perſon went down ſtairs, and the chaiſe drove off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General queſtioned what the time might be, but Lord Mansfield remarked. this is nothing but travelling a long way about; why don't you come to the point and bring them to London at once?</p>
               <p>T. Bourn, the waiter at the Royal Hotel, in Pall Mall, remembered a Lady and gentleman coming there about two in the morning, of the 19th of November; he went to the chaiſe door, and the Gentleman let the window down about half way; on his attempting to open the door, the gentleman pulled it up again: he ſtopped a ſhort time, and the window was let down half way again, and as he was opening the door, the window was once more thrown up. Mr. Weſton then came to the door, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033585_0011_0FF78F8CE9E59DD0"/>
and lady ſtepped out; they entered the houſe very quickly, and was ſhewn up ſtairs into a room named the Apollo, a large drawing-room, and they then ordered breakfaſt directly. The waiter carried breakfaſt up ſtairs and prepared a bed for them as near the dining-room as he poſſibly could, and then, ſaid he, they went to bed.</p>
               <p>Lord Mansfield aſked, how he knew they went to bed: the waiter's reaſon for thinking ſo was, that he went to take the things away, and they had left the dining-room. His Lordſhip again aſked, if he ſaw them go into the bed-room; to which he was anſwered, no: what induced the waiter to think they lay together in one bed, he declared, was the plain reaſon that there was no other bed in the room: they ſtaid at the Hotel four or five days, and during that time paſſed for man and wife; not that they ſaid any thing importing that they were ſo, but, knowing no otherwiſe, he ſuppoſed that to be the caſe.</p>
               <p>Ann Watkinſon, the houſe-keeper at the Royal Hotel, knew that the Lady and Gentleman, relative to whom the waiter had ſworn, lodged in that houſe, that their dining-room was called the Apollo, and their bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber No. 14. She was ordered to prepare the bed-room and accordingly did: ſhe never ſaw them in bed, but ſhe imagined they were, as it was prepared for them; and ſhe alſo heard them ſpeak in bed: ſhe ſaw the bed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and was convinced that ſome perſon had lain in it. She never heard any converſation between them, and did not know who they were when they came into the houſe, but had been informed ſince: when ſhe once went into the room there was a lady there, and ſhe aſked Lady Worſley her name, and ſhe anſwered that her name was Worſley.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Commande, who lived at the Royal Hotel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected a Lady and Gentleman coming there, on the 19th Novem. and remaining there till the 24th ſhe did not then know them, but had ſince been acquainted that their names were Lady Worſley and Captain Biſſet: they did not aſſume any name while they remained there nor was ſhe able to obſerve any thing in their behaviour,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033585_0012_0FF78F8E83775440"/>
which could empower her to judge of the form of their connexion. On the morning they went away, (the 24th) Lady Worſley's name was mentioned; the occaſion was, Mrs. Commande introducing two of Sir Richard's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, a woman and a groom, to Lady Worſley and Mr. Biſſett, while they were in bed; ſhortly afterwards, Captain Biſſett ſent for her into the dining-room, deſired to know her motives for ſhewing ſuch perſons into Lady Worſley's bed-room, and ſaid, ſuch behaviour to ladies of quality would not benefit their houſe; it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one o'clock in the morning Mrs. Commande ſaid, when ſhe ſaw Lady Worſley and Captain Biſſet in bed together.</p>
               <p>A Mr. Herne only ſaid, that he was the receiver of Mr. Biſſett's rents; the amount of which were 800l. or ſomewhat better than 800l. a year.</p>
               <p>This was the whole of the evidence adduced for the plaintiff; ſeveral particulars of it, perhaps, afford ſcope for remark to the curious obſerver. How auſpicious was the commencement of the Friendſhip between Sir Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and the Captain! he diſcovered, no doubt, ſome kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred virtue in the breaſt of Mr. Biſſett, which attached him by the moſt congenial ſympathy. With the view of having ſo valued a friend near him, he offers him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in that part of the Hampſhire Militia, which he himſelf commands: yet luckier, the Captain entertains as high a regard for <hi>Lady</hi> Worſley as for his friend; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, at firſt, a very pure attachment! but then comes this unfortunate invitation to a friend's houſe, and ſtill more unfortunately at this very criſis, poor Sir Richard finds himſelf indiſpoſed, and is neceſſitated to remain at home, nurſing himſelf with ſack whey, whilſt the ſcheme of his blackeſt diſhonour is planning; his wife and her lover, tempted by the opportunity, at once forfeit all their claims to virtue, and elope: the romantic attachment of the friends, is in a moment diſſolved. Sir Richard, with a patience truly exemplary, waits till five in the morning, and then ſends his man to beg his Lady to return home; he comes back with the doleful inteligence, that ſhe has
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033585_0013_0FF78F9063515220"/>
left the houſe where ſhe ſupped, ſome hours, in company with her guardian Captain. Sir Richard is ſtark raving mad at this news, and immediately repairs to his friend's houſe; after alarming the whole neighbourhood, he can gain no better tidings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but here the prudence of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the Attorney-General, interrupted Captain Lever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage's evidence, and prevented our hearing thoſe effecting burſts of tender anxiety, which muſt have placed Sir Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's character in the moſt amiable point of view; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let us in pity hope, that the ſituation of his mind was not ſo cruelly agonizing, as to have rendered Shakeſpear's lines applicable to him:
<q>
                     <l>Not Poppy, nor Mandragora, not all the drowſy Syrups of the Eaſt,</l>
                     <l>Shall medicine thee, to that ſweet ſleep, which thou had'ſt yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</l>
                  </q>
We will rather ſuppoſe that another potion of that ſack whey which unqueſtionably ſupported him during the abſence of Lady Worſley, reſtored tranquility to his ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated mind; we cannot even imagine, that his reſentment was ſo bitter, as to induce him to order his ſervants to penetrate the room where there Lady ſlept, and thereby give occaſion to thoſe pathetic remonſtrances, which his friend Captain B. was obliged to make uſe of to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious waiting-woman, who ſo impertinently intruded them into the preſence of <hi>a lady of quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The evidence for the defendant now came forwards; and Mr. Bearcroft, in anſwer to this evidence, did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make any defence in controvertion of the charge exhibited againſt the defendant, but was very ready to admit, that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. The only queſtion which then remained was upon the ſubject of damages; in mitigation of which only he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his client; and did not doubt to prove, to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the jury, that Sir Richard not only acquieſced under repeated acts of his own diſhonour with various perſons, but even excited and encouraged it: on which—</p>
               <p>Lord Mansfield ſaid, if a plaintiff encourages, or is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033585_0014_0FF78F961648E138"/>
to, or conſenting at all, or contributing to the debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of his wife, or joins in it, he ought not to recover a verdict.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft then ſtated, that he could not only prove this to be the fact, but that he ſhould prove by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits of the woman who attended the bath at Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, that the plaintiff there had abſolutely raiſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant upon his ſhoulders, to view his naked wife while bathing, and at the ſame time called to her, ſaying, Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour! Seymour! <hi>Biſett is looking at you!</hi> and that ſhe, on coming out after ſhe had dreſſed herſelf, joined the Gentlemen; and they all went off together in a hearty laugh at the tranſaction which had paſſed. The bathing-woman was ill, and could not attend the trial herſelf to give evidence of this fact; but that it had been agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parties, that the attornies on each ſide ſhould go down to the place for the purpoſe of taking the affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits, and in order to view the ſituation, which they had done, and which affidavits would be read.</p>
               <p>That the defendant could not poſſibly be the father of the child born in Auguſt laſt, as his firſt acquaintance with the plaintiff commenced only in March; ſo that he had not baſtardized the plaintiff's iſſue.</p>
               <p>He wondered why they had not called ſome perſons belonging to, or about the family, in orderto prove how the parties lived together; a circumſtance very material in a caſe like this: they had only called one perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the family; and that was the butler, who had lived in the houſe but one day, and who, of courſe, could not ſpeak to that point.</p>
               <p>That the licentious conduct of Lady Worſley, was ſo notorious, that it had been the ſubject of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and that many Ladies of diſtinction, in the Iſle of Wight and elſwhere, had frequently remonſtrated with Sir Richard on that ſubject, and told him, that if he did not attempt to reſtrain her conduct, her character would be ruined and deſtroyed; that the anſwer Sir Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard made was, that Lady Worſley liked it, and he choſe to do it to oblige her; upon which a very ſenſible Lady,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033585_0015_0FF78F97AAE2D608"/>
who had frequently remonſtrated with him on the ſubject, replied,
<q>If this is the caſe, God help you! you are the moſt contented—Huſband I ever knew:</q>
and that, from the Lady's many prior connections, the idea of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction by the preſent defendant was totally done away.</p>

                           <p>Mary Mariott being unable to attend the trial, the following affidavits were read.</p>
                           <p>Mary Mariott depoſed, that Lady Worſley uſed to come to the cold bath, near Maidſtone, to bathe, and that ſhe uſed to attend her; that Sir Richard and Mr. Biſſett were generally with her; and that the laſt time ſhe came, which was about noon, in September laſt, and at the latter end of the hop-ſeaſon, Sir Richard Worſley and Mr. Biſſett ſtaid at the door without, while ſhe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed; that after ſhe had bathed, ſhe retired into a corner to put on her ſhift, as Ladies uſually do after bathing, and then returned to dreſs herſelf, and ſat herſelf down on the ſeat: that there is a window over the door of the building in which the bath is, and which is the only inle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Seymour! Biſſett is going to get up to look at you," or words to that effect; and, looking round, ſhe ſaw his face at the window; that he continued there about five minuets; that ſhe did not ſee the plaintiff on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, but believes he muſt help the defendant up; and that after Lady Worſley had dreſſed herſelf, ſhe went out, and they were all mery and laughing together: that, excepting this, ſhe never ſaw any improper conduct or behaviour in the ſaid three perſons, unleſs what is above ſtated may be thought ſo.</p>
                           <p>In addition to this, there was another affidavit read, in which ſhe <hi>believed</hi> that Mr. Biſſett could <hi>not</hi> have got up to the window, unleſs he had been aſſiſted by Sir
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033585_0016_0FF78F997B916B90"/>
Richard, or ſtood upon his ſhoulders; and that Sir Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard might eaſily have pulled him down if he pleaſed.</p>
                           <p>The Right Honourable Lord Deerhurſt ſaid, that he was firſt acquainted with Lady Worſley, in the year 1779: he eſteemed her conduct as very diſſolute, and thought that conjugal fidelity was not one of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: he was intimate with Sir Richard, but never wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed any exertions made by him, to check the lewd depravity of her life. His Lordſhip being on a viſit at Sir Richard's houſe, in the Iſle of Wight; Sir Richard ſeeing Lady Worſley paſs by the window, ſaid to Lord Deerhurſt, that many young men had aſſailed her virtue: but that all had proved unſucceſsful, and that he gave him full liberty to attempt her chaſtity, this his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſidered as the effect of a light and airy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and this Lord Mansfield ſaid, went for nothing. Lord Deerhurſt continued at Sir Richard's houſe ten days; during that time, Sir Richard once found him in the dreſſing-room adjacent to her Ladyſhip's bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at four o'clock in the morning. Sir Richard pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended amazement at finding him there, and exclaimed, Deerhurſt, how came you here? after that his Lordſhip retired to his bed-chamber; he was, however, ſuffered to attend Lady Worſley, as if no remarkable occurrence had taken place: he attended her to Southampton, at Kingſton and Godalmin, at all theſe places alone, and with the knowledge of Sir Richard. At Kingſton and Godalmin, Lord Deerhurſt met her by apointment. Mr. Howarth, one of the defendant's counſel, aſked his Lordſhip, if he was criminally connected with Lady Worſley at the laſt-mentioned place; but his Lordſhip claimed the protection of the Judge, and Lord Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field decided, that it was a queſtion he had no right to anſwer. On the croſs examination of Mr. Attorney-General, Lord Deerhurſt denied any particular permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Sir Richard to attend Lady Worſley, and ſaid, that other Gentlemen attended her Ladyſhip, without objection from Sir Richard. His Lordſhip acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged carrying a meſſage from Sir Richard to Lady
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033585_0017_0FF78F9B6D166F48"/>
Worſley at the Hotel, and receiving for anſwer, that he might inform Sir Richard, that it was in vain for him to attempt the recovery of Lady Worſley, as ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined never to unite with him again.</p>
                           <p>The acquaintance of Lord Peterborough with Lady Worſley, commenced nearly about the opening of Rane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagh, in the year 1780: he was firſt introduced to her at Sadler's Wells, by Lord Deerhurſt; he had not any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with Sir Richard, either then or afterwards, nor even ſpoke to him during his acquaintance with Lady Worſley: he made no remarks on the behaviour of Sir Richard and his Lady, as he never ſaw them together, but did not think her conduct quite conſiſtent with the character of a decent and virtuous married woman.</p>
                           <p>Bouchier Smith, Eſq. was acquainted with Lady Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley, in the year 1779; he thought ſhe betrayed a great diſregard of character; he was in company with Lady Worſley, on a party at Shooter's Hill, when they met Sir Richard in a phaeton, and her Ladyſhip many times aſked him to accompany them, but he refuſed, and ſet off for town; he did not remark any thing elſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that day.</p>
                           <p>The Marquis of Graham's acquaintance with Lady Worſley, begun four years prior to the trial; he had no intimacy with Sir Richard, he ſometimes viſited at his houſe, but not frequently. Lady Worſley was gay, free, and airy, in a manner he thought carried rather too far for a married woman; he did not obſerve any abſolute impropriety or immodeſty in her conduct, as far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected converſation: to a queſtion which nearly related to himſelf, the Marquis refuſed to anſwer.</p>
                           <p>A Mr. Clark gave an account of the firſt interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sir Richard Worſley and Mr. Biſſett, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it.</p>
                           <p>The Honourable Charles Wyndham's acquaintance with Lady Worſley, commenced between three and four years before the trial: he was not accquainted with Sir Richard at that time, and ſince his intimacy has been very ſlight: he never thought the conduct of Lady Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033585_0018_0FF78FA0C9C937F0"/>
becoming; he remembered Lady Worſley's preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with a gold-ring in Kenſington Gardens.</p>
                           <p>Doctor Oſborn remembered Lady Worſley about Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, in the year 1780, at Sir Richard's houſe in town: being queſtioned as to the condition he found her in, he replied, 'Between a patient and a phyſician, there is an implied ſecrecy; the nature of the caſe required it, and that being the ſtate of the caſe I ſhould hardly conceive myſelf at liberty to declare it; but I have the Lady's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to give the truth: he ſaid, he was not employed by Sir Richard: being again queſtioned as to the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he found her, he replied, 'I believe it was never known; at leaſt I never was aſked my opinion of the diſorder; nor did I think it neceſſary to mention it, my buſineſs was to cure her; and I do not chuſe to talk upon the ſubject, one way or other.' Upon this anſwer, Lord Mansfield remarked, 'you might have told them when they firſt interrogated you, that you wiſhed to be excuſed.'</p>

               <p>Here the evidence for the defendant cloſed. Mr. J. Farrer, the plaintiff's attorney, was brought forwards and ſworn on his behalf: he ſaid, he went down to the cold bath mentioned in the affidavit; he ſaw the place on which Mr. Biſſett got to look into the bath, and believed that he might mount it with a great deal of eaſe, and without the help of Sir Richard; it was about breaſt high; there was an arm chair placed on the outſide; and when he was on the chair, he ſaid, he could raiſe himſelf to the window with great facility: the window was about four feet high, and the ſeat on the outſide of the bath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General made a ſhort reply on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of damages.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>LORD MANSFIELD.</speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
                  <p>There ariſes upon this evidence a ſerious queſtion for your conſideration.—The nature of the action is ſuch, that the defendant cannot confeſs a verdict, becauſe this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033585_0019_0FF78FA2607C8F10"/>
is between the Huſband and Wife and the Adulterer; and further proceedings may be had; therefore, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, you give muſt be out of the truth and juſtice of the caſe, and the juſtice of the evidence.</p>
                  <p>Now, the ſingle queſtion is, Whether Sir Richard has not been privy to the proſtitution of his wife? aſſenting to, and encouraging and exciting even this defendant? And, if he is ſo, upon your opinion of the evidence, he ought <hi>not</hi> to recover in this action—if he is not, why then the only queſtion that remains, is upon the ſubject of damages; upon which I will not ſay a word to you. You are the beſt judges of that.</p>
                  <p>This woman, for three or four years, has been proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituted with a variety of people; that is extremely clear. A ſtronger inſtance than the Doctor's appearance this day, and what he has ſaid, need not have been brought. —In the year 1779, Lord Deerhurſt knew Lady Worſley; ſhe was very profligate, and no ſtep was taken by Sir Richard to prevent her: he continued in the iſle of Wight ten days, and he has mentioned a converſation that paſſed between them and Sir Richard, which ought to be laid out of the caſe, becauſe it ſeems to be ironical: "That many young men had tried her, without ſucceſs; and that he might take his chance with her." But he ſays, once the plaintiff found him in Lady Worſley's dreſſing-room at four o'clock in the morning; and he only ſays to him, "Deerhurſt, how came you here?" And there is no further explanation or examination between them. Is it not extraordinary to find a Gentleman in his Lady's dreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing room at four o'clock in the morning; and nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid? All is well; they are all good company the next morning; and ſome few days afterwards, Lady Worſley is going to Southampton. At the ſame time Sir Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard goes eight miles with her, and leaves Lord Deerhurſt to go on with her to Southampton: he goes on with her to Southampton; he ſtays there twenty-four hours, and ſhe ſtays three or four days:—<hi>yet there is no appearance of jealouſy in the Huſband!</hi> This evidence deſerves your conſideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:033585_0020_0FF78FA4303A5BF8"/>Another piece of evidence is, that of the woman at the bath at Maidſtone; ſhe ſwears, ſhe <hi>believes</hi> it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Mr. Biſſet to have got up the height of the balcony, to look into the bath, unleſs he had ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir Richard's ſhoulders: but this is matter of belief; and they have called the Attorney, and you have heard his evidence: he went down there to take the affidavits: he ſays he got up with a great deal of eaſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſiſtance; that he got up firſt on an arm-chair which ſtood on the outſide of the bath; and then it was only four feet above him; ſo that, if he had not ſtood upon Sir Richard's ſhoulders, he might eaſily have pulled him down if he pleaſed; inſtead of which, he only taps at the door, and ſays Seymore! Seymore! <hi>Biſſett is looking at you.</hi> And when ſhe is dreſſed and comes out, ſhe joins them, and they are all jolly and merry, and laughing, and ſo away together.</p>
                  <p>This is the evidence which they have given; and if upon that evidence you think the Huſband was privy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, and encouraging this debauchery, he ought not to have your verdict; but if you think he is entitled to your verdict, then the only point for your conſideration is, What damages you will give—You will conſider of your verdict, and give what damages you think proper.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Jury went out of court, and after debating near an hour, returned with a verdict for the plaintiff, giving him <hi>only One Shilling</hi> damages.</p>
               <p>The whole of the evidence for the defendant, is not leſs curious than the teſtimony brought forwards in favour of the plaintiff: the remark made by the Lady, who had ſo frequently adviſed Sir Richard on the conduct of his Wife, muſt have been peculiarly grateful to a man of his refined and delicate ſentiments; when his amiable good nature prevented him from repreſſing thoſe irregularities of Lady Worſley's conduct, which their mutual friends apprehended, might terminate ſo diſagreeably, the kind compliment of his being the moſt <hi>contented</hi>—Huſband the Lady ever knew, muſt have been particularly conſoling: and the word Huſband ſo kindly ſubſtituted for that of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033585_0021_0FF78FA5F05444C8"/>
Cuckold! but how was this poor Gentleman deluded through the whole of the buſineſs? relying on that virtue, he had intuitively diſcovered in the boſom of Captain Biſſett, he with the moſt unaffected ſimplicity, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority to mean ſuſpicion, aſſiſted that Gentleman in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſurvey of Lady Worſley's charms, when uncovered in the bath. And yet perhaps, this was the firſt temptation which ſhook his friend's virtue, though none of the parties betrayed any ſymptoms of apprehenſion, that any thing wrong had happened, but retired laughing, joking; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely merry, happy, and wiſe.</p>
               <p>Sir Richard's conduct, with reſpect to Lord Deerhurſt, was not leſs expreſſive of confidence in his wife: and here the obſervation muſt ſtrike us, of that general want of acquaintance with Sir Richard, which moſt of the young men of faſhion who appeared on the Trial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed: though ſo friendly with his Lady, they knew but little of him; doubtleſs, the elevation of Sir Richard's integrity, and the refined purity of his ſentiments, were circumſtances but little congenial to the purſuits and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments of thoſe characters; their particular reſerve, however, as to betraying any circumſtances which might have affected the Lady's honour, may be urged as an exception in favour of their nicety: what could be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inſtance of Sir Richard's purity, than his obliging per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Lord Deerhurſt, to aſſail the virtue of Lady Worſley; or the good natured manner in which he paſſed over the extraordinary circumſtance of his being ſo near her bed-chamber, at four o'clock in the morning! This could have aroſe from nothing but the conſcious virtue of Sir Richard's own immaculate boſom: and how muſt we commiſerate, that ſo amiable a man ſhould ſuffer by fraud and deception!</p>
               <p>To have ſeen things in the light Sir Richard did, he doubtleſs muſt have poſſeſſed a different kind of viſion from that of perſons in general: perhaps a ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the 'poetical ſecond ſight' of Puff in the Critic, when the diſtracted heroine of the Poet's Tragedy, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in all the agonies of deſpair, for the loſs of her lover,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033585_0022_0FF78FA9F1F5EEA8"/>
the inſpiration of the Muſes pourtrays the Spaniſh Fleet in the livelieſt colours to her diſturbed mind; but her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, to uſe the language of Puff's friend, 'makes an allowance for this poetical ſecond ſight,' declares, that the 'Spaniſh fleet ſhe cannot ſee, becauſe <hi>'tis not in ſight.</hi>' The character of this father is repreſented by the Author, as that of a 'plain matter of fact man;' exactly this 'plain matter of fact man,' was Lord Mansfield: caſting wide the poetic fiction, a fancied ſecond ſight, or whatever mode of refined illuſion Sir Richard might be impelled by; he appealed only to well atteſted and corroborated circumſtances; and directing the Jury by irreſiſtible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, left to the Baronet the ſad recompence afforded him by the verdict.</p>
               <p>What the feelings of Sir Richard were, when he heard the determination, it would not be very eaſy to imagine: the contemptuous pity of his friends, the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Public, and the ſentiments of his own mind, muſt have afforded a happy combination: the impartial Public did not heſitate in giving their judgment, and all poſterity who may hear of the curious diſcuſſion, will find no difficulty in delivering an adequate deciſion.</p>

               <p>WE have hardly any need to premiſe, that the whole of this trial, is a ſtriking picture of a ſeries of excentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that have ſcarcely an equal in the annals of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. To deſcribe, or even to attempt to ſet them off in any other way, than exhibiting them developed of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal jargon, is beyond our plan. The libel gives them in an outline ſtriking indeed. We ſhall firſt give this as it ſtands, and afterwards, the particulars of the evidence.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſpecifies, that the Rev. James Altham was legally married to Suſannah Parkhurſt, now Suſannah Altham, and that they have lived and cohabited together, as lawful huſband and wife. That, notwithſtanding ſuch marriage, the Rev. James Altham gave a letter to Ann
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033585_0025_0FF78FAFF80650D0"/>
Saunders, addreſſed to her, deſiring her to read it at her leiſure; and that ſuch letter contained many ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of love and regard; and mentioned, if James Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham was to die, he would leave her two hundred pounds; and that, if his wife died, he would marry her, if he had not a quarter of an hour to live.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the ſum of ſixty pounds was afterwards paid by the ſaid Rev. James Altham, that ſuch letter might be cancelled, and all converſation relating thereto, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as ſoon as poſſible,</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Rev. James Altham appointed to meet Ann Saunders in a place called the Shrubbery, and that ſhe met him accordingly; and that then and there the Rev. James Altham, and Ann Saunders, committed the crime of adultery together; and that, on another day, James Altham prevailed on Ann Saunders to lie with him, in the entry or paſſage of the houſe inhabited by Mr. John Edwards.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. James Altham is charged with having confeſſed that he had twice lain with the ſaid Ann Saunders, and thereby committed the crime of adultery with her.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That he is vicar of St. Olave Jewry, and rector of St. Martin, Ironmonger-lane.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That, ſpeaking of his amours in public company, affirmed that Mrs. Elizabeth Wenham had kiſſed and ſmacked him, and called him "her dear Jemmy;" that he ſpoke very indecently of the ſaid Mrs. Elizabeth Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; and intimated that her haſband, Mr. John Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, was not a ſufficient man for her; and that Mrs. Wenham wanted him, the ſaid James Altham, to lie with her.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That he had ſaid that he was of a very warm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and that he had been concerned with fifty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the pariſh of Harlow, in Eſſex; and, as a proof of the warmth of his conſtitution, that he went home and laid with his wife immediately after lying with Ann Saunders in the Shrubbery.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That he had ſaid he kept a girl whilſt he was at college, and mentioned how he ſupported her. That he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033585_0026_0FF78FB415F765D8"/>
was very unguarded in his converſation, and frequently expreſſed him in obſcene and indecent terms, ſuch as we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e highly improper for a clergyman to make uſe of.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That he frequently importuned Ann Tavner to be criminally acquainted with him; and tried his utmoſt to prevail on her to conſent to gratify his criminal inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by promiſing what a friend he would be to her. That after trying every method of perſuaſion with her, he even attempted to force her; and once, in particular, he called upon her in the morning, and began putting his hand in her boſom, and then tried to put his hand up her petticoats, and unbuttoned his breeches; and, if ſhe had not reſiſted to her utmoſt, ſhe verily believes he would have carnally known her, and thereby have committed the crime of adultery.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That he called on Sarah Smith, wife of James Smith, of Harlow, and endeavoured to prevail on her to take her ſiſter, Ann Saunders, from Mr. Edwards's, where ſhe then lived as a ſervant, becauſe Mr. Edwards was a ſingle man; and that he then told Sarah Smith, that he loved Ann Saunders beyond any other woman; that he had been dying for her eight or nine months; and that was the reaſon why he wiſhed ſhe would take her from Mr. Edwards's, that he had even fainted away when he had ſeen her; and that Mrs. Altham had told him ſhe was ſure he loved that girl, that he had made Ann Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſome preſents.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The libel further ſets forth, that Ann Saunders confeſſed, that James Altham had once lain with her in the Shrubbery, behind Mr. Edwards's houſe; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time in the entry or paſſage of the ſaid houſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ann Saunders of Oakely, in Eſſex, who was aged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen years and upwards, ſaid, that ſhe knew James Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham for ſix years paſt, by living ſervant at Dr. Fiſher's in Harlow, where Mr. Altham frequently viſited; and further verified his perſon as being a prieſt in holy orders, and a married man.</p>
               <p>She ſaid, it was about the latter end of 1778, when Mr. Altham firſt began to take particular notice of her,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033585_0027_0FF78FB6E625F208"/>
by taking hold of her, and ſqueezing her hand, ſmiling upon her, and making uſe of very endearing expreſſions. And that a ſhort time before Chriſtmas in that year, he met her and one Elizabeth Purkis, as they were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the road; that he called her to him, and ſaid he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſpeak to her, and that going about nine or ten yards from Elizabeth Purkis, he aſked her if ſhe would accept of a pair of ſilver buckles, which ſhe refuſed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe did not want any, and that ſhe would not accept them: they then parted.</p>
               <p>About a fortnight after, it ſeems Mr. Altham came to her maſter's houſe, and put a pair of ſilver buckles in her hand, and immediately went into the parlour. On the Eaſter Sunday following, he gave her a pocket-book with a ſilver claſp, and a ſet of inſtruments.—In June follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he took many opportunities of frequenting her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and being alone with her, when he behaved with the utmoſt fondneſs and affection.—About this time, it ſeems he gave her a letter, and told her to read it at her leiſure, and then either return it to him, or burn it: this letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many ſtrong profeſſions of love and regard for her; and particularly mentioned, that if Mrs. Altham was to die he would marry Ann Saunders, even if he had not a quarter of an hour to live.—Ann Saunders ſeemed well acquainted with Mr. Altham's hand writing.</p>
               <p>This letter, it appears, being accidentally found in Ann Saunders's poſſeſſion by her brother, the circumſtance ſoon came to the ears of Mr. Altham, who employed ſome of her relatives, and a Mr. Luſhington, to get it out of their hands; but as they could not obtain this letter by perſuaſion, Mr. Luſhington, at length, paid ſixty pounds on Mr. Altham's account, and it was then given up.— Yet ſo ſtrong was the deſire of this gentleman, for the enjoyment of the perſon of Ann Saunders, that the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this money by no means abated his ardour: on the contrary, according to her own teſtimony, ſhe very ſoon after met him in the Shrubbery by appointment. The time being evening, and after dark, was perfectly Congenial to the good man's deſigns; for, according to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033585_0028_0FF78FB882AFE1A8"/>
the young lady's own account, he there and then prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over her to lie with him—ſo that in the ſtarched phraſe of the law, they had the carnal uſe and knowledge of each other's bodies; and thereby committed the foul crimes of fornication, adultery, and incontinence.</p>
               <p>This occurred in the month of April; but about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of May, Mr. Altham happening to find her alone in the houſe of Mr. Edwards, at Harlow, again prevailed upon her to lie with him in the entry or paſſage of the houſe. It ſeems, that ſhe propoſed going up ſtairs into a room, but the godly zeal of this good man was ſo warm, that he inſiſted upon fulfilling the firſt great command, "Increaſe and multiply," in the paſſage.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of this renewed intimacy, it ſeems that Mr. Altham was frequently ſoliciting Ann Saunders, to come and live with him.—It is to be obſerved, that this gentleman's friends ſet up the plea of inſanity; in excuſe for his conduct; and if even this plea was valid, it muſt be admitted, upon his telling Ann Edwards, that he would not mind murdering his wife and children, if ſhe would come and live with him, or words to the very ſame effect.</p>
               <p>Some particulars, in this extraordinary trial, offer a variety of reflections to the philoſophical obſerver.—Mr. Altham, appears to have been continually boaſting to the women, of his proweſs in the feats of love, and the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his connections with the ſex. Few, very few wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men indeed, cordially deſpiſe a rake: Mr. Altham's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs plainly proves it: while, lamentable to be told, any pretenſion to extraordinary virtue, or chaſtity in the male ſex, is univerſally deſpiſed.—'Oh Lud! A fellow's chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,' ſays an old lady in a drama; 'why, I never heard of ſuch a thing in my life!'—Conformably to this maxim, it ſeems Mr. Altham had told Ann Saunders, that he could lie with Mrs. Seed, a married woman, whenever he choſe or with her ſiſter Elizabeth Seed, both of Harlow. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it does not ſeem that this gentleman thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſo much, as of increaſing the lambs of his flock.</p>
               <p>As we have treated of the letter, and the negociation in general terms, we ſhall now come to its contents, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033585_0029_0FF78FBA322ED510"/>
the manner of its being diſcovered. It ſeems, that Mr. John Edwards, ſurgeon and man-midwife, of Harlow, with whom Ann Saunders lived ſervant, being one day in want of a pen and ink, he went into a room oppoſite to her's, which was not uſed, where he ſaw ſeveral papers lying upon a ſhelf, and among them a letter addreſſed, "Dear Nanny!" he ſoon knew this to be Mr. Altham's hand-writing; and as he directly conceived there had been an intimacy between the parties, it alſo occurred to him, how urgent Mr. Altham had been with Ann Saunders's ſiſter, to take her away from his houſe (Mr. Edwards's), under the idea that he being a ſingle man and living almoſt alone, made it exceeding dangerous for a young woman to ſtay with him!—Mr. Edwards as it is natural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, immediately read the contents of this curious Epiſtle; and it is much to be regretted, that a copy of it was not preſerved: there is no doubt, that as it was got out of the hands of the oppoſite party, for the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſixty pounds, it was immediately and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. It is certain, that it contained the following verſes:
<q>
                     <l>Dear maid, ſince thou haſt charm'd my ſight,</l>
                     <l>Oh let my arms thy neck infold;</l>
                     <l>Thoſe breaſts ſo fair, thoſe eyes ſo bright,</l>
                     <l>What joy, what pleaſure to behold!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The young woman to whom this was addreſſed, it ſeems, was ſoon ſenſible of the danger of this precious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, as Mr. Edwards had hardly come out of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he met her coming in with great haſte; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her that he knew what ſhe was in ſuch haſte about, but that he had got the letter in his pocket, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſhew it to her ſiſter. She then preſſed him very hard to deliver it up to her, but as he peremptorily refuſed it, ſhe began crying; but this was to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>So far from this indulgence, Mr. Edwards happening to ſee Mr. Smith and his wife, the brother and ſiſter of Ann Saunders, that day, he read the contents of it to them but did not give them the letter. It is commonly ſaid, that a woman cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> keep a ſecret; but from this and a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033585_0030_0FF78FBD50FD03A8"/>
thouſand other inſtances, it is highly probable, that that proverb is equally applicable to the men.</p>
               <p>The next day it ſeems, Mr. Edwards met Mr. Altham in the fields, and after walking together ſome time, he introduced the affair of Ann Saunders; at leaſt ſo much of it as had then got abroad: in reply to which, Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham readily confeſſed that he had lain with her, but was very reluctant in acknowledging the letter in queſtion. He indeed confeſſed, that he had written to her, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely declined entering into any particulars.</p>
               <p>The letter, in a few days after, was given by Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Mrs. Smith, the ſiſter of Ann Saunders; and it was alſo ſhewn to a number of perſons, moſt of whom identified it as the genuine hand-writing of the Reverend James Altham.</p>
               <p>It is worth obſerving, that when Mr. Luſhington came to Ann Saunders's friends, to agree with them to have it given up, he at firſt offered her but ten ponds; however, her brother had the addreſs to increaſe this price to ſixty, which was paid in the courſe of a few days:—and when finally given up, it was remembered, among other warm expreſſions, that Mr. Altham would never ceaſe to love her as long as he lived; and only requeſted, that ſhe would let him be an hour, or a night alone with her; he alſo aſked her ſhortly after, whether, if he parted with his wife, ſhe would come and live with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards alſo depoſed, that in converſation with the Rev. James Altham, he had confeſſed to him, that he was of a very warm conſtitution, and that he had been concerned with fifty women in the town and pariſh of Harlow; and as a particular inſtance of the vigour of his conſtitution, he further informed him, that directly after lying with Ann Saunders in the ſhrubbery, he went home and immediately obliged his wife to undergo the ſame proof of his amorous affections.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that in courſe of this trial, ſeveral of the witneſſes were aſked, if they really believed that Mr. Altham was inſane; to this, the general anſwer was Dr. Monro's excepted, that they had heard that he had been
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033585_0031_0FF78FC198343A60"/>
put in a private mad-houſe under the care of Doctor Monro, but that this was ſuſpected to have been done by his relations, merely to evade the force of the law.</p>
               <p>William Poole of Sheering, farmer, aged ſixty-ſix, depoſed, that he had been rather intimately acquainted with Mr. Altham, and that at the Tythe-feaſt, at Harlow, Mr. Altham, after dinner; and ſitting down with ſome of the pariſhioners and inhabitants, introduced a converſation about dogs, and particularly ſaid, "that he had a great paſſion for theſe animals, and women too;" to which W. Poole replied, Yes, Sir, I believe it, and you have paid for it lately, alluding to his connection with Ann Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Mr. Altham then expreſſed great virulence againſt the people who concerned themſelves in that buſineſs; and ſaid, he would ſhoot two or three of them if it was not for the law. To this Poole anſwered, he ſhould not talk of ſhooting people, though to be ſure he was a man of great ſpirit. That I am, rejoined Altham; and he immediately went on to tell them that he kept a girl when at college and even mentioned how he ſupported her. He informed the company at the ſame time that the wife of John Wenham, Eſq. was over head and ears in love with him; that ſhe was at his houſe the other day, and kiſſed him, and ſmacked him, and called him her dear Jemmy, O my dear Jemmy! and the like; and that at Dr. Legas's, ſhe aſked him to have her.—To this one Edward Wife, who was preſent, ſaid in a ſerious manner—Aye! what can ſhe want to have you for? What, ſaid Mr. Altham, why to r...r her, to be ſure. Mr. Poole then ſaid to him, do you conſider that you are a clergyman, and a juſtice of peace; I think this converſation may give you a great deal of trouble; to which Mr. Altham replied, he did not care for any body.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of this evidence it alſo appeared, that Mr. Altham had been married to two wives, before the one he then had; but that he had treated them both with much tenderneſs and affection.</p>
               <p>Ann Tavner, wife of Francis Tavner of Harlow,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033585_0032_0FF78FC3330B42C0"/>
ſwore, that about November 1776 her huſband was arreſted for debt, and confined in Chelmsford Goal; and that when Mr. Altham heard of it, he came to her to enquire into her huſband's affairs, and ſaid he would do his utmoſt to aſſiſt him, or to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that he always promiſed to be a friend to her, and particularly mentioned, that he would get her huſband out of goal in a fortnight's time. After this, he began to call upon her very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes every day, and generally three or four days in the week; ſtill he did not procure her huſband's enlargement till four or five months after he had propoſed it. During this time, he had made particularly free with her, taking very great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; ſuch as putting his hands in her boſom, and attempting to put them up her petticoats. In addition to this, he very frequently ſolicited her to be criminally acquainted with him, trying his utmoſt to prevail upon her: ſometimes, after he had exhauſted himſelf in perſuaſions, he would even attempt open force; particularly one morning in Feb. 1777, when he began putting his hand into her boſom, and then tried to put it up her petticoats, after he had unbuttoned and opened his breeches; when ſhe really believed, that if ſhe had not reſiſted to the utmoſt degree, by ſtruggling and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her knees with her cloaths under her, he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would have had the carnal knowledge of her body. To this ſhe added, that ſhe thought his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour ſo barbarous, that ſhe could not help cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Here it appears, in favour of Mr. Altham, that he was by no means devoid of humanity, as he was ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by this behaviour, that he promiſed he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be guilty of the like again; and though under no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obligation, promiſed, and really effected, her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's liberty in the courſe of three weeks: however he had not quite relinquiſhed his deſire for the wife, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his defeat ſome months after the releaſe of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033585_0033_0FF78FC4D3C0E668"/>
as he ſent for her to inform her, he would ſend him for a ſoldier, for not keeping up his payments to him. But, though he thus diſgraced his former liberality, he never put thoſe threats in execution.</p>
               <p>Thomas Speed, a malſter, of Harlow, ſaid, that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day in Harlow church-yard with Mr. Altham, by his deſire, he began aſking him whether he had heard any thing of Ann Saunders's affair. Altham then told him, that he certainly had lain with her, and that ſhe was very willing he ſhould. Well, ſaid the other, and I heard that you found her a maid: 'No, by G—d,' replied Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham, ſhe was 'as open as that pond,' pointing to a pond juſt by. And upon Speed's mentioning, that he thought this conduct very unbecoming in a man of his cloth, he ſaid, in anſwer to it, that he was a man of a very vigorous and warm conſtitution; and that he had lain with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man five times within an hour and a half.—He then went on and told him, that a certain lady not an hundred miles off, had been familiar with him; and that if diſcovered, it would cauſe a ſeparation between her and her huſband. This lady, the witneſs thought to be Mrs. Wenham. Mr. Altham told Speed, that he had not that experience in women that he had; as there was hardly three in the pariſh but would whore, if they were cloſely followed.</p>
               <p>Mary Special depoſed, that as Mr. Wenham and his wife, a Miſs Nicholſon and herſelf, were going to Hatfield fair, Mr. Wenham had dropped their company to ſpeak to Mr. Altham, whom he ſaw in Hatfield church-yard; and that as ſoon as Mrs. Wenham heard his voice, ſhe immediately went up to them, and in the hearing of all the company, ſaid to the Rev. James Altham, "Sir, will you ſay that I kiſſed you, and called you my dear Jemmy?" and that he then made anſwer that he would ſay it; on which Mrs. Wenham gave him ſeveral blow a upon the face with all her might; to which he made no manner of reſiſtance, but only exclaimed, See! ſee how I am uſed.—However he perſiſted
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033585_0034_0FF78FC91FAF5018"/>
he would ſay it again, and even take 'his ſacrament upon it. Mr. Altham's proteſtations, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were totally void of foundation: and only add another melancholy inſtance of the force of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſappointment, and exceſſes, the fatal effects of thoſe ſituations, which people bring themſelves into, by giving up the reins of reaſon to luſt and ſenſuality.</p>
               <p>Mary Church, wife of John Church, farmer, of Matching, ſpoke the moſt in favour of Mr. Altham's inſanity; and ſaid, that a ſong was handed about Harlow fair made againſt him; that he had often complained to her about it, and was very often much agitated in conſequence of this ſong. This, it is worthy of obſervation, is a new argument, which proves, that there is hardly any depravity ſo complete, as to be inſenſible to ridicule, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the vehicle by which it is conveyed.</p>
               <p>Among other inſtances of eccentricity in Mr. Altham, Mrs. Church mentioned, that he once cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at her gate, where he kept talking and rambling from one ſubject to another, for two hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he then mentioned, that he had had a thought of making away with himſelf; but that he thanked God that he had prevented him. That he likewiſe cried very much; and ſaid, he had done a thing by which he had diſhonoured Mrs. Altham and himſelf very much; but that he had prayed to God, and God had forgiven him: and then added, I know he has forgiven me; and how do you think that I know it? I have lately had a large ſum of money left me; and do you think that would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened if God had not forgiven me?</p>
               <p>In treating of the ſong, we neglected to ſay that it had a picture at the head of it with three faces, and that its title was, "The wicked Vicar of Eſſex:" the author was ſuppoſed to be a Mr. Whitnell, a clerk to John Wenham, Eſq. at his office in the city.</p>
               <p>W. Cotterell, of Manſion houſe-ſtreet, London,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033585_0035_0FF78FCBCD3D7B08"/>
depoſed, that one Saturday afternoon, Mr. Altham called at his houſe, on his coming to town to do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at his church the next day; but did not then ſtay two minutes, appearing, as he had done at other times, in a violent hurry and buſtle, ſaying he had a great deal of buſineſs to do. That between nine and ten at night, he returned very unexpectedly laughing and rubbing his hands, and ſaid, he was come to ſup with him, being the only time he ever ſupped with him in his life; and then added, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I know how you tradeſmen live and would not put you out of your way and have therefore brought my ſupper in my pocket; at the ſame time ſhewing two gooſberry tarts he had in his pocket. Mr. Cotterell was much ſurpriſed at his diſcourſe and manner; but nevertheleſs, making an apology for taking him up two pair of ſtairs, his houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then repairing, he introduced him to his wife, whom he had never ſeen before. That he then began laughing again, and ſaying what he had brought in his pocket for his ſupper; upon which Mrs. Cotterell obſerved, ſhe was ſorry he had given himſelf that trouble, for they had a gooſberry-pye in the houſe, which was accordingly brought upon the table. Mr. Altham declared he was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly glad of it, being remarkably fond of gooſber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-pye, and ſat down to partake of it; but ſoon after calling to their maid-ſervant, who was wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid to her in the moſt ſtrange way, Poll come, hither, my dear? Don't be afraid, child, I won't bite you. Do you love gooſbery-pye? He then took the two tarts out of his pocket, and inſiſted upon the maid taking them immediately into the kitchen, and eating them for her ſupper. That, in order to humour him, the ſervant was obliged to take the tarts into the kitchen; but returning to wait at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſooner then he imagined ſhe could have eaten them, he would not be ſatisfied till ſhe went back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ate the tarts. He then began to talk with
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:033585_0036_0FF78FCD7199D488"/>
Mrs. Cotterell, about his having a maid or two in the country, and he liked to make them a preſent now and then, and he bought a net-hood for one of them, which he would ſhew to Mrs. Cotterell; and accordingly took it out of his pocket, ſaying, the girls in that country wore thoſe kind of things, and they were very becoming, and he thought it would be a very pretty preſent for his maid. Then hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a little time in his hand, he told Mrs. Cotterell ſhe ſhould ſee how he looked in it, and thereupon put it on his own head, and tied it under his chin; and in that manner jumped and ſkiped about the room in it in the moſt antic mannner, now and then looking into the glaſs, and aſking Mrs. Cotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell how it became him, and whether ſhe ever ſaw a parſon in a net-hood before; and other expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſame ſtrange kind of way.</p>
               <p>After running on in this manner for ſome time, and having drank a glaſs of wine, he jumped up, and ſaid he muſt go to his inn, or he ſhould be locked out, and accordingly between ten and eleven he went away, deſiring Mr. Cotterell to come to his church the next day. They went as deſired, but Mr. Altham was not, at moſt, more than ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes in the pulpit, and the whole congregation appeared in the utmoſt aſtoniſhment at the extreme ſhortneſs of his diſcourſe, and the abruptneſs of his concluſion.</p>
               <p>After church, Mr. Cotterell and his wife went home, and were ſcarcely got into the houſe, when Mr. Altham followed them there, and ſaid laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Egad, I have given them a bobtail; now I'll go to Woodford, and get a dinner at Keepe's for nothing (meaning a gentleman of his acquaintance there) and a good feed for my horſe, and be at home in a chevy:" at the ſame time jumping about, and acting with his arms as if riding expeditiouſly, he went away apparently in a violent hurry.</p>
               <p>Hugh Tarling a bricklayer, of Harlow, ſaid, that when he was building a wall at Harlow, Mr.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033585_0037_0FF78FCF0D5D8A10"/>
Altham uſed to be with them frequently, running on, and talking in the moſt free and familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if they were his equals, and would hand bricks to them; and one time would inſiſt on laying a brick himſelf, and then bragged how well he did it, and how clever he was, and could even ſift cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or turn his hand to any thing, and that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came amiſs to him. That ſome time, in the middle of his employment with the bricklayer, he would ſuddenly, and abruptly ſet off, and run home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as hard as he could drive, and after being gone perhaps twenty minutes or ſo, run back again in the ſame manner, and quite out of breath. That one morning he came, about four o,clock, and knocked him up, ſaying, he muſt and would ſee him directly, and made a freſh noiſe at the door. That he then had his night-cap on, and his ſword-cane in his hand; and upon Tarling's going down to him, he found his buſineſs was, to inſiſt upon his taking a little fence down, which jutted a litle into the road, and run on a great deal about his being a magiſtrate, and he would have it done; and if he would not do it, he would be the ruin of him, and ſo on. That after, he told him to get his hat, and go with him, which he accordingly did; and in their way, ſtopt juſt by a pond in the road, and began talking about the preſbyterians, and Mr. Wenham in particular; and complained how they perſecuted him, and that they wanted to be the ruin of him, although he wanted to be at peace with them and every body, and a deal to that effect; and at laſt worked himſelf up to ſuch an agony, as to talk of throwing himſelf into the pond to drown himſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Altham, at other times in his flighty fits would talk of the diſſenters, and of Mr. Wenham in particular, in terms of great anger and reſentment, ſaying, he would fight him or any man with ſword piſtol or fiſt, and would often run on a great deal in a wild and unconnected way, about his fighting
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033585_0038_0FF78FD4B68C89E0"/>
and running; as that he could fight or run with any man in England: he would then jump and ſkip about in a very antic manner, and run and put himſelf into fighting attitudes, by way of diſplaying his ſkill and cleverneſs in what he was talking about; he was then very apt to ſwear much, which he was never guilty of before. And when he uſed to talk of the diſſenters perſecuting and tormenting him, he would burſt into tears; and uſed to harp much upon Mr. Parkhurſt, his father in law, and Mrs. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham; and what a good and excellent man Mr. Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt was, and that their was not ſuch a perſon in the world; and as for Mrs. Altham, there was not ſuch a woman in a thouſand; and if it was not for them, he did not know what would become of him. And this ſtrange and unaccountable conduct, in talking and behaviour, happened, as Tarling thought, all or moſtly in the ſummer and autumn of the year 1779.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to Mrs. Wenham he ſaid, that finding Mr. Altham at Mr. Legas's the apothecary, he began talking a great deal about that lady, and how ſhe had met him the day before at Hatfield fair, and had beat him moſt curſedly, and very near knocked him down, and then damned him and ſaid, "What do you ſay now, you dog?" Upon which he replied, "Madam, what I have ſaid I ſtill perſiſt in." Mrs. Wenham then ſpitting in her hand, and clench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her fiſt, attacked him again, and repeated her blows ſeveral times. Upon Tarling aſking him what it was for, he replied nothing, but becauſe he had ſaid ſhe had put her arms round his neck, and kiſſed him; and he then added, "By God, Tarling, ſhe did in this very entry; and to tell you the truth, I believe what ſhe wanted me to do was to r...r her. As to her, ſhe was a woman, and therefore I ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtrike her again; but by God, if it had been that potgutted ſon of a bitch, Wenham, damn him, I'd have broke every bone in his ſkin." That he then began to put himſelf into fighting poſtures,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033585_0039_0FF78FD6532E52F8"/>
and to talk and run on about his fighting; and how much money he had given to learn to fight, and of the ſtrength of his arm, and that he was a very devil at fighting, and was able to fight any man in England, and a great deal to that effect; after which changing the ſubject, he run on a great deal about his proweſs among the women, and that if it was not on Mrs. Altham's account, who was one of the beſt women in England, he could do any thng he pleaſed among the women, and ſwore, that if he pleaſed, 'he could r...r fifty or a hundred of them in a night,' and more to that effect: by every part of his conduct and diſcourſe on that occaſion, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was convinced he was then abſolutely inſane, and incapable of conſidering or reflecting on what he ſaid or did.</p>
               <p>Joſeph Legas, of Harlow, ſaid, that as he was riding by Mr. Altham's houſe, in company with Wenham, Mr. Altham being in his garden, called out to Mr. Wenham for his Eaſter offering; upon which Mr. Wenham ſtopped and gave him five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; that Mr. Altham appeared much offended, and aſked Mr. Wenham what he meant by offering him ſuch a ſum, and whether it was not meant for the clerk and not for him, and that he never took leſs than a guinea of a gentleman; and, upon Mr. Wenham's ſaying, he intended it for him, he flew into a moſt violent paſſion, and, his rage getting the better of his reaſon, railed at and abuſed Mr. Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in particular, and the diſſenters in general, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much; ſwearing violently, and at length ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off his coat, and calling Mr. Wenham a ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel and a coward, and other names of that ſort, challenged him to come down and fight him, and by ſuch violent behaviour, a number of people were gathered round them. Mr. Legas afterwards rode on with Mr. Wenham, who was much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at Mr. Altham; and called him a raſcal and a ſcoundrel, and ſaid he would bring an action againſt
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033585_0040_0FF78FD7EA863330"/>
him, for ſtopping and aſſaulting him in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; adding, that the fellow was crazy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved like a madman, and other expreſſions of that ſort.</p>
               <p>He alſo boaſted to Mr. Legas, what a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer he was; and at other times has told him, that if he had been bred to the navy, he was the only perſon in the world for the king to have ſent out to ſight Paul Jones, and if he had, he would have taken him at any rate. That on thoſe occaſions he would always jump and ſkip about, and act the part he was talking of performing. That at thoſe very early and unſeaſonable hours in the morning, he ſometimes inſiſted upon his going home with him to breakfaſt, and would make his ſervants get up and get breakfaſt, and after breakfaſt he would go to bed again.</p>
               <p>One morning in particular, as he was jumping and ſkipping about the chairs, and bragging of his activity, he happened to ſee Hugh Tarling, the bricklayer at Harlow, coming towards his houſe; he threw up the ſaſh, and called him in, when he ran on a great deal about Mrs. Wenham, that ſhe was very fond of him, and vexed that he would not lay with her; adding, that he was the only man that was fit for her, as that fat-gutted fellow Wenham, could not half do her buſineſs; and then turning to Tarling, and catching him by the coat, ſaid, Why, Tarling, it is nothing at all to me, I make nothing of it, I could lay with a hundred women in a night, I could, indeed, Tarling, and make nothing of it.</p>
               <p>But with all this eccentricity, Mr. Altham had his fits of piety; he would often deplore Mr. Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's defection from the Church of England; would even cry, and fall upon his knees, ſaying, "if Wenham would but turn to his mother Church, I would die a martyr to my religion;" and had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten begged and entreated the witneſs to go to Mr.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033585_0041_0FF78FD9A450D060"/>
Wenham from him, and endeavour to prevail on him to return to the church, which, to humour and pacify him, the other told him he would do, but never with any intention of doing it.</p>
               <p>The firſt time Mr. Altham ſaw Dr. Monro, he ſaid he would ſhew him a trick by way of diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his activity, which perhaps he had never ſeen before; then placing his hat on the ground, and taking up one leg in one hand, and pulling the other hand over his head, in that maner he hopped ſeveral times round the hat, and then ſtooped and picked it up in his mouth, without altering the poſition of his hands, or letting go his leg.—Very conſiſtent indeed, with the dignity of the ſacred function!</p>
               <p>And by the depoſition of Robert Maſter, it would ſeem, that Mr. Altham, with his other fervours, had ſome ſmall ſhare of poetical enthuſiaſm, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once at dinner with the Rev. Robert Fowler, at Harlow, he broke out in a poetical rhapſody on his favourite dog Zelio, declaring, that theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were the only lines he ever wrote, and that they were the effect of inſpiration!</p>
               <p>Such was the aggregate of the evidence adduced upon a trial, which, for a variety of ſituation, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance and character, has never been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It does not appear, that there was any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanity in this caſe, than the almoſt uncontrouled dominion of violent paſſions, over a mind warped, but by no means devoid of ſenſibility.—There was by far, too much method in theſe proceedings for ſheer madneſs; yet, if any perſon would heap a greater degree of criminality upon Mr. Altham, than upon another perſon, an account of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as a clergyman, it would be very unjuſt, and unphiloſophical. Nature is ſuperior to every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious form or inſtitution in the world; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be taught to the contrary, there is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033585_0042_0FF78FDCACE8FA90"/>
any virtue or ſanctity unaſſiſted by the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſtitution of the body: theſe, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, are the ſtrongeſt influencers of virtue and good order, as that unaſſiſted religion, and education are the weakeſt: hence it is a lamentable truth, that, in Popiſh countries eſpecially, the crimes and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of ſome of the clergy, have only been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the more violent by reſtraint.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen,</p>
                  <p>I am counſel for the plaintiff, Mr. Campbell; and although I feel on this occaſion for the unfortunate ſituation of my client, which my duty in this place naturally ſuggeſts to my mind—yet, if I could have diſcharged from my mind the painful ſenſations I feel at this time, by this cauſe being poſtponed or entirely put an end to, I ſhould have derived par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſatisfaction as far as it regards myſelf: for I do not know any ſituation more unpleaſant, than when it falls to the lot of an advocate to ſtate tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which bring a reproach upon human nature itſelf. If I prove what is ſtated to me, it muſt ſtrike at all the confidences and conſolations of the human mind.</p>
                  <p>The defendant, who is charged with criminal converſation with the wife of the plaintiff, is the uncle of that unfortunate lady—not an uncle by marriage, but her mother's brother. That, I dare ſay is ſufficient to engage your indignant attention in this cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, as I underſtand the adultery, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous adultery is to be denied, and inſiſted upon as the principal part of the defence; I have not the leaſt difficulty in ſtating to my learned friend, that it will be abundantly eſtabliſhed in proof: but although I ſhall make out to your perfect ſatisfaction, that in point of fact the adultery has been committed, I ſhall not waſte your time in making any obſervations on the nature of ſuch a caſe. All that I ſhall do at preſent, is to ſtate thoſe circumſtances which may be neceſſary to be known, in order to enable you to underſtand it.</p>
                  <p>As to the plaintiff, he is a captain of the 74th regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was married to his preſent wife in 1786. She was bred up in the Roman Catholic religion, and was the daughter of a Colonel Frazer, who was in the ſervice

of the Eaſt-India Company. This lady was religiouſly educated, and brought up in the ſtricteſt morals, although ſhe has not been proof againſt the ſeduction of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant. In the year 1788, the plaintiff ſettled his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in this country, and was preparing to go to India, and it was then underſtood that Mrs. Campbell intended to accompany him. At the time that Captain Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell was preparing to embark for India, the defendant, who is a Major in the Eaſt-India ſervice, came back to this country with a conſiderable fortune, and found his own niece (Mrs Campbell) under the protection of her mother, Mrs. Frazer, the preſent plaintiff being abſent. One is ſorry to lay any charge to any individual, I am ſorry to be obliged profeſſionally to lay a charge to any gentleman, and much more ſo, when it is a charge on human nature, which we all wear and carry about us. Yet I am afraid the evidence in this cauſe obliges me to ſtate, from the moment the defendant returned into Englan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, he had conceived the diabolical purpoſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching her affections from her huſband, with a view to that criminal intercourſe. So early did the plan of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction on the part of the defendant commence, that the huſband found, before Major Hook had been three weeks in England, a difference in the ſtile of the letters which he received from his wife.—She then began to ſuggeſt obſtacles to her going to the Eaſt-Indies. There was ſomething fretful and peculiar in her correſpondence, and he found at laſt, without any thing that ſuggeſted to his mind any criminal intercourſe, (for how could he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly entertain ſuch an idea) but he had occaſion to ſee that ſhe was conſiderably under the influence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant. And Major Hook was propoſing to take a journey to Scotland, to ſettle a difference which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place between him and the plaintiff—not on the idea, you may be ſure, of any criminal intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the daughter of his own ſiſter, but a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had taken place, becauſe the defendant had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to give his advice with regard to certain matters, and which was contrary to the inclination of Captain

Campbell, The defendant had the art to procure the father of Captain Campbell, to inſiſt upon his ſon's leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mrs. Campbell behind him, and the defendant was to be a ſort of guardian to her in her huſband's abſence.</p>
                  <p>The plaintiff and his father were at variance, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant kept the coals alive.—The defendant went down to Scotland and caried this lady with him: pretending to the plaintiff's father that there were great quarrels between her and her huſband, and that it would be infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhe ſhould remain with her mother, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Capt. Campbell to the Eaſt-Indies. All this time the defendant was carrying on a plan of criminal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, which ultimately gave riſe to this action.—The defendant gained his purpoſe, becauſe, for ſome time his niece remained under the care of her mother. The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band went to the Eaſt-Indies; and the uncle pretended to live with Mrs. Campbell as a parent, at the moment they were carrying on this adulterous commerce.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, it is a very material part of this caſe to ſtate that before the defendant had been three weeks in England, he carried this lady to Scotland, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of carrying her to the plaintiff's father to reconcile her and his ſon. I ſhall prove the defendant in ſuch a ſituation with her, and although I do not believe that the adultery was then committed, in that they had that crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intercourſe which muſt be the foundation of this action, yet it will be ſufficient to convince you he had caſt his eye upon her at that time, and therefore to that, all that happened afterwards muſt be refered. This was about three or four weeks after the defendant returned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and when the plaintiff was in barracks. It was at that time Captain Campbell ſaw his wife's affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alienated from him. It was at that time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the uncle giving her fine cloaths. Though he only conſidered this as proceeding from the kind diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of an affectionate parent, it was productive of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely bad conſequences to him. So far was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant from imagining that inceſtuous commerce, that my learned friends come here boldly to maintain their
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033585_0046_0FF78FE705E7F298"/>
client is abſolutely innocent, not only of the commerce, but that his mind or immagination never ſuggeſted ſuch an idea to him. That, therefore, is the nature of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that this inceſtuous commerce never ſuggeſted itſelf to the imagination of the defendant, and that he is perfectly innocent.</p>
                  <p>It was with difficulty, Gentlemen, Capt. Campbell could be made believe it, when he heard it the firſt time in the Eaſt-Indies, and immediately came home in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the report. I am extremely glad, gentlemen, the cauſe has not gone off. I underſtand I have now the witneſſes in Court. They will be called, and they are many in number, I ſhall prove firſt of all, that they were found in ſituations at Ramſgate, three weeks after his arrival, ſhameful and ſcandalous to relate.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall prove afterwards that they were ſeen almoſt in the very act of adultery, and that repeatedly; and if that is not proof ſufficient, where ſhall we find it? I ſhall prove it was his conſtant habit to ſleep with her every night in the ſame bed, the whole of the night.</p>
                  <p>It is to be repreſented, I underſtand, that my witneſſes come here to miſrepreſent theſe facts. They are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with one another, they lived in the houſe with Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell at different times. They are perſons over whom my client has no manner of influence, and therefore, unleſs you believe them corrupted with money, to come here to perjure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the face of God and man, to faſten an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation on a man whom they believe to be innocent, you cannot refuſe to find that fact, which is the foundation of this action.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make no farther obſervations on this caſe. It is of the moſt ſerious nature; like every other caſe, it muſt depend on the complexion that belongs to it when you have heard both ſides.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall lay ſuch a caſe before you as I have ſtated; my learned friend will then be heard on the other ſide; and happy ſhall I be if his client is not guilty; for every man muſt wiſh ſuch a caſe was not proved. The evidence
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033585_0047_0FF78FEB4AE667C0"/>
is of the ſtrongeſt kind of any ſort I ever received to urge on your attention.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Mr. Cleeve, who was examined by Mr. Mingay, proved, that he married the parties on February the 17th. 1786; he ſaid ſhe was a Miſs Frazer, the daughter of Mr. Colonel Frazer. Her father was in India. He alſo ſtated, that the plaintiff and the defendant are couſins? And that the lady, when married, was ſeventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Campbell, firſt couſin to the defendant, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the plaintiff, being examined by Mr. Holroyd, and croſs-examined by Mr. Bearcroft, ſaid, that he went to France with Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, in 1787, ſoon after their marriage; in company with his own wife, and Mrs. Frazer, the mother of Mrs. Campbell. He liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſame roof with them about two months, and never obſerved any thing but the greateſt harmony between the bride and bridegroom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft was very particular in queſtioning this witneſs, as to the behaviour of the plaintiff towards his wife: but nothing could be diſcovered that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the duty of a tender and affectionate huſband —nothing that could juſtify—or even apoligize—for the depraved conduct of the lady. He proved, that a bundle of papers which were ſhewn him, was the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Mr. Campbell. He knew the lady before ſhe was married; and, as ſhe was only, he ſaid, 15 or 16, he had no doubt, from that and other circumſtances, but it was a match of pure inclination.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Henderſon was next examined by Mr. Holroyd: this witneſs lived as cook with Mrs. Frazer, in 1788; in which year, in the month of July, the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to Ramſgate. In a ſhort time afterwards, they were joined by Major Hook, Mr. Campbell being then either at Chatham or Portſmouth. Their ſtay at this place was about ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Do you remember, ſaid the counſel, ſeeing any thing particular between Major Hook and his neice, Mrs. Campbell, during the period? When I went into the

parlour one day, with a bit of bread to the Major and Mrs. Campbell, ſaid the witneſs, I ſaw the Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r one hand round her neck, and his legs upon her lap.—Did you obſerve any thing with reſpect to her hair? Her hair, replied Mrs. Elizabeth, was rolled round his left arm, and his right-hand was in the handkerchief that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her neck.—This witneſs further ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that when the Major firſt arrived at Ramſgate, Mrs. Campbell was very much alarmed, and fainted away at his coming in.—This circumſtance aroſe, no doubt, from the ſudden remorſe of a troubled conſcience, which at the beſt of times, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could never be at reſt. If ſhe felt ſo much at the ſight of her uncle, who was a <hi>partner</hi> in her guilt, how much in truth, ought ſhe to have been afflicted at the ſight of her huſband! who, according to all the evidence, treated her in the moſt tender manner.</p>
               <p>In September the family again came to town, Mrs. Frazer and Mrs. Campbell going to their houſe in Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, and Major Hook to his own.</p>
               <p>Joſeph Rippington was next examined by Mr. Erſkine. He was hired by Major Hook as his valet, in May 1789, at which time the Major was at the Bath hotel, cohabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his niece. After living here about three weeks, they removed to Sackville-ſtreet, where they continued about two months. At this time, it is to be ſuppoſed, that the lady had made her uncle as happy as this kind of connexion could make him; and yet is this witneſs ſent to ſcour the ſtreets of London, to procure obſcene prints, which the Major ſaid he wanted to ſend to India but, as will be preſently ſeen, for quite a different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Did you buy theſe prints, aſked Mr. Erſkine? I bought ſome. I have ſome of them here in my pocket of the ſame nature. Now, Sir, did you ever ſee any of theſe prints in the Major's hand?—Yes, I did. I went into the room one day—But did they expect you, when you went in? No, Sir, they did not, anſwered the valet. You went into the room when he did not expect you with a meſſage; what did you then ſee? Why, Sir, he
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033585_0050_0FF78FF2F1285DA8"/>
had got one of the prints, I had purchaſed for him, in his hand, and ſhe was looking over his ſhoulder at it. When I came in, ſhe turned her head away, and walked to the window.</p>
               <p>The examination of this witneſs cloſed, by his deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome particulars of a journey through South Wales undertaken by the Major and Mrs. Campbell, no other ſervant being with them except this valet. The Major, ſaid he, would not take any lodging at any inn, unleſs there were rooms adjoining, and a middle door leading from the one room into the other.</p>
               <p>Robert Green, examined by Mr. Mingay, lived with Major Hook, in the year 1790, when Captain Campbell was abroad. He refided then in Duke-ſtreet, Mancheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſquare. When I had been in Major Hook's ſervice about ſix weeks, ſaid he, though before that I had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions from what I had ſeen, I thought there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing going on that was improper betwen the uncle and his niece. One day, after dinner, more from curioſity than any thing elſe, I went up into the drawing-room, and I perceived Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell ſitting on the couch which ſtood behind the door, in a very tender way, with one arm round Mrs. Campbell's neck, and the other up her petticoats. I plainly perceived Mrs. Campbell's naked thigh.</p>
               <p>How fickle and inconſtant is fortune! As a further proof it, we here obſerve Major Hook at the very <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> of ſenſual felicity, and in the next paragraph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in as critical and mortifying a ſituation as a gentleman could well be placed in: diſappointment, chagrin, remorſe, nay, almoſt madneſs, conflicting in the boſom of a beautiful young lady, while with a fatal weapon in her hand, ſhe was ſeeking for <hi>revenge</hi> on him! It is not for us to ſay the firſt cauſe of this undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but it ſeems to be certain, from this outrageous conduct of Mrs. Campbell, that ſhe would, if poſſible, have retrieved her honour, by ſacrificing her uncle.</p>
               <p>One day after this, continued the witneſs, Major Hook ſaid to Mrs. Campbell, I am going out, and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033585_0051_0FF78FF5AF0CB550"/>
ſhall be in at dinner, (the dinner was a cod's head and ſhoulder, and ſauce); Major Hook did not come in, upon which Mrs. Campbell waited till ſix o'clock; ſhe ſeemed to be in a violent paſſion, and ordered me to take the dinner down, and ſaid ſhe would not have any din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>When the Major came home I let him in; it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half paſt ten at night. He went into the drawing-room, after which I went down into the kitchen. After I had been there about a quarter of an hour, I heard a violent ſcream and cry of murder. With that I went into the drawing-room, and perceived Major Hook ſtanding in one corner of the room, with a chair before him, and Mrs. Campbell was trying to ſtrike him with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. With that he deſired me to quit the room, which I did, and went down into the kitchen. After I had been there about ten minutes I heard a violent cry out again, and Mrs. Campbell ran down ſtairs. This was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half-paſt eleven at night. She ran into the ſtreet; the Major followed her, and deſired me to go after her, I overtook her ſome way down the ſtreet. Her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief was all torn, and the Major's waiſtcoat was alſo very much torn. For God's ſake, Mrs. Campbell, ſaid I, conſider what you are about, conſider what condition you are in. You will be ſent to the watch-houſe. On this ſhe returned. She went into the parlour, and ſhut herſelf up there. Major Hook ſaid, Herriot, I inſiſt upon your coming out. She did come out, and ran up ſtairs. Her foot ſlipped, and ſhe either fainted or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to faint away.</p>
               <p>The Major ſtood over her, and when ſhe recovered, ſaid, Ye wh—e! ye d—d wh—e: ye worſt of wh—s! To which ſhe replied, I confeſs I am a wh—e, but I am a wh—e only to you. You, who ought to have been my protector, guardian, and friend, have been the utter ruin and deſtruction of myſelf and family as long as I live.—Oh! my huſband!</p>
               <p>No feeling mind, whether that of male or female, can ſcarcely refrain from <hi>pitying</hi> Mrs. Campbell at this aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033585_0052_0FF78FF74D0363F0"/>
period of her amour; and though it is, perhaps, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſhe ſhould ever more regain a tranquil ſtate of mind, ſhe may yet receive ſome conſolation in the almoſt certain hope, that the example of her fatal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions will operate moſt powerfully on the minds of every female yet untainted. While <hi>her</hi> ſtory lives, and an uncle dares make the ſmalleſt criminal advance to his niece, we truſt, that ſhe would ſpurn him from her with marked and inflexible indignation; that ſhe would not from delicacy, ſpare the viper, but inſtantly hold him up to the execration of every one within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his acquaintance. Cuckoldom, in its beſt point of view, is a crime of no common magnitude; it is a ſpecies of robbery that would diſgrace a highwayman, for he boldly ventures his life: the ſeducer, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nothing but his <hi>money,</hi> will ſend your wife panting with pollution into your arms, when you take her joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to your boſom; but, if ſhe does not <hi>deſpiſe,</hi> ſhe muſt certainly <hi>laugh</hi> at your raptures.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, proceeded the counſel, at any time, when you lived with Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell, that you had the curioſity to go into their bed-chamber to look at their bed? I do, replied the witneſs. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the name of Betty White, who lived at No. 18, and who made the beds, &amp;c. uſed to come down ſtairs to me, and make me go up and look at Mrs. Campbell's bed. She ſaid there had been more than one in bed: and I always ſaw the marks of two</p>
               <p>This witneſs confirmed what had been ſaid before, of the mode of engaging rooms at the different inns on the road; and, in addition thereto, ſaid, that one day after dinner, while at Swanſea, he was with the children, Major Hook's ſons, when he perceived the Major and Mis. Campbell lying on the foot of the bed in her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room. Here the counſel very properly aſked, what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they were in? As ſoon as the Major ſaw me, I put him into a ſurpriſe; he ſtarted up, ſaid the witneſs, and the flap of his breeches was turned down. His face was as red as fire at the ſame time he was lying in this
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033585_0053_0FF78FF8EC1B3E98"/>
manner.—Did you obſerve any part of Mrs. Campbell? Yes, Sir, I could ſee her thighs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow croſs-examined the witneſs; and again adverted to the curioſity of Betty White, who had invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to look at the bed after the Major and Mrs. Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell had riſen. He acknowledged having ſeen <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> elſe in the bed, beſides the impreſſion of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but, from delicacy, he did not point it out to Betty White, who was ſtanding in another part of the room.</p>
               <p>If perſons of a <hi>ſuperior</hi> rank in life muſt commit crimes, at which juſtice and decency revolts, how much is it to be regretted, that they are ſo careleſs of its publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city! Inferiors will, of courſe, follow the pernicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and having their maſter or miſtreſs to copy from, proceed ſtep by ſtep, till they imagine that to be meritorious, which is, in fact, diſgraceful to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The wife of this laſt witneſs, alſo lived with Mrs. Campbell about ſix weeks; ſhe attended her to Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea; and gave ſatisfactory information about the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſleeping rooms. Major Hook had his three children with him; the eldeſt of whom was eleven or twelve, the two others about two years of age, theſe children ſlept in a room between thoſe of the Major and Mrs. Campbell: and ſometimes the eldeſt ſlept with his father. The door of her miſtreſs's room, and the door of the children's room, were left open by her orders. The Major has frequently come in before ſhe left the room. Very often Major Hook, half undreſſed, has come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mrs. Campbell's room when ſhe was quite undreſſed: but always withdrew when he ſaw the witneſs</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Hurn, Elizabath Taylor, James Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and William Lewis, all ſaid, that the Major and Mrs. Campbell had been ſeen by them in loving, though not in criminal ſituations: they deſcribed ſome of the Major's nocturnal <hi>marches</hi> from his own chamber to that of his niece's.</p>
               <p>Jean Grynds, examined by Mr. Erſkine, had lived in the ſervice of the defendant in 1792, as cook; at
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033585_0054_0FF78FFE23928D58"/>
which time Mrs. Campbell lived with the Major. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that five months, tell us, ſaid the counſel, if you ſaw any thing particular, and what? I ſaw, anſwered the witneſs, Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell together in his room, I went into Mrs. Campbell's room, but ſhe was not there, and in coming by the Major's door, I found it was ſhut: the Major's room was almoſt cloſe to her's. I had the curioſity to look through the key-hole; when I ſaw the Major lying along the foot of the bed ſtark-naked as he could be; and Mrs Campbell ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting beſide him on the bed, with her hand on his back. She, indeed, was dreſſed, but the Major had no ſhirt on at all. While I ſtood there, Mrs. Campbell drew the curtains at the foot of the bed. When I could ſee no more, I inſtantly went down ſtairs. The Major, previous to this, had been bathing.</p>
               <p>It was admitted, in the courſe of the evidence, that Captain Campbell went into barracks in 1788, ſailed January 26, 1789, for India: and returned in 1792.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft's addreſs to the Jury on the part of Major Hook.</p>
               <p>Pleaſe your Lordſhip:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,—The evidence which has been given on the part of the plaintiff in this cauſe, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles me to your full and moſt patient hearing. My title I put upon this circumſtance, that the caſe as it now ſtands, is of a nature and of a complexion that muſt ſtrike every mind, as undoubtedly a very aggravated caſe. And it is of conſequence, that every generous mind will allow this follows when ſuch a caſe is proved, that thoſe who are to decide upon it, ſhall well view and conſider it in order, that the judgment, which they ultimately give may be temperate and moderate; for, unleſs it be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and moderate, it can never be juſt.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhould not be entitled to a moment's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from you, if I attempted to diſſemble the weight which I feel on my ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>The caſe which has been proved on the part of the plaintiff, has been ſtated, and juſtly ſtated on this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033585_0055_0FF78FFFB9837AF0"/>
in two very ſtrong words—a caſe of Inceſtuous Adultery. I admit it. I allow that ſuch a caſe calls ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly on the feelings of thoſe who hear it, and of thoſe who are to determine; but it is my duty to remark to you, and it will be the principal part with which I ſhall trouble you, to diſtinguiſh the ſituation in which you ſtand. You are not put there, nor does my Lord ſit there, I am ſure he will tell you, to puniſh the defendant criminally, for any crime or any offence. Perhaps it might be thought an opprobrium to the common law of England, that it aſſerts no criminal juriſdiction of ſuch offences. But you will recollect there are particular ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, and different diſpoſitions of the power of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and different courts of different juriſdictions. Becauſe the common law has no ſuch juriſdiction, let no perſon run away with the notion that ſuch offences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be puniſhed in England. Puniſhed they are, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. But that juriſdiction is in the eccleſiaſtical courts, and not in the courts of common law. I wiſh to remark to you, that there is another place where the criminal part of ſuch kind of conduct is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my Lord will tell you, that the queſtion in this cauſe (I do not mean to trouble you with wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) for you to decide ſimply, relates to damages: what ſatisfaction you will give by your verdict to the plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, when I am endeavouring to guard againſt mixing and running together different juriſdictions, when I am attempting to ſhew you that you ought not to blend the criminal juriſdiction with the civil damages, you are to give to the party, I deſire to be underſtood, as not to be contending by my defence, that you are to diveſt yourſelves of the other parts of the caſe. Take it as a matter of aggravation, but permit me to ſay, and I ſay it ſubject to the correction of the noble and learned Judge, that you ought not, that you have no power, in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in which you ſtand, to give vindictive damages.

juriſdiction. You will take care in the verdict you ſhall pronounce, that you will not by any means mix other juriſdictions, which you have no right to take any notice of, with the queſtion of damages which you are to give the party.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it was ſtated to you in the outſet, that it was underſtood that the counſel for the defendant, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to inſiſt upon the innocence of the defendant, and to impute to the plaintiff an attack of this kind by the means of perjury.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, no powers, no perſuaſion, after the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that has been given to-day, ſhould prevail on me to ſtand up as counſel for a party to attempt to do any thing of the kind. It never entered into the mind of the defendant to give any ſuch inſtructions. It would have been groſsly abſurd ſo to have done. It would have been an additional offence, I confeſs, on which to have founded an argument; for, I ſhould then have thought it an additional offence, to endeavour to acquit the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant by charging the plaintiff with a foul conſpiracy, with the intent to bring ſuch a caſe as this againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and ſupport it by a variety of ſuborned witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I diſclaim any ſuch idea. My client diſclaims it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,—having ſaid this, having marked this line, which ſeparates trial, judgment, and puniſhment, from a queſtion or civil damages, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of chiefly relying upon that ground.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with reſpect to the damages, I have but few and very few obſervations to make. The plaintiff quitted his wife; the plaintiff went to the Eaſt-Indies, and left her here. It has been attempted to call a witneſs to prove, that he intended to carry her with him. As that is an ingredient for your conſideration, I call upon you as a piece of juſtice, which I am ſure you will not deny me, to take that as a fact which is not proved. I preſs my obſervation farther. I ſay, I have a right I think to aſk you, and you will not refuſe it, to conſider it as a clear fact, that Mr. Campbell did not mean to take his wife with him, but to leave her here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:033585_0057_0FF790032A1DEBE0"/>Gentlemen, with reſpect to the manner in which the parties have lived together, I cannot help obſerving, that there is not that full and ſatisfactory proof that might be expected in a caſe of this kind. Perſons who are near relations to the plaintiff, and others, ſeem to leave that liable to obſervation, and liable to ſome degree of ſuſpicion. But do not underſtand me to preſs it farther than is proper. I admit there is ſome evidence of their living well together. And, perhaps, my Lord will tell you, when ſome evidence is given, and that evidence is not contradicted, it muſt be taken that ſuch perſons lived well together. You muſt take it ſo.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with reſpect to the damages you are to give to the plaintiff, there is another circumſtance, which Juries, during my experience in the profeſſion, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended to, and it is eſſential that they ſhould; I mean the Situation and Abilities of the party who is to make ſatisfaction. My learned friend, who never forgets even in the outſet to ſerve his client's caſe, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he reſerves his ſtrongeſt powers for a reply, told you, the defendant in this caſe was a perſon who reſided many years in India, and has returned to Europe with a great fortune: a deſcription that was proper for Lord Clive, Sir Francis Sykes, and many other perſons, that we are in the habit of calling Nabobs. That deſcription however, very little ſuits my client. Not a title of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has been given, not a queſtion was aſked about his circumſtances, and my learned friend has finiſhed his caſe. Now as to that, he is a Major, and has returned home with a few thouſands in his pocket: a great part of it is gone, and he is about to return to his former ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in the army in the Eaſt-Indies. It is in evidence to you that he has three children. They can be guilty of nothing. Theſe are the circumſtances of this caſe. In aſſeſſing damages againſt the father, as ſome of you probably are, I truſt that is a circumſtance which you can never be prevailed upon totally to forget.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with theſe conſiderations, therefore, I muſt ſurrender his caſe to your temper and moderation.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033585_0058_0FF790065F4F7120"/>
I call no witneſſes for the reaſon I have ſtated. You are in poſſeſſion of the caſe. You will recollect, as I have ſaid, you are not trying this man for crimes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but you are aſſeſſing the damages that ſuch a perſon as this ſhall pay to the plaintiff under all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that belong to this caſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the doctrine which I take the liberty of impreſſing on your minds, is the doctrine of good ſenſe, general juſtice, and I take the liberty of ſaying, that it is the peculiar doctrine of the law of England. I know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well it is ſtated, by great authority, and we read in all books, that attention ſhall be paid in the queſtion of damages; nay, even of criminal puniſhment and fine, to the abilites of the party. Nothing is proved on the part of the plaintiff but that this gentleman has reſided ſome few years in India; and though a few return with great fortunes, others do not.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, theſe are the obſervations, that under ſuch a caſe, I believe I have a right to make. I have been extremely diligent and careful not to make any impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ones. I hope and truſt I have ſucceeded, becauſe moſt undoubtedly, in a caſe of this ſort, I am extremely anxious to defend my client.</p>
               <p>I ſurrender him, therefore, without farther obſervation on the caſe, to your moderate and temperate juſtice.</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon's addreſs to the Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury—During the period of four or five years, it has been a painful part of my duty too often to aſſiſt Juries, as far as I am capable of aſſiſting them, in adminiſtering juſtice to the parties in cauſes of this kind. And if I could but promiſe myſelf that this were to be the laſt, that the reformation of the morals of the people might not be totally extinguiſhed, to my mind it would adminiſter great comfort indeed; for I confeſs I never did hear cauſes of this kind, ſerious cauſes of this kind, without feeling extremely for the diſtreſs of the party who has ſuffered this injury, and who has been obliged to appeal to the laws of his country for redreſs.</p>
               <p>The manly, prudent, and diſcreet manner in which the learned gentlemen who has juſt ſat down, has left
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033585_0059_0FF7900AD16A05E8"/>
the caſe of the defendant, has delivered me from the painful and odious taſk of drudging through that horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtory, which has juſt been detailed by the witneſſes who have been examined.</p>
               <p>It has been admitted that the caſe is proved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict, and the ſole conſideration is the quantum of the damages. You have been put in mind, and very properly, that this is a civil action, and that it is not a proceeding to puniſh the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if he had been guilty of a breach of any criminal law of the country. But, gentlemen, when you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to proportion your damages to the injury the plaintiff has received, I hardly know how to meaſure out that ſatisfaction in pounds, ſhillings, and pence.</p>
               <p>There are certain caſes where ſome other mode of proceeding is to be adopted; but this action is brought by a perſon of inſulted honour, and to whom no dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges can be given adequate to the offence. The perſon who takes one's goods and chattles, is ſaid to have taken that which has been ſlaves to thouſands; but he that takes from another his good name, takes from him that which does not enrich him, but takes from the other that which makes him poor indeed.</p>
               <p>Whether this action may not be reſembled to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the kind, it is for you to judge.</p>
               <p>I ſhall call back to you the outlines of the caſe, that which the plaintiff has enjoyed, and that which he has loſt: you were told, this was a match formed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the moſt ardent affections; that it was a love match, and as far as the ſituation in which they lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether was diſcloſed, they lived in the greateſt harmony and comfort till he went to India, and it was done away in the manner you have heard. But it is hinted rather than ſuggeſted, that ſomething wrong appeared in the plaintiff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s leaving his lady behind him.</p>
               <p>What! has every young officer, who is called upon to diſcharge his duty to his country, the means of carrying his family with him? How few perſons are able to carry along with them all their comforts: and, if he was torn
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033585_0060_0FF7900CABF74B78"/>
away from theſe comforts: and, if he was unfortunately torn away from theſe comforts here, is he to part with them for ever? Is there no hope he might be received into the arms of a wife whom he affectionately loved? Was he cautious and regardfull of her affection before he went abroad? Where could he have left her, except in the houſe of her own mother? Had he not a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the neareſt and deareſt calls of nature, that the uncle, the brother of her own mother, would have aſſiſted in protecting her, that wanted the immediate protection of her huſband. But has ſhe received that protection? I have a right to appeal to part of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—ſhe was a wh—e, a d—d wh—e, the worſt of wh—es, ſhe replied, ſhe became a wh—e through his means: that ſhe was his only, and that he who ought to have been her father and her protector, had been the ruin of her and her family; alas! her poor huſband!</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, did ſhe fall an eaſy prey into the arms of this Inceſtuous Adulterer? As far as we are able to judge, all poſſible means were firſt uſed to corrupt her mind, in order that afterwards he might debauch her body. Books to inflame her paſſions, prints moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent to be exhibited by any body to any body, are exhibited by the uncle to his own neice, the wife of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is very true, in aſſeſſing damages of this kind, one would wiſh that they ſhould bear ſome proportion to the circumſtances of the party who is to pay them. What his ſituation is I do not know, but this I do know, that poverty, abject poverty, is no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a call of this kind; to a man injured to the extent this gentleman has been.</p>
               <p>I can point out to you no rule but that which has been ſuggeſted certainly to conſider it temperately, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider it moderately. But at what ſum, temper and moderation, in a caſe of this kind, ought to ſtop, it is for you to judge, and not for me to ſuggeſt to you.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew about half an hour to conſider of their verdict, and afterwards found for the plaintiff damages,—Three Thouſand Pounds.</p>

                  <p>I am in the nature of a guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian over the infant Jane Skinner, who was then with her mother in Deadman's Place. On Monday October 16, the priſoner came to me in London, to let me know the child was ill, and would not diſcover what was the matter with her, till her papa came, (ſhe meant me, whom ſhe uſed to call ſo.) When I came to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I aſked her ſome queſtions, but ſhe told nothing. The grandfather of the child called me out, and ſaid ſhe had got the running of the reins. The next morning I took her to Mr. Hammond's, a ſurgeon and man-mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife; he would not examine the child without a woman; when the woman came, Mr. Hammond was gone out. Going back. I took the child into an apothecarey's ſhop, told him ſhe was bad, and deſired him to let me have ſomething. I ſaid to the child, Now, Jenny, I charge you to tell me what ails you; if nobody has meddeled with you, this will do you good: but if any boys have been rude with you, this will kill you. Then ſhe ſaid, Bob Newberry had. The mother fainted away, and I was much confuſed, I called in the priſoner, and aſked him what he had done to the child? Nothing, he ſaid; and I took him into a room, unbuttoned his breeches, and his ſhirt appeared in an uncommon way. I ſent for a ſurgeon, who is here and deſired him to ſearch them both: he did, and ſaid they were both foul: I took the priſoner before Juſtice Clark: there he owned that he got this diſeaſe by one Peg Mackintoſh, going to or
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033585_0062_0FF7901393FA0F38"/>
coming from Peckham Fair, or at the Fair, I cannot tell which. The child ſaid, he put her head in a bag of wool, and put a <hi>horn</hi> up her belly, and wet her a little; that ſhe cried out, Grand-daddy! Grand-daddy! Grand-daddy! and he ſtopt her mouth with wool.</p>

The ſurgeon that ſearched her ſaid ſhe was foul. When the priſoner was taken up, he cried, and ſaid he did it that day I dined at Mrs. Miller's. I ſaid, When did you get this diſtemper? he ſaid, as he was going to Peckham Fair, and that one Peg Mackintoſh gave it him. I know no more of it.</p>

The priſoner was there at that time. I examined the child, and found ſhe had got what we call a clap. I aſked her if any body had meddled with her: ſhe ſaid what ſhe did juſt now. I then took the priſoner into another room, and found him very bad with the ſame diſorder. I taxed him with putting the child's head in wool, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her up after that manner.

                  <p>I am counſel for the plaintiff, Mr. William Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, who is a ſurgeon and apothecary in Newcaſtle upon Tyne. The defendant, Sir M. W.

                  <p>Gentlemen, I am not inſtructed, nor is it, I aſſure you, my inclination to go out of this caſe to make any obſervations, much leſs to declaim on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, on account of the unpleaſant nature of the buſineſs that brings us into a court of juſtice. On the contrary, if I purſued my own inclinations, and my own inclinations are left perfectly free, I muſt ſay, that the defendant, in all other reſpects, is undoubtedly a man of character and honour; and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033585_0066_0FF7901A0FCA6390"/>
he is married to a lady (I do not ſpeak from inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from my own perſonal knowledge of her for a great many years) of the moſt amiable and pleaſant diſpoſition. This is therefore, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, an unfortunate cauſe for Sir Matthew White Ridley, even as it affects him in this reſpect. I have nothing to do with his ſufferings, but ought rather to turn my attention to the ſufferings which muſt be felt much more on this occaſion by my cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bromel had been married to this lady eight or ten years and had a child by her, a daughter. I am ſorry to remark, that my experience on this ſubject is but too large, which ariſes from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of the times in which we live.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall purſue this courſe. I ſhall ſimply ſtate what I am afraid my witneſſes will prove, and ſhall not give any gloſs or colour to the ſubject, nothing beyond that which I think properly belongs to it.</p>
                  <p>The wife of the plaintiff is a moſt beautiful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and when ſhe was married to her huſband, was extremely young; and whether from any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in her behaviour which makes a woman an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of temptation and ſuſpicion, a report for ſome time prevailed to her prejudice at Newcaſtle. As I underſtand reſpectable witneſſes will ſtate this is the fact, I therefore think it infinately better I ſhould ſtate it in the opening, leſt it might throw any prejudice on the cauſe, which, when it comes to be examined, will entitle me to call on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant for large damages in this caſe,</p>
                  <p>It is extremely true, this unfortunate lady, from her own beauty and levity of behaviour, knew ſhe had ſubjected herſelf to ſuch a report in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row circle, in conſequence of ſome malignity which beautiful women are but too frequently the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of. Undoubtedly ſuch a report prevailed, and within the knowledge of my client. I need hardly ſtate to you how much a huſband muſt feel on ſuch an occaſion.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:033585_0067_0FF7901F7471DB88"/>If I am broke in upon in the evidence which I ſhall produce in ſupport of the plaintiff's caſe, I deliver up my client to be treated with all the contempt with which any man ought to be treated, if he was not watchful and properly jealous of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his wife; if he was inattentive to her, and winking at her notorious adultery; or putting her into the hands of another for ſuch purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>This report blew over; for a ſeaſon ſhe had loſt the affections of her huſband. A few more years had paſſed over their heads, and the plaintiff was living happily and comfortable with his wife, till his peace was broke in upon, and ruined for ever.</p>
                  <p>This cauſe was certainly not brought here for public example. I do not mean to inſiſt upon it that this is any ſort of perſecution. I mean merely to ſtate that this is the ſituation of an injured man —of an injured huſband; and I think the injury ſufficiently great, without bringing in aid any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that might tend to inflame the minds of you the jury.</p>
                  <p>Sir Matthew White Ridley was not only a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried gentleman, but was chief magiſtrate of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, at the time this injury was committed. He was alſo repreſentative of it in Parliament; and, gentlemen, you will conſider how much he has diſgraced all theſe ſituations, by deſcending to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a crime which is now the ſubject of indignation.</p>
                  <p>I underſtand this defendant comes here with this double ſort of caſe. In theſe cauſes, what is to be contended on the other ſide is pretty general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. We are firſt to have the fact of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery reſiſted, and it is to be contended, that the defendant is wholly innocent of it. If he is, we ſhall ſee it. On my part, I ſhall eſtabliſh his guilt beyond the poſſibility of contradiction.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort of defence is this. Adulterers do not frequently give themſelves the trouble to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how far a woman is virtuous before the hour
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033585_0068_0FF7902111EE4178"/>
of appetite commences, but afterwards; and when the huſband is ruined, and his peace of mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, then the adulterer is to hunt out what the lady was. On this or that occaſion ſhe was ſuppoſed to be this or that ſort of woman, in order to endeavour to leſſen the damages for the loſs of her comfort and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                  <p>I think this a wholeſome ſpecies of defence, to wit, if it can be ſhewn in a cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of juſtice, that the huſband, inſtead of treating his wife with affection and regard; if, inſtead of protecting her as he ought; if he is careleſs as to her conduct; if he permits her to miſbehave: and if he, as it were, encourages her in it, by conniving at particular inſtances that have come within his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; if he delivers her over almoſt into the hands of the adulterer, he cannot be driven out of a court of juſtice with too much ſhame and too much contempt. Though to Sir Matthew White Ridley, in former times, this woman, from her conduct, had become an object of ſuſpicion; if ſhe in conſequence of the reports that were circulated in prejudice of her virtue, had conſidered her conduct, and had become more and more affectionate to her huſband; if ſhe was beginning, or had entirely got the better of theſe ſuſpicions; if ſhe was the mother of his child, and his affectionate wife in every part of her conduct; if juſt as that ſort of ſenſation began to be felt by the huſband; if juſt when he had recovered his peace again; if he was broke in upon, and made a fit object for the hand of ſcorn to point out, (for ſuch is the unhappy condition of every man in the plaintiff's ſituation however innocent) this defendant will have much to anſwer for to my much injured client. If a man happens to be married to a woman who miſconducts herſelf, and diſhonours her huſband's bed, let his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to her have been ever ſo properly and exemplary, though he had afforded her every ſpecies of protection, and ſhewn her every kind of indulgence that might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a good and affectionate huſband; yet the moment ſhe deviates from the paths of virtue, he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becomes the ſubject of ſcorn and contumely. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033585_0069_0FF79022B21D73D8"/>
conceive a more cruel ſituation. I ſhall content myſelf with this ſort of opening.</p>
                  <p>The plaintiff was a moſt affectionate huſband to his wife. He was careful to diſcover whether ſhe was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and no proof appearing of her infidelity, he continued to cheriſh her with that love, which his duty required he ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Sir Matthew White Ridley, when he was mayor of Newcaſtle, and had given the plaintiff a place under him, and had put him near to his perſon, took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of that relation, to rob my unfortunate client of his peace of mind, and of that which was moſt dear and valuable to him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make no farther obſervations on this caſe. The influence of the defendant, his life, his character, his fortune, are extremely well known to you; and from a long acquaintance with him, I believe him to be very much of a gentleman in all other reſpects.</p>
                  <p>I have confined my obſervations to the cauſe before you, I ſhall now call my witneſſes, and prove my caſe.</p>

               <div type="evidence">
                  <head>EVIDENCE FOR THE PLAINTIFF</head>
                  <p>The firſt witneſs called on the part of the plaintiff was John Wilſon. He depoſed, that he was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. Bromel and his lady; that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeemed to him to live in the utmoſt harmony and friendſhip, and to have the greateſt pleaſure in each other's ſociety.</p>
                  <p>A few years ago, reports were circulated through New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, which reflected on Mrs. Bromel's character and reputation, and which reports very ſenſibly affected Mr. Bromel, who ſpared no pains to inveſtigate the truth of them: in conſequence of the moſt minute examination, and ſtricteſt ſcrutiny into the foundation of them, he was led to conclude that they were perfectly and complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe.</p>
                  <p>Eleanor Swinney, was next examined in ſupport of the plaintiff's caſe, and ſhe was the only witneſs to ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033585_0070_0FF79028AD985530"/>
the fact upon which this action was grounded, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the adultery.</p>
                  <p>She depoſed, that ſhe lived ſervant with the plaintiff; and that one night ſhe found the defendant and Mrs. Bromel together in the very act of adultery, on the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe in Mr. Bromel's houſe, in Newcaſtle. She did not diſcover this to any body, till eight months after. The reaſon ſhe aſſigned, why ſhe had kept it ſecret ſo long, was that Mrs. Bromel told her that ſhe would poiſon herſelf if the witneſs ſhould reveal to her maſter that ſhe had ſeen her miſtreſs and Sir M. W. Ridley, in the act of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Law, as counſel for Sir M. W. Ridley, made a moſt excellent defence for his client. It had, he ſaid, been fairly admitted by his learned friend, in the outſet, that the character and reputation of the plaintiff's wife, had been extremely ſuſpicious long before the defendant and ſhe had become acquainted. And this was a moſt material circumſtance for the conſideration of a jury. It had alſo been very candidly admitted, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury were not aſſembled for the purpoſe of trying the defendant for a crime; but the only queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was (if they believed the ſervant, who undoubtedly, if credit was given to her teſtimony, had proved the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery) what damage they would give. Even if the Jury ſhould be diſpoſed to believe her teſtimony, he ſubmitted that this was only a caſe for very ſmall dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>He remarked on the vaſt number of actions of this ſort that were brought into courts of juſtice, ſolely for the purpoſe of getting money, as it frequently turned out, that the huſband had even encouraged and aſſiſted his wife in the commiſſion of this offence. When that was the caſe, it did not lie in his mouth to complain that he had ſuffered that to which he had freely aſſented; and which, perhaps, could not poſſibly have happened but by his conſent or connivance. He did not however contend, that was the caſe of the preſent plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>The defendant was a gentleman of high honour, and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:033585_0071_0FF7902A45146A40"/>
had a large family of children by his moſt amiable lady. The Gentlemen of the Jury were complete judges of every cauſe of this kind, and he had no difficulty in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to them the caſe of his client; being perfectly aſſured that they would do ſubſtantial juſtice between the parties.</p>
                  <p>Lord Kenyon, in his excellent addreſs to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Jury, after lamenting the frequency of actions of this nature, and the depravity of the age, obſerved, that there were infinite degrees of ſhades in actions of this ſort, and that each of them depended on circumſtances peculiar to itſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent caſe, the adultery which was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the action, had been proved, if credit was given to Mrs. Swinney. It therefore ſeemed that the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was entitled to their verdict and the ſingle queſtion was undoubtedly the queſtion of damages. He ſhould not ſay a ſingle ſyllable on that point to the twelve Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who were aſſembled before him: they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly competent to the taſk of deciding between the parties in this cauſe; and he could adminiſter no aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to them. It was extremely probable ſome of the Gentlemen of the Jury were huſbands themſelves. His lordſhip deſired them to put themſelves in the ſituation of the plaintiff, and whatever damages they ſhould think themſelves entitled to in that caſe, to give the ſame to the plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlemen of the Jury withdrew for twenty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, or half an hour, to conſider of their verdict, and found for the plaintiff—Damages, Four Hundred Pounds.</p>

               <head>Trial of Mrs. Liege, for Adultery with Mr. Wingtworth Tonge, during the abſence of her Huſband. In the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory Court of London, February 24, 1791.</head>
               <p>THIS trial preſents us with a feature of novelty upon its very firſt face; viz. a Sailor's divorce; a thing as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for its rarity, at leaſt according to the forms of law, as Sailor's weddings, without theſe forms, are for the frequency of their occurrence.</p>
               <p>Peter Liege, gentleman, of Broad-ſtreet, in the pariſh of St. George in the Eaſt, aged 71 years and upwards father of Peter William Liege, the principal party in this cauſe, ſaid, that in June 1783 his ſon was the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the merchant ſhip the Kent, then bound to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, and that when that ſhip ſailed from England, with many other paſſengers, there was a lady and her daughter who went by the name of Taylor, but whoſe real name he had ſince learned was Thomas. Peter W. Liege, he ſaid, at the time of his ſailing was a batchelor, free from all contracts, &amp;c. and that when he retuned to England, about a twelvemonth after, in June 1784, he brought the daughter of Mrs. Thomas with him, ſince Mrs. Liege, and whom he underſtood he was married to about the month of September 1783, at Philadelphia. At their return aforeſaid, they took lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Broad-ſtreet, and lived and cohabited together at bed and board, and conſummated their marriage, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two children, a boy and a girl, ſince dead.</p>
               <p>In the year 1787, it ſeems, that Peter W. Liege en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Eaſt India ſervice, as mate of a ſhip, and in conſequence of that was moſtly abroad, in parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſea, in his profeſſion, till March 1789. When
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033585_0073_0FF7902DA1F730C0"/>
Mr. Liege ſailed in the Nottingham Eaſt Indiaman, in March 1789, he left his wife in poſſeſſion of his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and furniture in Broad-ſtreet, and Mr. Alderman Curtis, being his agent, had orders to ſupply his wife with ſuch money as ſhe ſtood in need of. Mr. Liege returned to England in June 1790; but as his father was appriſed of the conduct of his wife, he no ſooner heard that the ſhip Nottingham had arrived in the Downs, but he wrote a letter to his ſon, informing him that his wife had conducted herſelf improperly during his abſence, and deſiring he would not ſee her till he had firſt ſeen ſome of his friends. Of courſe he believed that the ſaid Mr. Liege did not quit the ſhip Nottingham till ſhe came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to long Reach. He further ſaid, that he verily believed that Elizabeth Liege did commit adultery with one Wingtworth Tonge, or ſome ſtrange man or other, by whom ſhe had a female child; of which he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe was delivered in Parker's Buildings, near Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondſey Spa—And further, that his ſon never lived or cohabited with her ſince his return to England.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Jacob Duché, of Sloane-ſtreet, Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, and a miniſter among the people called Swedenbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, confirmed the teſtimony of the marriage of the parties, ſaying, that being well acquainted with Dr. White, the Proteſtant Biſhop of Pennſylvania he very well knew the manner and character of his hand-writing, having frequently ſeen him write and ſubſcribe his name —He therefore believed the Exhibit to contain a true copy of the entry of the marriage of the parties.</p>
               <p>Ann Mitchell, of Lamb Green, in the pariſh of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondſey, ſpinſter, aged 16 and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſaid, that ſhe went to live as a ſervant-maid with Mrs. Liege, at No. 4, Parker's Buildings, who then reſided with a man that ſhe took to be Mr. Liege, as he always went by that name, and paſſed for Mrs. Liege's huſband, but whom ſhe ſince underſtood was a Mr. Wingtworth Tonge. All the time ſhe lived with them, ſhe ſaid, they cohabited together as man and wife, and lay ſeveral times naked and alone in the ſame bed;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033585_0074_0FF7903377B5C7A0"/>
and, therefore, this young <hi>delicate</hi> witneſs verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they had oftentimes committed the <hi>foul</hi> crime of adultery, and all that, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Martha Moody, the waſherwoman, next depoſed, that living in Parker's Building's, ſhe was alſo engaged to attend Mrs. Liege during her lying-in, and that when firſt engaged by Mrs. Liege ſhe underſtood ſhe was a married woman, and that her huſband was to come to her very ſoon: and that ſhe was alſo preſent when Mrs. Liege was delivered of a female child, about four o'clock one morning, in the month of September.</p>
               <p>She further mentioned, that ſhe nurſed Mrs. Liege ſeven weeks in the whole, but, that during the laſt three weeks, a man came and reſided with her, who called himſelf Mr. Liege, but whoſe name ſhe has ſince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be Tonge. As in this interval ſhe ſlept in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Henry Radford, ſurgeon and man-midwife, of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington-Place, ſaid, that on the 26th day of Auguſt laſt, he received a note from Mr. Wingtworth Tonge, of whom he had a ſlight knowledge, informing him that he had a female friend that wanted his aſſiſtance; and that he was ſoon after introduced to a lady whoſe name he has ſince learned is Liege; that ſuch lady was then with child, and very near her time; and that he accordingly delivered her of a female child, on Friday the 3d of September following, about five in the morning in the preſence of Martha Moody.</p>
               <p>Mary Penney, wife of John Penney, taylor, of Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, in the pariſh of St. George's, Middleſex, traced the connection further back. She ſaid, ſhe and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band lodged in the ſame houſe in Broad-ſtreet with Mrs. Liege, when a perſon of the name of Tonge uſed to come backwards and forwards to viſit Mrs. Liege, and uſed to continue, perhaps alone, with her a conſiderable

time. All this witneſs then underſtood of Mrs. Liege was, that ſhe was a married woman, and had a huſband in the Eaſt Indies, and that ſhe then appeared to be about ſix months gone with child.</p>
               <p>Abraham Watſon Rutherford, of Bond Court, St. Stephens, Walbroke, London, merchant, ſaid, that he was well acquainted with Peter William Liege, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of marrying his ſiſter in 1785, and had known him in all for a period of 27 years. He perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered their taking lodgings in Broad-ſtreet, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting together as lawful man and wife, and their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two children—That Mr. Liege made three voyages as maſter or mate of different ſhips, leaving Mrs. Liege in town during the ſame; and that on his departure the laſt time, he gave Mr. Rutherford 40 guineas partly for the payment of the rent of Mrs. Liege's apartments at different payments, the remainder to be given to Mrs. Liege, at Mr. Rutherford's direction. And he further underſtood from Mr. Alderman Curtis, who was Mr. Liege's owner, that he had orders to ſuply Mrs. Liege with money to the amount of twenty or twenty-five pounds a year. And that whenever the ſaid Mr. Liege was going a voyage, he always laid in a ſtock of liquor, coals and other neceſſaries for her uſe, and in every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect always made an ample proviſion for her, fully adequate to his circumſtances and ſtation.</p>
               <p>During Mr. Liege's abſence, he had frequently ſeen his wife in London, and other places adjacent; but being informed of her improper conduct, as ſoon as he heard of the arrival of her huſband in the Downs, he wrote two letters to him, informing him of the ſame, and cautioning him not to admit his wife into the veſſel ſhould ſhe come to viſit him, till he had ſeen him, which happened on the 31ſt of May, when Mr. Liege came to Mr. Rutherford's houſe, who afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained him along with a Mr. Thomas Seddon to Mrs. Liege's apartments, when ſhe, being taxed with an adulterous intercourſe with a Mr. Wingtworth Tonge, acknowledged it before them all, and added,

               <p>Of the evidence produced before the Epiſcopal Court, James Bradley, a labouring man, of Moulſey, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that between ſix and ſeven years previous to the Trial, Major Arabin and his Wife came to live there:
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033585_0077_0FF790389288A8D0"/>
he perſonally knew Thomas Sutton, jun. Eſq. he well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, that one day in the ſummer of 1782, as he and William Harwood, a labouring man, were walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether up Moulſey Common, by a place called Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bale's Shrubbery, William Harwood ſtopped him and ſaid, 'they ſhould ſee ſome <hi>game!</hi> and pointing into the ſhrubbery, he ſaw Mrs. Arabin, the wife of Major Arabin, on the ground therein, with her petticoats up, and Thomas Sutton, Eſq. jun. on her, in the very act of Adultery, as he moſt firmly believes; and when they had finiſhed, he ſaw Thomas Sutton, jun. Eſq. get up, and help the ſaid Mrs. Arabin up from the ground, and ſaw him button up his breeches, and wipe his breeches knees with his handkerchief, and they then walked away together:' he entertained no doubt as to the identity of their perſons, knowing them perfectly, and it then being a fine day, and he not farther from them than about a dozen yards; he had alſo frequently ſeen them riding out together, both before and after the ſtriking circumſtance juſt related.</p>
               <p>Maria Haynes, of Chertſey, perſonally knew Major Arabin and his wife, and Thomas Sutton, jun. Eſq. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five years ago, being paſſing through a meadow near Moulſey Common, about two or three in the afternoon, it being hay-making time, ſhe perceived Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton walking together alone, as ſhe had oftentimes ſeen them before, and preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw them retire into a hollow way leading to a place called the Spa: Mrs. Arabin ſeated herſelf upon the bank formed by the hollow, and Mr. Sutton unbuttoned his breeches, and gently throwing himſelf upon her, he pulled up her clothes, and ſhe plainly ſaw him in the act of carnal copulation with her, being only about three or four yards diſtant from them, and concealed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of ſome trees and buſhes. Mr. Sutton, after remaining four or five minutes upon her, got up, and having raiſed Mrs. Arabin, gave her a kiſs, and then they went away together.</p>

               <p>James Poulter, of Vauxhall, about four or five years previous to this Trial, entered into the ſervice of Major Arabin and his wife, as gardener and footman, at their houſe at Eaſt Moulſey: an acquaintance, he knew ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between the families of Major Arabin and Thomas Sutton, Eſq. ſen. who was Lord of the Manor, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly between Mrs. Arabin and Thomas Sutton, jun.

Quickly after he had been in the family of Mr. Arabin, he noticed the diſtinguiſhed attention which Mr. Sutton obſerved towards his Miſtreſs, and with which ſhe appeared particularly well pleaſed: he oftentimes ſaw them go out in company with each other, during the abſence of his maſter, arm in arm, in various places near Moulſey, and the ſcene of their excurſions was more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially a ſhrubbery named Littlehale's Shrubbery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Thomas Sutton, Eſq. His miſtreſs uſed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to ride out twice or three times a week on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, attended by him; and Mr. Sutton, jun. uſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt invariably to join her, and ride with her upon Monlſey Common; and if Mr. Sutton did not arrive as early as Mrs. Arabin, ſhe uſed to diſpatch him home on ſome frivilous pretence, only that ſhe might with more convenience wait for the arrival of her lover: when they have been riding together, Mr. Sutton more than once kiſſed, and uſed other familiarities with Mrs. Arabin, on horſeback; ſuch as putting his hand into her pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole: when his miſtreſs returned home, ſhe has twice or three times told Mr. Arabin, that ſhe had been at Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033585_0079_0FF7903F87500E18"/>
Wells, a place frequented by ladies for the purpoſe of bathing; when, in reality, ſhe has only been in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Mr. Sutton.</p>
               <p>James Lawrence Brown, came perſonally to know Mr. and Mrs. Arabin, by living in the ſervice of George Molyneux, Eſq. the brother of Mrs. Arabin. One Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the ſummer of 1779, or 1780, he being at the houſe of Mr. Arabin, at Moulſey, and his maſter and Mr. Arabin being gone out together, Betty Dodſon, a ſervant in the family, told him, that her miſtreſs and Mr. Sutton (whom he knew by ſight) were in the parlour alone; in about three quarters of an hour afterwards, he, being in the kitchen, heard the parlour door open, and going to ſee, juſt catched a glimpſe of Mr. Sutton, going out at the front door of the houſe, and alſo perceived Mrs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabin coming out of the parlour: ſoon afterwards Betſy Dodſon called him into the parlour, and going in, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived one of the windows to be very much blinded, and an arm-chair near the window much tumbled and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and ſeveral black pins upon it: juſt before the chair upon the ground, he ſaw ſome ſeed or matter which comes from a man in the act of copulation; on diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the ſame, he called Betty Dodſon, and pointed with his foot to the ſame, and ſhe looked at it and ſmiled: from this he was in his conſcience ſatisfied, that Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton had had criminal converſation, and committed the crime of adultery with each other.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Dodſon lived ſervant in the family of Mr. and Mrs. Arabin. Mrs. Arabin had one child during her marriage, and ſhe verily believed that Mr. Arabin behaved to his wife in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a good huſband, and was ever particularly indulgent in his conduct towards her. Soon after ſhe went to live with them, they went to reſide at their country houſe at Eaſt Moulſey, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Mr. Sutton's viſits there ſoon became apparent: he and Mrs. Arabin found frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of being alone together, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when Mr. Arabin was out, which was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the caſe in the forenoon, he being either on horſeback, or elſe obliged to attend his duty as a Major in the Horſe Guards: directly he was gone, it frequently happened that Mr. Sutton called, and ſoon afterwards he and Mrs. Arabin uſed to walk or ride together; at other times when Mr. Arabin has gone out, Mr. Sutton has preſented himſelf in a field before the houſe, and Mrs. Arabin on ſeeing him, would wave her handkerch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One Sunday in the year 1779 or 1780, Mr. Arabin and Mr. Molyneux went out together, and ſoon after Thomas Sutton, Eſq. came in, and went into the parlour to Mrs. Arabin; after they had remained there ſhut up alone for the ſpace of half an hour, they went out. Betty Dodſon going into the parlour directly, impelled by curioſity to ſee which way they went, found the curtains let down, though they were not ſo before; Mr. Molyneux's ſervant followed her into the room, and while ſhe was drawing up one of the curtains, called her to him, and upon the ground cloſe by an arm-chair, he ſhewed her ſome ſeed or matter, which comes from a man in the act of copulation, and aſked her if ſhe knew what it was? And upon attentively looking at it, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe did, and could well undertake to ſpeak poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereto, being a married woman: the cover of the arm chair was very much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>umbled and dirted with hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and ſeveral black pins were upon it, and from all thoſe circumſtances, Betty Dodſon was well convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton had had the carnal knowledge of each other.</p>
               <p>Towards the winter of the year 1779, Betty Dodſon ſaid, they uſed to walk alone in a ſhubbery very near to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033585_0081_0FF79043F81B8680"/>
the houſe (the ſhrubbery called Littlehales) and very frequently arm in arm; after Mr. Sutton had gone, Mrs. Arabin uſed to come to Betty Dodſon under the ſhed where ſhe was milking, and ſit down and compoſe her hair and dreſs, which at theſe times have appeared very much ruffled, though ſhe was dreſſed very neatly when ſhe went out. When the family was in town, at Major Arabin's houſe in Poland-ſtreet, Oxford-road, Mr. Sutton uſed frequently to walk by the door and if the Major was not within, Mrs. Arabin would go out and call after him. Betty Dodſon twice ſaw them meet in the ſtreet when ſhe was going to market, and on their meeting they very cordially joined and walked off arm in arm together.</p>
               <p>What excellent topics for ſcandal, muſt the proceedings of this frolickſome couple have furniſhed to the barren circle of a country vicinity; the retailers of ſcandal, and the ſelf-appointed cenſors of morals, who abound ſo plentifully in every neighbourhood, muſt have obſerved the ridings out, the ſhrubby excurſions, &amp;c. &amp;c. and thoſe decent little intimacies of friendſhip, the publicly ſaluting a Lady, or putting a hand into her pocket-hole to—look for her ſnuff-box or handkerchief, with a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing combination of mirth and reſentment; the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cloſettings of the parties of Mr. Arabin's houſe, muſt have furniſhed a fund of the moſt inexhauſtible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for the kitchen fire-ſide, and contributed wonderfully towards improving the <hi>morals</hi> of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics of the family: how admirable an opportunity did the ſervant of Mr. Molyneux diſcover to diſplay a joking drollery, when pointing with his foot towards the arm-chair in the parlour (from whence Mrs Arabin and Mr. Sutton had juſt retired) he aſked Betty Dodſon her opinion of a certain appearance very viſible on the floor! and how excellent an occaſion did it furniſh to ſhow her ſkill and knowledge as a <hi>married woman,</hi> when attentiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering it, ſhe found herſelf enabled to reply with ſo much pointedneſs to the intimation of the queriſt. Circumſtances like theſe, muſt produce in ſervants the

profoundeſt reverence for the characters of their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and wonderfully ſerve the cauſe of ſubordination: not to mention the happy effects the details of, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on, the principal particulars which come to their knowledge, may have with their intimates and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps on ſociety, in a wider degree than may be at firſt imagined.</p>
               <p>Thomas Girdler, a youth of ſeventeen, lived as foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy in the ſervice of Mr. and Mrs. Arabin, from him it appeared that when at Eaſt Moulſey, Mr. Arabin and Mr. Sutton viſited each other very often, and a very particular intimacy appeared to exiſt between Mrs. Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, and young Mr. Sutton. Mr. Sutton, jun. was very much in the company of Mrs. Arabin in the abſence of her huſband, and his attention ſeemed to give her a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſatisfaction: they oftentimes walked out arm in arm, and rode out together, and many liberties were taken by each party with the other on theſe occaſions: in the abſence of Mr. Arabin, they have been ſeveral times ſhut up by themſelves in the parlour at Moulſey; after their departure, the chairs and carpet have been covered with powder, black pins, &amp;c. and almoſt always in ſuch a ſituation, that ſome perſons appeared to have lain on them whenever they went out together, the dreſs of Mrs. Arabin was particulary neat and ſmart; one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when every perſon was out excepting this foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, Thomas Girdler and his miſtreſs, ſhe ſent him to fetch a pot of beer, and on his returning with it, ſhe came into the kitchen, took the beer from him, and carried it into the parlour herſelf: about elev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at night he heard the parlour bell ring, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, his miſtreſs told him to take the pot away, which he found quite empty; from which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and her not requiring his attendance as uſual, he was ſatisfied that Mr. Sutton had been in company with her during the greater part of that evening.</p>

Sutton were alone together though he had not heard him come into the houſe, reſolved to look through the key-hole; taking off his ſhoes, he ſtept ſoftly to the parlour door; liſtening, he heard the creaking of a chair, and the ſound of two perſons voices, and looking through the key-hole, he perceived, by the fire light, his miſtreſs and Mr. Sutton in an arm-chair cloſe to each other: upon this, he run and aſked a boy called William Charles, to come and ſee, which he did, and then they both looked through the key-hole; he was perfectly ſatisfied that the parties then committed adultery together. The next morning, one of the chairs appeared to be very much tumbled and powdered, with ſeveral black pins on it; the print of a mans foot on the whole fill of the window was remarkably plain, and that was apparantly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Mr. Sutton's getting in at the window, in order to enter the houſe with the greater ſecreſy. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, when Mr. Arabin was from home, Mrs. Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin ordered the cloth to be laid for dinner in the libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-room oppoſite the bed-chamber door: after dinner, ſhe went into the kitchen, and told the footboy to get ſome large coals and leave them on the top of the ſtairs, ſaying, ſhe would take them in herſelf; the boy ſaw no more of her that evening; the next morning entering the room, he perceived the carpet and chairs to be very much powdered, black pins laying about &amp;c. from which he was convinced, that his miſtreſs and Mr. Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had been the whole afternoon ſhut up together.</p>
               <p>During the family's reſiding at Moulſey, the footboy ſaid, his miſtreſs and Mr. Sutton uſed frequently to ride out together; the boy attended them, and was very often ordered to ride on and leave them alone: ſometimes they would ride together till very late, and Mr. Sutton never uſed to accompany Mrs. Arabin to her own houſe, but always left her before they came near there; when ſhe arrived home, ſhe uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to tell Mr. Arabin that ſhe had not met any
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033585_0084_0FF7904B549F4048"/>
perſon during her ride. When the family was in town, in the winter of 1783, Mr. Arabin going one day to Eaſt Moulſey, he had not been out of the houſe long before Mr. Sutton called, and enquired if Mr. or Mrs. Arabin were at home; the footboy told him, that his miſtreſs was gone out, and his maſter was in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but as he was ſpeaking, Nanny Gatehouſe, Mrs, Arabin's maid, came running down ſtairs, and informed Mr. Sutton that her miſtreſs was at home, but that ſhe was dreſſing, and that if he would walk ſomewhere and call in half an hour, he might ſee her; he did go away, and returned in about that time, and was ſhewn into the dining-room: preſently afterwards, Nanny Gatehouſe came to the footboy, and told him he muſt deny Mrs. Arabin to every body but Mr. Sutton; he ſtaid with her at that time longer than an hour, and, as the boy had every reaſon to think, was alone with her during the whole of the time, in the back room into which the dining-room led; two of the chairs were very much powdered eſpecially the back parts of them.</p>
               <p>Thomas Parker; ſervant to Major Arabin, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his maſter to go to the Pariſh Church of St. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan, in the city of Dublin, and examine the regiſter-book of Marriages kept for that pariſh: he found an entry of the marriage of William John Arabin, Eſq. and Henrietta Molyneux, ſpinſter, of which he took a copy, and then carefully compared it with the original: and he was well convinced, that William John Arabin his maſter, and Henrietta Arabin his wife, were the ſame parties as thoſe mentioned in the regiſter. Thomas Parker remembered, when the family was at Moulſey, frequently ſeeing Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton, jun. walking arm in arm, in a ſhrubbery, near the houſe, called the Manor houſe, or Littlehale's ſhrubbery, belonging to Mr. Sutton's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at other places contiguous to Moulſey; at theſe times Mr. Arabin was generally from home, and when Mrs. Arabin has returned from theſe excurſions, her hair has appeared tumbled, and her dreſs greatly diſordered and rumpled, though ſhe was very neat when
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033585_0085_0FF7904D077437E8"/>
ſhe went out, which, indeed, always was the caſe when ſhe intended meeting Mr. Sutton.</p>
               <p>One day, while the reſidence of the family was at Moulſey, in the year 1779, as Thomas Parker entered the houſe, Betſey Dodſon, and Lawrence Browne, told him that there had been <hi>fine work</hi> in the parlour, between Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton, and deſired him to ſtep into the parlour and ſee; on entering it, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Parker perceived an arm-chair to be very much tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and a great deal of hair powder upon it; juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chair on the ground, he obſerved ſome wet, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which a perſon's foot had apparently been drawn, but what ſuch wet was, he could by no means form an opinion by his own obſervation, as the ſame was nearly rubbed out: on that day Major Arabin and Mr. Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux had gone out pretty ſoon in the morning, and did not return till nearl dark in the evening: after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily's arrival in town in the winter of the year 1779, Mrs. Arabin uſed oftentimes to walk out attended by Thomas Parker, on the pretence of paying viſits, but almoſt always Mr. Sutton jun. met her in the ſtreet, and then it was their cuſtom to walk together for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time; on Mrs. Arabin's return, ſhe has frequently told her huſband, in the preſence of Thomas Parker, that ſhe had been paying viſits to ſuch and ſuch perſons, when ſhe has, in reality, been the whole time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Mr. Sutton; afterwards ſhe has diſpatched Thomas Parker, with cards to ſuch perſons as ſhe has told her huſband ſhe has been viſiting with the view of preventing detection.</p>
               <p>William Graham, gentleman, clerk in the office of Meſſrs Graham, Attornies at Law, Lincoln's Inn, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Arabin's obtaining damages by action, in the ſum of one hundred pounds, againſt Thomas Sutton, jun.

               <p>To the particular obſervations which have occurred little more can be added, than that on a view of the whole of the glaring circumſtances adduced in the courſe of evidence, aſtoniſhment muſt be the prevailing feeling in every reflecting mind.</p>

               <head>The Trial of the celebrated Mrs. Erring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, for Adultery with Arthur Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray Smith, Eſq. Captain Buckley, Captain Southby, Captain Roberts; the Rev. Mr. Walker, Mr. Trayte, Mr. Clarke, and Mr. Daniel.</head>
               <p>THE firſt depoſition in this curious trial, is that of Mary Stevenſon, who lived as a ſervant with Mr. and Mrs. Errington. Herevidence amounts to this: That a Captain Smith lived at her maſter's houſe about three months; that her maſter was in the profeſſion of the law, and generally left home about eight o'clock in the morning, and did not return till four or five in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, or later; that during her maſter's abſence, ſhe has almoſt daily ſeen Captain Smith toying with and kiſſing her miſtreſs, and putting his hand in her boſom, and through her pocket holes, at which ſhe would ſeem plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy: at other times ſhe has ſeen her miſtreſs
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033585_0087_0FF77DD46B510CE0"/>
ſitting on the Captain's knee, with her arm round his neck or on his ſhoulder.</p>
               <p>This muſt have created ſtrange emotions in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the ſpectator, who was then about twenty-three or twenty-four years of age. She doubtleſs imagined ſomething was intended beſides picking the lady's pocket when the Captain put his hand through her pocket holes. Her feelings muſt afterwards have been greatly heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for, from the circumſtances that followed, ſhe muſt have known that thoſe degitations were a prelude to a more capital ſcene.</p>
               <p>She then ſays, that, "in the abſence of her huſband, when Captain Smith and her miſtreſs have been together in the parlour, the little boy has been ſent out of the room, and ſhe has frequently, after that, found the door faſtened on the inſide; and, her miſtreſs hearing her, would ſometimes open the door to her, and ſometimes not, but give her ſome anſwer from within; and that, when ſhe has opened the door, ſhe would appear rather embaraſſed, her hair being greatly diſordered, and her handkerchief and cloaths much rumpled." She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays, that, "ſhe believes, in her conſcience, that the ſaid parties, at ſuch times, were criminally connected with each other"</p>
               <p>After mentioning ſome trifling particulars, ſuch as thoſe of Captain Smith going frequently into her miſtreſs's bed-chamber, and ſhe into the Captain's, and that the beds were afterwards found greatly tumbled; ſhe ſays, 'She has twice or thrice ſeen her miſtreſs in the Captain's breeches, coat and waiſtcoat; and that, at ſuch times, the Captain and ſhe would help to undreſs each other.</p>
               <p>Whether Polly Stevenſon envied her miſtreſs, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undertake to ſay, but, it clearly appears, that this toying between the Captain and her miſtreſs, engaged much of her attention, for ſhe often watched them into the hay-loft together, whither they repaired under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of finding eggs; and ſhe ſays, 'Her miſtreſs, when ſhe returned, had her cloaths much tumbled, and in great diſorder.' At thoſe times, ſhe ſays, 'She had no doubt
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:033585_0088_0FF790500F1B2448"/>
upon her mind, that the ſaid parties had a criminal connection."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Polly alſo watched the waters of the poor curate of Batterſea. Cruel, indeed, that he could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to give her miſtreſs a little ſpiritual conſolation, but ſhe muſt put a carnal conſtruction upon his intentions. She ſays, 'She ſaw Mr. Walker and her miſtreſs come out of the bed-chamber together,' and without further evidence of any thing criminal ſhe runs immediately to the kitchen and tells her fellow ſervants, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved 'the parſon and her miſtreſs had been in a fit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the bed.'</p>
               <p>How depraved muſt the mind of Polly Stevenſon have been, to form ſuch a ſuppoſition! Does ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that nothing but carnalities can be practiſed in a bed-room? Might not he and Mrs. Errington, who was one of his pariſhoners, have been joining in ſome religious exerciſes, inſtead of perpetrating the horrid crime of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery? Might they not have been conning over the
<q>leſſons of the day, and turning over the ſheet of the Pilgrim's Progreſs?</q>
Might he not have pulled out of his pocket 'The Whole Duty of Man,' and have poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out particular intereſting practical paſſages! Was he not, thought in a ſubordinate degree, the ſhepherd of the pariſh; and was not ſhe one of his lambs?—But, if a tranſaction will bear two conſtructions, Polly ſeems to delight in giving it the worſt. It is poſſible that, having a ſtrong tendency to fornication herſelf, ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a 'pair of people' cannot go into a 'bed-room' without committing adultery; and actually ſays, that 'ſhe firmly believe that a criminal connection had paſſed between them.' She does not indeed mention the groſs and indelicate words 'carnal knowledge.'</p>
               <p>She then relates that 'her miſtreſs, being once in a coach with her, put her head out of the window, and aſked a ſmart officer how he did, and he came up to the coach, and the coach ſtopped, and he opened the door and got in; and Mrs. Errington carried him to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's houſe, where he ſtaid to tea, and continued alone
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:033585_0089_0FF790542DA950D8"/>
with her in the parlour ſome time; and that, from their converſation it appeared, that ſuch officer was an entire ſtranger to Mrs. Errington. That a great intimacy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards took place between them, and it appeared that this officer's name was Buckley.</p>
               <p>The Captain made his attacks in nearly the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as Captain Smith, and in particular, regularly beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the boſom and the pocket-holes. Mary Stephenſon obſerves alſo, that, 'whilſt her maſter was on a journey to Oxford, her miſtreſs ſtaid out all night twice,' and ſeems to conjecture that captain Buckley was with her.</p>
               <p>Jacob Endamaur comes forward as the next witneſs, and ſays, 'he was a ſervant to Mr. and Mrs. Erington, and has frequently ſeen Captain Smith and his miſtreſs kiſſing, toying, and romping together, and has ſeen his miſtreſs ſitting upon the Captain's knee, and her hair and cloaths in great diſorder.' He makes no criminal charge againſt the curate, but only ſays, he uſed now and then to viſit and drink tea at the houſe of his ſaid maſter, and that he never ſaw any thing improper paſs between him and his miſtreſs.'</p>
               <p>He then confirms the evidence given by Mary Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſon, reſpecting captain Buckley, and adds, that 'about two months before he left Mr. Errington's ſervice, as he went into the parlour, where Captain Buckley and his miſtreſs were alone together, to throw ſome coals on the fire, and entering rather ſuddenly, he ſaw his miſtreſs ſitting in an elbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chair, and Captain Buckley ſtanding before her; that upon his coming in, Captain Buckly turned immediately away, and appeared to be buttoning up his breeches; and they appeared to be in very great confuſion.'</p>
               <p>Hence he concludes, that 'they either had been, or were prevented by him from being, criminally acquainted together.'</p>
               <p>Thoſe, however, who pretend to be in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret affirm, that nothing of that kind was then tranſacting; but the lady was adminiſtering ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

to the Captain, in a particular part, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy a ſpecies of teſtaceous inſects, which were at that time very troubleſome and inconvenient to him. She was acting, it is preſumed, the part of 'Lady Bountiful,' by endeavouring to deſtroy ſuch noxious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; and yet Jacob Endamaur moſt uncharitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, that ſhe was engaged with the Captain in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a very different nature!</p>
               <p>He adds, that 'he has often ſeen them kiſſing and fondling each other; and once ſaw the Captain kiſſing her naked breaſt.' He concludes with ſaying, 'that he does in his conſcience believe, that the ſaid parties had frequently had the carnal knowledge of each other.'</p>
               <p>Philip Dixon, clerk to Mr. Errington, beſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming ſome of the particulars already mentioned, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that captain Buckley, at firſt, 'would ſtand in a lane juſt by the houſe, as if upon the watch: and, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe occaſions, Mrs. Errington would go to him, and bring him home, or ſtay ſome time with him, and he has known her ſtay in the lane with him till eleven o'clock at night. That at length, the Captain grew more audacious in his behavior, and would come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in about a quarter of an hour after Mr. Errington was gone out; and, without aſking any queſtions, would run up ſtairs, whiſtling or ſinging, into Mrs. Errington's bed-chamber, dreſſing-room, or parlour, wherever ſhe happened to be. That once, in particular, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Captain Buckley and Mrs. Errington coming into a room called the library, where the deponent uſually ſat to write, and while they were in the room, the Captain went up to her in a very familiar manner, and, as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired backwards, he followed her until ſhe came with her back againſt the bookcaſe; and then puſhed his hand in a moſt indecent manner, againſt her cloaths, between her thighs, and Mrs. Errington gently puſhed him from her, and they both went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Theſe particulars are ſo very open and apparent, as to require very little comment or elucidation. Mrs. Errington, on their firſt interview, behaves with great
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033585_0091_0FF79057ACE2D458"/>
freedom to the Captain; and he in his turn ſeems to have exactly followed her example. In ſhort he acted as maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the houſe, and one would imagine he really thought himſelf ſo; but his audacity at laſt was inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; Mr. Philip Dixon therefore, communicated his ſuſpicions, or rather facts, to Mr. Errington, and a ſeperation conſequently took place between him and his wife, and Mr. Dixon believes that Mr. Errington has never ſince cohabited with her.</p>
               <p>Another circumſtance of her behaviour, mentioned by Mr. Dixon, is too material to be ommitted. He ſays, 'Mr. Errington's houſe in Adam-ſtreet, was exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faceing the hotel, kept by William Oſborne, in the ſame ſtreet; and that Mrs. Errington, when her huſband was abſent upon buſineſs, very frequently went out and ſtaid for hours together, and often uſed to return home with various gentlemen, ſtrangers to the deponent, and appeared but newly acquainted with Mrs. Errington.</p>
               <p>There never was a more induſtrious woman in her line, than our heroine. Idleneſs ſhe ſeems to have had an averſion to, and upon all occaſions preferred an active life. Her generoſity too was unbounded; ſhe did not confine herſelf to a ſmall circle, and deal out favours with a parſimonious hand, but liberally diſtributed them to every one that aſked, and frequently even unaſked. If the riches of a kingdom depends upon its population, (a point in which all our politicians ſeem to be agreed) Mrs. Errington muſt certainly be a valuable member of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; her whole time is employed in the buſineſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, and ſhe conſtantly exerts her beſt endeavours to make new ſubjects for the ſtate. She has not, indeed, been very ſuceſsful in her endeavours, therefore ſhe may exclaim, in the language of Addiſon,

               <p>It is however a juſt and a general obſervation, that
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033585_0092_0FF7905AAEAD8238"/>
the ladies who labour too hard in the buſineſs of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſeldom propagate much. This appears to be preciſely the caſe in the preſent inſtance; and, if every woman was as indefatigable in this buſineſs as Mrs. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington, the king might 'lack ſoldiers, and ſailors,' which would be a heavy loſs at this moment.</p>
               <p>Luke Carter comes forward next with his teſtimony. He was alſo a ſervant to Mr. and Mrs. Errington. He ſays Captain Smith and his miſtreſs uſed to romp, play, and toy together; and goes upon the ſame ground as the reſt of the witneſſes; but ſays nothing new, except that the Captain uſed to chuck his miſtreſs under the chin, and gent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ged ſixteen years, is the next wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He was foot-boy to Mr. Branſton, in Lyme-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, at a time when Mrs. Errington boarded there. He depoſes that, 'being one day in his maſter's parlour upon ſome errand, Mrs. Errington called him to her, and taking a book out of her pocket, ſhewed him ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent pictures therein, exhibiting the private parts of both ſexes, which ſhe particularly pointed out to him, and told him, ſuch pictures were a repreſentation of the ſeveral methods in which gentle-folks and poor folks were connected together.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Errington, it muſt be acknowledged, had always an eye to buſineſs, and as poor ſimple Simon was, at that time, only ſixteen years of age, ſhe was apprehenſive that he might have been daunted, had ſhe proceeded in a more direct manner. She was determined, however, to have a reliſh of him, and her mode of angling for him was truly ingenious.</p>
               <p>Simon proceeds with his evidence, and ſays that, 'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two days afterwards, as one Mr. Daniel, an attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's clerk in the town, was paſſing by on horſeback, Mrs. Errington tapped againſt the parlour window, and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033585_0093_0FF7905F05C20790"/>
Mr. Daniel immediately alighted, tied up his horſe at the door, and walked in; when Mrs. Errington met him at the door, and aſked him to take a walk round the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and they accordingly walked together in the orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard behind the houſe, and Simon afterwards ſaw them ſitting upon the graſs; but, on their obſerving him, ſhe came and beat him about the head for watching them, and then returned to Mr. Daniel.'</p>
               <p>He then relates, that a Captain Roberts, and a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Southby, had practiſed great familiarities with Mrs. Errington, and from their having been ſhut up in rooms together, he ſuppoſes they at thoſe times committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p>He next depoſes, that 'Mr. Trayte, poſtmaſter of Lyme, viſited Mrs. Errington, and they behaved with great familiarity to each other; that he ſaw them play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the orchard together; and, when Mrs. Errington ran round the trees, Mr. Trayte purſued her till ſhe fell down, and he then caught hold of her, and ſhe ſaid he had hurt her leg, and pulled her petticoats above her knee; and Mr. Trayte put his hand upon her knee: that he then aſſiſted her in getting up, and ſhe ran and fell again, and pulled up her petticoats nearly as high as ſhe had done before; that, about half an hourafter wards, they got into the kitchen together, and Mrs. Errington went into the ſtore-room and fetched a ſyringe, which Mr. Trayte took from her and filled it with water, and diſcharged it under her petticoats."</p>
               <p>This appears to have been a very extraordinary kind of amuſement for Mr. Trayte. After having juſt had two views above the lady's knee, it is impoſſible to conceive why he ſhould have recourſe to a pewter ſquirt, and to diſcharge the contents of it under her petticoats. He may be a tolerable good 'Poſtmaſter,' but he muſt be a wretched 'wh—e-maſter,' not to think of a better expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cool the lady's warm premiſes. Had either of her Captain's been then upon duty, they would have acted more 'en militaire.' The poſt maſter of Lyme-Regis ſtands but a poor chance of obtaining a wife (if he has not already got one) for having worked an improper
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033585_0094_0FF790609C0781B0"/>
'engine,' and treated a very 'reverend' looking figure with unbecoming levity.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, a very cruel diſaſter happened to poor Simon and ſuch a one as fully retaliated for his watching Mr. Trayte and Mrs. Errington. The poor fellow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that 'the next night as he was aſleep in his bed, he was waked by the bedcloaths being ſtriped off him, and obſerved Mrs. Errington in her ſhift only, and Phebe Luſh, which then lived fellow ſervant with him, by his bed-ſide, and Mrs. Errington pulled up his ſhirt and caught hold of his private parts, and pulled him out of bed by the ſame, and ſaid ſhe would pull him down ſtairs; but he at length got away from her by tearing down the boſom of her ſhift.'</p>
               <p>Alas, poor Simon! If you had not been looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a youth of veracity, I ſhould hardly have credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a tale; this being the firſt time, by what I can learn, that Mrs. Errington attempted to treat ſuch, 'mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters' with diſreſpect, much leſs with a degree of cruelty. But the moſt aſtoniſhing part of this tranſaction is, that, after having taken a 'thing in hand,' ſhe could ever think of quitting the room till ſhe had finiſhed it.—Perhaps ſhe is not fond of miniatures.</p>
               <p>'The next night, continues maſter Simon, 'juſt as he had undreſſed himſelf and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oing into the bed, Mrs. Errington came into the room, and made him put on his breeches, and then took him down ſtairs into her bed-chamber, and placed him under the bedſtead of his fellow-ſervant, Mary Mitchell, which ſtood even with Mrs. Errington's bed, and bade him hide himſelf till the ſaid Mary Mitchell ſhould come to bed, and was gone to ſleep, and that ſhe would then ſpeak to him.</p>
               <p>But when the miſtreſs and maid were undreſſing to go to bed, the maid heard ſomething breathe hard, and, by the help of the candle, ſhe diſcovered poor Simon, and ſent him to his own bed.</p>
               <p>Poor Simon muſt have thought himſelf in a very whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ſituation, when placed under Mary Mitchell's bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead. He was not ſo entirely an infant, as not to be able
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033585_0095_0FF79062590E5E20"/>
to form ſome imperfect idea of what Mrs. Errington meant, when ſhe ſaid ſhe would 'ſpeak to him after Mary Mitchell was gone to ſleep.' Simon could not, at that early period be ignorant of the mode of geſtation, though perhaps he had then only a theoretical knowledge of it; and he muſt have been well convinced, that Mrs. Errington intended he ſhould attempt the practical part. It ſeems evident indeed, that Simon experienced thoſe ſenſations which ſuch a ſituation muſt naturally create, and that he was amply ſupplied with materials to act the part of a man, or he would not ſo readily and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have complied with the lady's injunctions of crawling under the bedſtead, and to continue in that diſagreeable hiding-place, till ſhe ordered him to mount. In the words of the poet Mrs. Errington wanted.</p>
               <q>To teach the young idea how to ſhoot.</q>
               <p>But it does not appear, from the evidence given that he was led out of the room in the ſame manner that he was taken out of bed by Mrs. Errington.</p>
               <p>The next morning, a maſter Simon depoſes, 'he ſaw Mrs. Errington ſtanding before the fire with her petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats as high as her knees, in the preſence of Phebe Luſh, Mary Mitchell, and his maſter's ſon, who was then about five years of age, and, ſeeing ſome hair lying upon a paper, aſked what it was, and the little boy ſaid Mrs. Errington had been cutting it off under her petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats; and then aſked Mrs. Errington to give him ſome; when ſhe replied, if ſhe cut off any more, Mr. Errington would know it.'</p>
               <p>Thus cloſes the evidence of maſter Simon: but there appears a deficiency in his depoſition; for he does not mention a ſyllable about the colour of this hair.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Errington appears, upon all occaſions, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the propriety of her actions. She did not chooſe to part with a hair more, leſt it ſhould be miſſed by her huſband; but ſhe never thought it neceſſary to refuſe thoſe favours that could not be miſſed by Mr. Erring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, though of ten thouſand times the value.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:033585_0096_0FF7906418583938"/>Phebe Luſh is the next witneſs on the trial; ſhe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborates what Simon Orchard had depoſed, reſpecting the mode of Mrs. Errington's dragging him out of bed by the middle; ſhe alſo mentions Mrs. Errington's ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſome indecent pictures; and ſhe adds that, 'one day in the kitchen, ſhe, in a very indecent manner took up her petticoats, and, with a pair of ſciſſars, cut off ſome hair from her private parts, and gave ſome to Mary Mitchell, and ſome to this deponent, and bade them keep it for her ſake; and, to the beſt of this deponent's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance. Simon Orchard, the foot-boy, came into the kitchen whilſt ſhe was about it.'</p>
               <p>It ſeems perfectly clear, from what has been already advanced, that the firſt tuft of hair which was generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtowed by Mrs. Errington, to thoſe about her, was all taken from one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the premiſes; and the beard appearing afterward to be rather unequally divided, ſhe gave it a ſecond 'mowing,' in order to bring matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a due proportion and uniformity.</p>
               <p>Mary Mitchell next ſteps forward with her teſtimony. She was cook to Mr. Branſton when Mrs. Errington boarded at his houſe. She corroborates the evidence given by ſeveral others, and adds, that Mr. Clarke, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon amuſed himſelf with taking off Mrs. Errington's ſtockings, and putting them on again, frequently kiſſing her.'</p>
               <p>This was a ſtrange kind of penchant of Mr. Clarke's! —'Pulling off her ſtockings and putting them on again. It reminds us of Motteux, who tranſlated Don Quixote. He had a ſtrong propenſity to women: but, as he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in years, he found it neceſſary to have recourſe to art to give him ability as well as inclinations. We never heard, indeed, that he had recourſe to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvre of practiſing upon legs and ſtockings, like Mr. Clarke; but he had other methods equally extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and, at length, Nature became ſo far debilitated, that nothing but hanging by the neck for a few moments, would give him that elaſticity neceſſary for conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Extraordinary as it may appear, he frequently ſubmitted to this operation, in order to procure a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:033585_0097_0FF79069357800E8"/>
which, like Mrs. Errington, he conſidered as the only buſineſs worth attending to. At length, however, his life became a forfeit for his imprudence.—He was tuck'd up as uſual in a two pair of ſtairs room, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of three 'filles des joye;' and, juſt as he was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, hearing that ſome dancing bears were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſtreet, they all ran down to enjoy a ſight of the entertainment; and, forgetting, for a while, the ſituation in which they had left Monſieur Motteux; when they returned, they immediately cut him down, but he was totally incapacitated for buſineſs, and alſo dead! Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, died the muſician KOTSWARRA, whoſe exploits are ſo brilliantly recorded in a new publication called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Propenſities.</p>
               <p>Mary Mitchell mentions ſeveral particulars, which have already been fully related; and, further obſerves, that, when Mrs. Errington ſhowed the obſcene pictures, ſhe would talk in a very immodeſt manner.</p>
               <p>The ſame witneſs alſo ſays, that 'Captain Southby and Mrs. Errington being in a room together, ſhe tried at the door, and found it faſtened, or locked within ſide; that Mrs. Errington called from within, and aſked her what ſhe wanted; and Mary Mitchell told her the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was ready; and ſhe told the deponent it muſt wait, for ſhe was not ready for it yet; that, in the courſe of half an hour more, Mrs. Errington and Captain South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by came out of the parlour, and the latter went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately away; that Mrs. Errington appeared quite heated, and looked confuſed, and her hair and cap, and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief about her neck were in great diſorder; that ſhe had no ſtays on, being in her morning dreſs, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very much tumbled.'—She adds that, 'ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found the carpet much tumbled, and believes, from her conſcience, that the ſaid parties had then the carnal knowledge of each other.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Errington, it muſt be admitted, paid but little attention to her dinners, when matters of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence were tranſacting. We cannot abſolutely ſay how ſhe was engaged while the repaſt was cooling, but
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033585_0098_0FF7906AD3D78760"/>
we can give a ſhrewd conjecture; and Molly Mitchell appears to favour our opinion. The Captain and ſhe, it is ſuppoſed, were taking a wet and a reliſh together; or he might probably be inſtructing her in ſome new evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, with the modern methods of attack and defence. She is a woman who thirſted after knowledge, and if the Captain had any thing new to communicate, ſhe was ſure to pump him out of it. Polly Mitchell ſuppoſes the Captain diſcharged his muſket, for, though ſhe did not hear the report, ſhe ſmelt the powder; and Mrs. Erring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton appeared to have been very much heated in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
               <p>The dinner was now cool, and Mrs. Errington, it is preſumed, was equally ſo; for ſhe ſat down to table with as much indifference as if ſhe was retiring to bed with her huſband. She picked a bit of the wing of a capon, without the leaſt appetite; though, but half an hour before, it is thought, ſhe had a moſt voracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity.</p>
               <p>Molly Mitchell relates yet another ſcene, which has not been depoſed to by any of the other witneſſes. She ſays, that ſhe 'once attended Mrs. Errington to bathing, and, while ſhe was in the bathing machine, with only her ſhift and petticoat on, ſhe called to a gentleman, who was a ſtranger to this deponent, by the name of Love, and deſired him to come in, which he did, and ſtaid about a quarter of an hour in the machine with her, and her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom all the while was quite expoſed to his ſight.'</p>
               <p>The ſame witneſs corroborates the clipping ſcene, and that 'Mrs. Errington gave her and Phebe Luſh ſome hair in a paper, and told them to keep it for her ſake, and ſays, ſhe believes Mrs. Errington cut off ſuch hair from her private parts.</p>
               <p>Private parts ſeems to be an improper term here, for what is meant to be underſtood by it! for, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe buſineſs which appears to have been tranſacted there, Molly Mitchell would have expreſſed herſelf with more propriety, if ſhe had called them her 'public parts.' But, perhaps, Polly is not cenſurable in this reſpect, as
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:033585_0099_0FF7906C6B2AA8C0"/>
the reſt of the witneſſes make uſe of the ſame expreſſion. The term, is probably technical, in Doctors Commons, and frequently occurs in their learned and elaborate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions. It is a ſubject often handled by the profeſſors of eccleſiaſtical law; and every proctor is ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, that (to uſe a figurative expreſſion) it is a buſineſs that he has at his 'fingers ends.'</p>
               <p>Towards the concluſion of Mary Mitchell's evidence ſhe ſays, with great gravity, 'that ſhe thinks Mrs. Erring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton did not behave in a ſober, decent, modeſt manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas Branſton, of Lyme-Regis, gentleman, depoſed nothing that has not been already mentioned. But among other things, he ſays, that, 'as far as fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obſervation, Mr. Errington behaved to his wife with great tenderneſs and affection, in every reſpect, as a good huſband.'</p>
               <p>James Baxter another witneſs, ſays, 'he was watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and attendant on the officers on guard at the Bank of England, in the riots in June, 1780, and ſtill continues in the ſame ſituation; that Captain Buckley, of the Coldſtream regiment of guards, uſed occaſionally to do duty there; and that Mrs. Errington, towards the latter end of the year 1781, frequently viſited him when on duty, and laid with him all night in one and the ſame bed.'</p>
               <p>Captain Buckley, it appearsby this, had double duty to perform, and he ſuppoſed he was as ſafe as the Bank from diſcovery; but maſter James Baxter, who had been engaged by the city to prevent riots, could not endure ſuch riotous proceedings. He thought it an abominable offence, that people who were not free of the city, ſhould come within the centre of its walls, to commit the foul crime of adultery. Had any one of the aldermen or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon council thought proper to amuſe himſelf with a lady on his premiſes, he would, perhaps, like a good citizen, have winked at it; but for people to bring their harlots from the Weſtminſter end of the town, to defile the more pure city of London, was a matter which his conſcience would not permit him to conceal from the community.</p>

               <p>At the age of fifteen, Miſs Harriot ſet her tender heart on a promiſing youth; and ſhewed much emotion and ſenſibility on occaſion of his death, which was by bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Thames.</p>
               <p>In her ſixteenth year, the moſt heedleſs ſpectator might have run and read the language of her ſuſceptible ſoul, in her ſparkling eyes, comely ſmiles, and high heaving boſom. The fragrance of ſpring was not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull as her breath; the roſes of ſummer bloomed in her cheeks. She aroſe to perfection, attracted the eyes of the gay and wanton youths; and grew the envy of her ſex. At nineteen, the fair one anticipated the ſpringing pleaſures of the diſtant day, and longed to peep into the page of futurity.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, Miſs Harriot, accompained by her maid, viſited the gypſies of Norwood, and received from thoſe pretenders to ſooth-ſaying, certain dark pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions which highly pleaſed her fond imagination; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding a repreſentation of thoſe ſcenes in which ſhe was to act a capital part.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that theſe falſe augurs preſented Miſs a ſpouſe whoſe air and addreſs but ill accorded with her warm wiſhes; becauſe he appeared employed chiefly in in diſputing with the parſon about tythes; and engaged in a ſtudy rather too dry for a lady of her vigorous and volatile deportment.</p>
               <p>As in a mirror, Miſs ſaw the day dawning, wherein her pleſures were to begin. All her future favours were ſet before her ſight, juſt as they afterwards actually appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Curate, Poſt-maſter, Captains, Footmen, Butler, Baker, and an uncounted croud of fine fellows paſſed on in proceſſion, in the manner of the kings in Macbeth. Thoſe who believe in predeſtination, will eaſily make an apology for the miſconduct of our fair

inconſtant; for ſurely a poor weak woman can never be ſuppoſed capable of thwarting the decrees of fate itſelf; and thoſe who caſt the greateſt weight into the ſcale of free-will, muſt reflect on the many temptations which urged her on to deviate from the thorny paths of virtue and tread the more ſoft and flowery ones of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Miſs Harriot, in due time beſtowed her gentle hand on Mr. Errington, and made him happy in her charms; in time ſhe produced a pledge of their mutual love; or, to uſe the language of the law, 'They lived and cohabited together, bed and board, as huſband and wife, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated their marriage by the pro-creation of children.' So truly loving were they in their lives, during the firſt twelve-months, that they might with a great degree of propriety have demanded the ſlitch of bacon at Dunmow. Happy, they dwelt on the banks of the ſilver Thames, in the pleaſant village of Batterſea; and in that Elyſium, might have long enjoyed the pureſt pleaſures, without a mixture of alloy, had not an inſinuating ſerpent entered their paradiſe, and by his cunning, ſeduced this daughter of Eve, to taſte the forbidden fruit, that grew in the 'middle' of the garden.</p>
               <p>The firſt tempter ſhall be nameleſs, becauſe he is not blazoned on the Biſhop's Book of Adultery; although he was the firſt who cracked the commandment with our fair but frail ſpouſe. His tongue was more inſinuating than oil, and his gnomon of a marvellous projection. His ſhoulders were broad, his limbs ſtout as thoſe of Hercules: in fine, his make was maſculine throughout, and not a mite of the maccaroni was blended in his ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letic frame. The man who charged his back with the gates of Gaza, was not much ſtronger, when he lay in the lap of Dalilah.</p>
               <p>He ſoon enflamed the heart of the lady, attracted her ear to his tale, and pointed out all the W—s of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and the Adultereſſes of his own day, as examples for the fair one to follow. He gained his point. Mrs. Errington yielded, and ſo purſued the road to pleaſure, or rather to diſgrace, from which ſhe could never after recede.</p>

               <head>The Trial of Elizabeth Levering, Wife of W. Levering, of Gun-ſtreet, Spital Fields, Carpenter, for Adultery with Gideon Ginchenet, an Apprentice and Journeyman, and Charles Sadler; in the Conſiſtory Court of London, in May, 1792.</head>
               <p>JOSEPH LEVERING, who worked, lodged, and boarded with his brother, ſubſtantiated the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſaid, that Elizabeth Levering was a perſon of a very looſe life, and of a very abandoned, wicked, luſtful, and profligate diſpoſition. He alſo witneſſed as a perſon preſent, to the articles of ſeparation drawn up in the preſence of two attornies.</p>
               <p>With all the reſt of the witneſſes, he affirmed, that Mrs. Levering uſed frequently to call Gideon Ginchenet out of the work-ſhop, and detain him for hours together; this was ſo frequent in Mr. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering's abſence, that on ſuch occaſions, the notice of the reſt of the men was ſo much attracted, that they uſed frequently to ſay, "Come Gideon, your miſtreſs wants you; ſhe cannot do without you."</p>
               <p>John Healy an apprentice to Mr. Levering, ſaid, that his miſtreſs would frequently hurry him and another to bed, ſaying Ginchenet ſhould follow immediately; but which hardly ever occurred while they kept awake.—He had alſo ſeen them playing together in a manner that ſhewed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree of intimacy; and in particular he had ſeen Ginchenet take hold of his miſtreſs's hand in the kitchen and kiſs it, ſhe at the ſame time ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033585_0104_0FF7907A087CD230"/>
him to pull her about without finding the leaſt fault with him—ſhe at other times pulling his hair and ſlapping his face. One night in particular, he remembered, that Mrs. Levering came into their bed-room with a candle in her hand, when Ginchenet got up in his ſhirt and followed her; and this witneſs afterwards putting on his breeches, followed him into the kitchen, where he found Mrs. Levering, her daughter, and another little girl, but did not obſerve any indecent familiarities between the parties at that time; on the contrary, Mrs. Levering affected to complain of Ginchenet's appearing before her in that manner; her daughter cried at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Another night, being in bed with Ginchenet, Mrs. Levering came into the room, and pulled the cloaths nearly off the former—Ginchenet then ſaid, he would not go; on which ſhe left the room, and began crying as ſoon as ſhe got to the door, ſaying, he would repent it.—Yet, before ſhe went away, ſhe pulled the bed-cloaths off a ſecond time, as low as their knees. It ſeems, that Healy being awake when ſhe firſt entered the room, he obſerved the ſhadow of her fingers againſt the wall, beckoning Ginchenet to follow her, which he was at firſt de-determined to take no notice of.</p>
               <p>Fanny Pounsford, wife of John Pounsford, one of Mr. Levering's journeymen, uſed to attend Mr. Levering's children, at his houſe in Gun-ſtreet, Spital-fields; ſhe ſaid, Mrs. Levering was an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned woman—ſhe knowing them ſeveral years, had obſerved Mrs. Levering take great liberties with Ginchenet, while an apprentice, having him to dine, drink tea, and ſup with her in Mr. Lever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's abſence; beſides calling him out of the ſhop at other times, to treat him with hot wine and other liquors, indulging him with getting him what he liked to eat—he, in return, uſed to bring home tarts, &amp;c. to treat his miſtreſs.—And as a proof of Mrs. Levering's inſatiable diſpoſition, ſhe affirmed,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033585_0105_0FF7907DE3A01A18"/>
that ſhe had known her call Ginchenet ten times a day out of the ſhop from his work; ſhe had likewiſe ſeen him kiſs her hand, and call her a pretty woman; at other times, he has attempted to take money out of her pocket, and on her hindering him, he has called her a ſhabby creature to her face, and the like.</p>
               <p>Jane Hill, ſervant to Mr. Levering, went over the ſame evidence, adding, that ſhe heard her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſay in Ginchenet's preſence, that ſhe loved him and hated her huſband; and that they were almoſt always playing together; and in fine, that one night in Mr. Levering's abſence, going into her miſtreſs's room unawares, ſhe heard them in bed together. And that another time, Mr. Levering coming home rather unexpectedly, Ginchenet was in his wife's bed room, when he knocked at the door, and had much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to get into his own apartment in his ſhirt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Levering was let in.</p>
               <p>Lucy Coleman another ſervant, teſtified, that Mrs. Levering was looſe in her manners; and that ſhe owned to her, that ſhe doated on Ginchenet, and loved the ground he walked upon, and could live happier with him on a cruſt of bread, than with her huſband upon thouſands.</p>
               <p>Lucy Coleman further depoſed, that one night when Gideon Ginchenet had come home from a journey, very much fatigued and gone to bed, ſhe was ſent out about eleven o'clock, for ſome beer, by her miſtreſs, who ordered her not to knock at the ſtreet door on her return, as ſhe would wait for her and let her in; that on her return ſhe was much ſurpriſed on finding no perſon at the door, and more ſo on ſeeing a light in the counting-houſe that was very near the paſſage, towards which ſhe ſaw a man, whom, at firſt, ſhe ſuppoſed to be a robber, till ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him feel her miſtreſs's breaſts, and kiſs her, ſhe heard her ſay, "Don't Sadler! don't you ſee the girl?" They then went up ſtairs, and the girl fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them towards the kitchen that was on the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033585_0106_0FF7907F79A9D358"/>
ſame floor; Mrs. Levering then aſked him if he would have any ſupper, to which he replied, No; but ſaid he would drink ſome ſmall beer—they then ſtaid in the kitchen half an hour, taking the ſame liberties as before; but as the man aſked her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to let him look at ſome needle-work in the dining-room, they both went in there, where they again kiſſed one another: and as the witneſs found the door was open, and thought they did not hear her, ſhe looked into the room, and plainly ſaw them ſtanding cloſe together near the fire-place, Mr. Sadler with his back towards her, with his breeches quite hanging down, his hands round her miſtreſs's waiſt, and his head at the ſame time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined upon her boſom, while ſhe leaned her head upon his ſhoulders; ſhe at the ſame time ſaw her cloaths ſo far drawn up, as to diſcover part of her belly, and one of her thighs quite naked; but was prevented from making further obſervations, by ſuppoſing ſhe heard ſomething upon the ſtairs.</p>
               <p>In this depoſition, ſhe had no doubt, but that the parties were then in the act of adultery together; neither were her ſuſpicions that ſhe heard ſomebody upon the ſtairs unfounded, for ſhe had not been long in the kitchen, before ſhe heard Mr. Levering call out and ſay, "I'll ſhoot you, Sadler! I'll enter an action againſt you to-morrow." Mr. Sadler imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ran down ſtairs, and Mr. Levering after him; but the other having ſhut the ſtreet-door, he followed Mrs. Levering into the kitchen, ſtruck her, and ſaid he would ſhoot her.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, being determined ſhe ſhould ſtay no longer in his houſe, he ſent for two watchman; but as they refuſed to take charge of her, ſhe ſlept with her maid that night, and went away to her brother's the next day.</p>
               <p>This witneſs further proved, that ſhe brought a letter from Mrs. Levering, to Gideon Ginchenet, after this ſeparation, which was opened by her huſband.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:033585_0107_0FF7908140860498"/>Mrs. Levering, it ſeems, had four children by her huſband; and ſeems to have had the culpabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her conduct increaſed ſo much the more, as her huſband was of a temper the moſt kind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent.—There is hardly a doubt, from what may be collected from this trial, but that from her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with Ginchenet, and her publicity with Sadler, that ſhe was in a very ſtriking degree a Mrs. Errington in miniature.</p>

               <p>Q. You muſt explain—He entered my body; he took and threw me on to the bed, and I called for aſſiſtance; I ſhrieked but once, and he put his hand and crammed the ſheets into my mouth; as ſoon as

he came into the room he bolted the door, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoke to me at all; he threw me on the bed without ſpeaking to me; he put his private parts into mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What paſſed then, did you make any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?—Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he manage to keep you down on the bed! did you reſiſt?—He forced me down, and he laid on me in ſuch a manner, that I could not get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ſtays on? I had a pair of ſtays on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make all the reſiſtance in your power? conſider one hand was engaged at your mouth? I reſiſted as much as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to do him any injury?—Yes, all that lay in my power. I could not get away at any rate in the world.</p>
               <p>Q, What paſt after he put his private parts into yours? How long might he be in that ſituation? How did he force himſelf on you? Did you ſee him take down his breeches?—He did that after he put his hand to my mouth, and then he forced his private parts into mine, and ſomething warm came from him.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time could not you make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance?—He put the ſheet into my mouth, and I could not; I had done all that lay in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you conceive he remained in that ſituation on your body?—Five minutes: After this was over he went out immediately and went and brought up ſome water; I was almoſt dead, and he brought up ſome water for me to drink, as I had fainted.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your complaint?—I felt myſelf ſo ill I could not get up; I was there about three weeks afterwards; I did not know a ſoul in the world in London.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did get up, whom did you find in the houſe?—I did not get up for about two hours;
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:033585_0109_0FF7908898588370"/>
my maſter was in the houſe, and the other partner too; there was a good many people in the tap-room, but I did not know them. There is a woman that lives up one pair of ſtairs, but I did not know her at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it after this happened to you that you firſt made any complaint?—I found myſelf very bad indeed, and I thought it might be becauſe I had never known any body before; at laſt I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a ſurgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not complain to your maſter of this ill-treatment?—No, I did not at all. But I went to live in Little-Mitre court, in Fenchurch-ſtreet, I was ſo bad I could not ſtay; after I found I had the bad diſtemper I aſked the priſoner, my maſter, to get me into the hoſpital, and he ſent a conſtable to take me up, I had left him a long time before I found out that I was ſo; about nine weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he had committed a rape on you?—I did not know any thing about committing a rape; all I aſked of him was to get me into the hoſpital.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you ſwear upon your oath that you have never known him but that one time?—I never had any connection with him but then: he ſent for a conſtable and took me up; he ſaid I inſulted him for money, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What anſwer did he make to that?—I did not hear him ſay ſo, the conſtable told me ſo; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable came and told me I muſt go along with him, and he took me to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knowlys.</hi> Now my girl tell us a little more about this: There was a man of the name of Potts that lodged in the houſe?—There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other two ſervants ſay, you was very fond of Potts.—They did ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hannah, one of them, ſay you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times got out of bed and cuddled Potts. Young woman was not you turned out of doors for being found in bed with Potts?—I was not.</p>

                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:033585_0110_0FF7908A2F4F4C30"/>Q. And ſo your maſter came in and never ſaid a word to you, good, bad, or indifferent, never called you my dear; never courted you at all?—Never ſaid a word, but immediately threw me down on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never known any thing of this ſort before?—Never before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Which part of the bed did you fall againſt? —It was the ſide of the bed near the foot, and my head towards the other ſide,</p>
               <p>Q. When he threw you on the bed, I ſuppoſe you ſuſpected his intention?—I did, and ſhrieked out.</p>
               <p>Q. You never ſhrieked out more than once?—He put the ſheet into my mouth, immediately cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it in; the ſheet was in my mouth all the time of the buſineſs, he was holding it down with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had only one hand at liberty, for one hand was conſtantly employed in keeping down the ſheet in your mouth; that was ſo?—It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your two hands employed againſt his one?—My two hands were behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, who was it put your hands in that ſhape?—Seeing him bar the door, I was frightened, and I held my hands ſo.</p>
               <p>Q. You ſuſpected, when you ſaw him bar the door? I did not know what he was going to do, I thought he was going to kill me, or ſomething, I cried out, and he immediately chucked me on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he ſhoved you on the bed the moment that he barred the door; how far is the bed from the door?—It is cloſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had time to make one cry and no more; how came your hands to fall behind you? —I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. That was rather odd, was not it; did you ever in your life when you fell, having your hands
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:033585_0111_0FF7908BD5249130"/>
cloſe by your ſide, had your hands behind you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; how could they be twiſted backwards by that fall?—I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they remained behind all the time?—I could not get them away, I made all the reſiſtance I could; I could not get my hands away.</p>
               <p>Q. They then remained pinioned like a fowl?— Exactly ſo; he prevented me, he lay on me.</p>
               <p>Q. The man is not two or three ton weight?— I made all the reſiſtance I poſſibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he by laying on you prevent your drawing one hand from under you?—I made all the reſiſtance I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you really could not get one hand from under your back; that man is not a very fat man?—The moment I ſaw him bar the door, the moment my ſtrength failed me directly. I being in a ſtrange place, what did I ſuppoſe that that man was going to do!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſlap his face?—I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull his hair?—I could not get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you kick him at all?—I kicked him all that lay in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you almoſt overturned him by your kicking?—I don't know, I cannot ſay but what I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Here he lays on you, and you kicking about, it is natural you ſhould almoſt overturn him?—I did all that was in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you kick his ſhins, or did you not kick at all?—I did all that lay in my power to get away. I tried to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you try to get up; the moment that you fell down, he threw himſelf upon you; where was your petticoats?—He pulled up my petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pulled up before you was on the bed, or after?—After.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:033585_0112_0FF79090AD700CB0"/>Q. How did he manage with his other hand?— And then he laid his knee on me, and in that ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation he lay on me; he kept my petticoats high up with his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. And in that ſituation he did it?—No, he did not do it ſo.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with his knee?—After he pulled up my petticoats he laid his knee on me to keep them up while he pulled down his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. He continued his knee there then?—No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What kept your coats up?—He took his knee up when he unbuttoned his breeches; he was on the bed, and my coats kept up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they keep up of their own accord, or did you keep them up?—He kept them up, to be ſure.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how did he keep them up?—he had not three hands, had he?—No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, let us diſpoſe of the two; how did he keep them up?—I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How high were your clothes?—My clothes were quite up to my chin.</p>
               <p>Q. And you ſtruggled and kicked about a good deal, did not you?—All that lay in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Still they kept up to your chin; you was quite a maid at this time?—I never knew a man before.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how he managed to bring his private parts to your's? can you ſay how he did that?—No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you croſs your legs?—No.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not occur to you that that would be a good way to ſtop him; did you keep your legs a little wider than uſual?—I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that you did not?—I don't know that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ſhould have thought keeping the legs cloſe
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:033585_0113_0FF790924ECD13E8"/>
would be the beſt way to prevent him; do you know how he managed to introduce his private parts? where was the hand that was at liberty? one hand was at the ſheet at your mouth, where was the other hand?—I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell me how he managed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce his private parts to you, becauſe you know you was a maid?—No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor where his hand was? was it employed to prevent your ſtruggling?—He laid on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Really, my girl, in the way you deſcribe it, I cannot ſee how ſuch a thing could be effected?— He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not feel where the other hand was; you never felt how he employed the other hand? —No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never felt it about your perſon at all?— Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how was it employed?—He took his other hand to put his private parts into mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, my girl, how came you to tell me, a minute ago, that you did not know how it was employed, becauſe I put it to you ſeveral times?— Becauſe I was aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Q. When one hand was on your mouth, and the other hand was ſo employed, a very little ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle would have put him off; how came it you did not get rid of him when both hands were engaged? —I did all in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue this hand to his private parts all the time that he did this to you?—No, not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he employ it afterwards?—I cannot tell you, I am ſure.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell nobody of this affair? —I had no friends nor any acquaintance in London or elſe I would have told them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain to your fellow-ſervant of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:033585_0114_0FF7909406C3BC38"/>
your parts being ſore?—No, not at all; neither did I ſhew them to any body.</p>
               <p>Robert Carrol ſworn. I am a ſilk weaver; I never ſaw the girl, only by bringing beer to my houſe from Mr. Curtis: he lives next door; ſhe left her place, and ſhe brought her box, and ſhe aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my wife to waſh her ſome linen, and ſhe did; this was within a week or a fortnight after ſhe left her place, I cannot ſay nearer; ſhe told my wife ſhe was going to live at No. 88, Houndſditch. Sev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral weeks after ſhe came back again to my houſe, and ſlept there; when I perceived ſhe walked lame, and my wife uſed to tell me ſhe waſhed herſelf with fuller's earth, and ſaid, ſhe was chafed. I ſaid to her, if you have any thing a matter with you, I will go with you to a ſurgeon: I did ſo, and the ſurgeon examined her, and ſaid, he thought there was nothing a matter, without her blood was bad; and then ſhe came back again, and got worſe and worſe: I aſked her ſeveral times if ſhe was ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her maſter; I meant joking among ourſelves; it was ſaid, that Mr. Curtis was rather fond of a woman; it was not done out of any harm to Mr. Curtis: ſhe ſaid, that her maſter never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any thing to her, that he never behaved any way ill to her: but about a month after this, ſhe came up to my loom-ſide, and ſaid, My maſter Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis gave me the bad diſtemper! I aſked her how ſhe knew it? She told me that he was obliged to take the plaiſters off before he could meddle with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did ſhe pretend that he had med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with her?—I cannot ſay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you underſtand from this language, that he had meddled with her more than once?—I ſhould imagine by that, that he did; I aſked her, Did you ever tell your maſter that he gave you this diſtemper? She ſaid No. I aſked her two or three times over, ſhe ſaid No, ſhe never told him or her miſtreſs of it. She then begged of me to aſk her
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:033585_0115_0FF79095C1B88D40"/>
maſter to get her into an hoſpital to get cured; I told her no, I could not think of doing of any ſuch thing, for the time was ſo long, I could not think of troubling my head about the matter; and if ſhe had any thing to ſay to him, they muſt decide it themſelves. She told me that ſhe had a ſiſter at the other end of the town.</p>

               <head>The Caſe of John Bury, Eſq. of the County of Devon, who was divorced for want of his Teſticles. Tried in 1561.</head>
               <p>JOHN BURY, Eſq. was a man of conſiderable lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded eſtate, which principally lay in the county of Devon, where he reſided. Being at length tired of a ſingle life, he reſolved to enter on the holy ſtate of matrimony; and for this purpoſe, paid his addreſſes, and ſhortly after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, one Willimot Gifford, of the ſame county; a lady
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033585_0116_0FF7909ACA848140"/>
poſſeſſing many perſonal charms. The marriage took place the 20th of November, in the firſt year of Queen Mary.</p>
               <p>The bride, who felt all the force of nature, was much ſurprized when the next morning came, to find that her huſband had riſen, and that nothing of a very tender concern had occurred; but ſhe concluded, that his extreme reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for her had prevented him from taking the laſt liberty in a precipitate manner; and conſoled herſelf, that ſhe was to be initiated into the myſteries of Hymen by degrees. The next night, however, proved equally, if not more, unſatisfactory as the former; for the round-a-bout en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments which he beſtowed, only made her the more deſirous of an inſtant explanation. Delicacy forbade her to point the way; or certain it is, that ſhe would have compelled him to diſcharge the duties of his ſtation. Days, and weeks, and months and years, paſſed on juſt in the ſame manner: they went to bed to repoſe, and roſe again to follow the buſineſs, or the pleaſures of the day. Let us for a moment pity a blooming young lady, in the height of blood and vigour, married to a man who could not deprive her of that virgin mark which ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with much care, for heightening his opinion, and for adding to the common ſtock of love: and while we commiſerate, let us not blame her for communicating her deplorable ſituation to a female confidant. This confidant was a mother, who deſcribed to her all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the tender communication between man and wife: now were the eyes of poor Willimot opened, her indignation was juſtly raiſed, and ſhe very properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to call her un-family huſband before the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Judge, charging him to be 'impotentem ad coeundum cum dicta Willimote, propter vitium perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum, &amp; incurabile impendimentum ad generationem, &amp; ejus inhabilitatem;' and therefore deſiring to be divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of this charge, ſeveral witneſſes were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, two of whom were phyſicians: theſe unravelled the whole myſtery, by declaring, that the ſaid J. Bury, Eſq,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:033585_0117_0FF7909C617B1738"/>
had but one little ſtone about the ſize of a bean. In further proof it was aſſerted by ſeveral experienced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, that Willimot was at that time a virgin, in the ſtrict ſenſe of the word. Theſe facts were of ſo ſtrong a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Bury, at length, made a full confeſſion; on which the Judge pronounced a ſentence of divorce.</p>
               <p>But what moſt aſtoniſhed us—and, what no doubt, will moſt aſtoniſh our readers—was, the circumſtance that this impotent man ſhould, ſome ſhort time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, marry another woman called Philip Monjoy, and that ſhe ſhould be delivered of a ſon by him! Perhaps this event favours as ſtrongly of Cuckoldom, as any other in the annals of gallantry: for, notwithſtanding this auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious birth, we find an interruption of matrimonial joys occurred in a ſhort ſpace of time; Mrs. Monjoy, without appealing to the laws—perhaps ſhe could not go into Court with clean hands—precipitately left her huſband, and married a Mr. Langeden, with whom ſhe ever after continued.</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, perhaps, not unreaſonable to conclude that Bury had been cornuted by Langeden, to whom the birth of the ſon may be attributed. In Bury's dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſituation, he no doubt conſidered the affair as a piece of friendſhip: and, on the other hand, if he took the atchievement to himſelf, it muſt wonderfully have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the good gentleman's peace of mind: for though on his examination at the ſuit of his firſt wife, he acknowledged that ſhe was a virgin, for aught he knew to the contrary; it is not impoſſible but the Graham or the Forman of that day, might have fleeced his purſe, on the pretence of removing his unfortunate defect.</p>

               <p>The Libel exhibited before the Epiſcopal Court, ſtated the marriage of the Hon. Edward Foley, and the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley, the then Right Hon. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Ann Coventry, on the 24th of October, 1778: the neceſſary documents were produced and properly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated. Mr. Foley and his Lady, lived together with every affection on his part, and were commonly reputed, taken, and acknowledged to be man and wife by their relations, neighbours, and acquaintance; about the latter end of the month of November, 1783, Lady Foley ſet out for London, and went to the houſe of Miſs Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, in Chandos-ſtreet, to make preparations for a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Continent; and Mr. Foley intended to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her to London, but having been informed that a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal intimacy had ſubſiſted and was ſubſiſting between his wife and the Earl of Peterborough, he declined his intention, and immediately ſeparated himſelf from union and company with Lady Foley.</p>
               <p>It was ſome time in the year 1781, that Lord Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt, brother to lady Foley, introduced the Earl of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:033585_0119_0FF7909FD59281B8"/>
Peterborough to the acquaintance and friendſhip, and into the houſe, of Mr. Foley, and from that time a ſtrong intimacy continued: in or near the months of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, February, and March, 1782, whilſt Mr. Foley reſided in Weymouth-ſtreet, the Earl of Peterborough frequently paid morning viſits to, and dined with, Mr. Foley and Lady Foley his wife, and was always enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Mr. Foley, in the moſt friendly and hoſpitable way: about the month of April 1783, the Earl of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough returned from the Continent; Mr. Foley then lived in Somerſet-ſtreet, and his Lordſhip there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his intimacy and viſits to Mr. Foley and his wife: the latter, in Auguſt 1783, came from Herefordſhire to London, and went to live at the houſe of the Hon. Miſs Foley in Chandos-ſtreet; here alſo they were frequently viſited by the Earl of Peterborough: after this they went to Haſtings, accompanied by Lord Peterborough, and from thence to Brighthelmſtone, where his Lordſhip ſtaid but one day: in November enſuing, Mr. Foley and Lady Foley returned to London, to a houſe in South-ſtreet, where his Lordſhip was very frequent in his attendance: about the latter end of April 1784, Lord Peterborough went to Cheltenham in Glouceſterſhire, for the benefit of his health, as he pretended, and from that place wrote to Mr. Foley, at Stoke Court, in Herefordſhire, about 30 miles diſtant, enquiring after his and Lady Foley's health: and Mr. Foley had not then the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion that any thing criminal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between lady Foley and him: an invitation was ſhortly ſent to his Lordſhip, to come and ſpend ſome time at Stoke Court, which invitation he accepted, and in May 1784, paid his firſt viſit to Mr. Foley and Lady Foley at Stoke Court, and from that time until about the Second of September 1784, his Lordſhip ſeveral times viſited them there for the courſe of a few days, and then returned to Cheltenham: about the ſecond of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, he came back to Stoke Court, with his ſervants and horſes, and continued entirely to reſide there till about the 20th: Lord Peterborough having thus, by
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:033585_0120_0FF790A3D52813A0"/>
various acts, eſtabliſhed an intimacy in Mr. Foley's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and taken opportunity thereby to ſeduce the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Lady Foley from her huſband, ſhe being a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a profligate and adulterous diſpoſition, they did mutually carry on a wicked and criminal correſpondence, which continued to be a matter of great notoriety.</p>
               <p>About the month of March 1784, Mr. Foley and Lady Ann Foley his wife, went to a ball given by his Royal Highneſs the Prince of Wales, at Carleton Houſe. Mr. Foley did not ſtay long at Carleton Houſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired and left Lady Foley there, who ſtaid till about four or five the next morning, and then left Carleton Houſe in Mr. Foley's coach, accompanied by the Earl of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough, and no perſon beſides; his Lordſhip order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the coachman, Thomas Simmonds, to drive to his Lordſhip's mother's houſe, in Dean-ſtreet, Soho, which he accordingly did; when they arrived there, the Earl of Peterborough ordered Thomas Andrews, the footman not to knock at the door, and Thomas Simmonds ſtaid on the coach box; the blinds of the coach were drawn up, and they ſtopped in that ſituation about an hour: during that time the coachman and footman perceived the coach to be in motion ſeveral times, though the horſes ſtood quite ſtill; the coachman, as he ſat on the box, looked through the front window of the coach, and the morning being remarkably fine, and the moon ſhining ſo clear as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to equal the light of day, he plainly ſaw the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley laying upon her back, upon the back ſeat of the ſaid coach, with her naked thighs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and Lord Peterborough laying upon her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her naked thighs, and they were then in the very act of carnal copulation; and the motion of the coach was occaſioned thereby.</p>
               <p>Frequently, at other times, in the winter of the year 1783, and the ſpring of the year 1784, Thomas Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds the coachman, hath, at nights, drove the Right Hon.

times; the blinds have been pulled up, and Lady Ann and the Earl have had the carnal uſe and knowledge of each other's bodies, and committed the crime of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: in May 1784, when his Lordſhip was at Mr. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's houſe at Stoke Court, William Maull, maſter of the Crown Inn, at Worceſter, by order of Mr. Foley, ſent his ſervant, Benjamin Smith, with a pair of job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes, for the uſe of his carriage; about three weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Benjamin Smith went to Stoke Court with the job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes, he drove Lady Foley and Lord Peterborough alone together, in his Lordſhip's coach, about two miles from Stoke Court, near Eaſtwood, in the turnpike road to Sudbury; and as he was driving the carriage gently up hill, he looked through the front window of the coach, and plainly perceived Lady Foley laying on her back, on the bench in the coach, with her thighs naked, (the coach had a large double window in the front, and a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bench within, to communicate from one ſeat to the other) and extended and expoſed towards his ſight, and Lord Peterborough was then laying upon her, in the very act of carnal copulation, and continued in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſeveral minutes, thus having the carnal uſe and knowledge of each other's bodies, and committing the crime of Adultery. After his Lordſhp and Lady Ann had left the coach, Benjamin Smith found, in one of the pockets thereof, a white handkerchief, with ſeveral marks or ſtains thereon, and which had been uſed by Lord Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough and Lady Foley, or by one of them, to wipe their, or one of their private parts.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this occurrence, Benjamin Smith drove Lady Ann and his Lordſhip in a phaeton, to the top of Stoke Park, near the double gates there, where Lord Peterborough ordered him to ſtop; getting out of the phaeton, his Lordſhip propoſed a walk to Lady Ann, upon which ſhe left the carriage, and they walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about fifty yards from the place where the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſtood, and then Lady Ann laid herſelf down on the graſs near ſome gorſe; his Lordſhip upon this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly unbuttoned his breeches, and pulled up her petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:033585_0122_0FF790A82F3DA4A8"/>
and laid down upon her; and they had there the carnal uſe and knowledge of each other's bodies: they continued on the ground together about ten minutes, and, during that time, they were perceived by Benjamin Smith with the utmoſt clearneſs.</p>
               <p>On the enſuing day, Benjamin Smith drove Lady Ann and the Earl, in the phaeton, to the top of Stoke Park, near the double gates there, and cloſe to the ſpot they were at the day before; here he ſtopped by Lord Peterborough's orders, and Lady Ann and his Lordſhip deſcending from the phaeton, walked on together for the ſpace of one hundred yards among the trees; there they ſtopped, and Lady Ann put her back to and leaned againſt an oak tree, and either ſhe or Lord Peterborough pulled her petticoats up to her waiſt, and thereby expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her naked thighs; his Lordſhip then pulled down his breeches and got between her legs and thighs, and then carnally enjoyed her there, leaning againſt the oak-tree, they had the carnal uſe and knowledge of each others bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and committed the foul crime of adultery, which fact was clearly ſeen by Benjamin Smith, and J. Hookey, Lord Peterborough's ſervant.</p>
               <p>One day, ſome time between May and September 1784, Benjamin Smith drove Lady Ann and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a phaeton, on the turnpike road from Stoke Court, to the city of Hereford; during the journey, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Lady Ann with her petticoats up ſitting in the ſaid Lord Peterborough's lap, whoſe breeches were down and her hand therein, and on his Lordſhip obſerving that Benjamin Smith noticed it, he ſaid, Poſtboy, mind your horſes, and don't look at us!</p>
               <p>On Friday the 9th. of July 1784, Lady Ann Foley and Lord Peterborough had a meeting, and agreed to continue their criminal intimacy on the enſuing Sunday; the next Monday was the day fixed for the election of Members of Parliament, for the city of Hereford, and on Saturday the 10th, being the Saturday before the election. Lord Peterborough ſent a letter to Lady Ann Foley, intimating therein, that he had repented having
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:033585_0123_0FF790AA4DABBD98"/>
appointed Sunday for their interview; that he thought Mr. Foley's arrival on the next day a certainty, as the Hereford election would be on Monday; that, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conceived, would be a more eligible day, as her Ladyſhip would be certain of Mr. Foley's abſence; in concluſion, his Lordſhip named the three-mile ſtone from Ledbury, as the place, and Monday at half after five as the time of meeting.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday the 30th September, 1784, Lady Ann Foley and Lord Peterborough were together in a walk in the ſhrubbery, near the grotto, in Mr. Foley's grounds, at Stoke Court, and his Lordſhip was ſtanding with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Ann in his arms; her arms were round his neck, and her legs round his, with her cloaths up to her waiſt, and her nakedneſs expoſed from the waiſt downwards; his arms were round her body, and both their bodies in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they were then in the very act of carnal copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and then had the carnal uſe and knowledge of each other's bodies, and thereby committed the foul crime of adultery: all this was plainly ſeen by John Davies, a a bricklaye, who had been that day employed in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down a pigeon-houſe in Stoke Park, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from his work, and walking along the road, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellel with the ſaid ſhrubbery; he heard Lady Ann Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley cry out three times, 'Oh dear," and ſay, 'you hurt me!" All this was a matter of public notoriety.</p>
               <p>Samuel Purlewent, of Lincoln's Inn, Gentleman, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the marriage of the Hon. Mr. Foley and the Right Hon. Lady Ann. Foley. Mr. Purlewent was employed as agent by Mr. Foley's attorney, Mr. White, and ſaid, that in Hillary Term laſt, Edward Foley brought his action in his Majeſty's Court of King's Bench at Weſtminſter, againſt the Right Hon. Charles Henry Earl of Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and Monmouth, for damages ſuſtained by reaſon of a criminal correſpondence carried on by the Earl, with Lady Ann Foley, the wife of Edward Foley: in the month of March in the year 1785, the cauſe came on to be heard at the Aſſizes held at the city of Hereford, before Sir George Nares, Knt. and Sir James Eyre, Knt.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:033585_0124_0FF790AE4C5B8360"/>
and a Jury of lawful and honeſt men, duly impannelled and ſworn, at which Aſſizes the deponent was preſent; when the Jury having heard the evidence, brought in a verdict for the Hon. Edward Foley, the plaintiff, with two thouſand five hundred pounds damages. Mr. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levent alſo depoſed to the authenticity of a copy of the verdict exhibited; and alſo to the identity of the perſons of the Hon. Edward Foley, the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley, and Charles Henry Earl of Peterborough and Monmouth,</p>
               <p>John Robinſon, of Bolton-ſtreet, Piccadilly, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, depoſed to the hand-writing of the Earl of Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough; what appears ſingular is, that this gentleman does not affix the ſignature of his name, but his mark to his depoſition.</p>
               <p>This was the whole of the evidence adduced; upon the hearing of which the Court adjudged, that a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſentence be promulgated; viz. it was therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and decreed, that the Hon. Edward Foley, Eſq. ſhould be divorced, &amp;c. from bed, board, and mutual cohabition with his wife, by reaſon of Adultery by her committed.</p>
               <p>Surely the ſcandalous ſcenes here related, could not have been exceeded by any of the ſhocking enormities committed by the great and noble, during the licentious reign of our ſecond Charles! what an admirable ſcheme, on the return from Carlton Houſe, was that of Lord Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough's ordering the coach to proceed to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe in Dean-ſtreet, and there to ſtand ſtill, while the amorous pair, 'hot with the Tuſcan grape, and high in blood,' (and inflamed her Ladyſhip perhaps had been by ſome liquor, during her ſtay at Carlton Houſe) enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in ſoft daliance: it is curious to conſider the ſituation of the ſervants on the coach-box, their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe on hearing his Lordſhip's order to let the coach <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> in the ſtreet; they might poſſibly ſuppoſe it was their intention to <hi>repoſe</hi> ſome little ſpace in that ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: the chuckling and grinning, and broken hints of thoſe candid interpreters of awkward ſituations, livery
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:033585_0125_0FF790B0EA69C1F0"/>
ſervants, may however, be eaſily gueſſed at; and then how muſt the philoſophy of Thomas Simmonds, the coachman, have been puzzled, at ſeeing the coach move, while the horſes ſtood perfectly ſtill, till venturing to look through the window, he, aſſiſted by the light of the moon, perceived that memorable ſcene ſo highly complimentary to the delicacy of modern manners, and ſo peculiarly honourable to the character of her Ladyſhip as a wife, and the feelings of his Lordſhip as a friend! How would the good old Lady have been affected, had ſhe known the ſcene of wickedneſs her ſon was tranſacting at her door! Perhaps ſhe was at that very moment, offering ſome prayer for ſtrengthening the religious and moral principles of his Lordſhip!</p>
               <p>Theſe ſcenes, it appeared, frequently occurred in the ſtreets of London, and they ſeem freaks of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this amiable couple muſt have been very partial to; but the country was a place more adapted to this mode of indulgence; in bye-roads, &amp;c. the favourite propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity might be humoured, without much hazard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, except from the curioſity of the driver, which was an evil to be feared alike in every place; thus driving gently up hill near Sudbury, the poſtillion perceived them in the laſt expoſure of ſhameleſs guilt, nor muſt the ſcenes where Lady Ann reclines herſelf on the graſs, or leans herſelf back againſt the oak-tree, be left unnoticed, though fit only to grace the annals of vulgar proſtitution. Theſe circumſtances according to the evidence of the poſtilion, happened about the month of May; the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſomewhere, adviſes his fair readers againſt too great an intimacy with Sylvan ſcenes in that month; but had the high-bred dames of faſhion, of that period, even degraded themſelves by obſcenities like thoſe we have been obliged to relate, that cenſor of the public morals would, perhaps, almoſt have deſpaired of the efficacy of precept, and have vented his ſentiments only, in indignant exclamation, or contemptuous ſarcarſin.</p>
               <p>What muſt her Ladyſhip's feelings and ſentiments have been, when his Lordſhip admoniſhed the poſtilion, on
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:033585_0126_0FF790B28A712438"/>
his looking at them, to mind his horſes, and not the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the company he was driving! O virtuous education, pride of birth, female dignity and delicacy, how were ye all degraded, loſt! the meaneſt wretch could not have ſtooped to lower infamy. Imperial Rome we will no longer ſurvey as prodigies, thy Agrippina's, Meſſalina's, &amp;c. England can vie with thee in ſome of thy moſt profligate exhibitions of moral evil.</p>
               <p>The occurrences of this Trial, indeed, only take the lead of numberleſs others of equal atrocity; ſome more heightened by wantonneſs, and more caricatured by burleſque: the utmoſt impartiality, the ſtricteſt adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to truth, will be obſerved in every narration; no favour will be allowed to rank or influence, nor will an already degraded name be cruſhed by unmerited obloquy: as our materials are drawn from the moſt authentic ſources our means of information are unbounded; it is to the public we write, and, therefore, truth and candour will ever be the grand directors of our compoſitions.</p>

               <head>The celebrated Caſe and Trial of the Marquis de Geſvres, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of his Lady, Mademoiſelle de Maſcranny, who, after three years Marriage, commenced a Suit againſt him, at Paris, for Imbecility and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency.</head>
               <p>THOUGH in point of morality and prudence, ſome people might think caſes of this kind better concealed than diſplayed, the contrary is the fact; and further, the publication of ſuch criminality as is generally the cauſe
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:033585_0127_0FF790B425CE2578"/>
of them, is loudly demanded by the united voices of juſtice and humanity. <note n="*" place="bottom">This caſe is illuſtrated by a number of parallel caſes, ancient and modern, confirmed by Eccleſiaſtical Decrees, the Judgment of the Canoniſts, Civilians, and Common Lawyers; and is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated purpoſely for this work, from the French original; together with an Engliſh verſion of all the particular paſſages, that have hitherto appeared in Latin only.</note>

               <p>To place theſe aſſertions in a clear, and indubitable light, only let it be conſidered, to what trials the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of a woman is expoſed, if united to a ſham huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band!—What cruel aſſaults and experiments has ſhe not to ſuſtain! The image of ſuch a huſband, lifeleſs as it is, cannot but kindle ſome kind of deſire, yet, like the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Tantalus, it can only torment.—And, as it is notorious, that the rage of a fumbler, is apt to hurry him into extravagancies, and even revenge; the life of a woman, hampered with ſuch a one, may be highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.—Theſe imperfect men always ſeek to do away their own ſhame by criminating ſomebody elſe! There is a remarkable inſtance of this in the conduct of a King of Caſtile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to return; all the while the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of the parties in queſtion, endured, it was plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the lady's advocate, that her huſband wanted little elſe but power to perform his duty: always imitating, even the geſtures, kind looks, poſtures, and in fine every thing but reality; ſo that there was not only a cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a condormetion, viz. a ſleeping together; but alſo offers and eſſays of conſummation, all in vain and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect. The firſt legal ſtep taken in this buſineſs, was to have a form of interrogation drawn up (and this was partly done by the commands of the lady's confeſſors) The lady in her charge, does not tax her huſband with the want of the organs neceſſary for generation; but only urges, that theſe organs are abſolutely deſtitute of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This kind of imbecility, is what the Canons call <hi>frigidity.</hi>

Thoſe men, like the Marquis, it is evident, are called the <hi>frigid;</hi> but the operations of the ill-made, were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be hindered by ſorcery.</p>
               <p>It is curious to obſerve, that in caſes of impotency, in one of the parties, canons recommend chaſtity to both! The canon we allude to, was made under Gregory I. but Gregory II. who ſucceeded him, was too wiſe to lay any reſtraint upon a woman's ſuing for a divorce; he contented himſelf by ſimply recommending the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of an ill-organized wife, to turn the conjugal life into a fraternal one. Yet, perſuaded that every body has not the gift of continency he concludes his diſcourſe with theſe words: <hi>Sed quia hoc magnorum eſt, ſi non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſe continere, nubat.</hi> But, becauſe this is a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, if a perſon cannot contain himſelf he may marry again. The ſame thing that he allowed to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of a diſabled wife, he granted to the wife of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent huſband, and the decrees of this pontiff are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral adhered to, at this preſent time.</p>
               <p>But to return to the conſideration of what it is that conſtitutes the characters of frigidity and ill-make: it is to be noticed, that the firſt is thus defined, in the canon we have referred to: <hi>frigidus is cenſetur qui licit habeat membrum, habet tamen invtile ad copulam, quia inerigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

unuſeful for copulation, becauſe incapable of erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which is a circumſtance better underſtood by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection than explained with words. Such a member, ſaith the law, is good for nothing; becauſe <hi>olli durae quies nervos affereus urget ſomnus.</hi> It is as it were dead, and ſleeps a ſleep of iron; that is, it wants that motive faculty which is the ſummit of its utility.—As viſitations for the purpoſes of inſpecting virility, are not known in this country, we ſhall be more particular in deſcribing them—"They manage theſe things better in France," for there, very little depends upon the oath of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing party. The ſeachers, as we have before obſerved, are men, and generally thoſe ſomewhat advanced in years; and in a buſineſs of this nature, they are inſtructed to lay aſide the language of judges, and talk to the parties as cordial friends, officiouſly tending them their advice; and more than this, like a favourable judge, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puts words in the mouth of a culprit at the bar, they ſometimes point out methods and expedients to the impotent perſon, informing him how he may exhibit the token of virility in its beſt appearance. They addreſſed the Marquis de Geſvres in the following manner, when they paid him the viſit of inſpection. "Sir, we readily allow that the maſter of a law-office and four ſearchers, are by no means the moſt inviting objects to put nature in a good humour; and therefore, that not being the caſe at this preſent inſtant, ſend for us any morning, and call us into your chamber in the happy minute, when, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the privacy of four curtains, if that moment has not arrived, you ſhall wait for that favourable glance from nature's eye, which ſhe never refuſes long to perſons of your age, who are not entirely under her diſpleaſure.— Then happy ſhall we be to be witneſſes of the alteration ſhe ſhall have wrought in you."</p>
               <p>Thus indulgently they dealt with the Marquis, but, after all their efforts, they could by no means give in their ultimatum as favourable:—there is no doubt but they made uſe of every incentive, for the French lawyers inform us, that in many caſes the ſearchers did
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:033585_0140_0FF790D70115C560"/>
not merely truſt to the formation of the virile member in a ſtate of flacidity, but would often prick it, to diſcover whether it had feeling or not. The duty of ſearchers is thus inculcated in one of the old law books: Debent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicere utrum homo moveatur ad libidinem; viz. they ought to ſee whether the man can be moved by luſt.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed any further, in order to enter into the ſpirit of the pleaders on both ſides of this caſe, it will be neceſſary to ſhew the ſuperior accuracy and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiailty of the French laws, by explaining ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular terms, ſuch as the Congreſs, the Viſitation, &amp;c. the former of which is ſimply nothing more than the act of copulation, in the preſence of an eccleſiaſtical judge appointed to ſee it done: this ceremony has been of late aboliſhed, becauſe, in one caſe, it once led the judges into an error. And it has been ſince obſerved, that one happy or unhappy quarter of an hour, was ſufficient to fix a man's fate in a trial of this kind for ever; as it was exceedingly difficult, if a perſon generally impotent, could not find himſelf capable once in the courſe of a few months!—Viſitation or inſpection has been the ſubſtitute for the Congreſs, which being a real and local ſtate, is ever the ſame, and ſubject to no viciſſitude. Again, the Congreſs depended upon the concurrence of two adverſe parties, one of whom, the wife, as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel obſerved, might eaſily ſupplant the other, while the viſitation requires no more of the wife than a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which ſhe will gladly lend as a ranſom for her modeſty.</p>
               <p>Copulation is alſo defined to conſiſt of Motion, Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and Expulſion; and conſequently as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the latter could only be obtained by the wife's perſon, her evidence was always ſuppoſed to be ſufficient and therefore, as Madam de Maſcranny was ſuppoſed to ſay to her huſband, "The end of your marrying me was to make me paſs from my-maiden condition to that of a wife; yet, after a long cohabitation, after many attempts and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, you have left me the ſame as you found me; you are therefore culpable and inſufficient."</p>

                  <pb n="141" facs="unknown:033585_0141_0FF790DB24A0A5E0"/>Viſitation, and the teſtimony or oath of the wife, was further preferred, on account of the little dependance that could be made on the external appearance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the virile member in a man; and the canon law even illuſtrates the caſe of a lifeleſs member, in a ſimile from ſacred writ, viz. for as the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo alſo, &amp;c. &amp;c. Still it is apparent, that the evidence of a wife is not always to be depended upon, ſuppoſing her to be actuated by malice, or regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of an oath—The following caſe offers a ſhrewd ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of an inſtance of this kind—"A huſband becomes a father, loſes a wife, and proceeds to a ſecond marriage. After ſeveral months cohabitation with his ſecond wife, he goes a voyage to ſea. During his abſence this ſecond wife marries another man; and the firſt huſband, at his return home, is ſaluted with an accuſation of impotency, which he anſwers by ſaying, I have had a child of my firſt marriage; but the wife inſiſts upon it, that the birth of that child was only owing to his wife's having to do with another man. Behold the ſtate of this conteſt, in which it is viſible, that the ſearchers could not reaſonably doubt of the faculties of one who had been a father!"</p>
               <p>Still to proceed, there is a very great latitude in the notions, that the French lawyers, as well as the canon law, entertain of a temporary impotency in a man. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Maſcranny's advocate inſiſted upon it, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Geſvres was afflicted with a palſy in the parts, and quotes Zachias, Tit. 9. Book ix. that author ſays he, tells us that a man's genitals ſometimes fall into a palſy; that then there's an end of hope: all is loſt! no reſource left! And this not only when this evil ſeizes people who are upon the decline in point of years, but likewiſe when it attacks young folks: then ſays Zachias, nature loſes the habitude of conveying the ſpirits towards the afflicted parts; and from thence it happens, that thoſe ſpirits ſo entirely quit their channel, that they never reſume it again. And this is doubtleſs the reaſon why that grave author, the great Petrone, who has ſpoken ſo ill of the Canoniſts, puts theſe words into the mouth of a lady diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:033585_0142_0FF790DCB542B848"/>
with her favourite, <hi>paraliſincave</hi>—Away, wretch! you are going into a palſy.</p>
               <p>How juſtly, ſay the Canoniſts, does all this apply to the text and rule of the apoſtle: <hi>Vir non habet poteſtatem ſui corporis ſed mulier</hi>—A man hath not power over his own body, but the woman.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding a ſuperb and pompous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ability, is often fallacious; yet ſuch perſons who can afford no ſuch ſhew, are juſtly to be diſtruſted; and as the French advocate goes ſome length upon apparent capability, when the thing by no means exiſt, we ſhall therefore make uſe of that part of his plea verbatim: "It is undeniably true, and is confirmed by the experience of all mankind, that the difference between able women's men, and thoſe that are frigid, is this: In the former, the penis is contracted and ſhrunk up, during the time that it does not actually ſtand; ſo that it is impoſſible to judge of its length and thickneſs unleſs it is erect and ſtiff. Whereas it is quite the contrary in thoſe that are frigid, as in the carcaſe of a dead man. For ſuch indeed have a penis, but it is never contracted or ſhrunk up; it has a continual length and thickneſs, (as in other men when it ſtands) but then it always hangs its head, and is incapable of a perfect and conſiſtent erection.—See Zachias upon this head in chapter concerning the tokens of virility and impotency.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, by all who have written concerning impotency, as well canoniſts as phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that there are many men whoſe penis very readily riſes, nay, lifts itſelf up in a moſt proud and oſtentatious manner; but then it's fury is as ſoon ſpent; like a fire made of ſtraw, the moment it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches its miſtreſs's door, it baſely falls down at the very threſhold, and piteouſly vomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="unknown:033585_0143_0FF790DE99323200"/>
the frigidity, but rather too much calidity of their blood. Of this ſort of infirmity we have a noted inſtance in the Baron du Pont, mentioned by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentraeus.</p>
               <p>This Lord was ſeparated from his wife, Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine de Parthenay, heireſs of Soubiſe, for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, Argentraeus, in the article 429, of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Bretagne, gives this deſcription of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency: Quidam Juvenis valenti corpore uxorem inire non poterat, etſi benè naſutus, ſed ſimul ac ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum admoverat, ſemen praecipitatâ ſeſtinatione ejiciebat, ita ut nihil intrà injiceret, nec intromittere poſſet genitale. He was a young man of a hale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituon, but could not enter his wife's body, though rarely well hung; for ſo ſoon as he approached her with his penis, his ſemen flew off with ſuch preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, that ſhe was not at all the better for it, nor could his label of morality make its way into love's paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Be that as it will, our inſpectors warn us not to truſt to the ſtiffneſs of the virile organ; there being in many an erective force, but not effective, becauſe not ſolid, ſober, and ſtrong enough to hold out to the end; and therefore we muſt always conſult the wife's perſon, if we would know what has been done by the man, whether at firſt ſight he appears to be a man, or whether he does not. For though he appears to be a man, he is not preſently to be concluded ſuch, becauſe there are ſome whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of manhood is a mere cheat, gives mighty hopes, but performs nothing. Again, though he does not appear a man, it does not follow, that he is not a man; becauſe the tokens of manhood do ſometimes lie hid, and ſometimes pop out. And therefore, by inſpecting the huſband, no certain judgment can be made either for or againſt virility; but by inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wife, both doubts are removed. For if in the wife, the ſeal of virginity appears to be broke, it is moſt certain, both that the huſband has vigour,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033585_0144_0FF790E3F96A3A18"/>
nay, and an efficacious vigour; but if the ſeals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main whole and unhurt, there is, ſay the canons, a certain and violent ſuſpicion, that the vigour of the man, if it did exert itſelf, was fallacious; and if it did not exert itſelf, then there was the ſame ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that nature had denied him it. And this ſuſpicion, though preſumptive, has the force of all undoubted proof, ſince the canons rely thereon, as appears per chapter Propoſuiſti, chapter Litterae, and by all the doctors, to a man."</p>
               <p>Having now produced the ſubſtance of every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made uſe of upon this famous trial, on the part of the lady, we ſhall draw to a concluſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dwelling upon the arguments in favour of the Marquis, becauſe they are merely deſultory and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical; and as ſuch they were treated; for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the influence of his family, and Madam Maintenon's interpoſition with the King on his behalf, nothing better could be obtained than an order from his Majeſty, that Madam de Maſcranny ſhould continue to cohabit with the Marquis, till he was 25 year's of age; as his father, the Duke, aſſured the King, that he himſelf was impotent till that period.—The Duke's family were not the moſt opulent in France, but the Lady had an eſtate of 4000l. per year, beſides a great ſum in ready caſh.</p>
               <p>The ſecond octavo volume of this trial, which like the preſent, is ſwelled up by a number of caſes quite irrelative in any other eye than that of the law, contains examples of many artificial maiden-heads—deſcriptions of ſmall orifices—ſuppoſed marks of virginity, impotency, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>The Trial of Mrs. Fanny Wilmot, wife of John Wilmot, Eſq. M. P. for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with Edward Waſhborn, a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. In 1790.</head>
               <p>WILLIAM Garthwaite ſaid, that he went to live as butler, in the family of John Wilmot, Eſq. at his houſe in Bedford-Row, and continued to live in his ſervice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſome time on or about the 25th day of April laſt: and that John Wilmot and his wife Fanny Wilmot lived and cohabited together as lawful huſband and wife, and had ſix children, viz. one ſon and five daughters, who are all now living, and the youngeſt of them about the age of five years; and that on all occaſions, as far as he knew, they owned and acknowledged themſelves to be lawful huſband and wife, and for and as ſuch they were and now are commonly accounted and taken to be; and that Mr. Wilmot, on all occaſions, behaved to, and treated his wife with the greateſt tenderneſs, love and affection.</p>
               <p>He further ſaid, that when he went to live with Mr. Wilmot, he kept nine domeſtic ſervants, viz. a butler, a coachman, a footman, an under footman, a lady's maid or own woman, an houſe-keeper, a nurſery-maid, an houſe-maid, and a kitchen-maid; and that Edward Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born lived there as footman, and continued there until February 1791. And this witneſs underſtood that Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn had lived in the family about ſeven years in all.</p>
               <p>He further depoſed, that unleſs his miſtreſs Fanny Wilmot had female viſitors, which was very ſeldom the caſe, ſhe uſed every day to retire from table ſoon after ſhe had dined, and go into the back drawing-room, where ſhe moſtly ſat, leaving her huſband with his children, in the dining-parlour. That about a fortnight after this
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:033585_0146_0FF790E72D3B8760"/>
witneſs went to live in the family, he began to remark, that Edward Waſhborn uſed to eat his dinner haſtily, and go up ſtairs to his miſtreſs in the back drawing-room, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to carry her dog victuals, and continued ſuch practice until he left the family. Upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he would ſtay twenty, thirty, or forty minutes in the room with his miſtreſs, until his maſter was about to leave the dining-parlour, which was known by his ringing the bell, for the butler to clear the tables; when he has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen Edward Waſhborn come down ſtairs from his miſtreſs, either with the coal-box in his hand, or the plate on which he had taken the dog's victuals. It was the cuſtom he ſaid of his maſter and miſtreſs to breakfaſt in the dining-parlour; after breakfaſt, his maſter uſed generally to go out and not return for ſome hours, while his miſtreſs uſed as conſtantly after breakfaſt to retire to the back drawing-room. It was the buſineſs of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn, as footman, to clear away the breakfaſt things, which after he has done, he has been frequently ſeen by this witneſs going into the back drawing-room to his miſtreſs, where he has ſtaid alone with her near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty minutes; and this witneſs was the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in watching him, as he had ſome ſuſpicions on his mind that there was too great a familiarity carrying on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>And even after he was diſcharged from the houſe and ſervice of Mr. Wilmot, he uſed, notwithſtanding, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, during the months of February, March, and April, to come and dine and drink tea with the ſervants, as this deponent apprehends, chiefly by the invitation of Elizabeth Smith, the houſekeeper, by reaſon that ſhe would, upon thoſe occaſions, tell him ſhe had aſked Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn to come and dine with them, ſaying, it muſt be very dull for him; but the latter remarked, it was generally in the abſence of Mr. Wilmot, or when he happened to dine abroad, that Waſhborn came; and that at ſuch times, Fanny Wilmot, ſoon after ſhe retired from the dining-parlour, uſed to ring her drawing-room bell, which was in general anſwered by the footman, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:033585_0147_0FF790E9339D8BF8"/>
going to his miſtreſs, would return and tell Elizabeth Smith her miſtreſs wanted her, who would thereupon go to her, but ſoon returning, he has obſerved her to make private ſignals to Waſhborn, ſometimes by holding up one of her fingers, ſometimes by puſhing him with her elbow, and ſometimes by uſing particular geſtures, and on receiving ſuch private intimations, he uſed to leave the kitchen, or ſervants' hall, and go up ſtairs into the back drawing-room, and remain there alone with Fanny Wilmot, from twenty to forty minutes—This witneſs ſaid he could ſpeak the more poſitively to the foregoing circumſtances, on account of having ſtrong ſuſpicions that an improper intercourſe ſubſiſted between her and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn; he made it his buſineſs more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to have an eye upon their conduct.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, he noticed, that one day laſt April, his miſtreſs had been for ſome time looking from the front windows of the drawing-room into the ſtreet, and on a ſudden obſerved, that ſhe put on her hat and cloak, and went out into the ſtreet, pulling the door after her; when, ſuſpecting the buſineſs, he ſoon afterwards went out into the ſtreet himſelf, and on the oppoſite ſide of the way he ſaw Edward Waſhborn, but that he might not ſuppoſe this witneſs was upon the look-out, he aſked him where Mr. Wilmot's ſmith lived, and being informed, he immediately left him, pretending he was going to ſuch ſmith's, but ſtill for ſome little time kept his eye upon Waſhborn, whom he obſerved to follow Mrs. Wilmot, but did not watch them further, being apprehenſive that they might obſerve him ſo doing.</p>
               <p>On or about the 25th of March, he ſaid, that Elizabeth Barnes, Fanny Wilmot's own woman, having gone out, returned about eight o'clock in the evening, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came into the kitchen, and aſked him if her miſtreſs was from home, and upon his ſaying No, ſhe ſaid, It was very odd, ſhe had been trying to open the back drawing-room door, and found it faſtened; he then took no notice to Elizabeth Barnes, but ſuſpecting that Edward Waſhborn might be locked up there with his
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:033585_0148_0FF790EC13F55448"/>
miſtreſs, he communicated his ſuſpicion to Samuel Clough, the footman, and deſired him to go into the area where he could ſee every perſon who went out of or into the houſe, which Clough accordingly did; though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to his ſpeaking to Clough upon the ſubject, he went himſelf into the parlour in order to liſten and be on the watch, and had remained there but a very ſhort time before he heard the back drawing-room door open, and ſaw his miſtreſs come down ſtairs, who ſeeing him, came into the dining-parlour and took up a newſpaper, and looked at the ſame until he left the room and went down ſtairs into the kitchen. But while he remained on the liſten on the kitchen ſtair-caſe, and almoſt immediately afterwards, he heard his miſtreſs return up ſtairs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come down again very ſoftly, with another foot coming down ſtairs at the ſame time with her; both went along the paſſage, and he then heard the ſtreet door open very gently, upon which he crept up three or four ſtairs, and ſaw his miſtreſs with the door in her hand about a quarter open, and gently ſhutting the ſame to, and ſhe then returned, and having opened the back-door to let the dog in, went up ſtairs—He then went down ſtairs into the kitchen, and having joined Clough, he aſked him whom he had ſeen go out at the ſtreet-door, who anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Edward Waſhborn. From the foregoing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he is firmly perſuaded that Waſhborn had been locked up ſome time with his miſtreſs, in the back draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, that it was not known to any of the ſervants in the family, that Waſhborn was in the houſe, previous to Elizabeth Barnes returning home that evening as before-mentioned; ſo that he did verily believe, that he was let into the houſe on that occaſion, privately, by Mrs. Wilmot, in the ſame manner as he was let out. This witneſs well remembered that his maſter was from home at the time, having an engagement to dine abroad on that day.</p>
               <p>He further ſaid, that on Sunday the tenth of April laſt, Mr. Wilmot dined abroad, and Mrs. Fanny Wilmot at home with Mrs. Paſcall, a lady of her acquaintance;
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033585_0149_0FF790F02F07FE48"/>
that juſt as the ſervants had finiſhed their dinner, the drawing-room bell rung, which was anſwered by Samuel Clough, who, as he was going into the room, he ſaw Mrs. Paſcall going out of doors with one of Mr. Wilmot's children, to take a walk; that Clough ſoon returned from the drawing-room, and on being aſked what the bell rung for, he ſaid, it was for Waſhborn (who had on that day dined with them in the kitchen) to go up to his miſtreſs; and preſently afterwards this witneſs ſaw Edward Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born go up ſtairs, and heard his miſtreſs ſpeaking to him in the drawing-room, the door being open; in about five minutes afterwards, going up again ſoftly, and obſerving the drawing-room door was ſhut, he then returned into the dining-parlour, determining to watch Waſhborn's coming down, and ſoon afterwards heard a creaking noiſe in the drawing-room, which he verily believes proceeded from his miſtreſs and Edward Waſhborn's being upon the large ſopha, which always ſtood in ſuch room; and from ſuch noiſe, which continued ſome minutes, he was induced to believe, that Fanny Wilmot and him were then and there committing adultery together; but after they had remained ſhut up in the drawing-room near thirty minutes, Waſhborn came down ſtairs and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kitchen; while, as he went up on a pretence to go into the back drawing-room, he met his miſtreſs on the landing-place, and obſerved ſhe was without her hat, and that her hair appeared very much diſordered, although at the time of dinner and afterwards, ſhe wore a hat, and her hair appeared to be well dreſſed and powdered.</p>
               <p>The pleaſure of watching to diſcover what this witneſs pretended to know beforehand, muſt have been very great; as having leave to go to the play one evening with ſome of the maid ſervants, he could not ſtay with them, but came home and got into the ſtable, where he ſent for Samuel Clough, and deſired him alſo to watch his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs's motions!</p>
               <p>William Tapſcott, coachman to Mr. Wilmot, ſaid, that living in the family ever ſince 1788, it appeared to him that his miſtreſs frequently fought opportunities of
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:033585_0150_0FF790F1C5F953D0"/>
being alone with her footman, Edward Waſhborn; and he was the more induced to notice her conduct by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that, about a twelvemonth before that time, whilſt the family were at the country-houſe at Wandſworth in Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he was paſſing by the breakfaſt-parlour window, and then obſerved that his miſtreſs and Waſhborn were in the parlour, and that his arms was round his miſtreſs's waiſt, which he immediately dropt on his paſſing by. And further, his miſtreſs uſed in town, he ſaid, (unleſs ſhe had ladies to viſit her, which was not often the caſe) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from table ſoon after ſhe had dined, and go into her drawing-room, when Edward Waſhborn uſed to go as ſoon as he had dined, and carry her dog victuals in a plate and upon theſe occaſions remain with her ten minutes, and ſometimes a quarter of an hour together. He had ſeveral times noticed, as ſoon as his maſter's bell has rung for the butler to clear the dining-table, that Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born has come running down ſtairs from his miſtreſs, in order, as he apprehended, to avoid being ſeen with her by his maſter. And that after breakfaſt, as ſoon as his maſter was gone out, he uſed to go into the room to his miſtreſs when ſhe has been alone, where they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alone together for a quarter of an hour at a time.</p>
               <p>Previous to the diſcharge of Waſhborn from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mr. Wilmot, which took place in February laſt, he ſaid he never knew his miſtreſs to walk out unatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome or one of the men-ſervants, but after that event he has obſerved her ſeveral times to walk out alone without any ſervant; and on the twentieth of April laſt, having heard from one of his fellow-ſervants that ſhe was going to walk out, and ſuſpecting ſhe was going to Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born's lodging, No. 12, in Kings-ſtreet, Holborn, he was determined to watch her, and for that purpoſe went to a public houſe fronting the ſtreet where, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, he ſaw her go into the houſe where Waſhborn then lodged; and in about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an hour afterwards he ſaw her come out, and Waſhborn following her to the door, and ſeeming as if he was ſpeaking to her, and then bowing to her as ſhe left
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:033585_0151_0FF790F362D5E860"/>
him—He then ſaw her go into a child-bed ware-houſe next door, where ſhe ſtaid about ſix or ſeven minutes, and then came out again, and paſſed by the houſe from whence he had watched her, and ſhe appeared as if ſhe was walking home, but this witneſs, that he might not be obſerved by her, went a different way, and got home be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her.</p>
               <p>His maſter, he further ſaid, on account of his being a Member of Parliament, and on account of his various other avocations was neceſſarily abſent a great deal from his houſe in Bedford-row— But, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of a day in April laſt, he well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered it was on Eaſter Monday, he took a letter from his maſter to his fellow-witneſs, Mr. Scatchard, at No. 12, in King-ſtreet, where Edward Waſhborn lodged, and while he was waiting in the paſſage for an anſwer, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour-door was opened by a ſervant, where he ſaw his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſitting therein, and folding up a letter, and when ſhe had folded it, ſhe roſe, came out, paſſed the witneſs, and went up ſtairs; ſhe then appeared in tears and greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated; ſhe enquired for a porter, and almoſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately afterwards this witneſs having received a letter from Mr. Scatchard to his maſter, came away; and ſince that time, he ſaid, that his maſter had not, to his knowledge or belief, cohabited with his wife.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Barnes, lady's maid in the family of Sir John Dailing, Bart in Upper Harley-ſtreet, ſaid, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout June, 1786, ſhe went to live in the family of John Wilmot, Eſq. in the capacity of own woman to Fanny Wilmot his wife; and continued to live in his family in that capacity, until the fifteenth of May laſt, and from the time ſhe went to live in this family Mr. John Wilmot and Fanny his wife had ſix children, viz. one ſon and five daughters, all living— Five children, and all living! —What an age muſt this be, when matrons go a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding! There was nothing elſe material in this witneſs's evidence.</p>
               <p>Ann Wiſdom very <hi>wiſely</hi> aſſerted, that in the evening of a day, a little before Chriſtmas laſt, Edward Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:033585_0152_0FF790F530969940"/>
complaining that he was ſomewhat indiſpoſed; came up ſtairs and retired to his bed-room, the door of which was oppoſite to the door of the nurſery-room, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by a narrow paſſage, in order, as ſhe ſuppoſed, to lay down: That about nine o'clock the ſame evening, the children being all in the drawing-room with her maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and miſtreſs, ſhe left it, and came up ſtairs into the nurſery, and finding the deponent there, ſhe ſent her down ſtairs to her own woman Elizabeth Barnes, who was then in the kitchen, with a meſſage, that ſhe was to go to the mantua-maker's, and deſire her to come the next morning to meaſure one of the young ladies for a gown. She accordingly went down ſtairs, carried the meſſage, and returned immediately, and when ſhe was near the upper flight of ſtairs, ſhe heard her miſtreſs in the paſſage between the nurſery and Waſhbon's bed-room and heard her go into the nurſery where, when ſhe went in, ſhe found her ſitting; and did not then appear, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have any other buſineſs in the nurſery, or for waiting there, except the ſending of her down ſtairs to Elizabeth Barnes, for whom ſhe might have rung the bell in the drawing-room: and that from the circumſtances before depoſed to, and her overhearing her in the paſſage as beforementioned, and returning into the nurſery, ſhe then ſuſpected, and does now believe, that her miſtreſs took the opportunity of her abſence to go into Waſhborn's bed-room, where he then was.</p>
               <p>Ann Frazer, ſpinſter, houſe-maid, ſaid, that about two months after ſhe went to live in the family, ſhe began to notice that her miſtreſs took every opportunity of being alone with Waſhborn, her footman, but the circumſtance that induced her to notice the ſame more particularly, was her having one day about that time gone unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly into the drawing-room, and found them alone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when they both appeared much confuſed, her miſtreſs bluſhing exceedingly. From that time ſhe ſaid ſhe was cautious how ſhe put herſelf in the way of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon them when ſhe has known them to be alone in a room together, as her miſtreſs on the beforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>Perrot Fenton, of Doctors Commons, London, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, being ſworn, ſaid, that on Friday the 15th of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril laſt, he was ſent for to the Chambers of Meſſrs. Wilmot, Dunn, and Lancaſter, Solicitors in Lincoln's Inn, and on going thither was introduced to John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot Eſq. and conſulted as to the meaſures neceſſary to be taken on his part, in conſequence of his having then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently been informed that his wife carried on a criminal correſpondence with Edward Waſhborn, a diſcarded footman, who then lodged at a houſe, No. 12, in King-ſtreet, Holborn; and when this witneſs had conſidered the circumſtances of the caſe, he conſulted counſel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by the advice of counſel he went to the houſe in King-ſtreet, on Saturday the ſixteenth of the ſame month, and engaged apartments as for an acquaintance, of the name of Marſhall; that ſuch apartments conſiſted of a dining or front room on the firſt floor, and a back-room on the ſecond floor of the houſe; but Mr. Marſhall, whom he then intended to place in ſuch lodging, diſappointing him, he applied to his fellow-witneſs Mr. Scatchard, and prevailed on him to occupy them for the purpoſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering whether Mrs. Wilmot really did or did not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a criminal correſpondence with Waſhborn. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, Mr. Scatchard took poſſeſſion on Monday
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:033585_0155_0FF790FDA4B3E3A8"/>
the 18th of April, and occupied them till Monday the 25th; when, to avoid ſuſpicion, this witneſs was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to introduce Mr. Scatchard to the houſe by the name of Marſhall, where this witneſs very frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him, and ſeveral times had opportunities of viewing the room then occupied by Waſhborn, and other parts of the houſe; though it was not till the 20th of April that he had an opportunity of being certain that Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot and Waſhborn were locked up together, and alone in the chamber of the latter, when he had no doubt of their commiſſion of the crime of adultery together.</p>
               <p>But on Saturday the 23d of April, this witneſs again called on Mr. Scatchard, in King-ſtreet, who informed him that the lady was juſt come to the houſe, and was then in the next room with Waſhborn, and preſently after Thomas Scatchard had communicated ſuch information, this witneſs left the houſe, and went to Mr. Wilmot, who was then waiting in the neighbourhood, and conſulted him as to the adviſeableneſs of breaking into the room wherein Fanny Wilmot and Edward Waſhborn were ſhut up, and afterwards quitting Mr. Wilmot, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to No. 12, King-ſtreet, he ſaw his fellow-witneſs, Mr. Scatchard, ſtanding on the balluſtrade of the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and looking through the lights or little windows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bed-chamber, when Mr. Scatchard informed him, that Waſhborn and the lady were in the nook or corner, between the bed and the fire-place, and that the bed-cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not being drawn forward, he had been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the motions of the parties; that the lady had been crying, and that Edward Waſhborn had been ſoothing and careſſing her. This man then took the place of his fellow-witneſs, and obſerved that the ſhutters of the firſt and third ſaſhed windows of the bed-room were cloſed, and that the parties were retired into the nook or corner near the fire-place—their perſons could not be ſeen from the ſituation he was then in, but on turning to the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs which hung againſt the pier, between the ſecond and third ſaſhed windows, he ſaw, by the reflection, the heads of Fanny Wilmot and Edward Waſhborn, and was
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:033585_0156_0FF7910081148128"/>
convinced they were then ſitting cloſe together on the left ſide of the bed, and were kiſſing together. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterwards Waſhborn appeared to ſink or kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lady, while the reflection of her head only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained viſible to the witneſs on the looking-glaſs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the ſame was ſo hung, as not to reflect the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the bodies of the parties, though he obſerved the teſter of the bed and the curtains to be agitated or ſhaken; and particularly obſerved the head of Fanny Wilmot in motion; and upon the whole, from all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances then under his obſervation, he did at the time believe that ſhe then ſat on the ſide of the bed, and that Waſhborn knelt before her, and that in that poſition they committed adultery together. And he alſo ſaid, that after he had for ſome time viewed the premiſes, he gave place to his fellow-witneſs, Thomas Scatchard, who took another view, and then expreſſed the like opinion to him: and further, that after Fanny Wilmot and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn had remained together about an hour, or an hour and a half, according to the beſt of his recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, Mr. Scatchard went out of the houſe into the ſtreet, to watch Fanny Wilmot on her return from thence, and this witneſs remained there, and by means of the lights in the partition, he ſoon afterwards ſaw Fanny Wilmot and Edward Waſhborn ſtanding together, near the middle of the chamber, with their hands joined; they were in very earneſt diſcourſe, and appeared to be greatly agitated, and frequently lifted their joined hands up towards Heaven, and ſeemed to the witneſs to be plighting vows to each other; and that after they for ſome time had remained thus, they paſſed towards the door of the chamber, while he retired up ſtairs to the landing-place on the ſecond-floor, and then heard one of them undo the faſtenings on the inſide of the chamber-door, and come out, when Fanny Wilmot ſaid ſomething in a low tone of voice, which appeared to him to be a ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that there was ſome perſon watching them, as Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn came forward, and ſtepped up two or three of the ſecond flight of ſtairs, and then returned,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:033585_0157_0FF791045131EE88"/>
ſaying, "Oh no, there is not!" This witneſs then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the balluſtrades of the ſtair-caſe, which is a well ſtair-caſe, ſaw Waſhborn going down ſtairs, and Fanny Wilmot following him; and preſently heard the ſtreet-door ſhut to, and then ſaw Edward Waſhborn paſs up ſtairs, and go into his chamber, and open the ſhutters of the firſt ſaſhed window.</p>
               <p>But the diſcovery on the part of Mr. Wilmot himſelf, it ſeems, did not take place till the 26th of April, when, as this witneſs was at breakfaſt with Mr. Scatchard, with the dining room door a little opened, they heard a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the ſtreet-door, and thereupon heard Waſhborn open his chamber-door, run down ſtairs, and return up ſtairs, converſing with a woman, who accompanied him into his chamber, when one of the parties faſtened the door of the chamber on the inſide—And it having been previouſly determined, between Mr. Wilmot and this witneſs, that the correſpondence between Mrs. Wilmot and Waſhborn ſhould be expoſed that morning, this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then went to Mr. Wilmot, at a houſe in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, leaving his fellow witneſs to make ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries as he was able. About half an hour afterwards he returned to King-ſtreet, with Mr. Wilmot, whom he introduced to the gentlewoman of the houſe, in a parlour on the ground-floor; and, after ſtaying ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtairs, and endeavouring to calm the agitation of Mr. Wilmot, and do away the ſurprize and apprehenſion of the people of the houſe, he went up ſtairs, and on the firſt flight he obſerved Mr. Scatchard looking through certain holes which he had made in the wainſcot, which, as he afterwards found, commanded a view of the nook, or corner, between the bed and fire-place beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; he then paſſed Mr. Scatchard, and went on the ſecond flight of ſtairs, and looked into the chamber, and obſerved that the ſhutters of the firſt and third ſaſh win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were cloſed, and that Fanny Wilmot and Edward Waſhborn were ſtanding together between the bed and the fire-place; he ſoon afterwards heard the bar let down on the inſide of the door of the chamber, and the lock
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:033585_0158_0FF79106041BB260"/>
turned, and ſaw the door opened, and Edward Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born come out, warily drawing the door to after him—this witneſs then advanced to him, and gave him a letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to Mrs. Wilmot, and ordered him to deliver it to Mrs. Wilmot, whereupon he appeared ſurpriſed and confounded; but on his ſaying he knew Mrs. Wilmot was in the room, Waſhborn withdrew with the letter, and again faſtened the door on the inſide. This letter was written by Mr. Wilmot, informing her of his having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her infidelity, and inſiſting that ſhe ſhould not return to his houſe, recommending it to her to adviſe with her friends, promiſing to ſend her linen, and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparel, and to furniſh her with money occaſionally. When this letter was delivered, Mr. Wilmot went up ſtairs to the dining-room, and tenderly expreſſed great apprehenſion for the perſonal ſafety of Mrs. Wilmot; left the ſhame of the diſcovery ſhould be too much for her—But ſoon afterwards Mrs. Wilmot came out of the chamber, and was accoſted by her huſband, who led her into the oppoſite dining-room, where ſuch a ſcene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued between them as made this witneſs very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that Mr. Wilmot would be overpowered by the poignancy of his feelings, eſpecially as he knew he was not in a good ſtate of health—While Mr. Wilmot and Fanny Wilmot were converſing together, this deponent and his fellow witneſs, went into the chamber, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the bed was greatly tumbled—At length Mr. Wilmot and this witneſs withdrew from the houſe, but Mrs. Wilmot ſtaid there; in the afternoon of the ſame day, this deponent again ſaw and converſed with her, and about nine o'clock in the evening of the ſame day he again ſaw and talked with her, in Waſhborn's chamber, Waſhborn being preſent: and Fanny Wilmot then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the witneſs that ſhe intended to ſleep that night in the houſe, and he was afterwards informed, and believes, ſhe did remain at the houſe until the next morning. He further ſaid, he was well aſſured that Mr. John Wilmot is a Member of Parliament, a Maſter in Chancery, and a Commiſſioner of American Claims; and that his vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033585_0159_0FF791079CE9A838"/>
avocations muſt neceſſarily have occaſioned him to be abſent a great deal from his houſe in Bedford-row.</p>
               <p>It further appeared, that about noon on the aforeſaid Monday, Mr. John Wilmot cauſed the trunks and boxes in Waſhborn's apartments in King-ſtreet to be ſearched by a peace-officer, in the preſence of him John Wilmot, Fanny Wilmot his wife, Edward Waſhborn, this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and his fellow-witneſs, Thomas Scatchard; and that in the trunks, or boxes, there were found a parcel of guineas wrapped up in paper, and a large aſſortment of faſhionable and new cloaths, but no letters; and on being queſtioned by this witneſs, Waſhborn in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and hearing of his miſtreſs, acknowledged that he had received many letters from her, and that he had burnt them on the preceding day; which Mrs. Fanny Wilmot, on being queſtioned by her huſband, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſhe had written and ſent letters to Edward Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born—There were alſo divers prints and drawings which Mrs. Wilmot and Edward Waſhborn then acknowledged had belonged to her, and that ſhe had given the ſame to him, and alſo a ſhirt-pin, ſet with hair, wrapped in ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paper, and appeared to be quite new; an elegant fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy gold ring, ſet with hair, a box with curious ſhells, a nutmeg grater in the ſhape of a heart, a pocket-book, an ink-ſtand, two riding-whips, a ſtraw-box, and a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ſweet water with a label bearing the inſcription of "Eau de Cologne," and various other articles. And as for the hair in the head of the ſhirt-pin, Mrs. Wilmot acknowledged it was her own.</p>
               <p>It further appeared, that while Mr. Wilmot was in great diſtreſs of mind, on account of his wife's infidelity, and the neceſſity there was for preſerving appearances, till he could obtain ſufficient evidence of her guilt, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the reſpondent of his having been applied to give a character of Waſhborn to Colonel Popham, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times expreſſed the embarraſſment he laboured under on that account; but this witneſs adviſed him to give ſuch a character; he did ſo, and it was ſince believed that Waſhborn was, by appointment, to go, and did go, to his
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:033585_0160_0FF7910A8CC8C038"/>
place at the ſaid Colonel Popham's, late in the evening of the twenty-fifth of April laſt.</p>
               <p>This witneſs, in reſpect to what he ſaw in Waſhborn's room, ſaid, that on Saturday the twenty-third day of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, he obſerved the reflection of the heads of Fanny Wilmot and Edward Waſhborn, face to face, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw the reflection of her head in motion, and alſo a tremulous motion in the teſter and curtains of the bed, and after that Fanny Wilmot and Edward Waſhborn ſtanding hand in hand together, and converſing together in an earneſt and agitated manner.</p>
               <p>He further ſaid, that he furniſhed his fellow-witneſs, Thomas Scatchard, with gimblets of all the ſizes he could meet with in an ironmonger's, with ſome or one of which he made three or four holes in different parts of the wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot of the room, by means of which they found the whole of the nook or corner to which the parties uſed to retire, might be fully viewed; but, from an apprehenſion of being called on as a witneſs, and believing Thomas Scatchard would be fully competent to the proving the adultery between the parties, he modeſtly felt himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to looking through the hole, while he ſuppoſed the parties were committing adultery together; but, at length, on being ſtrongly urged by his fellow-witneſs, he did for a moment look through one of the holes, juſt before Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn opened the door, but Fanny Wilmot was then ſtanding ſo cloſe to the wainſcot, that he could not ſee any thing but her gown; by that means he eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped being put to the bluſh!</p>
               <p>Neither could he ſay he ever ſaw the miniſtrant and Waſhborn lying down together on the bed in the room; nor take upon himſelf to depoſe poſitively to an act of adultery between them; but he was witneſs to ſo many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximate acts, that he has not any doubts in his mind, but that they did frequently commit adultery together.</p>
               <p>It is now worth while to obſerve Mrs. Wilmot's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in denying the charge of adultery; as the time when ſhe was leaving Waſhborn's chamber, in order to return home, this witneſs ſtopped up to her and introduced
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033585_0161_0FF7910EE6F655B0"/>
her to her huſband, who was at his elbow; at which Mrs. Wilmot appeared as though ſhe affected to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the producent's charging her with adultery, and repeatedly aſſured him he was miſtaken, and even ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared ſhe was entirely innocent of that crime, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſoliciting that her oath might be taken, as to her being innocent of the ſame. Waſhborn alſo forced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the company, and made the like declarations, and offered to take his oath to the ſame purport; and they both contended that the producent ought to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſuch their oaths, and this witneſs had no doubt but that they would have taken their oaths accordingly; but he conſidered this part of their conduct to be part of a plan concerted between them, and further conſidered Waſhborn's intruſion ſo improper, that he repeatedly drove him from the preſence of the producent. Mrs. Wilmot at firſt, he ſaid, urged there was nothing impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in her conduct; and even after the circumſtances which could be adduced in evidence againſt her, were ſtated, ſhe deſired ſhe might be allowed to clear herſelf on oath, and then that her little indiſcretions might be forgiven! and ſhe particularly deſired Mr. Wilmot would not mention the matter to his father and family. And, lawyer-like, after obtaining an account of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charges which were to be made againſt her, ſhe aſked whether the reſpondent and his fellow-witneſs, Thomas Scatchard, would take upon themſelves to ſwear, that they had ſeen <hi>an abſolute act</hi> of adultery, and on being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the negative, ſhe addreſſed herſelf to the reſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and ſaid, as ſhe obeſerved that the producent acted under his opinion, ſhe deſired to argue the caſe with him and then contended, as the producent could not prove a poſitive act of adultery, he could not avail himſelf of the circumſtances of the caſe, ſo as to obtain a divorce!!!</p>
               <p>A Deputy's lady in the city hearing this part of the trial, exclaimed, to <hi>largeſt half,</hi> "Dear, dear, Mr. Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, did you ever hear ſo much <hi>imperence</hi> in all your born-days!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="unknown:033585_0162_0FF791109DB49570"/>All the witneſſes proved that the houſe of Mrs. Page, where Waſhborn lodged, was a decent houſe, as well as that Mrs. Page was a very diſcreet woman!</p>
               <p>Thomas Scatchard, of Wardrobe Place, Doctor's Commons, London, went exactly over the ſame ground as the laſt witneſs, but was very particular in aſſerting that he plainly ſaw the curtain ſhake; that having looked for ſome time, he gave place to his fellow-witneſs, Perrot Fenton, who alſo looked for ſome time, and then gave place to him again, who, on looking again, by the help of the looking-glaſs which hung againſt the pier between the ſecond and third windows, obſerved, that Waſhborn, and Mrs. Wilmot had come more forward into the room and ſaw them embrace and kiſs each other ſeveral times, till Waſhborn ſunk down before ſuch lady, out of his ſight.—But, previous to this, by opening the holes in the wainſcot; he very plainly ſaw Waſhborn and Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot ſtanding together between the bed and fire-place, and apparently in converſation; that preſently afterwards they ſat down on the bed-ſide cloſe to each other, when Edward Waſhborn took the lady by the left hand and kiſſed the ſame, and when he had ſo done, he ſtooped a little, and with his right hand pulled up her petticoats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above her knees, ſo that this witneſs could plainly ſee her naked thighs; that he then ſtooped and kiſſed her naked thigh once or twice, and having ſo done, this witneſs ſaw him put his right-hand up her petticoats, which ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to reſiſt; but they ſoon got up, and ſtood face to face, when he obſerved that the flap of Waſhborn's breeches was unbuttoned; that Edward Waſhborn again put one of his hands up the petticoats of ſuch lady, and his other hand round her waiſt; ſhe making ſome little reſiſtance, and ſtanding croſs-legged; and that having ſtood for ſome time in this ſituation, the lady appeared to be moving as if ſhe were about to go away.</p>
               <p>Mary Page, of King-ſtreet, Bloomſbury, widow, ſaid, that ſome time in the beginning of Febuary 1791, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn applied to her to take an apartment or lodging in her houſe; and conceiving him to be a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:033585_0163_0FF791125580E9D0"/>
and having received a character of him as ſuch, ſhe immediately agreed to let him have the uſe of a bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room in her houſe; where he lived for eleven weeks, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, he was ſeveral times viſited there by Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, Mr. Wilmot's houſe-keeper, whom this witneſs and her ſervant then underſtood, and believed to be, his aunt.</p>
               <p>She added, that in about a fortnight after, he began to be viſited by a female perſon, about twice in the courſe of every week, during the time he reſided there. This female was always let into and out of the houſe by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Waſhborn, and they were always together in his bed-room, and alone, but ſhe did not think they ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained together at ſuch viſits for a conſiderable time.</p>
               <p>Richard Townſend, and John Serjeant, of Doctor's Commons, London, Gentlemen, proved the marriage of the parties.</p>
               <p>This very ſingular cauſe was firſt brought into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory Court of London—and from thence an Apeal was made to the Arches Court of Canterbury; where a Sentence of Divorce was obtained.</p>
               <p>This trial, it ſhould be remarked, is deſtitute of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which has certainly diſtinguiſhed a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the kind—which is, that the lady's confidante has not become the principal witneſs againſt her!</p>

               <head>The Trial of George Davidſon, at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle upon Tyne, in Auguſt, 1774; for a Rape upon Iſabella Blair.</head>
               <p>THE following trial, as well as ſome others which appears in the courſe of this Work, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring at an aſſize in the country, never appeared before in any collection whatever, and but for the aſſiduity of the Editors might have entirely eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the cognizance of our readers.</p>
               <p>Doctor Scott ſaid, that about the 21ſt of January laſt, Iſabella Blair applied to him at Stannerton, where he practiſes phyſic; that ſhe told him how ſhe had been uſed by the priſoner, and was adviſed to come to him for his advice. The doctor ſaid that he did not examine her cloſely; ſhe complained of a pain and weakneſs in her back, and a pain in one of her legs and knee, which he found were inflamed and ſwelled. She told him that ſhe had been four days in coming from the place where ſhe lived to him; which is about ten miles—he gave her ſome medicines, and called afterwards to ſee her, and told her that the diſtance was too far for him to attend her properly, and to adminiſter the quantity of medicines her diſorder required; and, likewiſe, that it would be neceſſary for her to apply to the Infirmary at Newcaſtle, where ſhe would have the care taken of her that the diſtemper required, and get the aſſiſtance of the faculty of that houſe. He was then aſked by the court, if he thought the uſage ſhe met with from the priſoner was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that diſorder ſhe complained of? he ſaid, that in the manner ſhe told him the circumſtances, he made not the leaſt doubt but it was. That, as
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:033585_0165_0FF7911958E058E0"/>
far as he had examined, complaints of that nature might come by cold.</p>
               <p>Doctor Rotheram ſaid, that Iſabella Blair came as a patient to the infirmary about the middle of February laſt; he being attending phyſician that week, ſhe was under his care. That ſhe told him the circumſtances in the ſame manner as ſhe had ſpoken in court. He then examined her very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely, and found the vagina very much depreſſed and inflamed. That the circumſtances appeared to him as if ſhe had been lain with by a man. On the doctor being aſked with regard to her knee and leg he agreed with what Mr. Scott had ſaid. He ſaid he would not have the jury underſtand him that the inflammation and ſwelling might not be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by cold, as it was a rheumatic complaint— On his being aſked if the proſecutrix's recovery was any ways doubtful? he ſaid he looked upon her to be in a very dangerous way, as the diſorder had fallen on her lungs.—He was further aſked, if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had never known man, might not appear, on examination, as if ſhe had. He ſaid it was very obvious that a woman might be deflowered by a fall, &amp;c. though ſhe had never known man.</p>
               <p>Iſabella Blair ſaid, that ſhe lived with Mr. Potts, at Maſon Dinnington Hill-head, on the 12th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1773, on which day ſhe had leave to go to Stannerton to ſee her miſtreſs's grand-children dance, who reſided there; that on her return home ſhe called in at a public-houſe at Maſon Dinnington, with deſire to go to ſee the dancers, as there was a dancing-ſchool in that town, where ſhe met with the priſoner at the bar, George Davidſon, drinking, who as hired to her miſtreſs; he deſired her to ſit down, on which ſhe told him he had more need to go home to his wife than to be ſitting there ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his money. The priſoner then told her that his wife had taken the child that day along with her to go and ſee her (the priſoner's wife's) mother.
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:033585_0166_0FF7911AF36A9900"/>
She then replied, he ought to be the more careful during her abſence, and deſired of him, as it was late, to ſee her home. The priſoner then told her, if ſhe would ſtop a little he would go with her. He then called for ſome more liquor, and ſhe went to ſee the dancers, and on her return ſhe found the priſoner ſtill drinking; ſhe again ſolicited him to go home with her, he then told her he would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother pot, and then he would go with her. On this ſhe became very uneaſy, and told him ſhe muſt be going; he then ſaid, as ſoon as the liquor was out he would go with her, and at the ſame time added, he would lye with her in the way home. She then replied, "No, George, I hope not—I dare truſt myſelf with you, as I think you are a better man than to do any thing to harm me." Upon this they came away together, and he was very peaceable till they were better than half way (this diſtance was better than a quarter of a mile) and then he took hold of her and threw her down on the ground —She, amazed at this treatment, aſked him what he meant to do; he anſwered, he would lye with her; ſhe ſaid, For God's ſake, George, rather take my life, for the one will be as agreeable as the other: he was then preparing to lye with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Court.</hi> What do you mean by preparing to lye with you?—He was letting down his breeches.</p>
               <p>She then turned herſelf on her face; the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then pulled up her cloaths behind; ſhe then ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with him and got upon her feet; upon this, he caught hold of her by the ancle, and ſhe fell upon her knees: he now took hold of her by the left arm, and twined her over on her back; ſhe ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all her might, he put his hand upon her mouth; whilſt ſhe ſtruggled as much as ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till, quite ſpent, ſhe could make no more reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He then took hold of her by the legs and dragged her over five or ſix ridges of the field.</p>
               <p>At this part of her examination the proſecrutrix
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:033585_0167_0FF7911C9A0358F8"/>
fainted, and coming to herſelf again, was informed by the court not to think any ſhame, as there was a neceſſity of her explaining every circumſtance.</p>
               <p>The priſoner then laid himſelf upon her, and had carnal knowledge of her body.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe fainted a ſecond time—On her recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Court.</hi> Did the priſoner enter your body?—Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Court.</hi> Did you feel any thing come from him?— Yes.</p>
               <p>She fainted a third time.</p>
               <p>On being aſked if the priſoner left her after this uſage, and if ſhe went home immediately, ſhe ſaid, ſhe had not power to move from the ground; that he ſat upon the dike oppoſite to her for about a minute, and then he came and uſed her in the ſame manner as he had done before. He then raiſed her from the ground, and bid her go home; ſhe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſtand, ſunk down on her knees. The priſoner then d—d her for a b—h, and aſked her if ſhe had got drunk. That ſhe then deſired the priſoner to go and get ſomebody to take her home; that the priſoner then left her for ſome time, and returned again, ſaying he had been to get her brother, but that he could get none of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to hear, for they were all in bed. He then uſed her in the ſame manner as before, ſhe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make any more reſiſtance. And after that he thruſt ſomething hard up her body, which to her ſeemed as if he was tearing out her bowels; that ſhe ſuppoſed it muſt have been his hand; and he likewiſe put an old tobacco-chew there, which ſhe took out of that place herſelf; that from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and pain, ſhe was in a ſtate of inſenſibility, and could remember no more.</p>
               <p>William Blair ſaid, that the night on which it happened, which was on the 12th day of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber laſt, Iſabella Blair, his ſiſter, went to Stannerton hopping. That about half paſt ten o'clock that
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:033585_0168_0FF79121933C58D0"/>
night, as he was ſtanding in the houſe where he lived, he heard ſomething like a rap at the door, when, on his opening it, his ſiſter fell into his arms. That as ſoon as he brought her in and ſaw her in the light, her cap was off, as was likewiſe her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief: her breaſt was bare, and her cloaths torn and dirty. He aſked her what was the matter. She told him ſhe had been very badly uſed in ſuch a field, and that ſhe had in ſtruggling loſt her bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and upon her deſcribing the place, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately took a lanthorn and candle, and went to the place in the field where it had happened; when he came there he found the graſs laid down for about five ridges, as if ſomebody had been lying and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling there: that he found his ſiſter's cap, handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, &amp;c. ſilver button; the cap and handkerchief were torn, (they were produced in court) that he then brought them home, where he found his ſiſter in a very weak condition, ſitting in an arm-chair: on his being aſked if he was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of her ſituation, and the perſon who had uſed her ſo, ſhe ſaid, George Davidſon.</p>
               <p>Roger Maſon, ſaid, that the night on which this affair happened he was at work in the byar; that his work being done, he came into the room where Iſabella Blair was; he found her ſitting in an arm-chair by the fire—her brother was ſtanding with his back towards her—that ſhe ſeemed to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent to be very ill—that her breaſt and head were bare, and her hair hanging about her ſhoulders —her brother got a lanthorn and candle and deſired him to go along with him in ſearch of her cloaths —that he went with him to the field, where they found the graſs, ſome trodden down, and her cloaths were found in that place—On his being aſked if he ſaw the priſoner that night, he ſaid he did not ſee him till the next day, when he (the priſoner) aſked after Bella; this deponent then told him he had behaved to her in a very baſe manner, and which
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:033585_0169_0FF791232DE4B3F8"/>
he was afraid he would have reaſon to repent of. The priſoner then told him he was very much in liquor, and that if he had behaved ill to her he was very ſorry for it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Potts ſaid, that Iſabella Blair was ſervant to her at the time the affair happened. That on the 12th of November laſt, ſhe ſent her to Stanner<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton hopping, and to ſee her grand-daughter dance, as there was a dancing-ſchool at Maſon Dinnington that on her return home ſhe was in a very miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

On the deponent's being aſked if ſhe had examined her body or her linen? ſhe ſaid her linen ſhe did, but not her body, and found the back part of her ſhift very wet, which ſhe ſuppoſed was with the priſoner's dragging her over the graſs—and on being asked if there was any blood appeared upon it? ſhe ſaid, No; but that there was blood on her arm—and on her being further asked in regard to her health before this happened, ſhe ſaid that ſhe had lived with her two years and a half, and that ſhe never knew her ill in that time, but once of an ague, of which ſhe got the better, and had her health afterwards as well as ſhe had before, till this misfortune happened—And on being asked if ever the proſecutrix was given to keep company with the men, or behaved herſelf any ways indecent, ſhe ſaid ſhe never ſaw any thing of the kind by her, but thought her much the reverſe; and that a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervant could not be about any perſon's houſe than ſhe was.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Court.</hi> Have you any perſon to call to your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter?—Call John Pringle and Ann Rutter.</p>
               <p>John Pringle refuſed being ſworn; ſaid he knew little of the priſoner, and would chooſe to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in it, as he could do him no good.</p>
               <p>Ann Rutter ſworn. Said ſhe kept a public-houſe at Maſon Dinnington; that the priſoner had been ſeveral times in her houſe, that ſhe thought him an honeſt man, and never ſaw any thing ill by him. On her being asked if ever ſhe ſaw Iſabella Blair with the priſoner in her houſe? ſhe ſaid, that on the 12th of November laſt, in the evening, ſhe did. Being asked if ſhe heard or ſaw any indecencies paſs between them? ſhe ſaid, no further than when Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella Blair asked him to ſee her home, he told her if he did he would kiſs her by the way. Being asked in what manner the priſoner expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and whether ſhe thought it was in jeſt or in earneſt? ſhe ſaid, ſhe thought it was ſpoken in jeſt. She was further asked, whether ſhe thought the priſoner in liquor or not? ſhe ſaid, ſhe thought he was not, as he could ſpeak and walk very well.</p>
               <p>The Judge then ſumming up the evidence to the Jury in a very clear and impartial manner—they, without going out of court, found him Guilty.</p>
               <p>Judge Blackſtone then paſſed ſentence of Death upon the priſoner.</p>
               <p>There are two leading features in this trial, which in many caſes, would have terminated in mercy to the priſoner; that is to ſay, his being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by the proſecutrix to go home with her, though in a ſtate of intoxication, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had in ſome degree made his conditions for ſo doing, by forewarning her that he ſhould kiſs her or lye with her, if he did. There can be no doubt, but that in a circumſtance of this kind, with reſpect to the term <hi>kiſſing,</hi> it may be ſaid with much
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:033585_0171_0FF79126CE08D5A0"/>

However, the ſtate of intoxication, and what followed as the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, though tinctured with wantonneſs and barbarity, was dearly atoned for, in the ſacrifice of a life that might probably have repaired the injury ſuſtained.</p>

               <head>The Trial of Mrs. Timmings for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in the Conſiſtory Court of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; March 20, 1791.</head>
               <p>THE marriage being proved, Thomas Gillet, nephew and apprentice to Mr. John Timmings, in Steward-ſtreet, near Biſhopſgate-ſtreet, ſaid, that after he became jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman and foreman to Mr. Timmings, he very well knew Mr. J. Smith of Aldgate; and that Mr. and Mrs. Timmings always lived together as man and wife, till the month of January or February laſt, when Mrs. Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings's unlawful connection with Mr. Smith and others, was firſt diſcovered. Mr. Smith, he ſaid, he knew par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, by his bringing ſhoes to the houſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backwards and forwards as an acquaintance of his maſter and miſtreſs. On the 12th of February, he ſaid, that on Mr. Timmings's going out, he told him, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he was going to Greenwich; and that between eight and nine o'clock on the ſame evening, Mr. Smith came to the houſe; and he ſoon afterwards ſaw him in
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:033585_0172_0FF79129A5D689E8"/>
the kitchen, in company with Mrs. Timmings and Mary Gibbs, a maid-ſervant. From communications made to the witneſs by this maid ſervant, with reſpect to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mr. Smith and his miſtreſs, prior to this period, he ſaid, he ſuſpected a criminal connection; and had, therefore, made a cavity through the wainſcot of the kitchen, on purpoſe to make uſe of the firſt opportunity to obſerve their behaviour. As this kitchen was on the ground-floor, he found the ſtair-caſe a very convenient place; and accordingly, ſoon after Mr. Smith came in, having placed himſelf there, he kept his ſituation near two hours, during which time he ſaw the maid dreſs a ſowl, upon which herſelf, Mr. Smith, and her miſtreſs ſupped. Soon after this, Mary Gibbs put on her hat and cloak and went out, and left them together; this was near eleven at night: but as the witneſs ſtill kept his poſition, he ſoon obſerved Mr. Smith draw his chair towards Mrs. Timmings, and put his left hand round her neck, while ſhe laid her head on his ſhoulder. He then kiſſed her, and put his right-hand up her petticoats towards her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate parts; in which ſituation, after they had remained ſome time, the witneſs obſerved her petticoats drawn up, though he did not exactly ſee by what means; however, he was certain that Mr. Smith was then upon her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her legs, though he could not ſee whether his breeches were down or not; however, he plainly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his body in motion, while laying upon his miſtreſs, in a chair; from all which circumſtances, he had no manner of doubt but they were then in the act of copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and had the carnal uſe and knowledge of each other's bodies. But while they were in this ſituation, he obſerved Mr. Timmings ruſh into the kitchen, from a door leading to the yard, and addreſſing himſelf to Mr. Smith, ſaid, "You raſcal, how dare you come to my houſe and uſe my wife in this manner!" on which the deponent left his ſituation and went into the yard, and from thence into the ſtreet, when he heard Timmings ſay, "Out, out, out, with you," and heard the ſtreet-door ſhut, and Mrs. Timmings ſay, "Forgive me, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:033585_0173_0FF7912D6D139CA0"/>
me, I'll do ſo no more!" he left his aforeſaid ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the time by him predepoſed to; he did not ſee whether the ſaid James Smith's breeches were down or not as articulate. He added, that he did not of his own knowledge know, that Mr. Timmings was apprized of the ſituation of the ſaid perſons, and did not ſee him from the time of his leaving his houſe to go to Greenwich, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſaw him ruſh into the kitchen. That, ſoon after Mr. Timmings came into the ſtreet, where he and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent met, he appeared very much agitated, inſomuch that he begged the deponent to ſupport him, and they went to the houſe of Grace Timmings, his mother, in Biſhopſgate-ſtreet, where he ſtaid about a quarter of an hour, and then with his aunt, Amey Barker, returned to his houſe; he went there the next day, and ſaw Mrs. Timmings go from thence, ſince which he never ſaw her there, but had conſtantly ſeen her huſband reſiding there.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grace Timmings, widow, of Biſhopſgate ſtreet, ſaid, that Mr. Chamberlain, of White Lion-ſtreet, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Yard, being indirectly charged by her ſon with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing connected with his wife, he agreed to come and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the matter with the latter at his houſe in Union-ſtreet —he came accordingly, and Mr. Timmings, Mr. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, Mrs. Timmings, and herſelf, all went together into the fore parlour; Mrs. Timmings's father, Mr. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Huet, of Hackney, was alſo preſent—Mr. Timmings then aſked her, in the preſence of them all, whether ſhe did not go with Mr. Chamberlain to an houſe of ill-fame in Wincheſter-ſtreet, on the preceeding Thurſday? to which ſhe anſwered, Yes—He then aſked her what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there? to which ſhe anſwered, that Mr. Chamberlain took her up into a back room, and committed adultery with her—Mr. Timmings then aſked her whether ſhe had ever been with him any where elſe? to which ſhe anſwered, Yes; and added, that ſhe went with Mr. Chamberlain to his warehouſe in White Lion-ſtreet on the Saturday following, where he again committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="unknown:033585_0174_0FF7912F052CDC10"/>The ſame witneſs, examined on interrogatories, ſaid, that ſhe did neither know or believe that Mr. Timmings committed adultery with any looſe woman, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by contract the veneral diſeaſe; but, on the contrary, had heard him declare that he had it of his wife, Mrs. Ann Timmings.</p>
               <p>Thomas Mountfort, of Moon Yard, Shoreditch, a journeyman weaver, affirmed, that being acquainted with the proceedings of Mr. Smith and Mrs. Timmings, and being in the habit of going of errands and the like for her huſband, in conſequence of ſome converſation with Thomas Gillett, his fellow-witneſs, upon the ſubject, he was ſet by him to watch them in the yard into which the kitchen window opened; this was on the evening of the 10th of January. Through a crevice in the ſame he could ſee almoſt every thing that paſſed, he then obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that on the maid's going out and leaving James Smith and Mrs. Timmings by themſelves, Smith took and kiſſed her, and put his hands up her petticoats ſeveral times; in a ſhort time after, Smith got up from his chair, and he ſaw them both move towards the window, Mrs. Timmings moving in her chair; when they came quite cloſe to the window he could not ſee particularly what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, any further than that Smith was upon her, and that both their bodies were in moiton for ſome minutes; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he ſaw Mr. Smith get up and ſit in the chair he was in before. He then left them, and informed Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lett of what had paſſed.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of January, it ſeems only two days after, about eight in the evening, Gillett came again to him and informed him that Mr. Smith was there, and further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to reſume his old ſtation—He did ſo, and through the ſame crevice obſerved that the maid-ſervant went out as before; and as Mrs. Timmings and Mr. Smith then ſat oppoſite to him, he could very well ſee what paſſed; he then very plainly obſerved Smith put his left arm round her neck, and while ſhe laid her head upon his ſhoulders, he put his right hand up her petticoats and after remaining ſo about a minute, he got up, and
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:033585_0175_0FF79130CDBA1578"/>
having unbuttoned his breeches, the witneſs plainly ſaw him pull up her petticoats ſo far, that while he placed himſelf between her thighs, he could plainly ſee them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on each ſide of him. He then again obſerved their bodies in motion.</p>
               <p>But what is the moſt remarkable, while the witneſs was in this ſituation, Mr. Timmings, who was privy to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed there, occaſionly came into the yard, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if he had ſeen any thing indecent between the parties? It was about nine o'clock when Mr. Timmings firſt came to him upon this curious enquiry. He alſo came again at the critical moment, when Smith was plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf upon his wife, which he took a view of through the crevice; and immediately after going and opening the kitchen-door, he went up to Smith, puſhed him off his wife, called him a villain, aſked him what buſineſs he had there, and afterwards turned him out of the houſe— He then called Gillett, and told him to go and fetch Mrs. Timmings, his mother—Gillett, on Smith's getting up from Mrs. Timmings, obſerved that the flap of his breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es was quite down.</p>
               <p>As a caſe in point, and ſomething relevelant to Mr. Timmings's patient waiting at the kitchen-window to ſee the completion of Mr. Smith's amour with Mrs. Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, we muſt mention a Benedict, or rather a Jerry Sneak, in the neighbourhood of Barbican, who uſed to be ſent for liquor while a viſitor of his wife's was left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with her. When he returned from theſe errands, upon being let into the apartment, he would frequently ſay, "he had been at the door a good while!" and if he was aſked by his wife and her gallant why he did not come in? his reply was, "Becauſe I thought you might be <hi>buſy!</hi>"</p>
               <p>To a further interrogation, the witneſs ſaid, that on the night of the 12th of January Mrs. Timmings ſaid to her huſband, Pray forgive me this time, and I'll do ſo no more! and that he never heard her make any other confeſſion whatever. To this he added, that no threats or promiſes were made uſe of to extort it from her at
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:033585_0176_0FF79136150EB770"/>
that time. Of her diſpoſition, he added it as his opinion, that ſhe is a woman of ſuch a ſimple and unſuſpicious turn, that any artful perſon might eaſily make her declare what had never occurred.</p>
               <p>Mary Gibbs, ſervant to Mr. Daniel Timmings, ſaid, that ſoon after ſhe came to live there ſhe uſed to obſerve a man, a ſtranger, to her, come backwards and forwards to the houſe in Union-ſtreet, whom her miſtreſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards told her was a Mr. James Barbett, a perſon who ſhe knew before ſhe was married, and had been her ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart. About three weeks after this witneſs came to live there, ſhe recollects carrying a note to him from Mrs. Timmings to where Mr. Barbett lived, in Stewart-ſtreet near Union-ſtreet. From that time till the 13th of January laſt ſhe carried ſeveral notes to the ſame perſon from her miſtreſs, in conſequence of which he came to the houſe ſeveral evenings, but always when Mr. Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings was abſent, and would ſtay with Mrs. Timmings half or three quarters of an hour at a time: at theſe times Mr. Barbett and her miſtreſs were generally alone in the parlour on the ground-floor; and ſhe frequently heard him kiſs her when he went away. Another time, as they were in the kitchen, ſhe ſaw him put his arm round her waiſt and upon her breaſt, and obſerved that her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief appeared tumbled; this was at a time when ſhe had left them together near three quarters of an hour. After Mr. Barbett was gone away, her miſtreſs told her, that if ever any thing ſhould happen, and ſhe and Mr. Timmings ſhould part, Mr. Barbett had repeatedly promiſed to take care of her. Another time, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from a walk on the Hackney road, ſhe told this witneſs that Mr. Barbett and ſhe had been and eaten cheeſe-cakes together at a houſe on the way, and that he had aſſured her he would never forſake her!—Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a witneſs!—And, as a further proof of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, according to the teſtimony of Mary Gibbs, the confidant, Mr. Barbett was once going by the door, and being called into the parlour by Mr. Timmings to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him about his connection with Mrs Timmings,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:033585_0177_0FF79137AD37FD20"/>
Barbett ſaid to her, Did I ever know you? to which ſhe immediately replied, Yes, Sir, you know you did, this very night four weeks, on this very carpet! ſtamping her foot upon the place at the ſame time. She then went into the kitchen, where Mrs. Amey Barker and the deponent then were, when addreſſing herſelf to them, ſhe ſaid, Though he denies it here, he can't deny it in a court of juſtice: ſhe then laughed, and the converſation ended for that night. The next night, it ſeems, Mrs. Barker, and Mrs. Grace Timmings being preſent, the latter ſaid to Mrs. Timmings, "How can I aſk my ſon to forgive you, when you know you have been that wicked woman before? and proceeded thus: "Nancy, who was it that gave you the bad diſtemper? was it Mr. Barbett or Mr. Carre?" to which ſhe replied, "It was Mr. Barbett:" and being further aſked what ſhe took for it? ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Bitter aloes, jalap, and brandy. And further this witneſs could not depoſe.</p>
               <p>But to another article ſhe anſwered, that Mr. J. Smith came to their houſe ſometimes twice a day, and that one night going away about 10 o'clock, he kiſſed Mrs. Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings twice; they alſo tickled one another, but on his putting his hand upon her breaſt, ſhe immediately deſired this witneſs, the maid, to put the wine upon the table, and go upon an errand, which ſhe accordingly did, and left them together till 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>From her teſtimony it alſo appeared, that on the 12th of January, when Mrs. Timmings's connection was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered with Mr. Smith, Mr. Timmings had talked of going to Greenwich, but returned home unexpectedly, after being abſent about half an hour. On the maid's opening the door to him, ſeeing him confuſed, ſhe aſked him what was the matter? in anſwer, he deſired her to go and aſk her miſtreſs; ſhe then went into the kitchen and found her miſtreſs with Mrs. Grace Timmings and her fellow-witneſs, Thomas Mount—her miſtreſs was then crying, and ſaid to her in the preſence of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, "I have committed adultery with Mr. Smith, and your maſter has turned him out of doors!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:033585_0178_0FF7913943A14E58"/>Amey Barker, wife of Edward Barker, a maſter in his Majeſty's navy, in Paradiſe Row, Rotherhithe, depoſed, that ſhe well knew James Barbett, by ſeeing him ſeveral times at Mr. Timmings's houſe in Union-ſtreet: and that one night in December 1790, in particular, ſhe ſaw a light in the window of the back parlour, on which ſhe ſuppoſed Mr. Timmings had company that might be ſtrangers to her; on this ſuppoſition ſhe went up to the window and as there was a vacancy between the ſhutters, ſhe could plainly ſee every part of the room, and, to her great ſurprize, then ſaw Ann Timmings laying upon the carpet, her petticoats were drawn quite up, and a man laying upon her; in this ſituation they continued ſome minutes during which ſhe is certain ſhe ſaw their bodies move, and was well convinced they had a mutual knowledge of each other in a carnal way. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this idea, ſhe afterwards obſerved James Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett button up his breeches, and Ann Timmings go and ſit down in a chair in a very penſive manner; but as ſhe heard ſomebody coming along the ſtreet, ſhe left the place, and returned to her ſiſter's.</p>
               <p>It was alſo her opinion, that Mr. Timmings had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the venereal diſeaſe from no other perſon but his wife, and ſhe was fully perſuaded that he had never treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with cruelty or violence.</p>
               <p>But ſtill the moſt ſurpriſing part of this evidence was, that Mrs. Amey Barker depoſed, that Mrs. Timmings was a woman of ſuch a pliable and unſuſpicious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as very eaſily to be impoſed upon; and ſeemingly as a proof of this aſſeveration, the next part of the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that followed, expreſſed that James Barbett and Ann Timmings had abſolutely committed adultery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, about the 15th of the month of December 1790, upon Mrs. Timmings's parlour-floor in Duke-ſtreet, while ſhe, Mrs. Barker, was ſitting at the window be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſeven and eight o'clock in the evening. This tranſaction, ſhe obſerved, ſhe never informed Mr. Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings of, but added, that he ſpoke of it to her about
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:033585_0179_0FF7913AF16AAA50"/>
the latter end of January laſt, which was the firſt time ſhe was appriſed of his knowing of it!</p>
               <p>Mary Gibbs alſo depoſed, that Mr. and Mrs. Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings and Mr. Smith all ſupped together one night; and that afterwards about ten o'clock Mr. Timmings went out and left Smith and his wife together a conſiderable time; during which, ſhe was witneſs to their uſual intimacies of kiſſing, and the like.</p>
               <p>But this, though the concluding part of the evidence, was not the only appearance of connivance, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Mrs. Barker's preſence during the parlour-floor ſcene. A cauſe of this kind brought on, where enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous damages were alſo obtained, would in ſome ſenſe account for the palpable ſcenes of intricate expoſure all the way through: but as this muſt have terminated, it is very evident there was in reality Much to do about No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                  <p>On Friday the 22d of March, I lived a ſervant at Mr. M'Carty's, the Beehive, in Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale-lane; I came there the Wedneſday before, and this tranſaction happened on the Friday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before this?—At Mr. Stagoths, the Nag's Head, Poſtern-row, Little Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Beehive a houſe of reputation, or is it a houſe where men and women come?—It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a houſe of good reputation, or is it a houſe of ill fame, that receives all ſorts of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?—All ſorts of men and women come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the looſe women come there?—Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who placed you as a ſervant there?—Mr. Carty's other girl came to my mother, and told her they wanted a maid. I hired myſelf there; my mother was bad in bed: my mother knew I hired myſelf there; ſhe lived about four doors off, where ſhe had lived but a fortnight, and I had been in the neighbourhood but two days. On the 20th of March, Wedneſday night when I went there the firſt night, the priſoner was drinking along with Mrs. Carty, and he laid hold of me, and ſaid I was a pretty girl; I told him to keep his hands to himſelf: I ſaw him again the next day in the ſame houſe, when he laid hold of me, and I again told him to keep his hands to himſelf; Mrs. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty laughed at it. The next day he came again, and ordered half a pint of gin to go upon Bunker's-hill; he did not live there, I did not know the houſe; my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>; I went to the door, and I ſaid Here is the gin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was a woman in the room, (I ſtaid at the door, the door was open) and the table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, and there was a tea-cup on the table; I

gave him the half-pint of gin, and the woman ſaid, Come in here, my dear, there is nobody here will hurt you. I did not go any further than the door all the time. I was waiting for the meaſure; he took the gin out of my hand at the door. Mrs. Carty told me to bring the meaſure back again, or take notice where it was going, as it was a ſtrange houſe. The woman got up and laid hold of me to pull me in, and puſhed me in, and ſaid I am going for a farthing-worth of thread, and ſhe would be in in a minute. I laid hold of her to go after her, and ſhe would not let me, ſhe puſhed me in and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the door after her, and this man came and lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door, and put the key in his pocket; and he laid hold of me, and there was a bureau bed-ſtead in the room, and he laid hold of one of my hands, and he was going to pull the bedſtead down; with that I ſcreamed out, and he took his hat off and put it on my face; there was ſomething in the hat that catched me, that ſtrangled me, that preſſed on my throat! I had a half guinea in my pocket, that my mother gave me in the morning; I told him I would give it him if he would let me go; this was juſt as he was going to put the hat on my face. No, by Chriſt! ſays he, I will have my revenge of you now: he had a great coat on, he wrapped it round me and flung me down on the floor; he put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my private parts that cut me: I was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it far in your private parts?—Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you ſay it cut you, do you mean a ſharp inſtrument; or that it tore your private parts?— It tore them.</p>
               <p>Q. And he lay his body on your's?—Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lay on you?—I cannot right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay. I fainted away in the hat; when I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, I was laying on the floor; he was on me ſtill;

he get off from me then; and when I got up, I found myſelf all blood.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part of your body?—All my ſhift and my private parts; I never had been before this out of order</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you never had thoſe diſcharges which are common to your ſex?—I never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: he then opened the door, and I was going out; when I recovered myſelf, he pulled me back again; ſays he, Where is the half guinea you was going to give a while ago? I told him, if he had let me go, I would have given it him then: he ſaid, I have had your maidenhead, and I will have that too; he then laid hold and pulled my pocket off from my ſide; from the pull he gave it, I thought my back was broke in two; he took my pocket and all there was in it, a red pocket-book; he kept all that was in the pocket: the half guinea was in the pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, in the pocket-book: there was alſo a pocket-book in it, and a pair of ſciſſars, and two-pence half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny in copper, three of them crooked, and two farthings; and when I came home to Mrs. Carty's, I could hardly walk. I went backwards and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf. I went out with a pint of beer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and I went to my mother, but ſhe was not at home. I went out about fifteen minutes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and went again ſeveral times that day, and ſhe was not at home; I ſaw her that night; ſhe was in bed, it was about ſeven o'clock ſhe looked out of the window, but ſhe could not come down; I told her I wanted to ſpeak to her very particularly. I was in the court, and I called to her; the window opens into the court: ſhe told me to come in the morning, becauſe my father was aſleep: the next day I went about eight o'clock in the morning; ſhe was in bed, I went up ſtairs to her, and I told her what had happened: ſhe aſked me if I told my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I told her I had not, becauſe of my character:
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:033585_0183_0FF7914523B897A0"/>
ſhe gave me ſome cloths; I got well about a week ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it kept ſecret between you and your mother?—About a week and a day over; the Juſtice ſent for the doctor of the London Hoſpital, and he ſaid I had the bad diſtemper.</p>

               <p>Mary Barrett ſworn. I am the mother of the laſt witneſs. I am married to my ſecond huſband.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had your daughter been at ſervice? —She never was out but a twelvemonth, and ſhe lived with Mr. Stagold, Poſtern-row, theſe twelve months; ſhe is fourteen years old laſt Chriſtmas; ſhe went to Carty's ſervice the Wedneſday night before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you know Carty before your daughter was placed in this ſervice?—I did not know them at all; I came down from living in Whitechapel into this houſe, where I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any enquiry into the character of Carty's houſe, or did you know what kind of a houſe it was?—The maid that lives at Carty's, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at my houſe for pots, and ſhe aſked me if my girl wanted a place, my being ill at the ſame time; I ſaid that I would not wiſh her to go and live in that houſe, a public-houſe, eſpecially an Iriſh houſe. The next day ſhe called again, and ſhe ſaid ſhe had ſpoke to her miſtreſs, and ſhe ſaid ſhe would be very glad if my daughter would come to live with her. Having been very ill, and having five children, the youngeſt ſix years old, and this preſent man not their father, I told the girl to go after it for a little time, till I got better, and I would get her into a private houſe; ſhe went after it and hired herſelf, and was to have four guineas a year, and that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was hired; I was going to the hoſpital, and I gave her the half guinea to pay for her ſhoes ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and heel-piecing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:033585_0184_0FF791497332D790"/>Q. What was your complaint?—It was in my head: I have had ſeveral bliſters, and I have been in the hoſpital ten months, and two of my children along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you procure this half guinea, as you was a poor woman?—I had been ſaving it to buy a gown, ſo put by half a crown a week unknown to my huſband. I ſaved it to buy the children ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where you was during the Friday?—I was down at an acquaintance of mine, being ſo very ill, and ſhe kept me to drink a diſh of tea, and I could hardly crawl home at ſix o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your acquaintance's name?—Her name is Mrs. Smith, ſhe lives in Cartwright-ſtreet in that neighbourhood; and I came home, and my huſband came directly after me, and I laid down directly, being ſo very ill, and he had a bit of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and laid down before eight o'clock; we were all in bed before eight o'clock, children and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your bedchamber window look to?—It looks into the court; there is but four houſes in the court. The girl knocked at the door ſoon after I was in bed, before eight, between ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eight; I heard her call, and I went to the window, and ſhe ſaid ſhe wanted to ſpeak to me very particularly; I told her I was very ill, and her father was aſleep, and ſhe muſt come in the morning, and I would hear what ſhe had got to ſay; ſhe called on me the next morning about eight o'clock, and ſhewed me herſelf, and told me what had happened to her the day before, and I aſked her if ſhe told her maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? ſhe ſaid no, on account of her character; I then told her not to do it; and I aſked her what ſort of a fellow it was? ſhe ſaid it was an ill looking fellow in ſailor's clothes; I ſaid, Don't ſpeak to any body about it till I get better; and I got a little better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your huſband of it?—I did not,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:033585_0185_0FF7914C30DB9180"/>
upon my word, becauſe he is the ſecond father; my huſband is a hard working man.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner does your preſent huſband behave to this child by your firſt huſband?—Very fond of her, but not altogether as if he was her own father.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell him?—I did not tell him indeed. As ſoon as I could crawl out of doors I went to Mr. Dawſon the officer, this was on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, 7, 8, or 9, days after, I told it to Mr. Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he is a peace-officer, his wife was preſent, he is here now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the day on which your daughter called on you, examine the ſtate in which ſhe was? —I did; ſhe was all over bloody, her private parts all torn, and her ſhift all over bloody.</p>

                  <p>We made the agreement to take the half pint of gin to Bunker's-hill, the girl and I; there were two men preſent; the miſtreſs ſent the other maid to go with it, and ſhe ſaid, "O, I will go with it!" ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſhe did: when we came to the houſe, the door was latched, I took and drawed the ſpring of the latch, and came in; and as ſoon as I came in, I gave the woman in the room a glaſs of gin, and told her I would pay her for the uſe of the room: ſhe went out and ſtood on the ſtairs while the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was done. I took and laid her down on the boards and pulled up her petticoats, and the tail of her ſmock was as ſtiff as parchment, ſeveral differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colours: when ſhe found I was feeling the tail of her ſmock ſhe whips her hand round, and takes it on one ſide; I had drank very hard, I could not execute my office properly, I could not get it to ſtand, ſo ſhe called me a fumbler ſeveral times; at laſt I coaxed it up, and got it to ſtand, and got in; when it was over, ſhe takes the quartern meaſure, and was going, Stop, ſays I, the gin is not all drank ſo I gave her ſome: ſhe went home, and I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and went into the tap-room. I ſat one ſide of the fire, ſhe would paſs up and down to the bar,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:033585_0187_0FF77DDAEF14C3D0"/>

               <head>The extraordinary Trial between Lady Elizabeth Weld and her huſband, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Weld, Eſq. for Impotency. In the Arches Court of Canterbury, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; 1732.</head>
               <p>THE counſel for the proſecution ſtated, that Edward Weld Eſq. married the Honourable Catharine-Elizabeth, daughter of Lord Aſton, June 22, 1727, he being aged 22, and the lady 19. That after his marriage he coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited with his wife at his ſeat at Lulworth Caſtle, in Dorſetſhire, till June, 1728, excepting one month, wherein, being indiſpoſed, ſhe came to London for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, from whence ſhe went to the ſeat of her father, at Standon, in Hertfordſhire, where her huſband followed her in the October following, and cohabited with her about a month, and then returned to Lulworth, where he continued till February 1728-9, and came back to his wife at her father's ſeat, and ſtaid with her about three

weeks; he then left her there a ſecond time, and went home to Lulworth Caſtle, and continued there till the end of May following, and then returned to her again for one week; after which they both came to London, and cohabited as man and wife about ſix weeks. During all thoſe times of cohabitation, ſhe ſaid, he never, (by reaſon of impotency) conſummated his marriage, though he acknowledged her to be able, apt, and fit for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of children: his wife, therefore, would no longer cohabit with him, though urged by him to it, by his tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her that "Many married people had lived together like brother and ſiſter:"—To which ſhe replied, "My dear, we ought not to live together after this manner!"</p>
               <p>All our fair readers will agree with Mrs. Weld, that a married ſtate ought to be quite another manner of life from that of brother and ſiſter; and the lady muſt be eſteemed blameleſs in commencing this ſuit, as ſhe was herſelf, and her huſband likewiſe, a Roman Catholic; eſpecially, as by their religion, matrimony is looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a ſacrament—And it is further underſtood by thoſe of that perſuaſion, that this ſacrament is violated by ſuch as continue in the married ſtate while they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to themſelves that they cannot anſwer the holy ends of its inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The counſel then produced Lord Aſton, who depoſed, that Mr. Weld and Mr. Colclough being at his houſe in Hertfordſhire, in May 1728; he deſired Mr. Colclough to ſpeak to Mr. Weld about his Not having conſummated the marriage with his daughter. Mr. Colclough declared he had ſpoke to him, and he confeſſed he had Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated his marriage with the ſaid Mrs. Weld, and that he had ſome outward defect that was painful to him, and hindered him from conſummating his marriage. Mr. Colclough then recommended one Mr. Williams to Mr. Weld, who had cured him of a ſimilar diſorder; and after this it ſeems, Mr. Weld told the witneſs at the lady Howard's, that Mr. Williams had cured him, though that ſome ſoreneſs remained, but he did not doubt but he ſhould be well in a little time.</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:033585_0192_0FF791568199DDC8"/>The Duke of Norfolk depoſed, that in June 1728, when he talked to Mr. Weld about the affair, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged he had not conſummated his marriage with the Honourable Miſs. Aſton, but had adviſed with phyſicians and hoped in a little time he ſhould be able to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate it.</p>

               <p>After this ſentence, there was an appeal to the King in his Court of Delegates. The cauſe was re-heard at Serjeant's Inn, and the foregoing ſentence was confirmed!</p>
