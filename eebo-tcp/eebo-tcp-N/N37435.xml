            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE main ≈øubject of the doctrinal part of this epi≈øtle, is the free grace of God in the ≈øalvation of men by Je≈øus Chri≈øt; e≈øpecially as it appears in the doctrine of ju≈øtification by faith alone. And the more clearly to evince this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and ≈øhew the rea≈øon of it, the apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in the fir≈øt place, e≈øtabli≈øhes that point, that no fle≈øh living can be ju≈øtified by the deeds of the law. And to prove it, he is very large and particular in ≈øhewing, that all mankind, not only Gentiles but Jews, are under ≈øin, and ≈øo under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law; which is what he in≈øi≈øts upon from the beginning of the epi≈øtle to this place. He fir≈øt begins with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and in the fir≈øt chapter ≈øhews that they are under ≈øin, by ≈øetting forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding corruptions and horrid wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs that over≈øpread the Gentile world: And then through the ≈øecond chapter, and the former part of this third chapter, to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:049067_0003_10264EBA17A204B0"/>
the text and following ver≈øe, he ≈øhews the ≈øame of the Jews, that they al≈øo are in the ≈øame circum≈øtances with the Gentiles in this regard. They had an high thought of them≈øelves, becau≈øe they were God's cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant people, and circumci≈øed, and the children of Abraham. They de≈øpi≈øed the Gentiles as polluted, condemned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur≈øed; but looked on them≈øelves, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their external privileges, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emonial and moral righteou≈øne≈øs, as a pure and holy people, and the children of God; as the apo≈øtle ob≈øerves in the ≈øecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It was therefore ≈øtrange doctrine to them, that they al≈øo were unclean and guilty in God's ≈øight, and under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and cur≈øe of the law. The apo≈øtle does therefore, on account of their ≈øtrong prejudices again≈øt ≈øuch doctrine, the more particularly in≈øi≈øt upon it, and ≈øhews that they are no better than the Gentiles; as in the 9th ver≈øe of this chapter, "What then? are we better than they? "No, in no wi≈øe? for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ≈øin." And, to convince them of it, he then produces certain pa≈ø≈øages out of their own law, or the Old Te≈øtament, (who≈øe authority they pretended a great regard to) from the 9th ver≈øe to the ver≈øe wherein is our text. And it may be ob≈øerved, that the apo≈øtle, <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> cites certain pa≈ø≈øages to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:049067_0004_10264EBFD4F9E368"/>
prove that mankind are all corrupt, in the 10th, 11th, and 12th, ver≈øes; "As it is written. There is none righteous, no not one: There is none that under≈øtandeth, there is none that ≈øeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one." <hi>Secondly,</hi> The pa≈ø≈øages he cites next, are to prove, that not only all are corrupt, but each one wholly corrupt, as it were all over unclean, from the crown of his head to the ≈øoles of his feet; and therefore ≈øeveral particular parts of the body are mentioned, as the throat, the tongue, the lips, the mouth, the feet, ver≈øes, 13.14.15.: "Their throat is an open ≈øepulchre: with their tongues they have u≈øed deceit; the poi≈øon of a≈øps is under their lips; who≈øe mouth is full of cur≈øing and bitterne≈øs: Their feet are ≈øwift to ≈øhed blood." And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He quotes other pa≈ø≈øages to ≈øhew, that each one is not only all over corrupt, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt to a de≈øperate degree, in the 16th, 17th, and 18th ver≈øes; in which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding degree of their corruption is ≈øhewn, Both by affirming and denying: By affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively expre≈ø≈øing the mo≈øt pernicious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency of their wickedne≈øs, in the 16th ver≈øe: "De≈øtruction and mi≈øery are in their ways." And ther by denying all good or godline≈øs of them, in the 17th
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:049067_0005_10264EC15D048B08"/>
and 18th ver≈øes, "And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes." And then, le≈øt the Jews ≈øhould think the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages of their law do not concern them, and that only the Gentiles are intended in them, the apo≈øtle ≈øhews in the ver≈øe of the text, not only that they are not exempt, but that they e≈øpecially mu≈øt be under≈øtood: "Now we know that what≈øoever things the law ≈øaith, it ≈øaith to them who are under the law." By tho≈øe that are under the law is meant the Jews; and the Gentiles by tho≈øe that are without law; as appears by the 18th ver≈øe of the preceding chapter. There is ≈øpecial rea≈øon to under≈øtand the law, as ≈øpeaking to and of them, to whom it was immediately given. And therefore the Jews would be unrea≈øonable in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting them≈øelves. And if we examine the places of the Old Te≈øtament whence the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages are taken, we ≈øhall ≈øee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ≈øpecial re≈øpect is had to the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the people of that nation, in every one of them. So that the law ≈øhuts all up in univer≈øal and de≈øperate wickedne≈øs, <hi>that every mouth may be ≈øtopp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>d;</hi> the mouths of the Jews, as well as of the Gentiles, notwith≈øtanding all tho≈øe privileges by which they were di≈øtingui≈øhed from the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:049067_0006_10264EC32658A680"/>The things that the law ≈øays, are ≈øufficient to ≈øtop the mouths of all mankind, in two re≈øpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ≈øtop them from boa≈øting of their righteou≈øne≈øs, as the Jews were wont to do; as the apo≈øtle ob≈øerves in the 23d ver≈øe of the preceding chapter.‚ÄîThat the apo≈øtle has re≈øpect to ≈øtopping their mouths in this re≈øpect, appears by the 27th ver≈øe of the context, "Where is boa≈øting then? It is excluded." The law ≈øtops our mouths from making of any plea for life, or the favour of God, or any po≈øitive good, from our own righteou≈øne≈øs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ≈øtop them from making any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe for our≈øelves or objection again≈øt the execution of the ≈øentence of the law, or the infliction of the puni≈øhment that it threatens. That this is intended, appears by the words immediately following, "That all the world may become guilty before God." That is, that they may appear to be guilty, and ≈øtand convicted before God, and ju≈øtly liable to the condemnation of his law, as guilty of death, according to the Jewi≈øh way of ≈øpeaking.</p>
            <p>And thus the apo≈øtle proves, that no fle≈øh can be ju≈øtified in God's ≈øight by the deeds of the law; as he draws the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in the following ver≈øe; and ≈øo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the way for the e≈øtabli≈øhing of the great doctrine of ju≈øtification by faith alone,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:049067_0007_10264EC716AC4A70"/>
which he proceeds to do in the next ver≈øe to that, and in the following part of the chapter, and of the epi≈øtle.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>"It is ju≈øt with God eternally to ca≈øt off and de≈øtroy ≈øinners."</p>
               <p>‚ÄîFor this is the puni≈øhment which the law condemns to; which the things that the law ≈øays, may well ≈øtop every mouth from all manner of objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt.</p>
               <p>The truth of this doctrine may appear by the joint con≈øideration of two things, viz. Man's ≈øinfulne≈øs, and God's ≈øovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It appears from the con≈øideration of man's ≈øinfulne≈øs. And that whether we con≈øider the infinitely evil nature of all ≈øin, or how much ≈øin men are guilty of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we con≈øider the infinite evil and heinou≈øne≈øs of ≈øin in general, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt in God to inflict what puni≈øhment is de≈øerved; becau≈øe the very notion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving any puni≈øhment is, that it may be ju≈øtly inflicted: A de≈øerved puni≈øhment and a ju≈øt puni≈øhment are the ≈øame thing. To ≈øay that one de≈øerves ≈øuch a puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet to ≈øay that he does not ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øerve it, is a contradiction; and if he ju≈øtly de≈øerves it; then it may be ju≈øtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:049067_0008_10264EC9F8D06348"/>Every crime or fault de≈øerves a greater or le≈ø≈øer puni≈øhment, in proportion as the crime it≈øelf is greater or le≈øs. If any fault de≈øerves puni≈øhment, then ≈øo much the greater the fault, ≈øo much the greater is the puni≈øhment de≈øerved. The faulty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any thing is the formal ground and rea≈øon of its de≈øert of puni≈øhment; and therefore the more any thing hath of this nature, the more puni≈øhment it de≈øerves. And therefore the terriblene≈øs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puni≈øhment, let it be never ≈øo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, is no argument again≈øt the ju≈øtice of it, if the proportion does but hold between the heinou≈øne≈øs of the crime and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs of the puni≈øhment; ≈øo that if there be any ≈øuch thing as a fault infinitely heinous, it will follow that it is ju≈øt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a puni≈øhment for it that is infinitely dreadful.</p>
               <p>A crime is more or le≈øs heinous, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we are under greater or le≈ø≈øer obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the contrary. This is ≈øelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; becau≈øe it is herein that the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalne≈øs or faultine≈øs of any thing con≈øi≈øts, that it is contrary to what we are obliged or bound to, or what ought to be in us. So the faultine≈øs of one being's hating another, is in proportion to his obligation to love him. The crime of one being's de≈øpi≈øing and ca≈øting contempt on another, is proportionably more or le≈øs heinous, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:049067_0009_10264ECB83E8D6D8"/>
he was under greater or le≈ø≈øer obligations to honour him. The fault of di≈øobeying another, is greater or le≈øs, as any one is under greater or le≈ø≈øer obligations to obey him. And therefore if there be any being that we are under infinite obligations to love, and honour, and obey, the contrary towards him mu≈øt be infinitely faulty.</p>
               <p>Our obligation to love, honour, and obey any being, is in proportion to his loveline≈øs, honourablene≈øs, and authority; for that is the very meaning of the words. When we ≈øay any one is very lovely, it is the ≈øame as to ≈øay, that he is one very much to be loved: Or if we ≈øay, ≈øuch a one is more honourable than another, the meaning of the words is, that he is one that we are more obliged to honour. If we ≈øay any one has great authority over us, it is the ≈øame as to ≈øay<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that he has great right to our ≈øubjection and obedience.</p>
               <p>But God is a being infinitely lovely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he hath infinite excellency and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To have infinite excellency and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the ≈øame thing as to have infinite loveline≈øs. He is a Being of infinite great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, maje≈øty and glory; and therefore is infinitely honourable. He is infinitely exalted above the greate≈øt potentates of the earth, and highe≈øt angels in heaven; and therefore is infinitely more honourable than they. His authority over us is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:049067_0010_10264ECE0A395710"/>
and the ground of his right to our obedience is infinitely ≈øtrong; for he is infinitely worthy to be obeyed in him≈øelf, and we have an ab≈øolute, univer≈øal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dependence upon him.</p>
               <p>So that ≈øin again≈øt God, being a violation of infinite obligations, mu≈øt be a crime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely heinous, and ≈øo de≈øerving of infinite puni≈øhment.‚ÄîNothing is more agreeable to the common ≈øen≈øe of mankind, than that ≈øins committed again≈øt any one, mu≈øt be proportionably heinous to the dignity of the being offended and abu≈øed; as it is al≈øo agreeable to the word of God, 1 Sam. ii.25. "If one man ≈øin again≈øt another, the judge ≈øhall judge him;" (i. e. ≈øhall judge him, and inflict a finite puni≈øhment, ≈øuch as finite judges can inflict;) "but if a man ≈øin again≈øt the Lord, who ≈øhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him?" This was the aggravation of ≈øin that made Jo≈øeph afraid of it, Gen. xxxix.9. "How ≈øhall I commit this great wickedne≈øs, and ≈øin again≈øt God?" This was the aggravation of David's ≈øin, in compari≈øon of which he e≈øteemed all others as nothing, becau≈øe they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely exceeded by it. P≈øalm li.4. "Again≈øt thee, thee only, have I ≈øinned." ‚ÄîThe eternity of the puni≈øhment of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men renders it infinite; and it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it no more than infinite; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore renders no more than proportionable

to the heinou≈øne≈øs of what they are guilty of.</p>
               <p>If there be any evil or faultine≈øs in ≈øin again≈øt God, there is certainly infinite evil: For if it be any fault at all, it has an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite aggravation, viz. that it is again≈øt an infinite object. If it be ever ≈øo ≈ømall upon other accounts, yet if it be any thing, it has one infinite dimen≈øion; and ≈øo is an infinite evil. Which may be illu≈øtrated by this: If we ≈øuppo≈øe a thing to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite length, but no breadth and thickne≈øs, but to be only a mere mathematical line, it is nothing: But if it have any breadth and thickne≈øs at all, though never ≈øo ≈ømall, yet if it have but one infinite dimen≈øion, viz. that of length, the quantity of it is infinite; it exceeds the quantity of any thing, however broad, thick and long, wherein the≈øe dimen≈øions are all finite.</p>
               <p>So that the objections that are made again≈øt the infinite puni≈øhment of ≈øin, from the nece≈ø≈øity, or rather previous cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the futurition of ≈øin, ari≈øing from the decree of God, or unavoidable origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al corruption of nature, if they argue any thing, do not argue again≈øt the infinitene≈øs of the degree of the faultine≈øs of ≈øin direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and no otherwi≈øe than they argue again≈øt any faultine≈øs at all: For if this nece≈ø≈øity or certainty leaves any evil at all in ≈øin, that fault mu≈øt be infinite by rea≈øon of the infinite object.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:049067_0012_10264ED51C889C78"/>But every ≈øuch objector as would argue from hence, that there is no fault at all in ≈øin, confutes him≈øelf, and ≈øhews his own in≈øincerity in his objection. For at the ≈øame time that he objects, that men's acts are nece≈ø≈øary, from God's decrees, and original ≈øin, and that this kind of nece≈ø≈øity is incon≈øi≈øtent with faultine≈øs in the act, his own practice ≈øhews that he does not believe what he objects to be true: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe why does he at all blame men? Or why are ≈øuch per≈øons at all di≈øplea≈øed with men, for abu≈øive, injurious and ungrateful acts towards them? Whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, by this they ≈øhew that indeed they do believe that there is no nece≈ø≈øity in men's acts, from divine decrees, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, that is incon≈øi≈øtent with blame. And if their objection be this, That this previous certainty is by God's own ordering, and that where God orders an antecedent certainty of acts, he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all the fault from the actor on him≈øelf; their practice ≈øhews, that at the ≈øame time they do not believe this, but fully believe the contrary: For when they are abu≈øed by men, they are di≈øplea≈øed with men, and not with God only.</p>
               <p>The light of nature teaches all mankind, that when an injury is voluntary, it is faulty, without any manner of con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what there might be previou≈øly to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:049067_0013_10264ED79FA07750"/>
determine the futurition of that evil act of the will. And it really teaches this as much to tho≈øe that object and cavil mo≈øt as to others; as their univer≈øal practice ≈øhews. By which it appears, that ≈øuch objections are in≈øincere and perver≈øe. Men will mention others corrupt nature in their own ca≈øe, or when they are injured, as a thing that aggravates their crime, and that wherein their faultine≈øs partly con≈øi≈øts. How common is it for per≈øons, when they look on them≈øelves greatly injured by another, to inveigh again≈øt him, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his ba≈øene≈øs, by ≈øaying, "He is a man of a mo≈øt perver≈øe ≈øpirit: He is nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally of a ≈øelfi≈øh, niggardly or proud and haughty temper: He is one of a ba≈øe and vile di≈øpo≈øition." And yet men's natural corrupt di≈øpo≈øitions are mentioned as an excu≈øe for them, with re≈øpect to their ≈øins again≈øt God, and as if they rendered them blamele≈øs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is ju≈øt with God eternally to ca≈øt off wicked men, may more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, if we con≈øider how much ≈øin they are guilty of.

That ≈øuch is God's ≈øovereign power and right, that he is originally under no obligation to keep men from ≈øinning; but may in his providence permit and leave them to ≈øin. He was not obliged to keep either angels or men from falling. It is unrea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe, that God ≈øhould be obliged, if he makes a rea≈øonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of knowing his will, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a law from him, and being ≈øubject to his moral government, at the ≈øame time to make it impo≈ø≈øible for him to ≈øin, or break his law.

For to what purpo≈øe would it be, for God to give ≈øuch and ≈øuch laws, and declare his holy will to a creature, and annex promi≈øes and threatenings to move him to his duty, and make him careful to perform it, if the creature at the ≈øame time has this to think of, that God is obliged to make it impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to break his laws?

Or, to what purpo≈øe is it for God to give a law at all? For according to this ≈øuppo≈øition, it is God, and not the creature, that is under

law. It is the lawgivers care, and not the ≈øubjects, to ≈øee that his law is obeyed; and this care is what the lawgiver is ab≈øolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to. If God be obliged never to permit a creature to fall, there is an end of all divine laws, or government, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God over the creature; there can be no manner of u≈øe of the≈øe things.</p>
               <p>God may permit ≈øin, though the being of ≈øin will certainly en≈øue on that permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion: And ≈øo, by permi≈ø≈øion, he may di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe and order the event. If there were any ≈øuch thing as chance, or mere contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the very notion of it did not carry a gro≈øs ab≈øurdity, (as might ea≈øily be ≈øhown that it does), it would have been very unfit, that God ≈øhould have left it to mere chance, whether man ≈øhould fall or no. For chance, if there ≈øhould be any ≈øuch thing, is unde≈øigning and blind. And certainly it is more fit that an event of ≈øo great importance, and that is attended with ≈øuch an infinite train of great con≈øequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ≈øhould be di≈øpo≈øed and ordered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wi≈ødom, than that it ≈øhould be left to blind chance.</p>
               <p>If it be ≈øaid, that God need not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øed to render it impo≈ø≈øible for man to ≈øin, and yet not leave it to mere contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or blind chance neither; but might have left it with man's free will, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether to ≈øin or no: I an≈øwer, if

≈øhould eternally reject and de≈øtroy you, what an agreeablene≈øs and exact mutual an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerablene≈øs there would be between God's ≈øo dealing with you, and your ≈øpirit and behaviour. There would not only be an equality, but a ≈øimilitude. God declares, that his dealings with men ≈øhall be ≈øuitable to their di≈øpo≈øition and practice. P≈øalm xviii.25.26. "With the merciful man, thou wilt ≈øhew thy≈øelf mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; With an upright man, thou wilt ≈øhew thy≈øelf upright: With the pure, thou wilt ≈øhew thy≈øelf pure; and with the froward, thou wilt ≈øhew thy≈øelf froward." How much ≈øoever you dread damnation, and are affrighted and concerned at the thoughts of it; yet if God ≈øhould indeed eternally damn you, you would but be met with in your own way; you would be dealt with exactly according to your own dealing; God would but mea≈øure to you in the ≈øame mea≈øure in which you mete. Surely it is but fair that you ≈øhould be made to buy in the ≈øame mea≈øure in which you ≈øell.</p>
               <p>Here I would particularly ≈øhew, 1. That if God ≈øhould eternally de≈øtroy you, it would be agreeable to your treatment of God. 2.

               <p n="1">1. You never have exerci≈øed the lea≈øt degree of love to God; and therefore it would be agreeable to your treatment of him if he ≈øhould never expre≈øs any love to you. When God converts and ≈øaves a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is a wonderful and un≈øpeakable manife≈øtation of divine love. When a poor lo≈øt ≈øoul is brought home to Chri≈øt, and has all his ≈øins forgiven him, and is made a child of God, it will take up a whole eternity to expre≈øs and declare the greatne≈øs of that love. And why ≈øhould God be obliged to expre≈øs ≈øuch wonderful love to you, who never exerci≈øed the lea≈øt degree of love to him in all your life? You never have loved God, who is infinitely glorious and lovely; and why then is God under obligation to love you, who are all over deformed and loath≈øome as a filthy worm, or rather a hateful viper? You have no benevolence in your heart towards God; you never rejoiced in God's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; if he had been mi≈øerable, and that had been po≈ø≈øible, you would have liked it as well as if he were happy; you would not have cared how mi≈øerable he was, nor

mourned for it, any more than you now do for the devil's being mi≈øerable: And why then ≈øhould God be looked upon as obliged to take ≈øo much care for your happine≈øs, as to do ≈øuch great things for it, as he doth for tho≈øe that are ≈øaved? Or why ≈øhould God be called hard, in ca≈øe he ≈øhould not be careful to ≈øave you from mi≈øery?

Has it not been ≈øo, that if you could but promote your private intere≈øt, and gratify your own lu≈øts, you cared not how much the glory of God ≈øuffered? And why may not God advance his own glory in the ruin of your welfare, not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much your intere≈øt ≈øuffers by it? You never ≈øo much as ≈øtirred one ≈øtep, ≈øincerely making the glory of God your end, or acting from real re≈øpect to him: And why then is it hard if God do nor do ≈øuch great things for you, as the changing your nature<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> rai≈øing you from ≈øpiritual death to life, conquering the powers of darkne≈øs for you, tran≈ølating you out of the kingdom of darkne≈øs into the kingdom of his dear ≈øon, delivering you from eternal mi≈øery, and be≈øtowing eternal glory upon you? You do not u≈øe to be willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your≈øelf for God; you never cared to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:049067_0033_10264F0945443888"/>
put your≈øelf out of your way for Chri≈øt: Whenever any thing cro≈øs or difficult came in your way, that the glory of God was concerned in, it has been your manner to ≈øhun it, and excu≈øe your≈øelf from it: You did not care to hurt your≈øelf for Chri≈øt, that you did not ≈øee worthy of it: And why then mu≈øt it be looked upon as ≈øuch a hard and cruel thing, if Chri≈øt had not been plea≈øed to ≈øpill his blood and be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to death for ≈øuch a ≈øinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have ≈ølighted and made light of God; and why then may not God ju≈øtly ≈ølight you? When ≈øinners are ≈øen≈øible in ≈øome mea≈øure of their mi≈øery, they are ready to think it hard that God will take no more notice of them; that he will ≈øee them in ≈øuch a lamentable, di≈øtre≈ø≈øed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, beholding their burthens and tears, and ≈øeem to ≈ølight it, and manife≈øt no pity to them.

They do not ≈øee through it, that God ≈øhould make ≈øo light of their ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But then, ought they not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider, that as their ≈øouls are precious, ≈øo is God's honour precious? The honour of the infinite God, the great King of heaven and earth, is a thing of as great importance, (and ≈øurely may ju≈øtly be ≈øo e≈øteemed by God) as the happine≈øs of you, a poor little

worm. But yet you have ≈ølighted that honour of God, and valued it no more than the dirt under your feet. You have been told that ≈øuch and ≈øuch things were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the will of an holy God, and again≈øt his honour; but you cared not for that. God called upon you, and exhorted you to be more tender of his honour; but you went on without regarding him. Thus have you ≈ølighted God! And yet, is it hard that God ≈øhould ≈ølight you? Are you more honourable than God, that he mu≈øt be obliged to make much of you, how light ≈øoever you make of him and his glory?</p>
               <p>And you have not only ≈ølighted God in time pa≈øt, but you ≈ølight him ≈øtill. You indeed now make a pretence and ≈øhew of honouring him in your prayers, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on other external duties, and by a ≈øober countenance, and ≈øeeming devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in your words and behaviour; but it is all mere di≈ø≈øembling. That downca≈øt look and ≈øeeming reverence, is not from any honour you have to God in your heart, though you would have it go ≈øo, and would have God take it ≈øo. You that have not believed in Chri≈øt, have not the lea≈øt jot of honour to God; that ≈øhew of it is merely forced, and what you are driven to by fear, like tho≈øe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in P≈øalm lxvi.3. "Through the greatne≈øs of thy power ≈øhall thine enemies ≈øubmit them≈øelves to thee." In the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

it is, "≈øhall lie unto thee;" that is, yield feigned ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and di≈ø≈øemble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect and honour to thee. There is a rod held over you that makes you ≈øeem to pay ≈øuch re≈øpect to God. This religion and devotion, even the very appearance of it, would ≈øoon be gone, and all vani≈øh away, if that were removed. Sometimes it may be you weep in your prayers, and in your hearing ≈øermons, and hope God will take notice of it, and take it for ≈øome honour; but he ≈øees it to be all hypocri≈øy. You weep for your≈øelf; you are afraid of hell; and do you think that that is worthy that God ≈øhould take much notice of you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe you can cry when you are in danger of being damned: when at the ≈øame time you indeed care nothing for God's hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>Seeing you thus di≈øregard ≈øo great a God, is it a heinous thing for God to flight you, a little, wretched, de≈øpicable creature; a worm, a mere nothing, and le≈øs than noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a vile in≈øect, that has ri≈øen up in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt again≈øt the Maje≈øty of heaven and earth?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why ≈øhould God be looked upon as obliged to be≈øtow ≈øalvation upon you, when you have been ≈øo ungrateful for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he has be≈øtowed upon you already? God has tried you with a great deal of kindne≈øs, and he never has ≈øincerely been

               <p>When a ≈øinner takes encouragement to neglect that ≈øecret prayer that God has commanded, and to gratify his lu≈øts, and to live a carnal, vain life, and thwart God, and run upon him, and contemn him to his face, thinking with him≈øelf, "If I do ≈øo, God would not damn me; he is a merciful God, and therefore when I ≈øeek his mercy he will be≈øtow it upon me;" mu≈øt God be accounted hard becau≈øe he will not do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ≈øuch a ≈øinner's pre≈øumption?

               <p>There is ≈øomething peculiarly heinous in ≈øinning again≈øt the mercy of God more than other attributes.

               <p>The greater the mercy of God is, the more ≈øhould you be engaged to love him, and live to his glory.

your≈øelf in ≈øin.

Though it was very offen≈øive to God, though you heard that God infinitely hated ≈øin, and that ≈øuch practices as you went on in were exceeding contrary to his nature, will, and glory, yet that did not make you unea≈øy; you heard that he was a very merciful God, and had grace enough to pardon you, and ≈øo cared not how offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive your ≈øins were to him. How long have ≈øome of you gone on in ≈øin, and what great ≈øins have ≈øome of you been guilty of, on that pre≈øumption! Your own con≈øcience can give te≈øtimony to it, that this has made you refu≈øe God's calls, and has made you regardle≈øs of his repeated commands. Now how righteous would it be if God ≈øhould ≈øwear in his wrath, that you ≈øhould never be the better for his being infinitely merciful!</p>
               <p>Your ingratitude has been the greater, that you have not only abu≈øed the attribute of God's mercy, taking encouragement from it to continue in ≈øin, but you have thus abu≈øed this mercy, under that very notion of its being exerci≈øed towards you, in a ≈øuppo≈øition that God would exerci≈øe infinite mercy to you in particular; which con≈øideration ≈øhould have e≈øpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared God to you.

to ≈øin the more, from that con≈øideration, that Chri≈øt came into the world and died to ≈øave ≈øinners; that thanks has Chri≈øt had from you, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ≈øuch a tormenting death for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies! Now, how ju≈øtly might it be ≈øo, that God ≈øhould refu≈øe that you ≈øhould ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be the better for his Son's laying down his life! It was becau≈øe of the≈øe things that you put off ≈øeeking ≈øalvation: You would take the plea≈øures of ≈øin ≈øtill longer, hardening your≈øelf with that, that mercy was infinite, and it would not be too late, if you ≈øought it afterwards; now, how ju≈øtly may God di≈øappoint you in this, and order it ≈øo that it ≈øhall be too late!</p>

one and another would ≈øay, "I cannot ≈øee how this can be, that I be not willing that Chri≈øt ≈øhould be my Saviour, when I would give all the world that he was my Saviour: How is it po≈ø≈øible that I ≈øhould not be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have Chri≈øt for my Saviour, when this is what I am ≈øeeking after, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and ≈øtriving for, as for my life?"</p>
               <p>Here therefore I would endeavour to convince you, that you are under a gro≈øs mi≈øtake in this matter.

               <p n="1">1. That you may ≈øee the weakne≈øs of the grounds of your mi≈øtake, con≈øider,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>≈øt,</hi> There is a great deal of difference between a willingne≈øs not to be damned, and a being willing to receive Chri≈øt for your Saviour.

The inclination of your will goes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ≈øelf, it never reaches Chri≈øt. You are willing not to be mi≈øerable; that is, you love your≈øelf, and there your will and choice terminate. And it is but a vain pretence and delu≈øion to ≈øay or think, that you are willing to accept of Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d,</hi> There is certainly a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a forced compliance and a free willingne≈øs.

Your heart does not go out after Chri≈øt of it≈øelf, but you are forced and driven to ≈øeek an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt in him. Chri≈øt has no ≈øhare at all in your heart; there is no manner of clo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart with him.

He ≈øeeks not that you ≈øhould receive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt your will, but with a free will. He ≈øeeks entertainment in your heart and choice.‚ÄîAnd,</p>
               <p>If you refu≈øe thus to receive Chri≈øt, how ju≈øt is it that Chri≈øt ≈øhould refu≈øe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you? How rea≈øonable are Chri≈øt's

Who can ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expect that Chri≈øt ≈øhould force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf upon any man to be his Saviour? Or what can be looked for more rea≈øonable, than that all that would be ≈øaved by Chri≈øt, ≈øhould heartily and freely entertain him? And ≈øurely it would be very di≈øhonourable for Chri≈øt to offer him≈øelf upon lower terms.</p>

If you are truly willing to accept of Chri≈øt as a Saviour, it mu≈øt be as a ≈øacrifice to make atonement for your guilt: Chri≈øt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world on this errand, to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf as an atonement, to an≈øwer for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert of puni≈øhment. But how is it po≈ø≈øible that you ≈øhould be willing to accept of Chri≈øt as an atonement for that guilt that you be not ≈øen≈øible that you have? How can you be willing to have Chri≈øt for a Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour from a de≈øert of hell? If you have not really de≈øerved everla≈øting burnings in hell, then the very offer of an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ≈øuch a de≈øert is an impo≈øition up-you on. If you have no ≈øuch guilt upon
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:049067_0051_10264F37DBC35878"/>
you, then the very offer of a ≈øatisfaction for that guilt is an injury, becau≈øe it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in it a charge of guilt that you are free from. Now therefore it is impo≈ø≈øible that a man that is not convinced of his guilt can be willing to accept of an offer; becau≈øe he cannot be willing to accept the charge that the offer implies: That he looks upon as injurious. A man that is not convinced that he has de≈øerved ≈øo dreadful a puni≈øhment, cannot willingly ≈øubmit to be charged with it: If he thinks he is willing, it is but a mere forced, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bu≈øine≈øs; becau≈øe in his heart he looks upon him≈øelf greatly injured; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot freely accept of Chri≈øt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion of a Saviour from that guilt, and from the de≈øert of ≈øuch a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhment; for ≈øuch an acceptance is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit owning that he does de≈øerve ≈øuch a puni≈øhment.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:049067_0052_10264F3A5C98DCA0"/>
from hell is a debt; and therefore cannot willingly and heartily receive it as a free gift.‚ÄîIf a king ≈øhould condemn a man to ≈øome exceeding tormenting death, which the condemned per≈øon thought him≈øelf not de≈øerving of, but looked upon the ≈øentence unju≈øt and cruel, and the king, when the time of execution drew nigh, ≈øhould offer him his pardon, under the notion of a very great act of grace and clemency, the condemned per≈øon never could willingly and heartily allow it under that notion, becau≈øe he judged him≈øelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtly condemned.</p>
               <p>Now by this it is evident that you are not willing to accept of Chri≈øt as your Saviour; becau≈øe you never yet had ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe of your own ≈øinfulne≈øs, and ≈øuch a conviction of your great guilt in God's ≈øight, as to be indeed convinced that you lay ju≈øtly condemned to the puni≈øhment of hell.

               <p>And that ≈øinners be not convinced that Chri≈øt is ≈øufficient for the work he has undertaken, appears mo≈øt manife≈øtly when they are under great convictions of their ≈øin, and danger of God's wrath.

To tell them of the blood of Chri≈øt ≈øignifies nothing, it does not relieve their ≈øinking, de≈øpairing hearts. This makes it mo≈øt evident that they are not convinced that Chri≈øt is ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be their Mediator.</p>
               <p>And as long as they are unconvinced of this, it is impo≈ø≈øible they ≈øhould be willing to accept of him as their Mediator and Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour. A man in di≈øtre≈ø≈øing fear will not willingly betake him≈øelf to a fort that he judges not ≈øufficient to defend him from the enemy. A man will not willingly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out into the ocean in a ≈øhip that he ≈øu≈øpects is leaky, and will ≈øink before he gets through his voyage.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>d,</hi> It is evident that you are not willing to have Chri≈øt for your Saviour, becau≈øe you have ≈øo mean an opinion of him, that you dur≈øt not tru≈øt his faithfulne≈øs. One that undertakes to be the Saviour of ≈øouls had need be faithful; for if he fails in ≈øuch a tru≈øt, how great is the lo≈øs! But you are not convinced of Chri≈øt's faithfulne≈øs;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:049067_0055_10264F421425FD50"/>
as is evident, becau≈øe at ≈øuch times as when you are in a con≈øiderable mea≈øure ≈øen≈øible of your guilt and God's anger, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he convinced that Chri≈øt is willing to accept of you, or that he ≈øtands ready to receive you<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> if you ≈øhould come to him, though Chri≈øt ≈øo much invites you to come to him<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and has ≈øo fully declared that he will not reject you, if you do come; as particularly, John, vi.37.: "Him that cometh to me, I will in no wi≈øe ca≈øt out." Now, there is no man can be heartily will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tru≈øt his eternal welfare in the hands of an unfaithful per≈øon, or one who≈øe faithfulne≈øs he ≈øu≈øpects.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>th,</hi> You are not willing to be ≈øaved in that way by Chri≈øt, as is evident, becau≈øe you are not willing that your own goodne≈øs ≈øhould be ≈øet at nought. In the way of ≈øalvation by Chri≈øt, men's own goodne≈øs is wholly ≈øet at nought; there is no account at all made of it. Now you cannot be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ≈øaved in a way, wherein your own goodne≈øs is ≈øet at nought, as is evident by that, that you make much of it your≈øelf. You make much of your prayers and pains in religion, and are often thinking of them; how con≈øiderable do they appear to you, when you look back upon them! And how much are ≈øome of you in thinking how much more you have done than ≈øome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and in expecting ≈øome re≈øpect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that God ≈øhould manife≈øt to what you
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:049067_0056_10264F44A147C680"/>
do: Now, if you make ≈øo much of what you do your≈øelf, it is impo≈ø≈øible that you ≈øhould be freely willing that God ≈øhould make nothing of it. As we may ≈øee in oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things; if a man is proud of a great e≈øtate, or if he values him≈øelf much upon his honourable office, or his great abilities, it is impo≈ø≈øible that he ≈øhould like it, and heartily approve of it, that others ≈øhould make light of the≈øe things and de≈øpi≈øe them.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that it is ≈øo evident that you refu≈øe to accept of Chri≈øt as your Saviour, why is Chri≈øt to be blamed that he does not ≈øave you? Chri≈øt has offered him≈øelf to you to be your Saviour in time pa≈øt, and he continues offering him≈øelf ≈øtill, and you continue to reject him, and yet complain that he does not ≈øave you.‚ÄîSo ≈øtrangely unrea≈øonable, and incon≈øi≈øtent with them≈øelves, are go≈øpel ≈øinners!</p>
               <p>But I expect that there are many of you that in your hearts ≈øtill object; Your mouths be not ≈øtopped.‚ÄîSuch an objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, is probably now in the hearts of many here pre≈øent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ≈øo, that I am not willing to have Chri≈øt for my Saviour, yet I cannot make my≈øelf willing.</p>
               <p>But I would give an an≈øwer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by laying down two things, that mu≈øt be acknowledged to be exceeding ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:049067_0057_10264F4627AD2E48"/>1. It is no excu≈øe, that you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chri≈øt of your≈øelf, unle≈øs you would if you could. This is ≈øo evident of it≈øelf, that it ≈øcarce needs any proof. Certainly, if per≈øons would not if they could, it is ju≈øt the ≈øame thing as to the blame that lies upon them, whether they can or cannot. If you were willing, and then found that you could not, your being unable would alter the ca≈øe, and might be ≈øome excu≈øe; becau≈øe then the defect would not be in your will, but only in your ability: But as long as you will not, it is no matter what the ability is, whether you have ability or no ability.</p>
               <p>If you be not willing to accept of Chri≈øt, it will follow that you have no ≈øincere willingne≈øs to be willing; becau≈øe the will always nece≈ø≈øarily approves of, and re≈øts in its own acts. To ≈øuppo≈øe the contrary would be to ≈øuppo≈øe a contradiction; it would be to ≈øuppo≈øe that a man's will is contrary to it≈øelf, or that he wills contrary to what he him≈øelf wills. So that as you are not willing to come to Chri≈øt, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make your≈øelf willing, ≈øo you have no ≈øincere de≈øire to be willing; and therefore may mo≈øt ju≈øtly peri≈øh without a Saviour. There is no excu≈øe at all for you; for ≈øay what you will about your inability, the ≈øeat of your blame lies in your perver≈øe will, that is an enemy to the Saviour. It is
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:049067_0058_10264F49AB732370"/>
in vain for you to tell of your want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as long as your will is found defective. If a man ≈øhould hate you, and devour you, and exalt him≈øelf, and ≈ømite you in the face, and tell you that he did it voluntarily, and becau≈øe he had a mind to, but only ≈øhould tell you at the ≈øame time, that he hated you ≈øo much, that he could not help choo≈øing and willing ≈øo to do, would you take it the more patiently for that? Would not your indignation be rather ≈øtirred up the more?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would be willing if you could, that is no excu≈øe, unle≈øs your willingne≈øs to be willing be ≈øincere. That which is hypocritical, and does not come from the heart, but is merely forced, ought wholly to be ≈øet a≈øide, as worthy of no con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that becau≈øe common ≈øen≈øe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that that which is not hearty but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical is indeed nothing, being only a ≈øhew of what is not; but that which is good for nothing, ought to go for nothing. But if you ≈øet a≈øide all that is not free, and call nothing a willingne≈øs, but a free, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty willingne≈øs, then ≈øee how the ca≈øe ≈øtands, and whether or no you have not lo≈øt all your excu≈øe for ≈øtanding out again≈øt the calls of the go≈øpel. You ≈øay you would make your≈øelf willing to accept if you could; but it is not from any good princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that you are willing for that; it is not from any free inclination, or true re≈øpect

to Chri≈øt, or any love to your duty, or any ≈øpirit of obedience, or from the influence of any manner of real re≈øpect, or tendency in your heart, towards any thing that is good, or from any other principle than ≈øuch as is in the hearts of devils, and would make them have the ≈øame ≈øort of willingne≈øs in the ≈øame circum≈øtances. It is therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there can be no goodne≈øs in that woulding to be willing to come to Chri≈øt: And that which has no goodne≈øs, cannot be an excu≈øe for any badne≈øs. If there be no good in it, then it ≈øignifies nothing, and weighs nothing, when put into the ≈øcales to counterbalance that which is bad.</p>
               <p>Sinners therefore ≈øpend their time in fooli≈øh arguing and objecting, making much o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that which is good for nothing, making tho≈øe excu≈øes that be not worth offering. It is in vain to keep making objections: You ≈øtand ju≈øtly condemned: The blame lies all at your door: Thru≈øt it off from you as often as you will, it will return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: Sew fig leaves as long as you will, your nakedne≈øs will appear: You contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue wilfully and wickedly rejecting Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and will not have him for your Saviour, and therefore it is ≈øotti≈øh madne≈øs in you to charge Chri≈øt with inju≈øtice that he does not ≈øave you.</p>
               <p>Here is the ≈øin of unbelief! Thus the guilt of that great ≈øin lies upon you! If you never had thus treated a Saviour, you
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:049067_0060_10264F4EB9823E88"/>
might mo≈øt ju≈øtly have been damned to all eternity: It would but be exactly agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your treatment of God. But be≈øides this, when God, notwith≈øtanding, has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you his own dear Son, to ≈øave you from this endle≈øs mi≈øery you had de≈øerved, and not only ≈øo, but to make you happy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the enjoyment of him≈øelf you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed him, and would not have him for your Saviour, and ≈øtill refu≈øe to comply with the offers of the go≈øpel; what can render any per≈øon more inexcu≈øable? If you ≈øhould now peri≈øh forever, what can you have to ≈øay?</p>
               <p>Hereby the ju≈øtice of God in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction appears in two re≈øpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is more abundantly manife≈øt that it is ju≈øt that you ≈øhould be de≈øtroyed. Ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice never appears ≈øo con≈øpicuous as it does after refu≈øed and abu≈øed mercy. Ju≈øtice in damnation appears abundantly the more clear and bright, after a wilful rejection of offered ≈øalvation. What can an offenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prince do more than freely offer pardon to a condemned malefactor? And if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øes to accept of it, will any one ≈øay that his execution is unju≈øt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. God's ju≈øtice evill appear in your greater de≈øtruction. Be≈øides the guilt that you would have had if a Saviour never had been offered, you bring that great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional guilt upon you, of mo≈øt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refu≈øing offered deliverance. What
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:049067_0061_10264F50468DD370"/>
more ba≈øe and vile treatment of God can there be, than for you, when ju≈øtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to eternal mi≈øery, and ready to be executed, and God graciou≈øly ≈øends his own Son, who comes and knocks at your door with a pardon in his hand, and not only a pardon, but a deed of eternal glory; I ≈øay, what can be wor≈øe, than for you, out of di≈ølike and enmity again≈øt God and his Son, to refu≈øe to accept tho≈øe benefits at his hands! How ju≈øtly may the anger of God be greatly incen≈øed and increa≈øed by it! When a ≈øinner thus ungratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects mercy, his la≈øt error is wor≈øe that the fir≈øt; this is more heinous than all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rebellion, and may ju≈øtly bring down more fearful wrath upon him.</p>
               <p>The heinou≈øne≈øs of this ≈øin of rejecting a Saviour e≈øpecially appears in two things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The greatne≈øs of the benefits offered; which appears in the greatne≈øs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, which is from inexpre≈ø≈øible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of corruption and wickedne≈øs of heart and life, the lea≈øt degree of which is infinitely evil: and from mi≈øery that is everla≈øting; and in the greatne≈øs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the inheritance purcha≈øed and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, Heb. ii.3. "How ≈øhall we e≈øcape, if we neglect ≈øo great ≈øalvation?"</p>
               <p n="2">2. The wonderfulne≈øs of the way in which the≈øe benefits are procured and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. That God ≈øhould lay help on his own Son, when our ca≈øe was ≈øo deplorable
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:049067_0062_10264F52D6D20E68"/>
that help could be had in no mere crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that he ≈øhould undertake for us, and ≈øhould come into the world, and take upon him our nature, and ≈øhould not only appear in a low ≈øtate of life, but ≈øhould die ≈øuch a death, and endure ≈øuch torments and contempt for ≈øinners while enemies, how wonderful is it! And what tongue or pen can ≈øet forth the greatne≈øs of the ingratitude, ba≈øene≈øs, and perver≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs that there is in it, when a peri≈øhing ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is in the mo≈øt extreme nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øalvation, rejects it, after it is procured in ≈øuch a way as this! That ≈øo glorious a per≈øon ≈øhould be thus treated, and that when he comes on ≈øo gracious an errand! That he ≈øhould ≈øtand ≈øo long offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf and calling and inviting, as he has done to many of you, and all to no purpo≈øe, but all the while be ≈øet at nought! Surely you might ju≈øtly be ca≈øt into hell without one more offer of a Saviour! Yea, and thru≈øt down into the lowe≈øt hell! Herein you have exceeded the very devils; for they never rejected the offers of ≈øuch glorious mercy; no, nor of any mercy at all. This will be the di≈øtingui≈øhing condemnation of go≈øpel ≈øinners, John, iii.18. "He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, is condemned already, becau≈øe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."</p>
               <p>That outward ≈ømoothne≈øs of your carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards Chri≈øt, that appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:049067_0063_10264F5669C91CF0"/>
to him in your looks, your ≈øpeeches, and ge≈øtures, do not argue but that you ≈øet him at nought in your heart. There may be much of the≈øe outward ≈øhews of re≈øpect, and yet you be like Judas, that betrayed the Son of man with a ki≈øs; and like tho≈øe mockers that bowed the knee before him, and at the ≈øame time ≈øpit in his face.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If God ≈øhould forever ca≈øt you off and de≈øtroy you, it would be agreeable to your treatment of others; it would be no other than what would be exactly an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your behaviour towards your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures, that have the ≈øame human nature, and are naturally in the ≈øame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances with you, and that you ought to love as your≈øelf. And that appears e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have many of you been oppo≈øite in your ≈øpirit to the ≈øalvation of others. There are ≈øeveral ways that natural men manife≈øt a ≈øpirit of oppo≈øition again≈øt the ≈øalvation of other's ≈øouls. It ≈øometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a fear that their companions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and equals, will obtain mercy, and ≈øo become un≈øpeakably happier than they. It is ≈øometimes manife≈øted by an unea≈øine≈øs at the news of others having hopefully obtained. It appears when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons envy others for it, and di≈ølike them the more, and di≈øreli≈øh their talk, and avoid their company, and cannot bear to hear their religious di≈øcour≈øe, and e≈øpecially
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:049067_0064_10263A648A9DD988"/>
to receive warnings and coun≈øels from them. And it oftentimes appears by their backwardne≈øs to entertain charitable thoughts of them, and their being difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to believe that it is really ≈øo, that they have obtained mercy, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈øs to li≈øten to any thing that ≈øeems to contradict it. The devil hated to own Job's ≈øincerity, Job. i.7. &amp;c. and chap. ii. ver≈øes 3.4.5. There appears very often much of this ≈øpirit of the devil in natural men. Sometimes they are ready to make a ridicule of others pretended godline≈øs: They ≈øpeak of the ground of other's hopes, as the enemies of the Jews did of the wall that they built. Neh. iv.3. "Now To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah the Ammonite was by him, and he ≈øaid<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> That which they build, if a fox go up, he ≈øhall even break down their ≈øtone wall." There are many that join with Sanballat and Tobiah, and are of the ≈øame ≈øpirit with them. There always was, and always will be, an enmity betwixt the ≈øeed of the ≈øerpent and the ≈øeed of the woman. It appeared in Cain, who hated his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becau≈øe he was more acceptable to God than him≈øelf: and it appears ≈øtill in the≈øe times<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and in this place. There are many that are like the elder brother, who could not bear it that the prodigal when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ≈øhould be received with ≈øuch joy and good entertainment, and was put into a fret by it, both again≈øt his brother that
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:049067_0065_10264F5A8193E670"/>
had returned, and his father that made him ≈øo welcome. Luke. xv.</p>
               <p>Thus have many of you been oppo≈øite to the ≈øalvation of others, that ≈øtand in as great nece≈ø≈øity of it as you. You have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt their being delivered from everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mi≈øery, that can bear it no better than you; not becau≈øe their ≈øalvation would do you any hurt, or their damnation help you, any otherwi≈øe than as it would gratify that vile ≈øpirit that is ≈øo much like the ≈øpirit of the devil, who, becau≈øe he is mi≈øerable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, is unwilling that others ≈øhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. How ju≈øt therefore is it that God ≈øhould be oppo≈øite to your ≈øalvation? If you have ≈øo little love or mercy in you as to begrudge your neighbour's ≈øalvation, whom you have no cau≈øe to hate, but the law of God and nature requires you to love, why is God bound to exerci≈øe ≈øuch infinite love and mercy to you, as to ≈øave you at the price of his own blood, that he is no way bound to love, but that have de≈øerved his hatred a thou≈øand and a thou≈øand times? You are not willing that others ≈øhould be converted, that have behaved them≈øelves injuriou≈øly towards you; and yet, will you count it hard if God does not be≈øtow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace upon you that have de≈øerved ten thou≈øand times as ill of God, as ever any of your neighbours have of you? You are oppo≈øite to God's ≈øhewing mercy to th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:049067_0066_10264F5E175655B0"/>
vicious per≈øons, and are very unworthy of ≈øuch mercy. Is others unworthine≈øs a ju≈øt rea≈øon why God ≈øhould not be≈øtow mercy on them? And yet will God be hard, if, notwith≈øtanding all your unworthine≈øs, and the abominablene≈øs of your ≈øpirit and practice in his ≈øight, he does not ≈øhow you mercy? You would have God be≈øtow lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally on you, and upbraid not; but yet when he ≈øhews mercy to others, you are ready to upbraid as ≈øoon as you hear of it; you immediately are thinking with your≈øelf how ill they have behaved them≈øelves; and it may be your mouths on this occa≈øion are open, enumerating and aggravating the ≈øins they have been guilty of. You would have God bury all your faults, and wholly blot out all your tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions; but yet if he be≈øtows mercy on others, it may be you will take that occa≈øion to rake up all their old faults that you can think of. You do not much reflect on and condemn your≈øelf for your ba≈øene≈øs and unju≈øt ≈øpirit towards others, in your oppo≈øition to their ≈øalvation; you do not quarrel with your≈øelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your≈øelf for this; but yet you in your heart will quarrel with God, and condemn him, and fret at his di≈øpen≈øations, becau≈øe you think he ≈øeems oppo≈øite to ≈øhewing mercy to you. One would think that the con≈øideration of the≈øe things ≈øhould forever ≈øtop your mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Con≈øider how you have promoted
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:049067_0067_10263A661433A180"/>
other's damnation. Many of you, by the bad examples you have ≈øet, by corrupting the minds of others, by your ≈øinful conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation, by leading them into ≈øin, or ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening them in ≈øin, and by the mi≈øchief that you have done in human ≈øociety other ways that might be mentioned, have been guilty of tho≈øe things that have tended to others damnation. You have heretofore appeared on the ≈øide of ≈øin and Satan, and have behaved your≈øelf ≈øo as much to ≈øtrengthen their intere≈øt, and have been many ways acce≈ø≈øory to other's ≈øins, have hardened other's hearts, and thereby have done what has tended to the ruin of their ≈øouls.</p>
               <p>And without doubt there are tho≈øe here pre≈øent that have been in a great mea≈øure the means of other's damnation. Though it is true that it is determined of God who he will ≈øave, and who not, from all eternity, yet one man may really be a means of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's damnation as well as ≈øalvation. Chri≈øt charges the ≈øcribes and Phari≈øees with this, Matth. xxiii.13. "Ye ≈øhut up the kingdom of heaven again≈øt men; for ye neither go in your≈øelves, neither ≈øuffer ye them that are entering, to go in." We have no rea≈øon to think that this congregation has none in it that are cur≈øed from day to day by poor ≈øouls that are roaring out in hell, who≈øe damnation they have been a means of, or have greatly contributed to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:049067_0068_10264F6099AD0750"/>There are many that contribute to their own children's damnation, by neglecting their education, and ≈øetting them bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and bringing them up in ≈øinful ways: They take ≈øome care of their bodies, but take but little care of their poor ≈øouls; they provide for them bread to eat, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the bread of life, that their fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhing ≈øouls ≈øtand in need of. And are there no ≈øuch parents here that have thus treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their children?

Is God obliged to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of your happine≈øs, than you are either of your own happine≈øs or his glory? Is God bound to take that care for you, out of love to you, that you will not take for your≈øelf, either from love to your≈øelf, or

regard to his authority? How long, and how greatly, have you neglected the welfare of your precious ≈øoul, refu≈øing to take pains and deny your≈øelf, or put your≈øelf a little out of your way for your ≈øalvation, while God has been calling upon you! Neither your duty to God, nor love to your own ≈øoul, were enough to induce you to do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things for your own eternal welfare; and yet do you now expect that God ≈øhould do great things, putting forth almighty power, and exerci≈øing infinite mercy for it? You was urged to take care for your ≈øalvation, and not to put it off: You was told that that was the be≈øt time before you grew older<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and that it might be, if you would put it off, God would not hear you afterwards; but yet you would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; you would run the venture of it. Now how ju≈øtly might God order it ≈øo, that it ≈øhould be too late, leaving you to ≈øeek in vain? You was told, that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it if you delayed; but you would not hear: How ju≈øtly therefore may God give you cau≈øe to repent of it, by refu≈øing to ≈øhow you mercy now? If God ≈øees you going on in ways contrary to his commands and his glory, and requires you to for≈øake them, and tells you that they are ways that tend to the de≈øtruction of your own ≈øoul, and therefore coun≈øels you to avoid them, and you refu≈øe; how ju≈øt would it be if God ≈øhould be provoked by it, hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <p n="2">2. You have not only neglected your ≈øalvation, but you have wilfully taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect cour≈øes to undo your≈øelf. You have gone on in tho≈øe ways and practices that have directly tended to your damnation and have been perver≈øe and ob≈øtinate in it. You cannot plead ignorance; you had all the light ≈øet before you that you could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire: God told you that you was undoing your≈øelf; but yet you would do it: He told you that the path you was going in led to de≈øtruction, and coun≈øelled you to avoid it; but you would not hearken: How ju≈øtly therefore may God leave you to be undone! You have ob≈øtinately per≈øi≈øted to travel in the way that leads to hell for a long time, contrary to God's continual coun≈øels and commands, till it may be at length you are got almo≈øt to your journey's end, and are come near to hell's gate, and ≈øo begin to be ≈øen≈øible of your danger and mi≈øery; and now account it unju≈øt and hard if God will not deliver you! You have de≈øtroyed your≈øelf, and de≈øtroyed your≈øelf wilfully, contrary to God's repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coun≈øels, yea, and de≈øtroyed your≈øelf in fighting again≈øt God: Now therefore, why do you blame any but your≈øelf if you are de≈øtroyed? If you will undo your≈øelf in oppo≈øing God, and while God oppo≈øes you by his calls and coun≈øels. and, it may be,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:049067_0071_10263A7320A89880"/>
too, by the convictions of his Spirit, what can you object again≈øt it, if God now leaves you to be undone? You would have your own way, and did not like that God ≈øhould oppo≈øe you in it, and your way was to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your own ≈øoul: How ju≈øt therefore is it, if, now at length, God cea≈øes to oppo≈øe you, and falls in with you, and lets your ≈øoul be ruined; and as you would de≈øtroy your≈øelf, ≈øo ≈øhould put to his hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy you too! The ways you went on in had a natural tendency to your mi≈øery: If you would drink poi≈øon in oppo≈øition to God, and in contempt of him and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who can you blame but your≈øelf if you are poi≈øoned, and ≈øo peri≈øh? If you would run into the fire again≈øt all re≈øtraints both of God's mercy and authority, you mu≈øt even blame your≈øelf if you are burnt.</p>
               <p>Thus I have propo≈øed ≈øome things to your con≈øideration, which, if you are not exceeding blind, ≈øen≈øele≈øs, and perver≈øe, will ≈øtop your month, and convince you that you ≈øtand ju≈øtly condemned before God, and that he would in no wi≈øe deal hardly with you, but altogether ju≈øtly, in denying you any mercy, and in refu≈øing to hear your prayers, let you pray never ≈øo earne≈øtly, and never ≈øo often, and continue in it never ≈øo long; and that God may utterly di≈øregard your tears and moans, your heavy heart, your earne≈øt de≈øires, and great endeavours; and that he may

ca≈øt you into eternal de≈øtruction, without any regard to your welfare, denying you converting grace, and giving you over to Satan, and at la≈øt ca≈øt you into the lake that burns with fire and brim≈øtone, to be there to eternity, having no re≈øt day nor night, for ever glorifying his ju≈øtice upon you, in the pre≈øence of the holy angels, and the pre≈øence of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here many may ≈øtill object, (for I am ≈øen≈øible it is an hard thing to ≈øtop ≈øinners mouth's,) "God ≈øhews mercy to others that have done the≈øe things as well as I, yea, that have done a great deal wor≈øe than I."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> 1. That does not prove that God is any way bound to ≈øhew mercy to you, or them either. If God does be≈øtow it on others, he does not be≈øtow it on them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he is bound to be≈øtow it: He might if he had plea≈øed, with glorious ju≈øtice, have denied it them. If God be≈øtows it on ≈øome, that does not prove that he is bound to be≈øtow it on any; and if he is bound to be≈øtow it on none, then he is not bound to be≈øtow it on you. God is in debt to none; and if he gives to ≈øome that he is not in debt to, becau≈øe it is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, that does not bring him into debt to others. It alters not the ca≈øe as to you at all, whether others have it or have it not: You do not de≈øerve damnation the le≈øs, than if mercy never had been be≈øtowed on

any at all. Matth. xx.15. "Is thine eye evil, becau≈øe mine is good?"</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this objection be good, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe of God's mercy is not in his own right, and his grace is not his own to give That which God may not di≈øpo≈øe of as he plea≈øes, is not his own; for that which is one's own, is at his own di≈øpo≈øal: but if it be not God's own, then he is not capable of making a gift or pre≈øent of it to any one; it is impo≈ø≈øible to give a debt.</p>
               <p>What is it that you would make of God? Mu≈øt the great God be tied up to that, that he mu≈øt not u≈øe his own plea≈øure in be≈øtowing his own gifts, but if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtows them on one, mu≈øt be looked upon obliged to be≈øtow them on another? Is not God worthy to have the ≈øame right, with re≈øpect to the gifts of his grace, that a man has to his money or goods? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe God is not ≈øo great, and ≈øhould be more in ≈øubjection than man, that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowed him? If any of you ≈øee cau≈øe to ≈øhew kindne≈øs to a neighbour, do all the re≈øt of your neighbours come to you, and tell you, that you owe them ≈øo much as you have given to ≈øuch a man? But this is the way that you deal with God, as though God were not worthy to have as ab≈øolute a property in his goods, as you have in yours.</p>
               <p>At this rate God cannot make a pre≈øent of any thing; he has nothing of his own
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:049067_0074_10264F673495DE48"/>
to be≈øtow: if he has a mind to ≈øhew pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar favour to ≈øome, or to lay ≈øome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar per≈øons under peculiar obligations to him, he cannot do it; becau≈øe he has no ≈øpecial gift, that his creatures ≈øtand in great need of, and that would tend greatly to their happine≈øs, at his own di≈øpo≈øal. If this be the ca≈øe, why do you pray to God to be≈øtow ≈øaving grace upon you? If God does not do fairly to deny it you, becau≈øe he be≈øtows it on others, then it is not worth your while to pray for it, but you may go and tell him that he has be≈øtowed it on the≈øe and tho≈øe, as bad or wor≈øe than you, and ≈øo demand it of him as a debt.‚Äî And at this rate per≈øons never need to thank God for ≈øalvation, when it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed; for what occa≈øion is there to thank God for that which was not at his own di≈øpo≈øal, and that he could not fairly have denied? The thing at bottom is, that men have low thoughts of God, and high thoughts of them≈øelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that they look upon God as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øo little right, and they ≈øo much.‚Äî Matth. xx.1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will fini≈øh what I have to ≈øay to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men in the application of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, with a caution not to improve the doctrine to di≈øcouragement. For though it would be righteous in God for ever to ca≈øt you off, and de≈øtroy you, yet it will al≈øo be ju≈øt in God to ≈øave you in and through Chri≈øt, who has made complete ≈øatisfaction for all ≈øin. Rom. iii.25.26. "Whom God hath ≈øet forth to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou≈øne≈øs for the remi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of ≈øins that are pa≈øt, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God; to declare, I ≈øay, at this time his righteou≈øne≈øs, that he might be ju≈øt, and the ju≈øtifier of him which believeth in Je≈øus." Yea, God may through this Mediator, not only ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but honourably, ≈øhew you mercy. The blood of Chri≈øt is ≈øo precious, that it is fully ≈øufficient to pay that debt that you have contracted, and perfectly to vindicate the divine Maje≈øty from all that di≈øhonour that has been ca≈øt upon it, by tho≈øe many great ≈øins of yours that have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:049067_0078_10264F70AC5B8F70"/>
It was as great, and indeed a much greater thing, for Chri≈øt to die, than it would have been for you and all mankind to have burnt in hell to all eternity. Of ≈øuch dignity and excellency is Chri≈øt in the eyes of God, that, ≈øeeing he has ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øo much for poor ≈øinners, God is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be at peace with them, however vile and unworthy they have been, and on how many accounts ≈øoever the puni≈øhment would be ju≈øt. So that you need not be at all di≈øcouraged from ≈øeeking mercy, for there is enough in Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Indeed it would not become the glory of God's maje≈øty to ≈øhew mercy to you that have been ≈øo ≈øinful and vile a creature, for any thing that you have done, for ≈øuch worthle≈øs and de≈øpicable things as your prayers, and other religious performances; it would be very di≈øhonourable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God ≈øo to do, and it is in vain to expect it: He will ≈øhew mercy only on Chri≈øt's account, and that, according to his ≈øovereign plea≈øure, on whom he plea≈øes, when he plea≈øes, and in what manner he plea≈øes. You cannot bring him under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by your works; do what you will, he will not look on him≈øelf obliged. But if it be his plea≈øure, he can honourably ≈øhew mercy through Chri≈øt to any ≈øinner of you all, not one in this congregation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>Therefore here is encouragement for you
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:049067_0079_10264F75D7489DF8"/>
≈øtill to ≈øeek and wait, notwith≈øtanding all your wickedne≈øs; agreeable to Samuel's ≈øpeech to the children of I≈ørael, when they were terrified with the thunder and rain that God ≈øent, and their guilt ≈øtared them in the face, 1 Sam. xii.20. "Fear not; ye have done all this wickedne≈øs; yet turn not a≈øide from following the Lord, but ≈øerve the Lord with all your hearts."</p>
               <p>I would conclude this di≈øcour≈øe by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the doctrine, in the ≈øecond place, very briefly to put the godly in mind of the freene≈øs and wonderfulne≈øs of the grace of God towards them. For ≈øuch were ≈øome of you.‚ÄîThe ca≈øe was ju≈øt ≈øo with you as you have heard; you had ≈øuch a wicked heart, you lived ≈øuch a wicked life, and it would have been mo≈øt ju≈øt with God for ever to have ca≈øt you off: but he has had mercy upon you; he hath made his glorious grace appear in your everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øalvation.

You was ungrateful for pa≈øt mercies; but yet
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:049067_0080_10264F785B422258"/>
God not only continued tho≈øe mercies, but be≈øtowed un≈øpeakably greater mercies upon you: You refu≈øed to hear when God called; but yet God heard you when you called: You abu≈øed the infinitene≈øs of God's mercy to encourage your≈øelf in ≈øin again≈øt God: but yet God has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øted the infinitene≈øs of that mercy, in the exerci≈øes of it towards you<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> You have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chri≈øt, and ≈øet him at nought; and yet he is become your Saviour<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> You have neglected your own ≈øalvation; but God has not neglected it; You have de≈øtroyed your≈øelf; but yet in God has been your help. God has magnified his free grace towards you, and not to others; becau≈øe he has cho≈øen you, and it hath plea≈øed him to ≈øet his love upon you.</p>
               <p>O! what cau≈øe is here for prai≈øe? What obligations are upon you to ble≈øs the Lord, who hath dealt bountifully with you, and to magnify his holy name? What cau≈øe for you to prai≈øe him in humility, to walk humbly before God, and to be conformed to that in Ezek. xvi.63.: "That thou maye≈øt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of thy ≈øhame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou ha≈øt done, ≈øaith the Lord God!"

generally, in the country, repre≈øented as of a new and odd opinion with re≈øpect to the terms of Chri≈øtian communion, and as being for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a peculiar way of my own. Whereas, I do not perceive that I differ at all from the ≈øcheme of Dr Watts, in his book intitled, <hi>The rational Foundation of a Chri≈øtian Church, and the Terms of Chri≈øtian Communion;</hi> which, he ≈øays, is the common ≈øentiment and practice of all reformed churches. I had not ≈øeen this book of Dr Watt's when I publi≈øhed what I have written on the ≈øubject. But yet, I think my ≈øentiments, as I have expre≈ø≈øed them, are as exactly agreeable to what he lays down, as if I had been his pupil. Nor do I at all go beyond what Dr Doddridge plainly ≈øhews to be his ≈øentiments, in his <hi>Ri≈øe and Progre≈øs of Religion</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and his <hi>Sermons on Regeneration,</hi> and his Parapha≈øe and Notes on the New Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. Nor indeed, Sir, when I con≈øider the ≈øentiments you have expre≈ø≈øed in your letters to Major Pomroy and Mr Billing, can I perceive but that they come exactly to the ≈øame thing that I maintain. You ≈øuppo≈øe, the ≈øacraments are not converting ordinances: But that, <hi>as ≈øeals of the covenant, they pre≈øuppo≈øe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, e≈øpecially in the adult; and that it is vi≈øible ≈øaint≈øhip, or<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in other words, a cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible profe≈ø≈øion of faith and repentance, a ≈øolemn con≈øent to the go≈øpel covenant, joined with a good conver≈øation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent mea≈øure of Chri≈øtian knowledge, is what gives a go≈øpel right to all ≈øacred or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:

But that it is nece≈ø≈øary to tho≈øe that come to the≈øe ordinances, and in tho≈øe that profe≈øs a con≈øent to the go≈øpel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that they be ≈øincere in their profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion,</hi> or at lea≈øt ≈øhould think them≈øelvss ≈øo.‚Äî The great things which I have ≈øcrupled in the e≈øtabli≈øhed method of this church's proceeding, and which I dare no longer go on in, is their publicly a≈ø≈øenting to the form of words rehear≈øed on occa≈øion of their admi≈ø≈øion to the communion, without pretending thereby to mean any ≈øuch thing as an hearty con≈øent to the terms of the go≈øpel-covenant, or to mean any ≈øuch faith or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as belong to the covenant of grace, and are the grand conditions of that covenant: It being, at the ≈øame time that the words are u≈øed, their known and e≈øtabli≈øhed principle, which they openly profe≈øs and proceed upon, that men may and ought to u≈øe the≈øe words, and mean no ≈øuch thing, but ≈øomething el≈øe of a nature far inferior; which I think they have no di≈øtinct determinate notion of; but ≈øomething co≈øi≈øtent with their knowing that they do not chu≈øe God as their chief good, but love the world more than him, and that they do not give them≈øelves up entirely to God, but make re≈øerves; and in ≈øhort, knowing that they do not heartily con≈øent to the go≈øpel covenant, but live ≈øtill under the reigning power of the love of the world, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thus far my letter to Mr. Clark.</p>
            <p>The council having heard that I had made certain draughts of the covenant, or forms of a public profe≈ø≈øion of religion which I ≈øtood ready to accept of from the candidates for church communion, they, for their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> information, ≈øent for them. Accordingly I ≈øent them four di≈øtinct draughts or forms, which I had drawn up about a twelvemonth before, as what I ≈øtood ready to accept of (any one of them) rather than contend, and brake with my people.</p>
            <p>The two ≈øhorte≈øt of the≈øe forms are here in≈øerted for the ≈øatisfaction of the reader. They are as follows.</p>
            <p>"I hope I do truly find a heart to give up my≈øelf wholly to God, according to the tenor of that covenant of grace which was ≈øealed in my bapti≈øm; and to walk in a way of that obediance to all the commandments of God, which the covenant of grace requires, as long as I live."</p>
            <p>Another,</p>
            <p>"I hope I truly find in my heart a willingne≈øs to comply with all the commandments of God which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to give up my≈øelf wholly to him, and to ≈øerve him with my body and my ≈øpirit. And do accordingly now promi≈øe to walk in a way of obedience to all the commandments of God, as long as I live."</p>
            <p>Such kind of profe≈ø≈øions as the≈øe I ≈øtood ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, rather than contend and break with my people. Not but that I think it much more convenient, that ordinarily the public profe≈ø≈øion of religion that is made
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:049067_0088_10264F8DA9A4F708"/>
by Chri≈øtians, ≈øhould be much fuller and more particular. And that (as I hinted in my letter to Mr Clark) I ≈øhould not chu≈øe to be tied up to any certain form of words, but to have liberty to vary the expre≈ø≈øions of a public profe≈øsion, the more exactly to ≈øuit the ≈øentiments and experience of the profe≈ø≈øor, that it might be a more ju≈øt and free expre≈øsion of what each one finds in his heart.</p>
            <p>And moreover it mu≈øt be noted, that I ever in≈øi≈øted on it, that it belonged to me as a pa≈øtor, before a profe≈ø≈øion was accepted, to have full liberty to in≈øtruct the candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date in the meaning of the terms of it, and in the nature of the things propo≈øed to be profe≈ø≈øed; and to inquire into his doctrinal under≈øtanding of the≈øe things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my be≈øt di≈øcretion; and to caution the per≈øon, as I ≈øhould think needful, again≈øt ra≈øhne≈øs in making ≈øuch a profe≈ø≈øion, or doing it mainly for the credit of him≈øelf or his family, or from any ≈øecular views what≈øoever, and to put him on ≈øerious ≈øelf-examination, and ≈øearching his own heart, and prayer to God to ≈øearch and enlighten him, that he may not be hypocritical and deceived in the profe≈ø≈øiom he makes; withal pointing forth to him the many ways in which profe≈ø≈øors are liable to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think it improper for a mini≈øter in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, to inquire and know of the candidate what can be remembered of the circum≈øtances of his Chri≈øtian expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; as this may tend much to illu≈øtrate his profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and give a mini≈øter great advantage for proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions: though a particular knowledge and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the time and method of the fir≈øt conver≈øion to God, is not to be made the te≈øt of a per≈øon's ≈øincerity, nor in≈øi≈øted on as nece≈ø≈øary in order to his being received into full charity. Not that I think it at all improper or unprofitable, that in ≈øome ≈øpecial ca≈øes, a declaration of the particular circum≈øtances of a per≈øon's fir≈øt awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the manner of his convictions, illuminations, and comforts, ≈øhould be publicly exhibited before the whole congregation, on occa≈øion of his admi≈ø≈øion into the church; though this be not demanded as nece≈ø≈øary to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:049067_0089_10264F91359A4E28"/>
admi≈ø≈øion. I ever declared again≈øt in≈øi≈øting on a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of experiences, in this ≈øen≈øe (viz. a relation of the particular time and ≈øteps of the operation of the Spirit, in fir≈øt conver≈øion,) as the term of communion: Yet, if by a relation of experiences, be meant a declaration of experience of the great things wrought, wherein true grace and the e≈ø≈øential acts and habits of holine≈øs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in this ≈øen≈øe, I think an account of a per≈øon's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences nece≈ø≈øary in order to his admi≈ø≈øion into full communion in the church. But that in whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries are made, and whatever account is given, neither mini≈øter nor church are to ≈øet up them≈øelve≈øs as ≈øearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of hearts, but are to accept the ≈øerious ≈øolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion of the well-in≈øtructed profe≈ø≈øor, of a good life, as be≈øt able to determine what he finds in his own heart.</p>
            <p>The≈øe things may ≈øerve in ≈øome mea≈øure to ≈øet right tho≈øe of my readers who have been mi≈øled in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øions of the ≈øtate of the controver≈øy between me and my people, by the forementioned mi≈ørepre≈øentations.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE apo≈øtle, in the preceding part of the chapter, declares what great troubles he met with in the cour≈øe of his mini≈øtry. In the text, and two foregoing ver≈øes, he declares what were his comforts and ≈øupports under the troubles he met with. There are four things in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he had approved him≈øelf to his own con≈øcience, ver≈ø. 12. "For our rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, the te≈øtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, that in ≈øimplicity and godly ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, not with fle≈øhly wi≈ødom, but by the grace of God, we have had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation in the world, and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to you-wards."</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing he ≈øpeaks of as matter of comfort, is, that as he had approved him≈øelf to his own con≈øcience, ≈øo he had al≈øo to the con≈øciences of his hearers, the Corinthians, whom he now wrote to<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and that they ≈øhould approve of him at the day of judgment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The hope he had of ≈øeeing the ble≈ø≈øed fruit of his labours and ≈øufferings in the mini≈øtry, in their happine≈øs and glory, in that great day of accounts.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:049067_0091_10264F9659905B78"/>4. That, in his mini≈øtry among the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, he had approved him≈øelf to his Judge, who would approve and reward his faithfulne≈øs in that day.</p>
            <p>The≈øe three la≈øt particulars are ≈øignified in my text, and the preceding ver≈øe; and indeed all the four are implied in the text: it is implied, that the Corinthians had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him as their ≈øpiritual Father, &amp; as one that had been faithful among them, and as the means of their future joy and glory at the day of judgment, and one whom they ≈øhould then ≈øee, and have a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meeting with as ≈øuch. It is implied, that the apo≈øtle expected at that time to have a joyful meeting with them before the Judge, and with joy to behold their glory, as the fruit of his labours; and ≈øo they would be his rejoicing. It is implied al≈øo, that he then expected to be approved of the great Judge, when he and they ≈øhould meet together before him; and that he would then acknowledge his fidelity, and that this had been the means of their glory; and that thus he would, as it were, give them to him as his crown of rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But this the apo≈øtle could not hope for, unle≈øs he had the te≈øtimony of his own con≈øcience in his favour. And therefore the words do imply, in the ≈øtronge≈øt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he had approved him≈øelf to his own con≈øcience.</p>
            <p>There is one thing implied in each of
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:049067_0092_10264F98E6F66168"/>
the≈øe particulars, and in every part of the text, which is that point I ≈øhall make the ≈øubject of my pre≈øent di≈øcour≈øe, viz.</p>

               <p>Mini≈øters, and the people that have been under their care, mu≈øt be parted in this world, how well ≈øoever they have been united: If they are not ≈øeparated before, they mu≈øt be parted by death; and they may be ≈øeparated while life is continued.

to do one with another, in this world.‚Äî But if it be ≈øo, there is one meeting more that they mu≈øt have, and that is in the la≈øt great day of accounts.</p>
               <p>Here I would ≈øhew,</p>

               <p n="1">I. I would ≈øhew, in ≈øome particulars, in what manner mini≈øters and the people which have been under their care, ≈øhall meet one another at the day of judgment. Concerning this, I would ob≈øerve two things in general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ≈øhall not then meet only as all mankind mu≈øt then meet, but there will be ≈øomething peculiar in the manner of their meeting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their meeting together at that time ≈øhall be very different from what u≈øed to be in the hou≈øe of God in this world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ≈øhall all not meet at that day mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as all the world mu≈øt then meet togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I would ob≈øerve a difference in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:049067_0094_10264F9D43267520"/>(1.) As to a clear actual view, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct knowledge and notice of each other.</p>
               <p>Although the whole world will be then pre≈øent, all mankind of all generations ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in one va≈øt a≈ø≈øembly, with all of the angelic nature, both elect and fallen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; yet we need not ≈øuppo≈øe that every one will have a di≈øtinct and particular knowledge of each individual of the whole a≈ø≈øembled multitude, which will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly con≈øi≈øt of many millions of millions. Though it is probable that men's capacities will be much greater than in their pre≈øent ≈øtate<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> yet they will not be infinite: Though their under≈øtanding and comprehen≈øion will be va≈øtly extended, yet men will not be deified. There will probably be a very enlarged view that particular per≈øons will have of the various parts and members of that va≈øt a≈ø≈øembly, and ≈øo of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that great day; but yet it mu≈øt needs be, that according to the nature of finite minds, ≈øome per≈øons and ≈øome things, at that day, ≈øhall fall more under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of particular per≈øons than others; and this (as we may well ≈øuppo≈øe) according as they ≈øhall have a nearer concern with ≈øome than others in the tran≈øactions of the day. There will be ≈øpecial rea≈øon why tho≈øe who have had ≈øpecial concerns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this world, in their ≈øtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and who≈øe mutual affairs will be then to be tried and judged, ≈øhould e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:049067_0095_10264FA399A2D208"/>
be ≈øet in one another's view. Thus we may ≈øuppo≈øe, that rulers and ≈øubjects, earthly judges and tho≈øe whom they have judged, neighbours who have had mutual conver≈øe, dealings, and conte≈øts, heads of families and their children and ≈øervants, ≈øhall then meet, and in a peculiar di≈øtinction be ≈øet together. And e≈øpecially will it be thus with mini≈øters and their people. It is evident by the text, that the≈øe ≈øhall be in each other's view, ≈øhall di≈øtinctly know each, other, and ≈øhall have particular notice one of another at that time.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) They ≈øhall meet together, as having ≈øpecial concern one with another in the great tran≈øactions of that day.</p>
               <p>Although they ≈øhall meet the whole world at that time, yet they will not have any immediate and particular concern with all. Yea, the far greater part of tho≈øe who ≈øhall then be gathered together, will be ≈øuch as they have had no intercour≈øe with in their ≈øtate of probation, and ≈øo will have no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concerns to be judged of. But as to mini≈øters and the people that have been under their care, they will be ≈øuch as have had much immediate concern one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in matters of the greate≈øt moment that ever mankind have to do one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in. Therefore they e≈øpecially mu≈øt meet, and be brought together before the Judge, as having ≈øpecial concern one with another in the de≈øign and bu≈øine≈øs of that great day of accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:049067_0096_10264FA114F89B48"/>Thus their meeting, as to the manner of it, will be diver≈øe from the meeting of mankind in general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their meeting at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be very diver≈øe from their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one with another in this world.</p>
               <p>Mini≈øters and their people, while their relation continues, often meet together in this world: They are wont to meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, and at other times, for the public wor≈øhip of God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration, of ordinances, and the ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn ≈øervices of God's hou≈øe: And be≈øides the≈øe meetings, they have al≈øo occa≈øions to meet for the determining and managing their eccle≈øia≈øtical affairs, for the exerci≈øe of church-di≈øcipline, and the ≈øettling and adju≈øting tho≈øe things which concern the purity and good order of public admini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations. But their meeting at the day of judgment will be exceeding diver≈øe, in its manner and circum≈øtances, from any ≈øuch meetings and interviews as they have one with another in the pre≈øent ≈øtate. I would ob≈øerve how, in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Now they meet together in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory mutable ≈øtate, but then in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable ≈øtate.</p>
               <p>Now ≈øinners in the congregation meet their mini≈øter in a ≈øtate wherein they are capable of a ≈øaving change, capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned, through God's ble≈ø≈øing on the mini≈øtrations and labours of their pa≈øtor,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:049067_0097_10264FA522A2B300"/>
from the power of Satan unto God; and being brought out of a ≈øtate of guilt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and wrath, to a ≈øtate of peace and favour with God, to the enjoyment of the privileges of his children, and a title to their eternal inheritance. And ≈øaints now meet their mini≈øter with great remains of corruption, and ≈øometimes under great ≈øpiritual difficulties and affliction: And therefore are yet the proper ≈øubjects of means of an happy alteration of their ≈øtate, con≈øi≈øting in a greater freedom from the≈øe things, which they have rea≈øon to hope for in the way of an attendance on ordinances, and of which God is plea≈øed commonly to make his mini≈øters the in≈øtruments. And mini≈øters and their people now meet in order to the bringing to pa≈øs ≈øuch happy changes; they are the great benefits ≈øought in their ≈øolemn meetings in this world.</p>
               <p>But when they ≈øhall meet together at the day of judgment, it will be far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe. They will not then meet in order to the u≈øe of means for the bringing to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any ≈øuch changes; for they will all meet in an unchangeable ≈øtate. Sinners will be in an unchangeable ≈øtate: They who then ≈øhall be under the guilt and power of ≈øin, and have the wrath of God abiding on them, ≈øhall be beyond all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or po≈ø≈øibility of change, and ≈øhall meet their mini≈øters without any hopes of relief or remedy, or getting any good by their

means. And as for the ≈øaints, they will be already perfectly delivered from all their before remaining corruption, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and calamities of every kind, and ≈øet for ever out of their reach; and no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, no happy alteration, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be accompli≈øhed in the way of the u≈øe of means of grace, under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtrations of mini≈øters. It will then be pronounced, "He that is unju≈øt, let him be unju≈øt ≈øtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ≈øtill; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous ≈øtill; and he that is holy, let him be holy ≈øtill."</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Then they ≈øhall meet together in a ≈øtate of clear, certain, and infallible light.</p>
               <p>Mini≈øters are ≈øet as guides and teachers, and are repre≈øented in Scripture as lights ≈øet up in the churches; and in the pre≈øent ≈øtate meet their people from time to time in order to in≈øtruct and enlighten them, to correct their mi≈øtakes, and to be a voice behind them, when they turn a≈øide to the right hand or the left, ≈øaying, "This is the way, walk in it;" to evince end confirm the truth by exhibiting the proper evidences of it, &amp; to refute errors &amp; corrupt opinions, to convince the erroneous, and e≈øtabli≈øh the doubting. But when Chri≈øt ≈øhall come to judgment, every error &amp; fal≈øe opinion ≈øhall be detected; all deceit &amp; delu≈øion ≈øhall van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh away before the light of that day, as the darkne≈øs of the night vani≈øhes at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

of the ri≈øing ≈øun; and every doctrine of the word of God ≈øhall then appear in full evidence, and none ≈øhall remain unconvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; all ≈øhall know the truth with the greate≈øt certainty, and there ≈øhall be no mi≈øtakes to rectify.</p>
               <p>Now mini≈øters and their people may di≈øagree in their judgements concerning ≈øome matters of religion, and may ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet to confer together concerning tho≈øe things wherein they differ, and to hear the rea≈øons that may be offered on one ≈øide and the other; and all may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual as to any conviction of the truth: they may meet and part again no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed than before; and that ≈øide which was in the wrong, may remain ≈øo ≈øtill: Sometimes the meetings of mini≈øters with their people, in ≈øuch a ca≈øe of di≈øagreeing ≈øentiments, are attended with unhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and controver≈øy, managed with much prejudice and want of candour: not tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to light and conviction<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but rather to confirm and increa≈øe darkne≈øs, and e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh oppo≈øition to the truth, and alienation of affection one from another. But when they ≈øhall hereafter meet together, at the day of judgment, before the tribunal of the great Judge, the mind and will of Chri≈øt will be made known; and there ≈øhall no longer be any debate or difference of opinions; the evidence of the truth ≈øhall appear beyond all di≈øpute, and all
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:049067_0100_10264FADCC9348B8"/>
controver≈øies ≈øhall be finally and for ever decided.</p>
               <p>Now mini≈øters meet their people in ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enlighten and awaken the con≈øciences of ≈øinners; ≈øetting before them the great evil and danger of ≈øin, the ≈øtrictne≈øs of God's law, their own wickedne≈øs of heart and practice, the great guilt they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the wrath that abides upon them, and their impotence, blindne≈øs, poverty, and helple≈øs and undone condition: But all is often in vain; they remain ≈øtill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all their mini≈øters can ≈øay, ≈øtupid and unawakened, and their con≈øciences unconvinced. But it will not be ≈øo at their la≈øt meeting at the day of judgment; ≈øinners, when they ≈øhall meet their mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before their great Judge, will not meet him with a ≈øtupid con≈øcience: They will then be fully convinced of the truth of tho≈øe things which they formerly heard from him, concerning the greatne≈øs and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible maje≈øty of God, his holine≈øs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ≈øin, and his awful ju≈øtice in pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhing of it, the ≈øtrictne≈øs of his law, and the dreadfulne≈øs and truth of his threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and their own un≈øpeakable guilt and mi≈øery: And they ≈øhall never more be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øible of the≈øe things: The eyes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience will now be fully enlightened, and never ≈øhall be blinded again: The mouth of con≈øcience ≈øhall now be opened, and never ≈øhall be ≈øhut any more.</p>

And nothing is more common than for men to be mi≈øtaken concerning their own ≈øtate: Many that are abominable to God, and the children of his wrath, think highly of them≈øelves, as his precious ≈øaints and dear children. Yea, there is rea≈øon to think, that often ≈øome that are mo≈øt bold in their confidence of their ≈øafe and happy ≈øtate, and think them≈øelves not only true ≈øaints, but the mo≈øt eminent ≈øaints in the congregation, are in a peculiar manner a ≈ømoke in God's no≈øe. And thus it undoubtedly often is in tho≈øe congregations where the word of God is mo≈øt faithfully di≈øpen≈øed, notwith≈øtanding

all that mini≈øters can ≈øay in their cleare≈øt explications, and mo≈øt ≈øearching applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the doctrines and rules of God's word to the ≈øouls of their hearers, in their meetings one with another. But in the day of judgment they ≈øhall have another ≈øort of meeting; then the ≈øecrets of every heart ≈øhall be made manife≈øt, and every man's ≈øtate ≈øhall be perfectly known. 1 Cor. iv.5. "Therefore judge nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkne≈øs, and will make man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ife≈øt the coun≈øels of the hearts: And then ≈øhall every man have prai≈øe of God." Then none ≈øhall be deceived concerning his own ≈øtate, nor ≈øhall be any more in doubt about it. There ≈øhall be an eternal end to all the ≈øelf-conceit and vain hopes of deluded hypocrites, and all the doubts and fears of ≈øincere Chri≈øtians.‚Äî And then ≈øhall all know the ≈øtate of one another's ≈øouls: The people ≈øhall know whether their mini≈øter has been ≈øincere and faithful, and the mini≈øter ≈øhall know the ≈øtate of every one of their people, and to whom the word and ordinances of God have been a ≈øavour of life unto life, and to whom a ≈øavour of death unto death.</p>
               <p>Now in this pre≈øent ≈øtate it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that when mini≈øters and people meet together to debate and manage their eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øtical affairs, e≈øpecially in a ≈øtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øy,

they are ready to judge and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure one another with regard to each others views and de≈øigns, and the principles and ends that each is influenced by; and are greatly mi≈øtaken in their judgement, and wrong one another in their cen≈øures: But at that future meeting, things will be ≈øet in a true and perfect light, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and aims that every one has acted from, ≈øhall be certainly known; and there will be an end to all errors of this kind, and all unrighteous cen≈øures.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In this world, mini≈øters and their people often meet together to hear of and wait upon an un≈øeen Lord; but at the day of judgment, they ≈øhall meet in his mo≈øt immediate and vi≈øible pre≈øence.</p>
               <p>Mini≈øters, who now often meet their people to preach to them the King eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, immortal, and invi≈øible, to convince them that there is a God, and declare to them what manner of being he is, and to convince them that he governs, and will judge the world, and that there is a future ≈øtate of rewards and puni≈øhments, and to preach to them a Chri≈øt in heaven, at the right hand of God, in an un≈øeen world, ≈øhall then meet their people in the mo≈øt immediate ≈øen≈øible pre≈øence of this great God, Saviour, and Judge, appearing in the mo≈øt plain, vi≈øible, and open manner, with great glory, with all his holy angels<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and the whole world.

≈øhall not meet them to hear about an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Chri≈øt, an un≈øeen Lord, and future Judge; but to appear before that Judge, and as being ≈øet together in the pre≈øence of that ≈øupreme Lord, in his immen≈øe glory and awful maje≈øty, whom they have heard ≈øo often of, in their meetings together on earth.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The meeting at the la≈øt day, of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øters, and the people that have been under their care, will not be attended by any one with a carele≈øs heedle≈øs heart.</p>
               <p>With ≈øuch an heart are their meetings often attended in this world by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, having little regard to him whom they pretend unitedly to adore in the ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn duties of his public wor≈øhip, taking little heed to their own thoughts or frame of their minds, not attending to the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs they are engaged in, or con≈øidering the end for which they are come together.‚Äî But the meeting at that great day will be very different: there will not be one carele≈øs heart, no ≈øleeping, no wandering of mind from the great concern of the meeting, no inattentivene≈øs to the bu≈øine≈øs of the day, no regardle≈ø≈øne≈øs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence they are in, or of tho≈øe great things which they ≈øhall hear from Chri≈øt at that meeting, or that they formerly heard from him, and of him, by their mini≈øters, in their meetings in a ≈øtate of trial, or which they ≈øhall now hear their mini≈øters declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

concerning them before their judge.</p>
               <p>Having ob≈øerved the≈øe things, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner and circum≈øtances of this future meeting of mini≈øters and the people that have been under their care, before the tribunal of Chri≈øt at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I now proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">II. To ob≈øerve to what purpo≈øes they ≈øhall then meet.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To give an account, before the great Judge, of their behaviour one to another, in the relation they ≈øtood in to each other in this world.</p>
               <p>Mini≈øters are ≈øent forth by Chri≈øt to their people on his bu≈øine≈øs, are his ≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and me≈ø≈øengers; and, when they have fini≈øhed their ≈øervice, they mu≈øt return to their ma≈øter to give him an account of what they have done, and of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment they have had in performing their mini≈øtry. Thus we find, in Luke, xiv.16.‚Äî21. That when the ≈øervant who was ≈øent forth to call the gue≈øts to the great ≈øupper, had done his errand, and fini≈øhed his appointed ≈øervice, he returned to his ma≈øter, and gave him an account of what he had done, and of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had received. And when the ma≈øter, being angry, ≈øent his ≈øervant to others, he returns again, and gives his ma≈øter an account of his conduct and ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs. So we read, in Heb. xiii.17. of mini≈øters or rulers in the hou≈øe of God,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:049067_0106_10264FBC247148E0"/>
"that watch for ≈øouls, as tho≈øe that mu≈øt give account." And we ≈øee by the forementioned Luke xiv. that mini≈øters mu≈øt give an account to their ma≈øter, not only of their own behaviour in the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their office, but al≈øo of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples reception of them, and of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have met with among them.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as they will be called to give an account of both, they ≈øhall give an account at the great day of accounts, in the pre≈øence of their people; they and their people being both pre≈øent befor their Judge.</p>
               <p>Faithful mini≈øters will then give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with joy, concerning tho≈øe who have received them well, and made a good improvement of their mini≈øtry; and the≈øe will be given them, at that day, as their crown of rejoicing. And, at the ≈øame time, they will give an account of the ill treatment of ≈øuch as have not well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them and their me≈ø≈øages from Chri≈øt: they will meet the≈øe, not as they u≈øed to do in this world, to coun≈øel and warn them, but to bear witne≈øs again≈øt them; and as their judges, and a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors with Chri≈øt, to condemn them. And, on the other hand, the people will, at that day, ri≈øe up in judgment again≈øt wicked and unfaithful mini≈øters, who have ≈øought their own temporal intere≈øt more than the good of the ≈øouls of their flock.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:049067_0107_10264FBFC8A25F78"/>2. At that time mini≈øters, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have been under their care, ≈øhall meet together before Chri≈øt, that he may judge between them, as to any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies which have ≈øub≈øi≈øted between them in this world.</p>
               <p>So it very often comes to pa≈øs in this evil world, that great differences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øies ari≈øe between mini≈øters and the people that are under their pa≈øtoral care. Though they are under the greate≈øt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to live in peace, above per≈øons in almo≈øt any relation whatever; and altho' conte≈øts and di≈ø≈øentions between per≈øons ≈øo related are the mo≈øt unhappy and terrible in their con≈øequences, on many accounts, of any ≈øort of contentions; yet how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent have ≈øuch contentions been? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a people conte≈øt with their mini≈øters about their doctrine, ≈øometimes about their admini≈øtrations and conduct, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times about their maintenance; and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ≈øuch conte≈øts continue a long time; and ≈øometimes they are decided in this world, according to the prevailing intere≈øt of one party or the other, rather than by the word of God, and the rea≈øon of things; and ≈øometimes ≈øuch controver≈øies never have any proper determination in this world.</p>
               <p>But at the day of judgement there will be a full, perfect, and everla≈øting deci≈øion of them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> The infalliable Judge, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

fountain of light, truth, and ju≈øtice, will judge between the contending parties, and will declare what is the truth, who is in the right, and what is agreeable to his mind and will. And in order hereto, the parties mu≈øt ≈øtand together before him at the la≈øt day; which will be the great day of fini≈øhing and determining all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øies, rectifying all mi≈øtakes, and abol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhing all unrighteous judgments, errors, and confu≈øions, which have before ≈øub≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world of mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mini≈øters, and the people that have been under their care, mu≈øt meet together at that time to receive an eternal ≈øentence and retribution from the Judge, in the pre≈øence of each other, according to their behaviour in the relation they ≈øtood in, one to another in the pre≈øent ≈øtate.</p>
               <p>The Judge will not only declare ju≈øtice, but he will do ju≈øtice between mini≈øters and their people. He will declare what is right between them, approving him that has been ju≈øt and faithful, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unju≈øt; and perfect truth and equity ≈øhall take place in the ≈øentence which he pa≈ø≈øes, in the rewards he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtows, and the puni≈øhments which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts. There ≈øhall be a glorious reward to faithful mini≈øters; to tho≈øe who have been ≈øucce≈øsful. Dan. xii.3. "And they that be wi≈øe ≈øhall ≈øhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the firmament, and they that

"Then I ≈øaid, I have laboured in vain, I have ≈øpent my ≈øtrength for nought; yet ≈øurely my judgment is with the Lord, and my reward with my God." And tho≈øe who have well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entertained them ≈øhall be gloriou≈øly rewarded; Matth. x.40.41. "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ≈øent me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, ≈øhall receive a prophet's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, ≈øhall receive a righteous man's reward." Such people, and their faithful mini≈øters, ≈øhall he each other's crown of rejoicing. 1 The≈ø. ii.19.20. "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the pre≈øence of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy." And in the text, <hi>We are your rejoicing, as ye al≈øo are ours, in the day of the Lord Je≈øus.</hi> But they that evil-intreat Chri≈øt's faithful mini≈øters<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> e≈øpecially in that wherein they are faithful, ≈øhall be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puni≈øhed; Matth. x.14.15.

               <p>Thus ju≈øtice ≈øhall be admini≈øtered at the great day to mini≈øters and their people: And to that end they ≈øhall meet together, that they may not only receive ju≈øtice to them≈øelves<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but ≈øee ju≈øtice done to the other party: For this is the end of that great day, to reveal or declare the righteous judgment of God; Rom. ii.5. Mini≈øters ≈øhall have ju≈øtice done them, and they ≈øhall ≈øee ju≈øtice done to their people: And the people ≈øhall receive ju≈øtice them≈øelves from their Judge, and ≈øhall ≈øee ju≈øtice done to their mini≈øter.‚Äî And ≈øo all things will be adju≈øted and ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled for ever between them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> every one being ≈øentenced and recompen≈øed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works, either in receiving and wearing a crown of eternal joy and glory, or in ≈øuffering everla≈øting ≈øhame and pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:049067_0111_10264FCA710A94A8"/>I come now to the next thing propo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To give ≈øome rea≈øons why we may ≈øuppo≈øe God has ≈øo ordered it, that mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the people that have been under their care, ≈øhall meet together at the day of judgment, in ≈øuch a manner and for ≈øuch purpo≈øes.</p>
               <p>There are two things which I would now ob≈øerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The mutual concerns of mini≈øters and their people are of the greate≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>The Scripture declares, that God will bring every work into judgment, with every ≈øecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. It is fit that all the concerns, and all the behaviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, both public and private, ≈øhould be brought at la≈øt before God's tribunal, and finally determined by an infallible Judge<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> But it is e≈øpecially requi≈øite that it ≈øhould be thus, as to affairs of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Now the mutual concerns of a Chri≈øtian mini≈øter and his church and congregation, are of the va≈øte≈øt importance: in many re≈øpects<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of much greater moment than the temporal concerns of the greate≈øt earthly monarchs, and their kingdoms or empires. It is of va≈øt con≈øequence how mini≈øters di≈øcharge their office, and conduct them≈øelves towards their people in the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:049067_0112_10264FCCF458E8D0"/>
work of the mini≈øtry, and in affairs apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it. It is al≈øo a matter of va≈øt importance, how a people receive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a faithful mini≈øter of Chri≈øt, and what improvement they make of his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtry. The≈øe things have a more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and direct re≈øpect to the great and la≈øt end for which man was made, and the eternal welfare of mankind, than any of the temporal concerns of men, whether public or private. And therefore it is e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially fit that the≈øe affairs ≈øhould be brought into judgment, and openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and ≈øettled in truth and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eou≈øne≈øs; and that to this end, mini≈øters and their people ≈øhould meet together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the omni≈øcient and infallible Judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The mutual concerns of mini≈øters and their people have a ≈øpecial relation to the main things appertaining to the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>They have a ≈øpecial relation to that great and divine per≈øon who then will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as Judge. Mini≈øters are his me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ≈øent forth by him; and, in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and admini≈øtrations among their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, repre≈øent his per≈øon, ≈øtand in his ≈øtead, as tho≈øe that are ≈øent to declare his mind, to do his work, and to ≈øpeak and act in his name: And therefore it is e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit that they ≈øhould return to him to give an account of their work and ≈øucce≈øs. The king is judge of all his ≈øubjects, they
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:049067_0113_10264FCE79DDD3D8"/>
are all accountable to him: But it is more e≈øpecially requi≈øite that the king's mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who are e≈øpecially intru≈øted with the admini≈øtrations of his kingdom, and that are ≈øent forth on ≈øome ≈øpecial negociation, ≈øhould return to him, to give an account of them≈øelves, and their di≈øcharge of their tru≈øt, and the reception they have met with.</p>
               <p>Mini≈øters are not only me≈ø≈øengers of the per≈øon who at the la≈øt day will appear as Judge, but the errand they are ≈øent upon, and the affairs they have committed to them as his mini≈øters, do mo≈øt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern his honour, and the intere≈øt: of his kingdom: The work they are ≈øent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to promote the de≈øigns of his admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtration and government; and therefore their bu≈øine≈øs with their people has a near relation to the day of judgment<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for the great end of that day is completely to ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and e≈øtabli≈øh the affairs of his kingdom, to adju≈øt all things that pertain to it, that every thing that is oppo≈øite to the intere≈øts of his kingdom may be removed, and that every thing which contributes to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletene≈øs and glory of it may be perfected and confirmed, that this great King may receive his due honour and glory.</p>
               <p>Again, the mutual concerns of mini≈øters and their people have a direct relation to the concerns of the day of judgment, as the bu≈øine≈øs of mini≈øters with their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:049067_0114_10264FD10B8D32F8"/>
is to promote the eternal ≈øalvation of the ≈øouls of men, and their e≈øcape from eternal damnation; and the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the day appointed for that end, openly to decide and ≈øettle men's eternal ≈øtate, to fix ≈øome in a ≈øtate of eternal ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to bring their ≈øalvation to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt con≈øummation, and to fix others in a ≈øtate of everla≈øting damnation and mo≈øt perfect mi≈øery. The mutual concerns of mini≈øters and people have a mo≈øt direct relation to the day of judgment, as the very de≈øign of the work of the mini≈øtry is the people's preparation for that day: Mini≈øters are ≈øent to warn them of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that day, to forewarn them of the dreadful ≈øentence then to be pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the wicked, and declare to them the ble≈ø≈øed ≈øentence then to be pronounced on the righteous, and to u≈øe means with them that they may e≈øcape the wrath which is then to come on the ungodly, and obtain the reward then to be be≈øtowed on the ≈øaints.</p>
               <p>And as the mutual concerns of mini≈øters and their people have ≈øo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ear and direct a relation to that day, it is e≈øpecially fit that tho≈øe concerns ≈øhould be brought into that day, and there ≈øettled and i≈ø≈øued; and that in order to this, mini≈øters and their people ≈øhould meet and appear together before the great Judge at that day.</p>

               <p>The improvement I would make of the things which have been ob≈øerved, is to lead the people here pre≈øent, who have been under my pa≈øtoral care, to ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and give them ≈øome advice ≈øuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our pre≈øent circum≈øtances; relating to what has been lately done in order to our being ≈øeparated, as to the relation we have heretofore ≈øtood in one to another; but expecting to meet each other before the great tribunal at the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>The deep and ≈øerious con≈øideration of that our future mo≈øt ≈øolemn meeting, is certainly mo≈øt ≈øuitable at ≈øuch a time as this<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> there having ≈øo lately been that done, which, in all probability, will (as to the relation we have heretofore ≈øtood in) be followed with an everla≈øting ≈øeparation.</p>
               <p>How often have we met together in the hou≈øe of God in this relation? how often have I ≈øpoken to you, in≈øtructed, coun≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, warned, directed, and fed you, and admini≈øtered ordinances among you, as the people which were committed to my care, and who≈øe precious ≈øouls I had the charge of? but in all probability, this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be again.</p>
               <p>The prophet Jeremiah, (chap. xxxv.3.) puts the people in mind how long he had laboured among them in the work of the mini≈øtry: "From the thirteenth year of Jo≈øiah, the ≈øon of Amon, king of Judah,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:049067_0116_10264FD7707F6F90"/>
even unto this day (that is, the three and twentieth year) the word of the Lord came unto me, and I have ≈øpoken unto you, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing early and ≈øpeaking." I am not about to compare my≈øelf with the prophet Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah; but in this re≈øpect I can ≈øay as he did, that "I have ≈øpoken the word of God to you, unto the three and twentieth year, ri≈øing early and ≈øpeaking." It was three and twenty years, the 15th day of la≈øt Februray, ≈øince I have laboured in the work of the mini≈øtry, in the relation of a pa≈øtor to this church and congregation.‚Äî And though my ≈øtrength has been weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, having always laboured under great infirmity of body, be≈øides my in≈øufficiency for ≈øo great a charge in other re≈øpects, yet I have not ≈øpared my feeble ≈øtrength, but have exerted it for the good of your ≈øouls. I can appeal to you, as the apo≈øtle does to his hearers, Gal. iv.13. "Ye know how through infirmity of the fle≈øh, I preached the go≈øpel unto you." I have ≈øpent the prime of my life and ≈øtrength in labours for your eternal welfare. You are my witne≈ø≈øes, that what ≈øtrength I have had, I have not neglected in idlene≈øs, nor laid out in pro≈øecuting worldly ≈øchemes, and managing temporal affairs, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of my outward e≈øtate, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing my≈øelf and family; but have given my≈øelf to the work of the mini≈øtry, labouring in it night and day, ri≈øing early,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:049067_0117_10264FD8F77BB088"/>
and applying my≈øelf to this great bu≈øine≈øs to which Chri≈øt appointed me. I have found the work of the mini≈øtry among you to be a great work indeed, a work of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding care, labour, and difficulty: Many have been the heavy burdens that I have borne in it, which my ≈øtrength has been very unequal to. God called me to bear the≈øe burdens; and I ble≈øs his name, that he has ≈øo ≈øupported me as to keep me from ≈øinking under them, and that his power herein has been manife≈øted in my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; ≈øo that although I have often been troubled on every ≈øide, yet I have not been di≈øtre≈ø≈øed; perplexed, but not in de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; ca≈øt down, but not de≈øtroyed.</p>
               <p>But now I have rea≈øon to think my work is fini≈øhed which I had to do as your mini≈øter: You have publicly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and my opportunities cea≈øe.</p>
               <p>How highly, therefore, does it now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us, to con≈øider of that time when we mu≈øt meet one another before the chief Shepherd? When I mu≈øt give an account of my ≈øteward≈øhip, of the ≈øervice I have done for, and the reception and treatment I have had among the people he ≈øent me to: And you mu≈øt give an account of your own conduct towards me<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and the improvement you have made of the≈øe three and twenty years of my mini≈øtry. For then both you and I mu≈øt appear together, and we both mu≈øt give an account, in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der

to an infallible righteous and eternal ≈øentence to be pa≈ø≈øed upon us, by him who will judge us with re≈øpect to all that we have ≈øaid or done in our meetings here, all our conduct one towards another, in the hou≈øe of God and el≈øewhere, on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath days and on other days; who will try our hearts, and manife≈øt our thoughts, and the principles and frames of our minds, will judge us with re≈øpect to all the controver≈øies which have ≈øub≈øi≈øted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, with the ≈øtricte≈øt impartiality, and will examine our treatment of each other in tho≈øe controver≈øies: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing covered, that ≈øhall not be revealed, nor hid, which ≈øhall not be known; all will be examined in the ≈øearching pene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trating light of God's omni≈øcience and glory, and by him who≈øe eyes are as a flame of fire; and truth and right ≈øhall be made plainly to appear, being ≈øtripped of every veil; and all error, fal≈øehood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteou≈øne≈øs, and injury ≈øhall be laid open, ≈øtripped of every di≈øgui≈øe; every ≈øpecious pretence, every cavil, and all fal≈øe rea≈øoning, ≈øhall vani≈øh in a moment, as not being able to bear the light of that day.‚Äî And then our hearts will be turned in≈øide out, and the ≈øecrets of them will be made more plainly to appear than our outward actions do now. Then it ≈øhall appear what the ends are which we have aimed at, what have been the governing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:049067_0119_10264FDF24CA6178"/>
which we have acted from, and what have been the di≈øpo≈øitions we have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed in our eccle≈øia≈øtical di≈øputes and conte≈øts. Then it will appear, whether I acted uprightly, and from a truly con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious careful regard to my duty to my great Lord and Ma≈øter, in ≈øome former eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtical controver≈øies, which have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with exceeding unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances and con≈øequences: It will appear whether there was any ju≈øt cau≈øe for the re≈øentment which was manife≈øted on tho≈øe occa≈øions. And then our late grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øy, concerning the qualifications ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for admi≈ø≈øion to the privileges of members, in complete ≈øtanding, in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible church of Chri≈øt, will be examined and judged in all its parts and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, and the whole ≈øet forth in a clear, certain, and perfect light. Then it will appear whether the doctrine which I have preached and publi≈øhed concerning this matter be Chri≈øt's own doctrine, whether he will not own it as one of the precious truths which have proceeded from his own mouth, and vindicate and honour as ≈øuch before the whole univer≈øe. Then it will appear what is meant by "the man that comes without the wedding-garment;" for that is the day ≈øpoken of<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Matth. xxii.13. "wherein ≈øuch an one ≈øhall be bound hand and foot, and ca≈øt into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, where ≈øhall be weeping and gna≈øhing

of teeth." And then it will appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in declaring this doctrine, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to it, and in my general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the affair, I have been influenced from any regard to my own temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt, or honour, or de≈øire to appear wi≈øer than others; or have acted from any ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øter ≈øecular views what≈øoever; and wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what I have done has not been from a careful, ≈øtrict, and tender regard to the will of my Lord and Ma≈øter, and becau≈øe I dare not offend him, being ≈øatisfied what his will was, after a long, diligent, impartial, and prayerful inquiry; having this con≈øtantly in view and pro≈øpect, to engage me to great ≈øolicitude not ra≈øhly to determine truth to be on this ≈øide of the que≈øtion where I am now per≈øuaded it is, that ≈øuch a determination would not be for my temporal intere≈øt, but every way again≈øt it, bringing a long ≈øeries of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulties, and plunging me into an aby≈øs of trouble and ≈øorrow. And then it will appear whether my people have done their duty to their pa≈øtor with re≈øpect to this matter, whether they have ≈øhown a right temper and ≈øpirit on this occa≈øion; whether they have done me ju≈øtice in hearing, attending to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidering what I had to ≈øay in evidence of what I believed and taught as part of the coun≈øel of God<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> whether I have been treated with that impartiality, candour,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:049067_0121_10264FE3314D6DF0"/>
and regard which the ju≈øt judge e≈øteemed due; and whether, in the many ≈øteps which have been taken, and the many things that have been ≈øaid and done in the cour≈øe of this controver≈øy, righteou≈øne≈øs, and charity, and Chri≈øtian decorum has been maintained; or if otherwi≈øe, to how great a degree the≈øe things have been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Then every ≈øtep of the conduct of each of us in this affair, from fir≈øt to la≈øt, and the ≈øpirit we have exerci≈øed in all, ≈øhall be examined and manife≈øted, and our own con≈øciences will ≈øpeak plain and loud, and each of us ≈øhall be convinced, and the world ≈øhall know; and never ≈øhall there be any more mi≈øtake, mi≈ørepre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or mi≈øapprehen≈øion of the affair to eternity.</p>
               <p>This controver≈øy is now probably brought to an i≈ø≈øue between you and me as to this world; it has i≈ø≈øued in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the week before la≈øt: But it mu≈øt have another deci≈øion at that great day, which certainly will come, when you and I ≈øhall meet together before the great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-≈øeat: And therefore I leave it to that time, and ≈øhall ≈øay no more about it at pre≈øent.</p>
               <p>But I would now proceed to addre≈øs my≈øelf particular to ≈øeveral ≈øorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons.</p>

               <p>I have endeavoured, according to my be≈øt ability, to ≈øearch the word of God, with regard to the di≈øtingui≈øhing notes of true piety, tho≈øe by which per≈øons might be≈øt di≈øcover their ≈øtate, and mo≈øt ≈øurely and clearly judge of them≈øelves. And the≈øe rules and marks I have from time to time applied to you, in the preaching of the word, to the utmo≈øt of my ≈økill, and in the mo≈øt plain and ≈øearching manner that I have been able, in order to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the deceived hypocrite, and e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhing the hopes and comforts of the ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.

them as I leave in a Chri≈øtle≈øs, gracele≈øs condition; and would call on ≈øuch ≈øeriou≈øly to con≈øider of that ≈øolemn day when they and I mu≈øt meet before the Judge of the world.</p>
               <p>My parting with you is in ≈øome re≈øpects in a peculiar manner a melancholy part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in as much as I leave you in mo≈øt melancholy circum≈øtances; becau≈øe I leave you in the gall of bitterne≈øs and bond of iniquity, having the wrath of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on you, and remaining under condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to everla≈øting mi≈øery and de≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Seeing I mu≈øt leave you, it would have been a comfortable and happy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance of our parting, if I had left you in Chri≈øt, ≈øafe and ble≈ø≈øed in that ≈øure ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge and glorious re≈øt of the ≈øaints. But it is otherwi≈øe, I leave you far off, aliens and ≈øtrangers, wretched ≈øubjects, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ≈øin and Satan, and pri≈øoners of vindictive ju≈øtice; without Chri≈øt, and without God in the world.</p>
               <p>Your con≈øciences hear me witne≈øs, that while I had opportunity, I have not cea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to warn you, and ≈øet before you your danger. I have ≈øtudied to repre≈øent the mi≈øery and nece≈ø≈øity of your circum≈øtances in the cleare≈øt manner po≈ø≈øible. I have tried all ways that I could think of tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to awaken your con≈øciences, and make you ≈øen≈øible of the nece≈ø≈øity of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving your time, and being ≈øpeedy in
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:049067_0126_10264FF112C8C2F8"/>
dying from the wrath to come, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough in the u≈øe of means for your e≈øcape and ≈øafety, I have diligently endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find out and u≈øe the mo≈øt powerful motives to per≈øuade you to take care for your own welfare and ≈øalvation. I have not only endeavoured to awaken you, that you might be moved with fear, but I have u≈øed my utmo≈øt endeavours to win you: I have fought out acceptable words, that if po≈ø≈øible I might prevail upon you to for≈øake ≈øin, and turn to God, and accept of Chri≈øt as your Saviour and Lord. I have ≈øpent my ≈øtrength very much in the≈øe things. But yet, with regard to you whom I am now ≈øpeaking to, I have not been ≈øucce≈øsful: But have this day rea≈øon to complain in tho≈øe words, Jer. vi.29. "The bellows are burnt, the lead is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed of the fire, the founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not plucked away." It is to be feared that all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as to many of you, have ≈øerved to no other purpo≈øe but to harden you; and that the word which I have preached, in≈øtead of being a favour of life unto life<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> has been a favour of death unto death. Though I ≈øhall not have any account to give for the future of ≈øuch as have openly and re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely renounced my mini≈øtry, as of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øtment committed to me; yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you mu≈øt give account for your≈øelves, of your care of your own ≈øouls, and your
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:049067_0127_10264FF3D10963A0"/>
improvement of all means pa≈øt and future, through your whole lives. God only knows what will become of your poor peri≈øhing ≈øouls, what means you may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after enjoy, or what di≈øadvantages and temptations you may be under. May God in mercy grant, that however all pa≈øt means have been un≈øucce≈øsful, you may have future means which may have a new effect; and that the word of God, as it ≈øhall be hereafter di≈øpen≈øed to you, may prove as the fire and the hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces. However, let me now at parting exhort and be≈øeech you not wholly to forget the warnings you have had while under my mini≈øtry.‚Äî When you and I ≈øhall meet at the day of judgment, then you will remember them: The ≈øight of me your former mini≈øter, on that occa≈øion, will ≈øoon revive them in your memory; and that in a very affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. O do not let that be the fir≈øt time that they are ≈øo revived!</p>
               <p>You and I are now parting one from another as to this world; let us labour that we may not be parted after our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the la≈øt day. If I have been your faithful pa≈øtor, (which will that day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, whether I have or not) then I ≈øhall be acquitted, and ≈øhall a≈øcend with Chri≈øt. O do your part, that in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, it may not be ≈øo, that you ≈øhould be forced eternally to part from me, and all
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:049067_0128_10264FF55A76C7C0"/>
that have been faithful in Chri≈øt Je≈øus. This is a ≈øorrowful parting that now is between you and me; but that would be a more ≈øorrowful parting to you than this. This you may perhaps bear without being much affected with it, if you are not glad of it; but ≈øuch a parting in that day will mo≈øt deeply, ≈øen≈øibly, and dreadfully, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I would addre≈øs my≈øelf to tho≈øe who are under ≈øome awakenings.</p>
               <p>Ble≈ø≈øed be God that there are ≈øome ≈øuch, and that (although I have rea≈øon to fear I leave multitudes in this large congregation in a Chri≈øtle≈øs ≈øtate) yet I do not leave them all in total ≈øtupidity and carele≈ø≈øne≈øs about their ≈øouls. Some of you, that I have rea≈øon to hope are under ≈øome awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, have acquainted me with your circum≈øtances; which has a tendency to cau≈øe me, now I am leaving you, to take my leave of you with peculiar concern for you. What will be the i≈ø≈øue of your pre≈øent exerci≈øe of mind I know not: But it will be known at that day, when you and I ≈øhall meet before the judgment-≈øeat of Chri≈øt. Therefore now be much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of that day.</p>
               <p>Now I am parting with this flock, I would once more pre≈øs upon you the coun≈øels I have heretofore given, to take heed of being ≈ølighty in ≈øo great a concern, to be thorough and in good earne≈øt in the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:049067_0129_10264FF7DDEB2248"/>
affair, and to beware of back≈øliding, to hold on and hold out to the end. And cry mightily to God, that the≈øe great changes that pa≈øs over this church and congregation do not prove your overthrow<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> There is great temptations in them; and the devil will undoubtedly ≈øeek to make his advantage of them, if po≈ø≈øible, to cau≈øe your pre≈øent convictions and endeavours to be abortive. You had need to double your diligence, and watch and pray, le≈øt you be overcome by temptation.</p>
               <p>Whoever may hereafter ≈øtand related to you as your ≈øpiritual guide, my de≈øire and prayer is, that the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep would have a ≈øpecial re≈øpect to you, and be your guide, (for there is none teacheth like him,) and that he who is the infinite fountain of light, would "open your eyes, and turn you from darkne≈øs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that you may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øins, and inheritance among them that are ≈øanctified, through faith that is in Chri≈øt;" that ≈øo, in that great day, when I ≈øhall meet you again before your Judge and mine, we may meet in joyful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circum≈øtances, never to be ≈øeparated any more.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I would apply my≈øelf to the young people of the congregation.</p>
               <p>Since I have been ≈øettled in the work of the mini≈øtry in this place. I have ever
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:049067_0130_10264FFB9A3676E8"/>
had a perculiar concern for the ≈øouls of the young people, and a de≈øire that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might flouri≈øh among them; and have e≈øpecially exerted my≈øelf in order to it; becau≈øe I knew the ≈øpecial opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they have beyond others, and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily tho≈øe whom God intended mercy for were brought to fear and love him in their youth. And it has ever appeared to me a peculiarly amiable thing, to ≈øee young people walking in the ways of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Chri≈øtian piety, having their hearts purified and ≈øweetened with a principle of divine love. And it has appeared a thing exceeding beautiful, and what would be much to the adorning and happine≈øs of the town, if the young people could be per≈øuaded, when they meet together, to conver≈øe as Chri≈øtians, and as the children of God; avoiding impurity, levity, and extravagance; keeping ≈øtrictly to rules of virtue, and conver≈øing together of the things of God, and Chri≈øt, and heaven.‚Äî This is what I have longed for: And it has been exceeding grievous to me when I have heard of vice, vanity, and di≈øorder among our youth. And ≈øo far as I know my heart, it was from hence that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly led this church to ≈øome mea≈øures, for the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing vice among our young people, which gave ≈øo great offence, and by which I became ≈øo obnoxious. I have fought the good and not the hurt of our
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:049067_0131_10264FFD618CB308"/>
young people. I have de≈øired their true≈øt honour and happine≈øs, and not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; knowing that true virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion tended not only to the glory and felicity of young people in another world, but their greate≈øt peace and pro≈øperity, and highe≈øt dignity and honour, in this world; and above all things to ≈øweeten, and render plea≈øant and delightful, even the days of youth.</p>
               <p>But whether I have loved you, and ≈øought your good more or le≈øs, yet God in his providence, now calling me to part with you, committing your ≈øouls to him who once committed the pa≈øtoral care of them to me, nothing remains, but only (as I am now taking my leave of you) earne≈øtly to be≈øeech you, from love to your≈øelves, if you have none to me, not to de≈øpi≈øe and forget the warnings and coun≈øels I have ≈øo often given you; remembering the day when you and I mo≈øt meet again before the great Judge of quick and dead; when it will appear whether the things I have taught you were true, whether the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels I have given you were good, and whether I truly ≈øought your good, and whether you have well improved my endeavours.</p>
               <p>I have, from time to time, earne≈øtly warned you again≈øt frolicking (as it is called,) and ≈øome other liberties common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken by young people in the land.‚Äî
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:049067_0132_10265000E45CD680"/>
And whatever ≈øome may ≈øay in ju≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øuch liberties and cu≈øtoms, and may laugh at warnings again≈øt them, I now leave you my parting te≈øtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt ≈øuch things; not doubting but God will approve and confirm it in that day when we ≈øhall meet before them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I would apply my≈øelf to the children of the congregation, the lambs of this flock, who have been ≈øo long under my care.</p>
               <p>I have ju≈øt now ≈øaid that I have had a peculiar concern for the young people; and in ≈øo ≈øaying, I did not intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude you. You are in youth, and in the mo≈øt early youth: And therefore I have been ≈øen≈øible, that if tho≈øe that were young had a precious opportunity for their ≈øoul's good, you who are very young, had, in many re≈øpects, a peculiarly precious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. And accordingly I have not neglected you: I have endeavoured to do the part of a faithful ≈øhepherd, in feeding the lambs as well as the ≈øheep. Chri≈øt did once commit the care of your ≈øouls to me as your mini≈øter; and you know, dear children, how I have in≈øtructed you, and warned you from time to time: You know how I have often called you together for that end; and ≈øome of you, ≈øometimes, have ≈øeemed to be affected with what I have ≈øaid to you. But I am afraid it has had no ≈øaving effect as to many of you;
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:049067_0133_102650036A88BF88"/>
but that you remain ≈øtill in an unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, without any real ≈øaving work wrought in your ≈øouls, convincing you thoroughly of your ≈øin and mi≈øery, cau≈øing you to ≈øee the great evil of ≈øin, and to mourn for it, and hate it above all things; and giving you a ≈øen≈øe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with all your hearts to cleave to him as your Saviour, weaning your hearts from the world, and cau≈øing you to love God above all, and to delight in holine≈øs more than in all the plea≈øant things of this earth: And ≈øo that I now leave you in a mi≈øerable condition, having no intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, and ≈øo under the awful di≈øplea≈øure and anger of God, and in danger of going down to the pit of eternal mi≈øery.</p>
               <p>But now I mu≈øt bid you farewell: I mu≈øt leave you in the hands of God: I can do no more for you than to pray for you. Only I de≈øire you not to forget, but often think of the coun≈øels and warnings I have given you, and the endeavours I have u≈øed, that your ≈øouls might be ≈øaved from everla≈øting de≈øtruction.</p>
               <p>Dear children, I leave you in an evil world, that is full of ≈ønares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. God only knows what will become of you. This the Scripture has told us, that there are but few ≈øaved; and we have abundant confirmation of it from what we ≈øee. This we ≈øee, that children die as
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:049067_0134_10265004F215F1F8"/>
well as others: Multitudes die before they grow up; and of tho≈øe that grow up, comparatively few ever give good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ≈øaving conver≈øion to God. I pray God to pity you, and take care of you, and provide for you the be≈øt means for the good of your ≈øouls; and that God him≈øelf would undertake for you, to be your heavenly Father, and the mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of your immortal ≈øouls. Do not neglect to pray for your≈øelves: Take heed you be not of the number of tho≈øe who ca≈øt off fear, and re≈øtrain prayer before God. Con≈øtantly pray to God in ≈øecret; and often remember that great day when you mu≈øt appear before the judgment-≈øeat of Chri≈øt, and meet your mini≈øter there, who has ≈øo often coun≈øelled and warned you.</p>
               <p>I conclude with a few words of advice to all in general, in ≈øome particulars, which are of great importance in order to the future welfare and pro≈øperity of this church and congregation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One thing that greatly concerns you, as you would be an happy people, is the maintaining of family order.</p>
               <p>We have had great di≈øputes how the church ought to be regulated; and indeed the ≈øubject of the≈øe di≈øputes was of great importance: But the due regulation of your families is of no le≈øs, and, in ≈øome re≈øpects, of much greater importance.‚Äî
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:049067_0135_10265008B67DE7C8"/>
Every Chri≈øtian family ought to be as it were a little church, con≈øecrated to Chri≈øt, and wholly influenced and governed by his rules. And family education and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are ≈øome of the chief of the means of grace. If the≈øe fail, all other means are like to prove ineffectual. If the≈øe are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained, all the means of grace will be like to pro≈øper and be ≈øucce≈øsful.</p>
               <p>Let me now therefore, once more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I finally cea≈øe to ≈øpeak to this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, repeat, and earne≈øtly pre≈øs the coun≈øel which I have often urged on heads of families here, while I was their pa≈øtor, to great painfulne≈øs, in teaching, warning, and directing their children; bringing them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord; beginning early, where there is yet opportunity, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a con≈øtant diligence in labours of this kind<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Remembering that, as you would not have all your in≈øtructions and coun≈øels ineffectual, there mu≈øt be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as in≈øtructions, which mu≈øt be maintained with an even hand, and ≈øteady re≈øolution, as a guard to the religion and morals of the family, and the ≈øupport of its good order. Take heed that it be not with any of you as it was with Eli of old, who reproved his children, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained them not; and that, by this means, you do not bring the like cur≈øe on your families as he did on his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:049067_0136_1026500B46FB5A80"/>And let children obey their parents, and yield to their in≈øtructions, and ≈øubmit to their orders, as they would inherit a ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing and not a cur≈øe. For we have rea≈øon to think, from many things in the word of God, that nothing has a greater tendency to bring a cur≈øe on per≈øons in this world, and on all their temporal concerns, than an undutiful, un≈øubmi≈ø≈øive, di≈øorderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in children towards their parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As you would ≈øeek the future pro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of this ≈øociety, it is of va≈øt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that you ≈øhould avoid contention.</p>
               <p>A contentious people will be a mi≈øerable people. The contentions which have been among you, ≈øince I fir≈øt became your pa≈øtor, have been one of the greate≈øt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens I have laboured under in the cour≈øe of my mini≈øtry: Not only the contentions you have had with me, but tho≈øe which you have had one with another, about your lands, and other concerns. Becau≈øe I knew that contention, heat of ≈øpirit, evil-≈øpeaking, and things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were directly contrary to the ≈øpirit of Chri≈øtianity, and did, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, tend to drive away God's Spirit from a people, and to render all means of grace ineffectual, as well as to de≈øtroy a people's outward comfort and welfare.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore earne≈øtly exhort you, as you would ≈øeek your own future good, hereafter to watch again≈øt a contentious
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:049067_0137_1026500CCCAFC998"/>
≈øpirit. "If you would ≈øee good days, ≈øeek peace, and en≈øue it." 1 Pet. iii.10.11. Let the contentions which has lately been about the terms of Chri≈øtian communion, as it has been the greate≈øt of your conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øo be the la≈øt of them. I would, now I am preaching my farewell ≈øermon, ≈øay to you, as the apo≈øtle to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. xiii.11.: "Finally, brethren, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Be perfect: Be of one mind: Live in peace; and the God of love and peace ≈øhall be with you."</p>
               <p>And here I would particularly advi≈øe tho≈øe that have adhered to me in the late controver≈øy, to watch over their ≈øpirits, and avoid all bitterne≈øs towards others.‚Äî Your temptations are, in ≈øome re≈øpects, the greate≈øt; becau≈øe what has been lately done is grievous to you. But however wrong you may think others have done, maintain, with great diligence and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs, a Chri≈øtian meekne≈øs and ≈øedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øpirit; and labour, in this re≈øpect, to excel others who are of the contrary part. And this will be the be≈øt victory: For "he that rules his ≈øpirit, is better than he that takes a city." Therefore let nothing be done through ≈øtrife or vain-glory. Indulge no revengeful ≈øpirit in any wi≈øe; but watch and pray again≈øt it: and, by all means in your power, ≈øeek the pro≈øperity of this town: And never think you behave your≈øelves as becomes Chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:049067_0138_1026500F4CF3FAA0"/>
but when you ≈øincerely, ≈øen≈øibly, and fervently love all men, of whatever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or opinion, and whether friendly or unkind, ju≈øt or injurious, to you or your friends, or to the cau≈øe and kingdom of Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another thing that va≈øtly concerns the future pro≈øperity of the town, is, that you ≈øhould watch again≈øt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of error; and particularly Armin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iani≈øm, and doctrines of like tendency.</p>
               <p>You were, many of you, as I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, much alarmed with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øions of the danger of the prevailing of the≈øe corrupt principles, near ≈øixteen years ago. But the danger then was ≈ømall in compari≈øon of what appears now. The≈øe doctrines at this day are much more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than they were then: The progre≈øs they have made in the land, within this ≈øeven years, ≈øeems to have been va≈øtly greater than at any time in the like ≈øpace before: And they are ≈øtill prevailing and creeping into almo≈øt all parts of the land, threatening the utter ruin of the credit of tho≈øe doctrines which are the peculiar glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the go≈øpel, and the intere≈øts of vital piety. And I have of late perceived ≈øome things among your≈øelves, that ≈øhew that you are far from being out of danger, but on the contrary remarkably expo≈øed. The older people may perhaps think them≈øelves ≈øufficiently fortified again≈øt infection<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:049067_0139_10265012C8801620"/>
But it is fit that all ≈øhould beware of ≈øelf confidence and carnal ≈øecurity, and ≈øhould remember tho≈øe needful warnings of ≈øacred writ, "Be not high minded, but fear; and let him that ≈øtands, take heed le≈øt he fall." But let the ca≈øe of the older people be as it will, the ri≈øing generation are doubtle≈øs greatly expo≈øed. The≈øe principles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding taking with corrupt nature, and are what young people, at lea≈øt ≈øuch as have not their hearts e≈øtabli≈øhed with grace, are ea≈øily led away with.</p>
               <p>And if the≈øe principles ≈øhould greatly prevail in this town, as they very lately have done in another large town I could name, formerly greatly noted for religion, and ≈øo for a long time, it will threaten the ≈øpiritual and eternal ruin of this people, in the pre≈øent and future generations. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have need of the greate≈øt and mo≈øt diligent care and watchfulne≈øs with re≈øpect to this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another thing which I would advi≈øe to, that you may hereafter be a pro≈øperous people, is, that you would give your≈øelves much to prayer.</p>
               <p>God is the fountain of all be≈ø≈øing and pro≈øperity, and he will be ≈øought to for his ble≈ø≈øing. I would therefore advi≈øe you not only to be con≈øtant in ≈øecret and family prayer, and in the public wor≈øhip of God in his hou≈øe, but al≈øo often to a≈ø≈øemble your≈øelves in private praying ≈øocieties. I

would advi≈øe all ≈øuch as are grieved for the afflictions of Jo≈øeph, and ≈øen≈øibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the calamities of this town, of whatever opinon they be with relation to the ≈øubject of our late controver≈øy, often to meet together for prayer, and to cry to God for his mercy to them≈øelves, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to this town, and mercy to Zion and the people of God in general through the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The la≈øt article of advice I would give (which doubtle≈øs does greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your pro≈øperity) is, that you would take great care with regard to the ≈øettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mini≈øter, to ≈øee to it who, or what manner of per≈øon he is that you ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and particularly in the≈øe two re≈øpects.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That he be a man of thoroughly ≈øound principles, in the ≈øcheme of doctrine which he maintains.</p>
               <p>This you will ≈øtand in the greate≈øt need of, e≈øpecially at ≈øuch a day of corruption as this is. And in order to obtain ≈øuch a one, you had need to exerci≈øe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care and prudence.‚ÄîI know the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I know the manner of many young gentlemen of corrupt principles, their ways of concealing them≈øelves, the fair ≈øpecious di≈øgui≈øes they are wont to put on, by which they deceive others, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own credit, and get them≈øelves into others confidence and improvement, and ≈øecure and e≈øtabli≈øh their own intere≈øt,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:049067_0141_10263A6D95F0A748"/>
until they ≈øee a convenient opportunity to begin more openly to broach and propagate their corrupt tenets.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Labour to obtain a man who has an e≈øtabli≈øhed character, as a per≈øon of ≈øerious religion and fervent piety.</p>
               <p>It is of va≈øt importance that tho≈øe who are ≈øettled in this work ≈øhould be men of true piety, at all times, and in all places; but more e≈øpecially at ≈øome times, and in ≈øome towns and churches. And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent time, which is a time wherein reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in danger, by ≈øo many corruptions in doctrine and practice, is in a peculiar manner a day wherein ≈øuch mini≈øters are nece≈ø≈øary. Nothing el≈øe but ≈øincere piety of heart is at all to be depended on, at ≈øuch a time as this, as a ≈øecurity to a young man, ju≈øt coming into the world, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing infection, or thoroughly to engage him in proper and ≈øucce≈øsful endeavours to with≈øtand and oppo≈øe the torrent of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and prejudice, again≈øt the high my≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious evangelical doctrines of the religion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and their genuine effects in true experimental religion. And this place is a place that does peculiarly need ≈øuch a mini≈øter, for rea≈øons obvious to all.</p>
               <p>If you ≈øhould happen to ≈øettle a mini≈øter who knows nothing truly of Chri≈øt, and the way of ≈øalvation by him, nothing experimentally of the nature of vital reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; alas, how will you be expo≈øed as ≈øheep without a ≈øhepherd! Here is need of one in this place, who ≈øhall be eminently fit to ≈øtand in the gap, and make up the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:049067_0142_102650197A636EF8"/>
hedge, and who ≈øhall be as the chariots of I≈ørael, and the hor≈øemen thereof. You need one that ≈øhall ≈øtand as a champion in the cau≈øe of truth and the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs.</p>
               <p>Having briefly mentioned the≈øe important articles of advice, nothing remains, but that I now take my leave of you, and bid you all, farewell; wi≈øhing and praying for your be≈øt pro≈øperity. I would now commend your immortal ≈øouls to him, who formerly committed them to me, expecting the day, when I mu≈øt meet you again before him, who is the Judge of quick and dead. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire that I may never forget this people, who have been ≈øo long my ≈øpecial charge, and that I may never cea≈øe fervently to pray for your pro≈øperity. May God ble≈øs you with a faithful pa≈øtor, one that is well acquainted with his mind and will, thoroughly warning ≈øinners, wi≈øely and ≈økilfully ≈øearching profe≈ø≈øors, and conducting you in the way to eternal ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs. May you have truly a burning and ≈øhining light ≈øet up in this candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick; and may you, not only for a ≈øea≈øon, but during his whole life, and that a long life, be willing to rejoice in his light.</p>
               <p>And let me be remembered in the prayers of all God's people that are of a calm ≈øpirit, and are peaceable and faithful in I≈ørael, of whatever opinion they may be with re≈øpect to terms of church communion.</p>
               <p>And let us all remember, and never forget our future ≈øolemn meeting on that great day of the Lord; the day of infallible deci≈øion and of the everla≈øting and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ≈øentence. Amen.</p>
