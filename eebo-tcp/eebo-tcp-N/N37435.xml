            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE main ſubject of the doctrinal part of this epiſtle, is the free grace of God in the ſalvation of men by Jeſus Chriſt; eſpecially as it appears in the doctrine of juſtification by faith alone. And the more clearly to evince this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and ſhew the reaſon of it, the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in the firſt place, eſtabliſhes that point, that no fleſh living can be juſtified by the deeds of the law. And to prove it, he is very large and particular in ſhewing, that all mankind, not only Gentiles but Jews, are under ſin, and ſo under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law; which is what he inſiſts upon from the beginning of the epiſtle to this place. He firſt begins with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and in the firſt chapter ſhews that they are under ſin, by ſetting forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding corruptions and horrid wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that overſpread the Gentile world: And then through the ſecond chapter, and the former part of this third chapter, to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:049067_0003_10264EBA17A204B0"/>
the text and following verſe, he ſhews the ſame of the Jews, that they alſo are in the ſame circumſtances with the Gentiles in this regard. They had an high thought of themſelves, becauſe they were God's cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant people, and circumciſed, and the children of Abraham. They deſpiſed the Gentiles as polluted, condemned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; but looked on themſelves, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their external privileges, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emonial and moral righteouſneſs, as a pure and holy people, and the children of God; as the apoſtle obſerves in the ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It was therefore ſtrange doctrine to them, that they alſo were unclean and guilty in God's ſight, and under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and curſe of the law. The apoſtle does therefore, on account of their ſtrong prejudices againſt ſuch doctrine, the more particularly inſiſt upon it, and ſhews that they are no better than the Gentiles; as in the 9th verſe of this chapter, "What then? are we better than they? "No, in no wiſe? for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ſin." And, to convince them of it, he then produces certain paſſages out of their own law, or the Old Teſtament, (whoſe authority they pretended a great regard to) from the 9th verſe to the verſe wherein is our text. And it may be obſerved, that the apoſtle, <hi>Firſt,</hi> cites certain paſſages to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:049067_0004_10264EBFD4F9E368"/>
prove that mankind are all corrupt, in the 10th, 11th, and 12th, verſes; "As it is written. There is none righteous, no not one: There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one." <hi>Secondly,</hi> The paſſages he cites next, are to prove, that not only all are corrupt, but each one wholly corrupt, as it were all over unclean, from the crown of his head to the ſoles of his feet; and therefore ſeveral particular parts of the body are mentioned, as the throat, the tongue, the lips, the mouth, the feet, verſes, 13.14.15.: "Their throat is an open ſepulchre: with their tongues they have uſed deceit; the poiſon of aſps is under their lips; whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſs: Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood." And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He quotes other paſſages to ſhew, that each one is not only all over corrupt, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt to a deſperate degree, in the 16th, 17th, and 18th verſes; in which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding degree of their corruption is ſhewn, Both by affirming and denying: By affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively expreſſing the moſt pernicious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency of their wickedneſs, in the 16th verſe: "Deſtruction and miſery are in their ways." And ther by denying all good or godlineſs of them, in the 17th
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:049067_0005_10264EC15D048B08"/>
and 18th verſes, "And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes." And then, leſt the Jews ſhould think theſe paſſages of their law do not concern them, and that only the Gentiles are intended in them, the apoſtle ſhews in the verſe of the text, not only that they are not exempt, but that they eſpecially muſt be underſtood: "Now we know that whatſoever things the law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the law." By thoſe that are under the law is meant the Jews; and the Gentiles by thoſe that are without law; as appears by the 18th verſe of the preceding chapter. There is ſpecial reaſon to underſtand the law, as ſpeaking to and of them, to whom it was immediately given. And therefore the Jews would be unreaſonable in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting themſelves. And if we examine the places of the Old Teſtament whence theſe paſſages are taken, we ſhall ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſpecial reſpect is had to the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people of that nation, in every one of them. So that the law ſhuts all up in univerſal and deſperate wickedneſs, <hi>that every mouth may be ſtopp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d;</hi> the mouths of the Jews, as well as of the Gentiles, notwithſtanding all thoſe privileges by which they were diſtinguiſhed from the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:049067_0006_10264EC32658A680"/>The things that the law ſays, are ſufficient to ſtop the mouths of all mankind, in two reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſtop them from boaſting of their righteouſneſs, as the Jews were wont to do; as the apoſtle obſerves in the 23d verſe of the preceding chapter.—That the apoſtle has reſpect to ſtopping their mouths in this reſpect, appears by the 27th verſe of the context, "Where is boaſting then? It is excluded." The law ſtops our mouths from making of any plea for life, or the favour of God, or any poſitive good, from our own righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſtop them from making any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for ourſelves or objection againſt the execution of the ſentence of the law, or the infliction of the puniſhment that it threatens. That this is intended, appears by the words immediately following, "That all the world may become guilty before God." That is, that they may appear to be guilty, and ſtand convicted before God, and juſtly liable to the condemnation of his law, as guilty of death, according to the Jewiſh way of ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>And thus the apoſtle proves, that no fleſh can be juſtified in God's ſight by the deeds of the law; as he draws the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the following verſe; and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the way for the eſtabliſhing of the great doctrine of juſtification by faith alone,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:049067_0007_10264EC716AC4A70"/>
which he proceeds to do in the next verſe to that, and in the following part of the chapter, and of the epiſtle.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>"It is juſt with God eternally to caſt off and deſtroy ſinners."</p>
               <p>—For this is the puniſhment which the law condemns to; which the things that the law ſays, may well ſtop every mouth from all manner of objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
               <p>The truth of this doctrine may appear by the joint conſideration of two things, viz. Man's ſinfulneſs, and God's ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It appears from the conſideration of man's ſinfulneſs. And that whether we conſider the infinitely evil nature of all ſin, or how much ſin men are guilty of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider the infinite evil and heinouſneſs of ſin in general, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in God to inflict what puniſhment is deſerved; becauſe the very notion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving any puniſhment is, that it may be juſtly inflicted: A deſerved puniſhment and a juſt puniſhment are the ſame thing. To ſay that one deſerves ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet to ſay that he does not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerve it, is a contradiction; and if he juſtly deſerves it; then it may be juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:049067_0008_10264EC9F8D06348"/>Every crime or fault deſerves a greater or leſſer puniſhment, in proportion as the crime itſelf is greater or leſs. If any fault deſerves puniſhment, then ſo much the greater the fault, ſo much the greater is the puniſhment deſerved. The faulty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any thing is the formal ground and reaſon of its deſert of puniſhment; and therefore the more any thing hath of this nature, the more puniſhment it deſerves. And therefore the terribleneſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puniſhment, let it be never ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, is no argument againſt the juſtice of it, if the proportion does but hold between the heinouſneſs of the crime and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the puniſhment; ſo that if there be any ſuch thing as a fault infinitely heinous, it will follow that it is juſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a puniſhment for it that is infinitely dreadful.</p>
               <p>A crime is more or leſs heinous, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we are under greater or leſſer obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the contrary. This is ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; becauſe it is herein that the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalneſs or faultineſs of any thing conſiſts, that it is contrary to what we are obliged or bound to, or what ought to be in us. So the faultineſs of one being's hating another, is in proportion to his obligation to love him. The crime of one being's deſpiſing and caſting contempt on another, is proportionably more or leſs heinous, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:049067_0009_10264ECB83E8D6D8"/>
he was under greater or leſſer obligations to honour him. The fault of diſobeying another, is greater or leſs, as any one is under greater or leſſer obligations to obey him. And therefore if there be any being that we are under infinite obligations to love, and honour, and obey, the contrary towards him muſt be infinitely faulty.</p>
               <p>Our obligation to love, honour, and obey any being, is in proportion to his lovelineſs, honourableneſs, and authority; for that is the very meaning of the words. When we ſay any one is very lovely, it is the ſame as to ſay, that he is one very much to be loved: Or if we ſay, ſuch a one is more honourable than another, the meaning of the words is, that he is one that we are more obliged to honour. If we ſay any one has great authority over us, it is the ſame as to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he has great right to our ſubjection and obedience.</p>
               <p>But God is a being infinitely lovely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath infinite excellency and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To have infinite excellency and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the ſame thing as to have infinite lovelineſs. He is a Being of infinite great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, majeſty and glory; and therefore is infinitely honourable. He is infinitely exalted above the greateſt potentates of the earth, and higheſt angels in heaven; and therefore is infinitely more honourable than they. His authority over us is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:049067_0010_10264ECE0A395710"/>
and the ground of his right to our obedience is infinitely ſtrong; for he is infinitely worthy to be obeyed in himſelf, and we have an abſolute, univerſal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dependence upon him.</p>
               <p>So that ſin againſt God, being a violation of infinite obligations, muſt be a crime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely heinous, and ſo deſerving of infinite puniſhment.—Nothing is more agreeable to the common ſenſe of mankind, than that ſins committed againſt any one, muſt be proportionably heinous to the dignity of the being offended and abuſed; as it is alſo agreeable to the word of God, 1 Sam. ii.25. "If one man ſin againſt another, the judge ſhall judge him;" (i. e. ſhall judge him, and inflict a finite puniſhment, ſuch as finite judges can inflict;) "but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him?" This was the aggravation of ſin that made Joſeph afraid of it, Gen. xxxix.9. "How ſhall I commit this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?" This was the aggravation of David's ſin, in compariſon of which he eſteemed all others as nothing, becauſe they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely exceeded by it. Pſalm li.4. "Againſt thee, thee only, have I ſinned." —The eternity of the puniſhment of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men renders it infinite; and it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it no more than infinite; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore renders no more than proportionable
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:049067_0011_10264ED296E1E130"/>
to the heinouſneſs of what they are guilty of.</p>
               <p>If there be any evil or faultineſs in ſin againſt God, there is certainly infinite evil: For if it be any fault at all, it has an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite aggravation, viz. that it is againſt an infinite object. If it be ever ſo ſmall upon other accounts, yet if it be any thing, it has one infinite dimenſion; and ſo is an infinite evil. Which may be illuſtrated by this: If we ſuppoſe a thing to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite length, but no breadth and thickneſs, but to be only a mere mathematical line, it is nothing: But if it have any breadth and thickneſs at all, though never ſo ſmall, yet if it have but one infinite dimenſion, viz. that of length, the quantity of it is infinite; it exceeds the quantity of any thing, however broad, thick and long, wherein theſe dimenſions are all finite.</p>
               <p>So that the objections that are made againſt the infinite puniſhment of ſin, from the neceſſity, or rather previous cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the futurition of ſin, ariſing from the decree of God, or unavoidable origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al corruption of nature, if they argue any thing, do not argue againſt the infiniteneſs of the degree of the faultineſs of ſin direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and no otherwiſe than they argue againſt any faultineſs at all: For if this neceſſity or certainty leaves any evil at all in ſin, that fault muſt be infinite by reaſon of the infinite object.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:049067_0012_10264ED51C889C78"/>But every ſuch objector as would argue from hence, that there is no fault at all in ſin, confutes himſelf, and ſhews his own inſincerity in his objection. For at the ſame time that he objects, that men's acts are neceſſary, from God's decrees, and original ſin, and that this kind of neceſſity is inconſiſtent with faultineſs in the act, his own practice ſhews that he does not believe what he objects to be true: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe why does he at all blame men? Or why are ſuch perſons at all diſpleaſed with men, for abuſive, injurious and ungrateful acts towards them? Whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, by this they ſhew that indeed they do believe that there is no neceſſity in men's acts, from divine decrees, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, that is inconſiſtent with blame. And if their objection be this, That this previous certainty is by God's own ordering, and that where God orders an antecedent certainty of acts, he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all the fault from the actor on himſelf; their practice ſhews, that at the ſame time they do not believe this, but fully believe the contrary: For when they are abuſed by men, they are diſpleaſed with men, and not with God only.</p>
               <p>The light of nature teaches all mankind, that when an injury is voluntary, it is faulty, without any manner of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what there might be previouſly to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:049067_0013_10264ED79FA07750"/>
determine the futurition of that evil act of the will. And it really teaches this as much to thoſe that object and cavil moſt as to others; as their univerſal practice ſhews. By which it appears, that ſuch objections are inſincere and perverſe. Men will mention others corrupt nature in their own caſe, or when they are injured, as a thing that aggravates their crime, and that wherein their faultineſs partly conſiſts. How common is it for perſons, when they look on themſelves greatly injured by another, to inveigh againſt him, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his baſeneſs, by ſaying, "He is a man of a moſt perverſe ſpirit: He is nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally of a ſelfiſh, niggardly or proud and haughty temper: He is one of a baſe and vile diſpoſition." And yet men's natural corrupt diſpoſitions are mentioned as an excuſe for them, with reſpect to their ſins againſt God, and as if they rendered them blameleſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is juſt with God eternally to caſt off wicked men, may more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, if we conſider how much ſin they are guilty of. From what has been already ſaid, it appears, that if men were guilty of ſin but in one particular, that is ſufficient ground of their eternal rejection and condemnation: If they are ſinners, that is enough: Merely this might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to keep them from ever lifting up
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:049067_0014_10264EDA2293F590"/>
their heads, and cauſe them to ſmite on their breaſts, with the publican that cried "God be merciful to me a ſinner." But ſinful men are not only thus, but they are full of ſin; full of principles of ſin, and full of acts of ſin: Their guilt is like great mountains, heaped one upon another, till the pile is grown up to heaven. They are totally corrupt, in every part, in all their faculties; and all the principles of their nature, their underſtandings, and wills; and in all their diſpoſitions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, their heads, their hearts, are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally depraved; all the members of their bodies are only inſtruments of ſin; and all their ſenſes, ſeeing, healing, taſting, &amp;c. are only inlets and outlets of ſin, channels of corruption. There is nothing but ſin, no good at all. Rom. vii.18. "In me, that is in my fleſh, dwells no good thing." There is all manner of wickedneſs. There are the ſeeds of the greateſt and blackeſt crimes. There are principles of all ſorts of wickedneſs againſt men; and there is all wickedneſs againſt God. There is pride; there is enmity; there is contempt; there is quarrelling; there is Atheiſm; there is blaſphemy. There are theſe things in exceeding ſtrength; the heart is under the power of them, is ſold under ſin, and is a perfect ſlave to it. There is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs, hardneſs greater than that of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:049067_0015_10264EDCA2EA27F8"/>
a rock, or an adamant ſtone. There is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and perverſeneſs, incorrigibleneſs and inflexibleneſs in ſin, that will not be overcome by threatenings or promiſes, by awakenings or encouragements, by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or mercies, neither by that which is terrifying, nor that which is winning: The very blood of God will not win the heart of a wicked man.</p>
               <p>And there is actual wickedneſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number or meaſure. There are breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of every command, in thought, word and deed; a life full of ſin; days and nights filled up with ſin; mercies abuſed, and frowns deſpiſed; mercy and juſtice, and all the divine perfections, trampled on; and the honour of each perſon in the Trinity trod in the dirt. Now if one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word or thought has ſo much evil in it, as to deſerve eternal deſtruction, how do they deſerve to be eternally caſt off and deſtroyed, that are guilty of ſo much ſin!</p>
               <p n="2">II. If with man's ſinfulneſs, we conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er God's ſovereignty, it may ſerve further to clear God's juſtice in the eternal rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and condemnation of ſinners, from men's cavils and objections. I ſhall not now pretend to determine preciſely, what things are, and what things are not, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acts and exerciſes of God's holy ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty; but only, that God's ſovereignty extends to the following things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:049067_0016_10264EDF25C60370"/>1. That ſuch is God's ſovereign power and right, that he is originally under no obligation to keep men from ſinning; but may in his providence permit and leave them to ſin. He was not obliged to keep either angels or men from falling. It is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould be obliged, if he makes a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of knowing his will, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a law from him, and being ſubject to his moral government, at the ſame time to make it impoſſible for him to ſin, or break his law. For if God be obliged to this, it deſtroys all uſe of any commands, laws, promiſes or threatenings, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notion of any moral government of God over thoſe reaſonable creatures. For to what purpoſe would it be, for God to give ſuch and ſuch laws, and declare his holy will to a creature, and annex promiſes and threatenings to move him to his duty, and make him careful to perform it, if the creature at the ſame time has this to think of, that God is obliged to make it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to break his laws? How can God's threatenings move to care or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, when, at the ſame time, God is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged to render it impoſſible that he ſhould be expoſed to the threatenings? Or, to what purpoſe is it for God to give a law at all? For according to this ſuppoſition, it is God, and not the creature, that is under
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:049067_0017_10264EE0AC7A4E88"/>
law. It is the lawgivers care, and not the ſubjects, to ſee that his law is obeyed; and this care is what the lawgiver is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to. If God be obliged never to permit a creature to fall, there is an end of all divine laws, or government, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God over the creature; there can be no manner of uſe of theſe things.</p>
               <p>God may permit ſin, though the being of ſin will certainly enſue on that permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And ſo, by permiſſion, he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and order the event. If there were any ſuch thing as chance, or mere contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the very notion of it did not carry a groſs abſurdity, (as might eaſily be ſhown that it does), it would have been very unfit, that God ſhould have left it to mere chance, whether man ſhould fall or no. For chance, if there ſhould be any ſuch thing, is undeſigning and blind. And certainly it is more fit that an event of ſo great importance, and that is attended with ſuch an infinite train of great conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould be diſpoſed and ordered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom, than that it ſhould be left to blind chance.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that God need not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to render it impoſſible for man to ſin, and yet not leave it to mere contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or blind chance neither; but might have left it with man's free will, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether to ſin or no: I anſwer, if
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:049067_0018_10264EE42CC8FF10"/>
God did leave it to man's free will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſort of diſpoſal, or ordering in the caſe, whence it ſhould be previouſly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain how that free will ſhould determine, then ſtill that firſt determination of the will muſt be merely contingent or by chance. It could not have any antecedent act of the will to determine it; for I ſpeak now of the very firſt act or motion of the will, reſpecting the affair that may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the prime ground and higheſt ſource of the event. To ſuppoſe this to be determined by a foregoing act is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. God's diſpoſing this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will by his permiſſion, does not at all infringe the liberty of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is in no reſpect any more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with liberty, than mere chance or contingence. For if the determination of the will be from blind, undeſigning chance, it is no more from the agent himſelf, or from the will itſelf, than if we ſuppoſe, in the eaſe, a wiſe, divine diſpoſal by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was fit that it ſhould be at the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the divine wiſdom, and good pleaſure, whether every particular man ſhould ſtand for himſelf, or whether the firſt father of mankind ſhould be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the moral and federal head and rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentative of the reſt. If God has not Liberty in this matter to determine either
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:049067_0019_10264EE6B2998978"/>
of theſe two as he pleaſes, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe determining that the firſt father of men ſhould repreſent the reſt, and not that every one ſhould ſtand for himſelf, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to mankind. For if it be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to mankind, how is it unjuſt? But it is not injurious to mankind; for there is nothing in the nature of the caſe itſelf, that makes it better for mankind that each man ſhould ſtand for himſelf, than that all ſhould be repreſented by their common father; as the leaſt reflection or conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation will convince any one. And if there be nothing in the nature of the thing that makes the former better for mankind than the latter, then it will follow, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are not hurt in God's chooſing and appointing the latter, rather than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; or, which is the ſame thing, that it is not injurious to mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When men are fallen, and become ſinful, God by his ſovereignty has a right to determine about their redemption as he pleaſes. He has a right to determine whether he will redeem any or no. He might, if he had pleaſed, have left all to periſh, or might have redeemed all. Or, he may redeem ſome, and leave others; and if he doth ſo, he may take whom he pleaſes, and leave whom he pleaſes. To ſuppoſe that all have forfeited his favour, and deſerved to periſh, and to ſuppoſe that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:049067_0020_10264EE83A9FACD8"/>
he may not leave any one individual of them to periſh, implies a contradiction; becauſe it ſuppoſes that ſuch an one has a claim to God's favour, and is not juſtly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to periſh; which is contrary to the ſuppoſition.</p>
               <p>It is meet that God ſhould order all theſe things according to his own pleaſure. By reaſon of his greatneſs and glory, by which he is infinitely above all, he is worthy to be ſovereign, and that his pleaſure ſhould in all things take place: He is worthy that he ſhould make himſelf his end, and that he ſhould make nothing but his own wiſdom his rule in purſuing that end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſking leave or counſel of any, and without giving any account of any of his matters. It is fit that he that is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect, and infinitely wiſe, and the fountain of all wiſdom, ſhould determine every thing by his own will, even things of the greateſt importance, ſuch as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſalvation or damnation of ſinners. It is meet that he ſhould be thus ſovereign, becauſe he is the firſt being, the eternal being, whence all other beings are. He is the creator of all things; and all are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and univerſally dependent on him; and therefore it is meet that he ſhould act as the ſovereign poſſeſſor of heaven and earth.</p>

               <p>In the improvement of this doctrine, I would firſt direct myſelf to ſinners that are afraid of damnation, in a uſe of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This may be matter of conviction to you, that it would be juſt and righteous with God eternally to reject and deſtroy you. This is what you are in danger of: You that are a Chriſtleſs ſinner, are a poor condemned creature: God's wrath ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides upon you; and the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation lies upon you: You are in God's hands, and it is uncertain what he will do with you. You are afraid what will become of you: You are afraid that it will be your portion to ſuffer eternal burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and your fears are not without grounds; you have reaſon to tremble eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment. But let you be never ſo much afraid of it, let eternal damnation be nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo dreadful, yet it is juſt: God may nevertheleſs do it, and be righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and holy, and glorious in it. Though eternal damnation be what you cannot bear, and how much ſoever your heart ſhrinks at the thoughts of it, yet God's juſtice may be glorious in it. The dreadfulneſs of the thing on your part, and the greatneſs of your dread of it, do not render it the leſs righteous on God's part. If you think otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a ſign that you do not ſee yourſelf, that you are not ſenſible what ſin is, nor how much
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:049067_0022_10264EEE4371AB08"/>
of it you have been guilty of. Therefore, for your conviction, be directed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To look over your paſt life: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at the mouth of conſcience, and hear what that has to teſtify concerning it. Conſider what you are, what light you have had, and what means you have lived under: And yet how have you behaved yourſelf! What have thoſe many days and nights, that you have lived, been filled up with? How have thoſe years, that have rolled over your heads, one after another, been ſpent? What has the ſun ſhone upon you for, from day to day, while you have improved his light to ſerve Satan by it? What has God kept your breath in your noſtrils for, and given you meat and drink, from day to day for, that you have ſpent that life and ſtrength that have been, ſupported by them, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing God, and rebellion againſt him?</p>
               <p>How many ſorts of wickedneſs have you been guilty of? How manifold have been the abominations of your life? What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs and contempt of God has been exerciſed by you? How little regard have you had to the Scriptures, to the word preached, to Sabbaths and ſacraments? How profanely have you talked, many of you, about thoſe things that are holy? After what manner have many of you kept God's holy day, not regarding the holineſs

of the time, not caring what you thought of in it? Yea, you have not only ſpent the time in worldly, vain, and unprofitable thoughts, but in immoral thoughts; pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelf with the reflection on paſt acts of wickedneſs, and in contriving new acts. Have not you ſpent much holy time in gratifying your luſts in your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yea, not only holy time, but the very time of God's public worſhip, when you have appeared in God's more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate preſence? How have you not only not attended to the worſhip, but have in the mean time been feaſting your luſts, and wallowing yourſelf in abominable unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? How many Sabbaths have you ſpent, one after another, in a moſt wretched man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Some of you not only in worldly and wicked thoughts, but alſo a very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed outward behaviour! When you on Sabbath days have got along with your wicked companions, how has holy time been treated among you! What kind of converſation has there been! Yea, how have ſome of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a very indecent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, openly diſhonoured and caſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on the ſacred ſervices of God's houſe, and holy day!

And it is well if you have not mocked them behind their backs; and, like the accurſed Ham and Canaan, derid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your parents nakedneſs inſtead of cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering it, and hiding your eyes from it. Have not ſome of you often diſobeyed your parents, yea, and refuſed to be ſubject to them?

Such has been your inordinate love of the world, and care about the things of it, that it has taken up your heart; you have allowed no room for God and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; you have minded the world more than your eternal ſalvation.

And how have you corrupted others, as well as polluted yourſelves! What vile uncleanneſs have you practiſed in company! What abominations have you been guilty of in the dark! Such as the apoſtle doubtleſs had reſpect to in Eph. v. 12. "For it is a ſhame even to ſpeak of thoſe things that are done of them in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret." Some of you have corrupted others, and done what in you lay to undo their ſouls, (if you have not actually done it); and by your vile practices and examples have made room for Satan, and invited his preſence, and eſtabliſhed his intereſt, in the town where you have lived.</p>
               <p>What lying have ſome of you been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, eſpecially in your childhood! And
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:049067_0028_10264EFDAE45C3A0"/>
have not your heart and lips often diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed ſince you came to riper years? What fraud, and deceit, and unfaithfulneſs, have many of you practiſed in your dealings with your neighbours that your own heart is conſcious to, if you have not have been noted for it by others!</p>
               <p>And how have ſome of you behaved yourſelves in your family relations! How have you neglected your children's ſouls! And not only ſo, but have corrupted their minds by your bad examples; and inſtead of training them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord, have rather brought them up in the devil's ſervice!</p>
               <p>How have ſome of you attended that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ordinance of the Lord's ſupper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of ſerious preparation, and in a careleſs flighty frame of ſpirits, and chiefly to comply with cuſtom! Have you not ventured to put the ſacred ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of the body and blood of Chriſt into your mouth, while at the ſame time you lived in ways of known ſins, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other than ſtill to go on in the ſame wicked practices? And, it may be, have ſat at the Lord's table with rancour in your heart againſt ſome of your brethren that you have ſat there with. You have come even to that holy feaſt of love among God's children, with the leaven of malice and envy in your heart; and ſo have eat and drank judgment to yourſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:049067_0029_10264EFF3490E4D8"/>What ſtupidity and ſottiſhneſs has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended your courſe of wickedneſs; which has appeared in your obſtinacy under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening diſpenſations of God's word and providence. And how have ſome of you backſlidden after you have ſet out in religion, and quenched God's Spirit after he had been ſtriving with you! And what unſteadineſs, and ſlothfulneſs, and great miſimprovement of God's ſtrivings with you, have you been chargeable with, that have long been the ſubject of them!</p>
               <p>Now, can you think when you have thus behaved yourſelf, that God is obliged to ſhew you mercy? Are you not after all this aſhamed to talk of its being hard with God to caſt you off? Does it become one that has lived ſuch a life to open his mouth to excuſe himſelf, or object againſt God's juſtice in his condemnation, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it as hard in God not to give him converting and pardoning grace, and make him his child, and beſtow on him eternal life! Or to talk of his duties and great pains in religion, and ſuch like things, as if ſuch performances were worthy to be accepted, and to draw God's heart to ſuch a creature! If this has been your manner, does it not ſhew how little you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered yourſelf, and how little a ſenſe you have had of your own ſinfulneſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be directed to conſider, if God
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:049067_0030_10264F02B2198FC0"/>
ſhould eternally reject and deſtroy you, what an agreeableneſs and exact mutual an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerableneſs there would be between God's ſo dealing with you, and your ſpirit and behaviour. There would not only be an equality, but a ſimilitude. God declares, that his dealings with men ſhall be ſuitable to their diſpoſition and practice. Pſalm xviii.25.26. "With the merciful man, thou wilt ſhew thyſelf mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; With an upright man, thou wilt ſhew thyſelf upright: With the pure, thou wilt ſhew thyſelf pure; and with the froward, thou wilt ſhew thyſelf froward." How much ſoever you dread damnation, and are affrighted and concerned at the thoughts of it; yet if God ſhould indeed eternally damn you, you would but be met with in your own way; you would be dealt with exactly according to your own dealing; God would but meaſure to you in the ſame meaſure in which you mete. Surely it is but fair that you ſhould be made to buy in the ſame meaſure in which you ſell.</p>
               <p>Here I would particularly ſhew, 1. That if God ſhould eternally deſtroy you, it would be agreeable to your treatment of God. 2. That it would be agreeable to your treatment of Jeſus Chriſt. 3. That it would be agreeable to your behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your neighbours. 4. That it would be
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:049067_0031_10264F05375E9750"/>
according to your own fooliſh behaviour towards yourſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">I. If God ſhould for ever caſt you off, it would be exactly agreeable to your treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. That you may be ſenſible of this, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You never have exerciſed the leaſt degree of love to God; and therefore it would be agreeable to your treatment of him if he ſhould never expreſs any love to you. When God converts and ſaves a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is a wonderful and unſpeakable manifeſtation of divine love. When a poor loſt ſoul is brought home to Chriſt, and has all his ſins forgiven him, and is made a child of God, it will take up a whole eternity to expreſs and declare the greatneſs of that love. And why ſhould God be obliged to expreſs ſuch wonderful love to you, who never exerciſed the leaſt degree of love to him in all your life? You never have loved God, who is infinitely glorious and lovely; and why then is God under obligation to love you, who are all over deformed and loathſome as a filthy worm, or rather a hateful viper? You have no benevolence in your heart towards God; you never rejoiced in God's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if he had been miſerable, and that had been poſſible, you would have liked it as well as if he were happy; you would not have cared how miſerable he was, nor
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:049067_0032_10264F07B89E2BD0"/>
mourned for it, any more than you now do for the devil's being miſerable: And why then ſhould God be looked upon as obliged to take ſo much care for your happineſs, as to do ſuch great things for it, as he doth for thoſe that are ſaved? Or why ſhould God be called hard, in caſe he ſhould not be careful to ſave you from miſery? You care not what becomes of God's glory; you are not diſtreſſed how much ſoever his honour ſeems to ſuffer in the world: And why ſhould God care any more for your welfare? Has it not been ſo, that if you could but promote your private intereſt, and gratify your own luſts, you cared not how much the glory of God ſuffered? And why may not God advance his own glory in the ruin of your welfare, not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much your intereſt ſuffers by it? You never ſo much as ſtirred one ſtep, ſincerely making the glory of God your end, or acting from real reſpect to him: And why then is it hard if God do nor do ſuch great things for you, as the changing your nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> raiſing you from ſpiritual death to life, conquering the powers of darkneſs for you, tranſlating you out of the kingdom of darkneſs into the kingdom of his dear ſon, delivering you from eternal miſery, and beſtowing eternal glory upon you? You do not uſe to be willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yourſelf for God; you never cared to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:049067_0033_10264F0945443888"/>
put yourſelf out of your way for Chriſt: Whenever any thing croſs or difficult came in your way, that the glory of God was concerned in, it has been your manner to ſhun it, and excuſe yourſelf from it: You did not care to hurt yourſelf for Chriſt, that you did not ſee worthy of it: And why then muſt it be looked upon as ſuch a hard and cruel thing, if Chriſt had not been pleaſed to ſpill his blood and be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to death for ſuch a ſinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have ſlighted and made light of God; and why then may not God juſtly ſlight you? When ſinners are ſenſible in ſome meaſure of their miſery, they are ready to think it hard that God will take no more notice of them; that he will ſee them in ſuch a lamentable, diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, beholding their burthens and tears, and ſeem to ſlight it, and manifeſt no pity to them. Their ſouls they think are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: It would be a dreadful thing if they ſhould periſh, and burn in hell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. They do not ſee through it, that God ſhould make ſo light of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But then, ought they not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that as their ſouls are precious, ſo is God's honour precious? The honour of the infinite God, the great King of heaven and earth, is a thing of as great importance, (and ſurely may juſtly be ſo eſteemed by God) as the happineſs of you, a poor little
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:049067_0034_10264F0BC8A30770"/>
worm. But yet you have ſlighted that honour of God, and valued it no more than the dirt under your feet. You have been told that ſuch and ſuch things were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the will of an holy God, and againſt his honour; but you cared not for that. God called upon you, and exhorted you to be more tender of his honour; but you went on without regarding him. Thus have you ſlighted God! And yet, is it hard that God ſhould ſlight you? Are you more honourable than God, that he muſt be obliged to make much of you, how light ſoever you make of him and his glory?</p>
               <p>And you have not only ſlighted God in time paſt, but you ſlight him ſtill. You indeed now make a pretence and ſhew of honouring him in your prayers, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on other external duties, and by a ſober countenance, and ſeeming devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your words and behaviour; but it is all mere diſſembling. That downcaſt look and ſeeming reverence, is not from any honour you have to God in your heart, though you would have it go ſo, and would have God take it ſo. You that have not believed in Chriſt, have not the leaſt jot of honour to God; that ſhew of it is merely forced, and what you are driven to by fear, like thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Pſalm lxvi.3. "Through the greatneſs of thy power ſhall thine enemies ſubmit themſelves to thee." In the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:049067_0035_10264F0F5E855EA8"/>
it is, "ſhall lie unto thee;" that is, yield feigned ſubmiſſion, and diſſemble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honour to thee. There is a rod held over you that makes you ſeem to pay ſuch reſpect to God. This religion and devotion, even the very appearance of it, would ſoon be gone, and all vaniſh away, if that were removed. Sometimes it may be you weep in your prayers, and in your hearing ſermons, and hope God will take notice of it, and take it for ſome honour; but he ſees it to be all hypocriſy. You weep for yourſelf; you are afraid of hell; and do you think that that is worthy that God ſhould take much notice of you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you can cry when you are in danger of being damned: when at the ſame time you indeed care nothing for God's hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>Seeing you thus diſregard ſo great a God, is it a heinous thing for God to flight you, a little, wretched, deſpicable creature; a worm, a mere nothing, and leſs than noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a vile inſect, that has riſen up in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt the Majeſty of heaven and earth?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why ſhould God be looked upon as obliged to beſtow ſalvation upon you, when you have been ſo ungrateful for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he has beſtowed upon you already? God has tried you with a great deal of kindneſs, and he never has ſincerely been
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:049067_0036_10264F11E55432B8"/>
thanked by you for any of it. God has watched over you, and preſerved you, and provided for you, and followed you with mercy all your days; and yet you have continued ſinning againſt him. He has given you food and raiment, but you have improved both in the ſervice of ſin. He has preſerved you while you ſlept; but when you aroſe, it was to return to the old trade of ſinning, God, notwithſtanding this ingratitude, has ſtill continued his mercy; but his kindneſs has never won your heart, or brought you to a more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful behaviour towards him. It may be you have received many remarkable mercies, recoveries from ſickneſs, or preſervations of your life, when at one time and anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expoſed by accidents, when if you had died, you would have gone directly to hell: But you never had any true thankfulneſs for any of theſe mercies. God has kept you out of hell, and continued your day of grace, and the offers of ſalvation, this ſo long a time; and that, it may be, while you did not regard your own ſalvation ſo much as to go in ſecret and aſk God for it: And now God has greatly added to his mercy to you, by giving you the ſtrivings of his Spirit, whereby you have a moſt precious opportunity for your ſalvation in your hands. But what thanks has God received for it? What kind of returns have you made for all this kindneſs? As God has
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:049067_0037_10264F146A4D6820"/>
multiplied mercies, ſo have you multiplied provocations.</p>
               <p>And yet now are you ready to quarrel for mercy, and to find fault with God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he does not beſtow more mercy, but to contend with him, becauſe he does not beſtow infinite mercy upon you, heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with all it contains, and even himſelf, for your eternal portion. What ideas have you of yourſelf, that you think God is obliged to do ſo much for you, though you treat him never ſo ungratefully for his kindneſs that you have been followed with all the days of your life?</p>
               <p n="4">4. You have voluntarily choſen to be with Satan in his enmity and oppoſition to God; how juſtly therefore might you be with him in his puniſhment? You did not chooſe to be on God's ſide, but rather choſe to ſide with the devil, and have obſtinately continued in it, againſt God's often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed calls and counſels. You have choſen rather to hearken to Satan than to God, and would be with him in his work: You have given yourſelf up to him, to be ſubject to his power and government, in oppoſition to God. How juſtly therefore may God alſo give you up to him, and leave you in his power, to accompliſh your ruin? Seeing you have yielded yourſelf to his will, to do as he would have you, ſurely God may leave you in his hands to execute his will upon you If men will be with God's enemy, and on
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:049067_0038_10264F15F61C91D0"/>
his ſide, why is God obliged to redeem them out of his hands, when they have done his work? Doubtleſs you would be glad to ſerve the devil, and be God's enemy while you live, and then to have God year friend, and to deliver you from the devil, when you come to die. But will God be unjuſt if he deals otherwiſe by you? No ſurely! It will be altogether and perfectly juſt, that you ſhould have your portion with him with whom you have choſen your work; and that you ſhould be in his poſſeſſion to whoſe dominion you have yielded yourſelf; and if you cry to God for deliverance, he may moſt juſtly give you that anſwer, Judges x.14. "Go to the gods which ye have choſen."</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider how often you have refuſed to hear God's calls to you, and how juſt it would therefore be, if he ſhould refuſe to hear you when you call upon him. You are ready, it may be, to complain that you have often prayed, and earneſtly begged of God to ſhew you mercy, and yet have no anſwer of prayer: One ſays, I have been conſtant in prayer for ſo many years, and God has not heard me. Another ſays, I have done what I can; I have prayed as earneſtly as I am able; I do not ſee how I can do more; and it will ſeem hard if after all I am denied. But do you conſider how often God has called, and you have denied him? God has called earneſtly and for a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:049067_0039_10264F197431FBF8"/>
long time; he has called, and called again in his word and in his providence, and you have refuſed. You was not uneaſy for fear you ſhould not ſhow regard enough to his calls. You let him call as loud, and as long as he would; for your part, you had no leiſure to attend to what he ſaid; you had other buſineſs to mind; you had theſe and thoſe luſts to gratify and pleaſe, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns to attend; you could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to ſtand conſidering of what God had to ſay to you. When the miniſters of Chriſt that he ſent on that errand, have ſtood and pleaded with you, in his name, Sabbath after Sabbath, and have even ſpent their ſtrength in it, how little was you moved by it! It did not alter you, but you went on ſtill as you uſed to do; when you went away, you returned again to your ſins, to your laſciviouſneſs, to your vain mirth, to your covetouſneſs, to your intemperance, and that has been the language of your heart and practice. Exod. v.2. "Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice?" Was it no crime for you to refuſe to hear when God called; and yet is it now very hard that God does not hear your earneſt calls, and that though your calling on God be not from any reſpect to him, but merely from ſelf-love? The devil would beg as earneſtly as you, if he had any hope to get ſalvation by it, and a thouſand times as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and yet be as much of a devil as he
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:049067_0040_10264F1BF50695C0"/>
is now. Are your calls more worthy to be heard than God's? Or is God more oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to regard what you ſay to him, than you to regard his commands, counſels, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to you? What can have more juſtice in it than that, in Prov. i.24, &amp;c. "Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I will alſo laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you. Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me."</p>
               <p n="6">6. Have you not taken encouragement to ſin againſt God, on that very preſumption, that God would ſhow you mercy when you fought it? And may not God juſtly refuſe you that mercy that you have ſo preſumed upon? That has been what you have flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered yourſelf with, and that which has made you bold to diſobey God, viz. that though you did ſo, yet God would ſhew you mercy when you cried earneſtly to him for it: How righteous therefore would it be in God, to diſappoint ſuch a wicked preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It was upon that very hope that you dared to affront the Majeſty of heaven ſo dreadfully as you have done; and can you
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:049067_0041_10264F1D80080E80"/>
now be ſo ſottiſh as to think that God is obliged not to fruſtrate that hope?</p>
               <p>When a ſinner takes encouragement to neglect that ſecret prayer that God has commanded, and to gratify his luſts, and to live a carnal, vain life, and thwart God, and run upon him, and contemn him to his face, thinking with himſelf, "If I do ſo, God would not damn me; he is a merciful God, and therefore when I ſeek his mercy he will beſtow it upon me;" muſt God be accounted hard becauſe he will not do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch a ſinner's preſumption? Cannot he be excuſed from ſhowing ſuch a ſinner mercy when he is pleaſed to ſeek it, without incurring the charge of being unjuſt? If this be the caſe, God has no liberty to vindicate his own honour and majeſty; but muſt lay himſelf open to all manner of affronts, and yield himſelf up to the abuſes of vile men, and lot them diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, deſpiſe, and diſhonour him as much as they will; and when they have done, his mercy and pardoning grace muſt not be in his own power and at his own diſpoſal, but he muſt be obliged to diſpenſe it at their call: He muſt take theſe bold and vile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of his majeſty, when it ſuits them to aſk it, and muſt forgive all their ſins, and not only ſo, but muſt adopt them into his family, and make them his children, and beſtow eternal glory upon them. What mean, low, and ſtrange thoughts have ſuch men of God, as think thus of him?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:049067_0042_10264F20094BF970"/>Conſider that you have injured God the more, and have been the worſe enemy to him, for his being a merciful God. So have you treated that attribute of God's mercy! How juſt is it therefore that you never ſhould have any benefit of that attribute!</p>
               <p>There is ſomething peculiarly heinous in ſinning againſt the mercy of God more than other attributes. There is ſuch baſe and horrid, ingratitude, in being the worſe to God, becauſe he is a being of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grace, that it above all things ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wickedneſs vile and deteſtable. This ought to win us, and engage us to ſerve God better; but inſtead of that, to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him the more, has ſomething inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly bad in it, and does in a peculiar manner enhance guilt, and incenſe wrath; as ſeems to be intimated in Rom. ii.4.5. "Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forbearance, and long ſuffering; not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up unto thyſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God."</p>
               <p>The greater the mercy of God is, the more ſhould you be engaged to love him, and live to his glory. But it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe with you; the conſideration of the mercies of God being ſo exceeding great, is the thing wherewith you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:049067_0043_10264F238800FB10"/>
yourſelf in ſin. You have heard that the mercy of God was without bounds, that it was ſufficient to pardon the greateſt ſinner, and you have upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ventured to be a very great ſinner. Though it was very offenſive to God, though you heard that God infinitely hated ſin, and that ſuch practices as you went on in were exceeding contrary to his nature, will, and glory, yet that did not make you uneaſy; you heard that he was a very merciful God, and had grace enough to pardon you, and ſo cared not how offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive your ſins were to him. How long have ſome of you gone on in ſin, and what great ſins have ſome of you been guilty of, on that preſumption! Your own conſcience can give teſtimony to it, that this has made you refuſe God's calls, and has made you regardleſs of his repeated commands. Now how righteous would it be if God ſhould ſwear in his wrath, that you ſhould never be the better for his being infinitely merciful!</p>
               <p>Your ingratitude has been the greater, that you have not only abuſed the attribute of God's mercy, taking encouragement from it to continue in ſin, but you have thus abuſed this mercy, under that very notion of its being exerciſed towards you, in a ſuppoſition that God would exerciſe infinite mercy to you in particular; which conſideration ſhould have eſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared God to you. You have taken en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:049067_0044_10264F2510BF4310"/>
to ſin the more, from that conſideration, that Chriſt came into the world and died to ſave ſinners; that thanks has Chriſt had from you, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ſuch a tormenting death for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies! Now, how juſtly might it be ſo, that God ſhould refuſe that you ſhould ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be the better for his Son's laying down his life! It was becauſe of theſe things that you put off ſeeking ſalvation: You would take the pleaſures of ſin ſtill longer, hardening yourſelf with that, that mercy was infinite, and it would not be too late, if you ſought it afterwards; now, how juſtly may God diſappoint you in this, and order it ſo that it ſhall be too late!</p>
               <p n="7">7. How have ſome of you riſen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and in the frame of your minds oppoſed him in his ſovereign diſpenſations! And how juſtly upon that account might God oppoſe you, and ſet himſelf againſt you! You never yet would ſubmit to God; never could willingly comply with it, that God ſhould have dominion over the world, and that he ſhould govern it for his own glory, according to his own wiſdom. You, a poor worm, a potſherd, a broken piece of an earthen veſſel, have dared to find fault and quarrel with God. Iſaiah, .xlv.9. "Wo to him that ſtrives with his mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Let the potſherd ſtrive with the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherds of the earth: Shall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, What makeſt thou?"
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:049067_0045_10264F279928C7D8"/>
But yet you have ventured to do it. Rom. ix.20. Who art thou, O man, that replieſt againſt God?" But yet you have thought you was big enough; you have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to call God to an account, why he does thus and thus; you have ſaid to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, What doſt thou?</p>
               <p>If you have been reſtrained by fear from openly venting your oppoſition and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart againſt God's government, yet it has been in you; you have not been quiet in the frame of your mind; you have had the heart of a viper within, and have been ready to ſpit venom at God: And it is well if ſometimes you have not actually done it, by tolerating blaſphemous thoughts and malignant riſings of heart againſt him; yea, and the frame of your heart in ſome meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure appeared in an impatient and fretful behaviour.</p>
               <p>Now, ſeeing you have thus oppoſed God, how juſt is it that God ſhould oppoſe you? Or is it becauſe you are ſo much better, and ſo much greater than God, that it is a crime for God to make that oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you that you do againſt him? Do you think you ought to appropriate the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of making oppoſition to yourſelf as being your prerogative, ſo that you may be an enemy to God, but God muſt by no means be an enemy to you, but muſt be looked upon under obligation nevertheleſs to help you, and ſave you by his blood, and beſtow his beſt bleſſings upon you?</p>

God's exerciſing his infinite grace towards your neighbours, has put you into an ill frame, and it may be, ſet you into a mere tumult of mind: How juſtly therefore may God refuſe ever to exerciſe that mercy towards you! Have you not thus oppoſed God's ſhewing mercy to others, even at the very time when you pretended to be earneſt with God for pity and help for yourſelf? Yea, and while you was endeavouring to get ſomething wherewith to recommend yourſelf to God? And will you look to God ſtill with a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of mercy, and contend with him for it notwithſtanding?

                  </gap> Jeſus Chriſt. It would have been juſt with God if he had caſt you off forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without ever making you the offer of a Saviour. But God hath not done that; but has provided a Saviour for ſinners, and offered him to you, even his own Son Jeſus Chriſt, who is the only Saviour of men: All that be not forever caſt off are ſaved by him: God offers men ſalvation through him, and has promiſed us, that if
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:049067_0047_10264F2DCB390430"/>
we come to him, we ſhall not be caſt off. But you have treated, and ſtill treat this Saviour after ſuch a manner, that if you ſhould be eternally caſt off by God, it would be moſt agreeable to your behaviour towards him; which appears by this, viz.</p>
               <p>"That you reject Chriſt, and will not have him for your Saviour."</p>
               <p>If God offers you a Saviour from deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed puniſhment, and you will not receive him, then ſurely it is juſt that you ſhould go without a Saviour. Or is God obliged, becauſe you do not like this Saviour, to provide you another? If, when he has given an infinitely honourable and glorious perſon, even his only begotten Son, to be a ſacrifice for ſin, in the fire of his wrath, and ſo provided ſalvation, and this Saviour is offered to you, you be not ſuited in him, and refuſe to accept of him, is God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unjuſt if he does not ſave you? Is he obliged to ſave you in a way of your own chooſing, becauſe you do not like the way of his chooſing? Or will you charge Chriſt with injuſtice becauſe he does not become your Saviour, when at the ſame time you will not have him when he offers himſelf to you, and beſeeches you to accept of him as your Saviour?</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible that by this time many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ready to open their mouths in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt this. If all ſhould ſpeak what they now think, we ſhould hear a murmuring all over the meetinghouſe, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:049067_0048_10264F305131EAA0"/>
one and another would ſay, "I cannot ſee how this can be, that I be not willing that Chriſt ſhould be my Saviour, when I would give all the world that he was my Saviour: How is it poſſible that I ſhould not be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have Chriſt for my Saviour, when this is what I am ſeeking after, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and ſtriving for, as for my life?"</p>
               <p>Here therefore I would endeavour to convince you, that you are under a groſs miſtake in this matter. And, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> I would endeavour to ſhew the weakneſs of the grounds of your miſtake. And 2<hi>dly,</hi> To demonſtrate to you, that you have rejected, and do wilfully reject Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you may ſee the weakneſs of the grounds of your miſtake, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> There is a great deal of difference between a willingneſs not to be damned, and a being willing to receive Chriſt for your Saviour. You have the former; there is no doubt to be made of that: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ſuppoſes that you love miſery ſo well as to chooſe an eternity of it; and ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you are willing to be ſaved from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery. But that is a very different thing from being willing to come to Chriſt: Perſons very commonly miſtake the one for the other, but they are quite two things. You may love the deliverance, but hate the deliverer. You tell of a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs; but conſider what is the object of that willingneſs: It does not reſpect
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:049067_0049_10264F31D8EF77F8"/>
Chriſt; the way of ſalvation by him is not at all the object of it; but it is wholly terminated on your eſcape from miſery. The inclination of your will goes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſelf, it never reaches Chriſt. You are willing not to be miſerable; that is, you love yourſelf, and there your will and choice terminate. And it is but a vain pretence and deluſion to ſay or think, that you are willing to accept of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d,</hi> There is certainly a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a forced compliance and a free willingneſs. Force and freedom cannot conſiſt together. Now that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs that you tell of, whereby you think you are willing to have Chriſt for a Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour, is merely a forced thing. Your heart does not go out after Chriſt of itſelf, but you are forced and driven to ſeek an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him. Chriſt has no ſhare at all in your heart; there is no manner of cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart with him. This forced compliance is not what Chriſt ſeeks of you; he ſeeks a free and willing accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Pſalm cx.3. "Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power." He ſeeks not that you ſhould receive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your will, but with a free will. He ſeeks entertainment in your heart and choice.—And,</p>
               <p>If you refuſe thus to receive Chriſt, how juſt is it that Chriſt ſhould refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you? How reaſonable are Chriſt's
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:049067_0050_10264F345C6B2D50"/>
terms, who offers to ſave all thoſe that willingly, or with a good will, accept of him for their Saviour! Who can ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expect that Chriſt ſhould force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon any man to be his Saviour? Or what can be looked for more reaſonable, than that all that would be ſaved by Chriſt, ſhould heartily and freely entertain him? And ſurely it would be very diſhonourable for Chriſt to offer himſelf upon lower terms.</p>
               <p>But I would now proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhew that it is really ſo, that you are not willing to have Chriſt for a Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour. To convince you of it, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> How is it poſſible that you ſhould be willing to accept of Chriſt as a Saviour from the deſert of a puniſhment that you are not ſenſible you have deſerved. If you are truly willing to accept of Chriſt as a Saviour, it muſt be as a ſacrifice to make atonement for your guilt: Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world on this errand, to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an atonement, to anſwer for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of puniſhment. But how is it poſſible that you ſhould be willing to accept of Chriſt as an atonement for that guilt that you be not ſenſible that you have? How can you be willing to have Chriſt for a Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour from a deſert of hell? If you have not really deſerved everlaſting burnings in hell, then the very offer of an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſuch a deſert is an impoſition up-you on. If you have no ſuch guilt upon
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:049067_0051_10264F37DBC35878"/>
you, then the very offer of a ſatisfaction for that guilt is an injury, becauſe it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in it a charge of guilt that you are free from. Now therefore it is impoſſible that a man that is not convinced of his guilt can be willing to accept of an offer; becauſe he cannot be willing to accept the charge that the offer implies: That he looks upon as injurious. A man that is not convinced that he has deſerved ſo dreadful a puniſhment, cannot willingly ſubmit to be charged with it: If he thinks he is willing, it is but a mere forced, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed buſineſs; becauſe in his heart he looks upon himſelf greatly injured; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot freely accept of Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion of a Saviour from that guilt, and from the deſert of ſuch a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; for ſuch an acceptance is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit owning that he does deſerve ſuch a puniſhment.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay, but that men may be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſaved from an undeſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they may rather not ſuffer it than ſuffer it: But a man cannot be willing to accept one at God's hands, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Saviour from puniſhment deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, that he thinks he has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is impoſſible that any one ſhould freely allow a Saviour under that notion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such an one cannot like the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt; For if he thinks he has not deſerved hell, then he will think that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:049067_0052_10264F3A5C98DCA0"/>
from hell is a debt; and therefore cannot willingly and heartily receive it as a free gift.—If a king ſhould condemn a man to ſome exceeding tormenting death, which the condemned perſon thought himſelf not deſerving of, but looked upon the ſentence unjuſt and cruel, and the king, when the time of execution drew nigh, ſhould offer him his pardon, under the notion of a very great act of grace and clemency, the condemned perſon never could willingly and heartily allow it under that notion, becauſe he judged himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly condemned.</p>
               <p>Now by this it is evident that you are not willing to accept of Chriſt as your Saviour; becauſe you never yet had ſuch a ſenſe of your own ſinfulneſs, and ſuch a conviction of your great guilt in God's ſight, as to be indeed convinced that you lay juſtly condemned to the puniſhment of hell. You never was convinced that you had forfeited all favour, and was in God's hands and at his ſovereign and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary diſpoſal, to be either deſtroyed or ſaved, juſt as he pleaſed. You never yet was convinced of the ſovereignty of God. Hence are there ſo many objections ariſing againſt the juſtice of your puniſhment from original ſin, and from God's decrees, from mercy ſhown to others, and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d,</hi> That you be not ſincerely willing to accept of Chriſt as your Saviour, appears
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:049067_0053_10264F3BE337F9D8"/>
by this, That you never have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he is ſufficient for the work of your ſalvation. You never had a ſight or ſenſe of any ſuch excellency or worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt, as ſhould give ſuch great value to his blood and his mediation with God, as that it was ſufficient to be accepted for ſuch exceeding guilty creatures, and thoſe that have ſo provoked God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to ſuch amazing wrath. A ſaying it is ſo, and a cuſtomary yielding and allowing it to be as others ſay, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different thing from being really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it, and a being made ſenſible of it in your own heart. The ſufficiency of Chriſt depends upon, or rather conſiſts in his excellency. It is becauſe he is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a perſon that his blood is of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient value to atone for ſin, and it is hence that his obedience is ſo worthy in God's ſight; it is alſo hence that his interceſſion is ſo prevalent; and therefore thoſe that never had any ſpiritual ſight or ſenſe of Chriſt's excellency, cannot be ſenſible of his ſufficiency.</p>
               <p>And that ſinners be not convinced that Chriſt is ſufficient for the work he has undertaken, appears moſt manifeſtly when they are under great convictions of their ſin, and danger of God's wrath. Though it may be before they thought they could allow Chriſt to be ſufficient, (for it is eaſy to allow any one to be ſufficient for our
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:049067_0054_10264F3E68D579D8"/>
defence at a time when we ſee no danger) yet when they come to be ſenſible of their guilt and God's wrath, what diſcouraging thoughts do they entertain! How are they ready to draw towards deſpair, as if there were no hope or help for ſuch wicked creatures as they! The reaſon is, They have no apprehenſion or ſenſe of any other way that God's majeſty can be vindicated, but only in their miſery. To tell them of the blood of Chriſt ſignifies nothing, it does not relieve their ſinking, deſpairing hearts. This makes it moſt evident that they are not convinced that Chriſt is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be their Mediator.</p>
               <p>And as long as they are unconvinced of this, it is impoſſible they ſhould be willing to accept of him as their Mediator and Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour. A man in diſtreſſing fear will not willingly betake himſelf to a fort that he judges not ſufficient to defend him from the enemy. A man will not willingly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out into the ocean in a ſhip that he ſuſpects is leaky, and will ſink before he gets through his voyage.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>d,</hi> It is evident that you are not willing to have Chriſt for your Saviour, becauſe you have ſo mean an opinion of him, that you durſt not truſt his faithfulneſs. One that undertakes to be the Saviour of ſouls had need be faithful; for if he fails in ſuch a truſt, how great is the loſs! But you are not convinced of Chriſt's faithfulneſs;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:049067_0055_10264F421425FD50"/>
as is evident, becauſe at ſuch times as when you are in a conſiderable meaſure ſenſible of your guilt and God's anger, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he convinced that Chriſt is willing to accept of you, or that he ſtands ready to receive you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you ſhould come to him, though Chriſt ſo much invites you to come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has ſo fully declared that he will not reject you, if you do come; as particularly, John, vi.37.: "Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out." Now, there is no man can be heartily will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truſt his eternal welfare in the hands of an unfaithful perſon, or one whoſe faithfulneſs he ſuſpects.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>th,</hi> You are not willing to be ſaved in that way by Chriſt, as is evident, becauſe you are not willing that your own goodneſs ſhould be ſet at nought. In the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, men's own goodneſs is wholly ſet at nought; there is no account at all made of it. Now you cannot be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſaved in a way, wherein your own goodneſs is ſet at nought, as is evident by that, that you make much of it yourſelf. You make much of your prayers and pains in religion, and are often thinking of them; how conſiderable do they appear to you, when you look back upon them! And how much are ſome of you in thinking how much more you have done than ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and in expecting ſome reſpect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that God ſhould manifeſt to what you
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:049067_0056_10264F44A147C680"/>
do: Now, if you make ſo much of what you do yourſelf, it is impoſſible that you ſhould be freely willing that God ſhould make nothing of it. As we may ſee in oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things; if a man is proud of a great eſtate, or if he values himſelf much upon his honourable office, or his great abilities, it is impoſſible that he ſhould like it, and heartily approve of it, that others ſhould make light of theſe things and deſpiſe them.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that it is ſo evident that you refuſe to accept of Chriſt as your Saviour, why is Chriſt to be blamed that he does not ſave you? Chriſt has offered himſelf to you to be your Saviour in time paſt, and he continues offering himſelf ſtill, and you continue to reject him, and yet complain that he does not ſave you.—So ſtrangely unreaſonable, and inconſiſtent with themſelves, are goſpel ſinners!</p>
               <p>But I expect that there are many of you that in your hearts ſtill object; Your mouths be not ſtopped.—Such an objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, is probably now in the hearts of many here preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſo, that I am not willing to have Chriſt for my Saviour, yet I cannot make myſelf willing.</p>
               <p>But I would give an anſwer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by laying down two things, that muſt be acknowledged to be exceeding ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:049067_0057_10264F4627AD2E48"/>1. It is no excuſe, that you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt of yourſelf, unleſs you would if you could. This is ſo evident of itſelf, that it ſcarce needs any proof. Certainly, if perſons would not if they could, it is juſt the ſame thing as to the blame that lies upon them, whether they can or cannot. If you were willing, and then found that you could not, your being unable would alter the caſe, and might be ſome excuſe; becauſe then the defect would not be in your will, but only in your ability: But as long as you will not, it is no matter what the ability is, whether you have ability or no ability.</p>
               <p>If you be not willing to accept of Chriſt, it will follow that you have no ſincere willingneſs to be willing; becauſe the will always neceſſarily approves of, and reſts in its own acts. To ſuppoſe the contrary would be to ſuppoſe a contradiction; it would be to ſuppoſe that a man's will is contrary to itſelf, or that he wills contrary to what he himſelf wills. So that as you are not willing to come to Chriſt, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make yourſelf willing, ſo you have no ſincere deſire to be willing; and therefore may moſt juſtly periſh without a Saviour. There is no excuſe at all for you; for ſay what you will about your inability, the ſeat of your blame lies in your perverſe will, that is an enemy to the Saviour. It is
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:049067_0058_10264F49AB732370"/>
in vain for you to tell of your want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as long as your will is found defective. If a man ſhould hate you, and devour you, and exalt himſelf, and ſmite you in the face, and tell you that he did it voluntarily, and becauſe he had a mind to, but only ſhould tell you at the ſame time, that he hated you ſo much, that he could not help chooſing and willing ſo to do, would you take it the more patiently for that? Would not your indignation be rather ſtirred up the more?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would be willing if you could, that is no excuſe, unleſs your willingneſs to be willing be ſincere. That which is hypocritical, and does not come from the heart, but is merely forced, ought wholly to be ſet aſide, as worthy of no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that becauſe common ſenſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that that which is not hearty but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical is indeed nothing, being only a ſhew of what is not; but that which is good for nothing, ought to go for nothing. But if you ſet aſide all that is not free, and call nothing a willingneſs, but a free, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty willingneſs, then ſee how the caſe ſtands, and whether or no you have not loſt all your excuſe for ſtanding out againſt the calls of the goſpel. You ſay you would make yourſelf willing to accept if you could; but it is not from any good princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that you are willing for that; it is not from any free inclination, or true reſpect
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:049067_0059_10264F4C322094A0"/>
to Chriſt, or any love to your duty, or any ſpirit of obedience, or from the influence of any manner of real reſpect, or tendency in your heart, towards any thing that is good, or from any other principle than ſuch as is in the hearts of devils, and would make them have the ſame ſort of willingneſs in the ſame circumſtances. It is therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there can be no goodneſs in that woulding to be willing to come to Chriſt: And that which has no goodneſs, cannot be an excuſe for any badneſs. If there be no good in it, then it ſignifies nothing, and weighs nothing, when put into the ſcales to counterbalance that which is bad.</p>
               <p>Sinners therefore ſpend their time in fooliſh arguing and objecting, making much o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that which is good for nothing, making thoſe excuſes that be not worth offering. It is in vain to keep making objections: You ſtand juſtly condemned: The blame lies all at your door: Thruſt it off from you as often as you will, it will return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: Sew fig leaves as long as you will, your nakedneſs will appear: You contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue wilfully and wickedly rejecting Jeſus Chriſt, and will not have him for your Saviour, and therefore it is ſottiſh madneſs in you to charge Chriſt with injuſtice that he does not ſave you.</p>
               <p>Here is the ſin of unbelief! Thus the guilt of that great ſin lies upon you! If you never had thus treated a Saviour, you
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:049067_0060_10264F4EB9823E88"/>
might moſt juſtly have been damned to all eternity: It would but be exactly agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your treatment of God. But beſides this, when God, notwithſtanding, has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you his own dear Son, to ſave you from this endleſs miſery you had deſerved, and not only ſo, but to make you happy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the enjoyment of himſelf you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him, and would not have him for your Saviour, and ſtill refuſe to comply with the offers of the goſpel; what can render any perſon more inexcuſable? If you ſhould now periſh forever, what can you have to ſay?</p>
               <p>Hereby the juſtice of God in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction appears in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is more abundantly manifeſt that it is juſt that you ſhould be deſtroyed. Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice never appears ſo conſpicuous as it does after refuſed and abuſed mercy. Juſtice in damnation appears abundantly the more clear and bright, after a wilful rejection of offered ſalvation. What can an offenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prince do more than freely offer pardon to a condemned malefactor? And if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to accept of it, will any one ſay that his execution is unjuſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. God's juſtice evill appear in your greater deſtruction. Beſides the guilt that you would have had if a Saviour never had been offered, you bring that great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional guilt upon you, of moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſing offered deliverance. What
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:049067_0061_10264F50468DD370"/>
more baſe and vile treatment of God can there be, than for you, when juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to eternal miſery, and ready to be executed, and God graciouſly ſends his own Son, who comes and knocks at your door with a pardon in his hand, and not only a pardon, but a deed of eternal glory; I ſay, what can be worſe, than for you, out of diſlike and enmity againſt God and his Son, to refuſe to accept thoſe benefits at his hands! How juſtly may the anger of God be greatly incenſed and increaſed by it! When a ſinner thus ungratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects mercy, his laſt error is worſe that the firſt; this is more heinous than all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rebellion, and may juſtly bring down more fearful wrath upon him.</p>
               <p>The heinouſneſs of this ſin of rejecting a Saviour eſpecially appears in two things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The greatneſs of the benefits offered; which appears in the greatneſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, which is from inexpreſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of corruption and wickedneſs of heart and life, the leaſt degree of which is infinitely evil: and from miſery that is everlaſting; and in the greatneſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the inheritance purchaſed and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, Heb. ii.3. "How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?"</p>
               <p n="2">2. The wonderfulneſs of the way in which theſe benefits are procured and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. That God ſhould lay help on his own Son, when our caſe was ſo deplorable
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:049067_0062_10264F52D6D20E68"/>
that help could be had in no mere crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that he ſhould undertake for us, and ſhould come into the world, and take upon him our nature, and ſhould not only appear in a low ſtate of life, but ſhould die ſuch a death, and endure ſuch torments and contempt for ſinners while enemies, how wonderful is it! And what tongue or pen can ſet forth the greatneſs of the ingratitude, baſeneſs, and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that there is in it, when a periſhing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is in the moſt extreme neceſſity of ſalvation, rejects it, after it is procured in ſuch a way as this! That ſo glorious a perſon ſhould be thus treated, and that when he comes on ſo gracious an errand! That he ſhould ſtand ſo long offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and calling and inviting, as he has done to many of you, and all to no purpoſe, but all the while be ſet at nought! Surely you might juſtly be caſt into hell without one more offer of a Saviour! Yea, and thruſt down into the loweſt hell! Herein you have exceeded the very devils; for they never rejected the offers of ſuch glorious mercy; no, nor of any mercy at all. This will be the diſtinguiſhing condemnation of goſpel ſinners, John, iii.18. "He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."</p>
               <p>That outward ſmoothneſs of your carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards Chriſt, that appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:049067_0063_10264F5669C91CF0"/>
to him in your looks, your ſpeeches, and geſtures, do not argue but that you ſet him at nought in your heart. There may be much of theſe outward ſhews of reſpect, and yet you be like Judas, that betrayed the Son of man with a kiſs; and like thoſe mockers that bowed the knee before him, and at the ſame time ſpit in his face.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If God ſhould forever caſt you off and deſtroy you, it would be agreeable to your treatment of others; it would be no other than what would be exactly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your behaviour towards your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures, that have the ſame human nature, and are naturally in the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with you, and that you ought to love as yourſelf. And that appears eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have many of you been oppoſite in your ſpirit to the ſalvation of others. There are ſeveral ways that natural men manifeſt a ſpirit of oppoſition againſt the ſalvation of other's ſouls. It ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a fear that their companions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and equals, will obtain mercy, and ſo become unſpeakably happier than they. It is ſometimes manifeſted by an uneaſineſs at the news of others having hopefully obtained. It appears when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons envy others for it, and diſlike them the more, and diſreliſh their talk, and avoid their company, and cannot bear to hear their religious diſcourſe, and eſpecially
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:049067_0064_10263A648A9DD988"/>
to receive warnings and counſels from them. And it oftentimes appears by their backwardneſs to entertain charitable thoughts of them, and their being difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to believe that it is really ſo, that they have obtained mercy, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to liſten to any thing that ſeems to contradict it. The devil hated to own Job's ſincerity, Job. i.7. &amp;c. and chap. ii. verſes 3.4.5. There appears very often much of this ſpirit of the devil in natural men. Sometimes they are ready to make a ridicule of others pretended godlineſs: They ſpeak of the ground of other's hopes, as the enemies of the Jews did of the wall that they built. Neh. iv.3. "Now To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah the Ammonite was by him, and he ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That which they build, if a fox go up, he ſhall even break down their ſtone wall." There are many that join with Sanballat and Tobiah, and are of the ſame ſpirit with them. There always was, and always will be, an enmity betwixt the ſeed of the ſerpent and the ſeed of the woman. It appeared in Cain, who hated his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe he was more acceptable to God than himſelf: and it appears ſtill in theſe times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in this place. There are many that are like the elder brother, who could not bear it that the prodigal when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſhould be received with ſuch joy and good entertainment, and was put into a fret by it, both againſt his brother that
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:049067_0065_10264F5A8193E670"/>
had returned, and his father that made him ſo welcome. Luke. xv.</p>
               <p>Thus have many of you been oppoſite to the ſalvation of others, that ſtand in as great neceſſity of it as you. You have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their being delivered from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſery, that can bear it no better than you; not becauſe their ſalvation would do you any hurt, or their damnation help you, any otherwiſe than as it would gratify that vile ſpirit that is ſo much like the ſpirit of the devil, who, becauſe he is miſerable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is unwilling that others ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. How juſt therefore is it that God ſhould be oppoſite to your ſalvation? If you have ſo little love or mercy in you as to begrudge your neighbour's ſalvation, whom you have no cauſe to hate, but the law of God and nature requires you to love, why is God bound to exerciſe ſuch infinite love and mercy to you, as to ſave you at the price of his own blood, that he is no way bound to love, but that have deſerved his hatred a thouſand and a thouſand times? You are not willing that others ſhould be converted, that have behaved themſelves injuriouſly towards you; and yet, will you count it hard if God does not beſtow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace upon you that have deſerved ten thouſand times as ill of God, as ever any of your neighbours have of you? You are oppoſite to God's ſhewing mercy to th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe, and thoſe that you think have been
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:049067_0066_10264F5E175655B0"/>
vicious perſons, and are very unworthy of ſuch mercy. Is others unworthineſs a juſt reaſon why God ſhould not beſtow mercy on them? And yet will God be hard, if, notwithſtanding all your unworthineſs, and the abominableneſs of your ſpirit and practice in his ſight, he does not ſhow you mercy? You would have God beſtow lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally on you, and upbraid not; but yet when he ſhews mercy to others, you are ready to upbraid as ſoon as you hear of it; you immediately are thinking with yourſelf how ill they have behaved themſelves; and it may be your mouths on this occaſion are open, enumerating and aggravating the ſins they have been guilty of. You would have God bury all your faults, and wholly blot out all your tranſgreſſions; but yet if he beſtows mercy on others, it may be you will take that occaſion to rake up all their old faults that you can think of. You do not much reflect on and condemn yourſelf for your baſeneſs and unjuſt ſpirit towards others, in your oppoſition to their ſalvation; you do not quarrel with yourſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn yourſelf for this; but yet you in your heart will quarrel with God, and condemn him, and fret at his diſpenſations, becauſe you think he ſeems oppoſite to ſhewing mercy to you. One would think that the conſideration of theſe things ſhould forever ſtop your mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how you have promoted
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:049067_0067_10263A661433A180"/>
other's damnation. Many of you, by the bad examples you have ſet, by corrupting the minds of others, by your ſinful conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, by leading them into ſin, or ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening them in ſin, and by the miſchief that you have done in human ſociety other ways that might be mentioned, have been guilty of thoſe things that have tended to others damnation. You have heretofore appeared on the ſide of ſin and Satan, and have behaved yourſelf ſo as much to ſtrengthen their intereſt, and have been many ways acceſſory to other's ſins, have hardened other's hearts, and thereby have done what has tended to the ruin of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>And without doubt there are thoſe here preſent that have been in a great meaſure the means of other's damnation. Though it is true that it is determined of God who he will ſave, and who not, from all eternity, yet one man may really be a means of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's damnation as well as ſalvation. Chriſt charges the ſcribes and Phariſees with this, Matth. xxiii.13. "Ye ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt men; for ye neither go in yourſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entering, to go in." We have no reaſon to think that this congregation has none in it that are curſed from day to day by poor ſouls that are roaring out in hell, whoſe damnation they have been a means of, or have greatly contributed to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:049067_0068_10264F6099AD0750"/>There are many that contribute to their own children's damnation, by neglecting their education, and ſetting them bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and bringing them up in ſinful ways: They take ſome care of their bodies, but take but little care of their poor ſouls; they provide for them bread to eat, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the bread of life, that their fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing ſouls ſtand in need of. And are there no ſuch parents here that have thus treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their children? If their children be not gone to hell, it is no thanks to them; it is not becauſe they have not done what has tended to their deſtruction. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have had no more regard to other's ſalvation, and have promoted their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how juſtly might God leave you to periſh yourſelf?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If God ſhould eternally caſt you off, it would but be agreeable to your own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards yourſelf: And that in two reſpects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In being ſo careleſs of your own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. You have refuſed to take care for your ſalvation, as God has counſelled and commanded you from time to time; and why may not God neglect it, now you ſeek it of him? Is God obliged to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of your happineſs, than you are either of your own happineſs or his glory? Is God bound to take that care for you, out of love to you, that you will not take for yourſelf, either from love to yourſelf, or
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:049067_0069_10265017D1E5B9E0"/>
regard to his authority? How long, and how greatly, have you neglected the welfare of your precious ſoul, refuſing to take pains and deny yourſelf, or put yourſelf a little out of your way for your ſalvation, while God has been calling upon you! Neither your duty to God, nor love to your own ſoul, were enough to induce you to do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things for your own eternal welfare; and yet do you now expect that God ſhould do great things, putting forth almighty power, and exerciſing infinite mercy for it? You was urged to take care for your ſalvation, and not to put it off: You was told that that was the beſt time before you grew older<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it might be, if you would put it off, God would not hear you afterwards; but yet you would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; you would run the venture of it. Now how juſtly might God order it ſo, that it ſhould be too late, leaving you to ſeek in vain? You was told, that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it if you delayed; but you would not hear: How juſtly therefore may God give you cauſe to repent of it, by refuſing to ſhow you mercy now? If God ſees you going on in ways contrary to his commands and his glory, and requires you to forſake them, and tells you that they are ways that tend to the deſtruction of your own ſoul, and therefore counſels you to avoid them, and you refuſe; how juſt would it be if God ſhould be provoked by it, hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:049067_0070_10263A6F79DC9F40"/>
to be as careleſs of the good of your ſoul as you are yourſelf?</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have not only neglected your ſalvation, but you have wilfully taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect courſes to undo yourſelf. You have gone on in thoſe ways and practices that have directly tended to your damnation and have been perverſe and obſtinate in it. You cannot plead ignorance; you had all the light ſet before you that you could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: God told you that you was undoing yourſelf; but yet you would do it: He told you that the path you was going in led to deſtruction, and counſelled you to avoid it; but you would not hearken: How juſtly therefore may God leave you to be undone! You have obſtinately perſiſted to travel in the way that leads to hell for a long time, contrary to God's continual counſels and commands, till it may be at length you are got almoſt to your journey's end, and are come near to hell's gate, and ſo begin to be ſenſible of your danger and miſery; and now account it unjuſt and hard if God will not deliver you! You have deſtroyed yourſelf, and deſtroyed yourſelf wilfully, contrary to God's repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed counſels, yea, and deſtroyed yourſelf in fighting againſt God: Now therefore, why do you blame any but yourſelf if you are deſtroyed? If you will undo yourſelf in oppoſing God, and while God oppoſes you by his calls and counſels. and, it may be,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:049067_0071_10263A7320A89880"/>
too, by the convictions of his Spirit, what can you object againſt it, if God now leaves you to be undone? You would have your own way, and did not like that God ſhould oppoſe you in it, and your way was to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your own ſoul: How juſt therefore is it, if, now at length, God ceaſes to oppoſe you, and falls in with you, and lets your ſoul be ruined; and as you would deſtroy yourſelf, ſo ſhould put to his hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you too! The ways you went on in had a natural tendency to your miſery: If you would drink poiſon in oppoſition to God, and in contempt of him and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who can you blame but yourſelf if you are poiſoned, and ſo periſh? If you would run into the fire againſt all reſtraints both of God's mercy and authority, you muſt even blame yourſelf if you are burnt.</p>
               <p>Thus I have propoſed ſome things to your conſideration, which, if you are not exceeding blind, ſenſeleſs, and perverſe, will ſtop your month, and convince you that you ſtand juſtly condemned before God, and that he would in no wiſe deal hardly with you, but altogether juſtly, in denying you any mercy, and in refuſing to hear your prayers, let you pray never ſo earneſtly, and never ſo often, and continue in it never ſo long; and that God may utterly diſregard your tears and moans, your heavy heart, your earneſt deſires, and great endeavours; and that he may
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:049067_0072_10264F63294B8C68"/>
caſt you into eternal deſtruction, without any regard to your welfare, denying you converting grace, and giving you over to Satan, and at laſt caſt you into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, to be there to eternity, having no reſt day nor night, for ever glorifying his juſtice upon you, in the preſence of the holy angels, and the preſence of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here many may ſtill object, (for I am ſenſible it is an hard thing to ſtop ſinners mouth's,) "God ſhews mercy to others that have done theſe things as well as I, yea, that have done a great deal worſe than I."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That does not prove that God is any way bound to ſhew mercy to you, or them either. If God does beſtow it on others, he does not beſtow it on them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is bound to beſtow it: He might if he had pleaſed, with glorious juſtice, have denied it them. If God beſtows it on ſome, that does not prove that he is bound to beſtow it on any; and if he is bound to beſtow it on none, then he is not bound to beſtow it on you. God is in debt to none; and if he gives to ſome that he is not in debt to, becauſe it is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that does not bring him into debt to others. It alters not the caſe as to you at all, whether others have it or have it not: You do not deſerve damnation the leſs, than if mercy never had been beſtowed on
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:049067_0073_10264F64B1E3FCE8"/>
any at all. Matth. xx.15. "Is thine eye evil, becauſe mine is good?"</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this objection be good, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of God's mercy is not in his own right, and his grace is not his own to give That which God may not diſpoſe of as he pleaſes, is not his own; for that which is one's own, is at his own diſpoſal: but if it be not God's own, then he is not capable of making a gift or preſent of it to any one; it is impoſſible to give a debt.</p>
               <p>What is it that you would make of God? Muſt the great God be tied up to that, that he muſt not uſe his own pleaſure in beſtowing his own gifts, but if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows them on one, muſt be looked upon obliged to beſtow them on another? Is not God worthy to have the ſame right, with reſpect to the gifts of his grace, that a man has to his money or goods? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is not ſo great, and ſhould be more in ſubjection than man, that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowed him? If any of you ſee cauſe to ſhew kindneſs to a neighbour, do all the reſt of your neighbours come to you, and tell you, that you owe them ſo much as you have given to ſuch a man? But this is the way that you deal with God, as though God were not worthy to have as abſolute a property in his goods, as you have in yours.</p>
               <p>At this rate God cannot make a preſent of any thing; he has nothing of his own
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:049067_0074_10264F673495DE48"/>
to beſtow: if he has a mind to ſhew pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar favour to ſome, or to lay ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons under peculiar obligations to him, he cannot do it; becauſe he has no ſpecial gift, that his creatures ſtand in great need of, and that would tend greatly to their happineſs, at his own diſpoſal. If this be the caſe, why do you pray to God to beſtow ſaving grace upon you? If God does not do fairly to deny it you, becauſe he beſtows it on others, then it is not worth your while to pray for it, but you may go and tell him that he has beſtowed it on theſe and thoſe, as bad or worſe than you, and ſo demand it of him as a debt.— And at this rate perſons never need to thank God for ſalvation, when it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed; for what occaſion is there to thank God for that which was not at his own diſpoſal, and that he could not fairly have denied? The thing at bottom is, that men have low thoughts of God, and high thoughts of themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that they look upon God as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo little right, and they ſo much.— Matth. xx.1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</p>
               <p n="3">3. God may juſtly ſhew greater reſpect to others than to you, for you have ſhown greater reſpect to others than to God.— You have ſhown greater reſpect to men than to God: You have rather choſen to offend God than offend men. God only
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:049067_0075_10264F6B09734BD8"/>
ſhews a greater reſpect to others, that are by nature your equals, than to you; but you have ſhown a greater reſpect to thoſe that are infinitely inferior to God than to him. You have ſhown a greater regard to wicked men than to God; you have honoured them more, loved them better, and adhered to them rather than to him. Yea, you have honoured the devil, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects, more than God: you have choſen his will and his intereſt, rather than God's will and his glory: you have choſen a little worldly pelf, rather than God: you have ſet more by a vile luſt than by him: you have choſen theſe things, and rejected God: You have ſet your heart on theſe things, and caſt God behind your back: And where is the injuſtice if God is pleaſed to ſhew greater reſpect to others than to you, or if he chooſes others and rejects you? You have ſhown great reſpect to vile and worthleſs things, and no reſpect to God's glory; and why may not God ſet his love on others, and have no reſpect to your happineſs? You have ſhown great reſpect to others and not to God, that you are laid under infinite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to reſpect above all; and why may not God ſhew reſpect to others, and not to you, that never have laid him under the leaſt obligation?</p>
               <p>And will you not be aſhamed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe things, ſtill to open your

mouth, to object and cavil about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, and other things that you cannot fully underſtand. Let the decrees of God be what they will, that alters not the caſe as to your liberty, any more than if God had only foreknown. And why is God to blame for decreeing things? How unbecoming an infinitely wiſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would it have been to have made a world, and let things run at random, without diſpoſing events, or fore-ordering how they ſhould come to paſs? And what is that to you, how God has fore-ordered things as long as your conſtant experience teaches you, that that does not hinder your liberty, or your doing what you chooſe to do. This you know, and your daily practice and behaviour amongſt men declares that you are fully ſenſible of it, with reſpect to yourſelf and others: And ſtill to object, becauſe there are ſome things in Gods diſpenſations above your underſtanding, is exceeding unreaſonable. Your own conſcience charges you with great guilt, and with thoſe things that have been mentioned, let the ſecret things of God be what they will. Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience charges you with thoſe vile diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and that baſe behaviour towards God, that you would at any time moſt highly reſent in your neighbour towards you, and that not a whit the leſs for any concern thoſe ſecret counſels and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

diſpenſations of God may have in the matter. It is in vain for you to exalt yourſelf againſt an infinitely great, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and juſt God. If you continue in it, it will be to your eternal ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, when hereafter you ſhall ſee at whoſe door all the blame of your miſery lies.</p>
               <p>I will finiſh what I have to ſay to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men in the application of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, with a caution not to improve the doctrine to diſcouragement. For though it would be righteous in God for ever to caſt you off, and deſtroy you, yet it will alſo be juſt in God to ſave you in and through Chriſt, who has made complete ſatisfaction for all ſin. Rom. iii.25.26. "Whom God hath ſet forth to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins that are paſt, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God; to declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus." Yea, God may through this Mediator, not only juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but honourably, ſhew you mercy. The blood of Chriſt is ſo precious, that it is fully ſufficient to pay that debt that you have contracted, and perfectly to vindicate the divine Majeſty from all that diſhonour that has been caſt upon it, by thoſe many great ſins of yours that have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:049067_0078_10264F70AC5B8F70"/>
It was as great, and indeed a much greater thing, for Chriſt to die, than it would have been for you and all mankind to have burnt in hell to all eternity. Of ſuch dignity and excellency is Chriſt in the eyes of God, that, ſeeing he has ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much for poor ſinners, God is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be at peace with them, however vile and unworthy they have been, and on how many accounts ſoever the puniſhment would be juſt. So that you need not be at all diſcouraged from ſeeking mercy, for there is enough in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Indeed it would not become the glory of God's majeſty to ſhew mercy to you that have been ſo ſinful and vile a creature, for any thing that you have done, for ſuch worthleſs and deſpicable things as your prayers, and other religious performances; it would be very diſhonourable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God ſo to do, and it is in vain to expect it: He will ſhew mercy only on Chriſt's account, and that, according to his ſovereign pleaſure, on whom he pleaſes, when he pleaſes, and in what manner he pleaſes. You cannot bring him under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by your works; do what you will, he will not look on himſelf obliged. But if it be his pleaſure, he can honourably ſhew mercy through Chriſt to any ſinner of you all, not one in this congregation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>Therefore here is encouragement for you
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:049067_0079_10264F75D7489DF8"/>
ſtill to ſeek and wait, notwithſtanding all your wickedneſs; agreeable to Samuel's ſpeech to the children of Iſrael, when they were terrified with the thunder and rain that God ſent, and their guilt ſtared them in the face, 1 Sam. xii.20. "Fear not; ye have done all this wickedneſs; yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your hearts."</p>
               <p>I would conclude this diſcourſe by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the doctrine, in the ſecond place, very briefly to put the godly in mind of the freeneſs and wonderfulneſs of the grace of God towards them. For ſuch were ſome of you.—The caſe was juſt ſo with you as you have heard; you had ſuch a wicked heart, you lived ſuch a wicked life, and it would have been moſt juſt with God for ever to have caſt you off: but he has had mercy upon you; he hath made his glorious grace appear in your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation. You behaved yourſelf ſo as you have heard towards God: You had no love to God; but yet he has exerciſed unſpeakable love to you: You have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned God, and ſet light by him; but ſo great a value has God's grace ſet on you and your happineſs, that you have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed at the price of the blood of his own Son: You choſe to be with Satan in his ſervice; but yet God hath made you a joint heir with Chriſt of his glory. You was ungrateful for paſt mercies; but yet
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:049067_0080_10264F785B422258"/>
God not only continued thoſe mercies, but beſtowed unſpeakably greater mercies upon you: You refuſed to hear when God called; but yet God heard you when you called: You abuſed the infiniteneſs of God's mercy to encourage yourſelf in ſin againſt God: but yet God has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the infiniteneſs of that mercy, in the exerciſes of it towards you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chriſt, and ſet him at nought; and yet he is become your Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You have neglected your own ſalvation; but God has not neglected it; You have deſtroyed yourſelf; but yet in God has been your help. God has magnified his free grace towards you, and not to others; becauſe he has choſen you, and it hath pleaſed him to ſet his love upon you.</p>
               <p>O! what cauſe is here for praiſe? What obligations are upon you to bleſs the Lord, who hath dealt bountifully with you, and to magnify his holy name? What cauſe for you to praiſe him in humility, to walk humbly before God, and to be conformed to that in Ezek. xvi.63.: "That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God!" You ſhould never open your mouth in boaſting, or ſelf-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: You ſhould lie the lower before God for his mercy to you. But you have
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:049067_0081_10264F79E28AAE90"/>
reaſon, the more abundantly for your paſt ſins, to open your mouth in God's praiſes, that they may be continually in your mouth, both here and to all eternity, for his rich, unſpeakable, and ſovereign mercy to you, whereby he, and he alone, hath made you to differ from others.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE FAREWELL SERMON.</head>
            <p>IT is not unlikely, that ſome of the readers of the following Sermon may be inquiſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the circumſtances of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and the people of Northampton, that iſſued in that ſeparation between me and them which occaſioned the preaching of this farewell ſermon.—There is, by no means, room here for a full account of that matter: But yet it ſeems to be proper, and even neceſſary, here to correct ſome groſs miſrepreſentations, which have been abundantly, and (it is to be feared) by ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly and induſtriouſly made, of that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Such as, that I inſiſted on perſons being aſſured of their being in a ſtate of ſalvation, in order to my admitting them into the church: that I required a particular relation of the method and order of a perſon's inward expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and of the time and manner of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as the teſt of his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for Chriſtian communion; yea, that I have undertaken to ſet up a pure church, and to make an exact and certain diſtinction between saints and hypocrites, by a pretended infalliable diſcerning the ſtate of men's ſouls: that in theſe things I had fallen in with thoſe wild people, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and that I myſelf was become a grand Seperatiſt; that
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:049067_0083_10264F8033A786A8"/>
I arrogated all the power of judging of the qualifications of candidates for communion wholly to myſelf, and inſiſted on acting by my ſole authority, in the admiſſion of members into the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to theſe ſlanderous repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I ſhall at preſent only give my reader an account of ſome things which I laid before the council, that ſeparated between me and my people, in order to their having a juſt and full account of my principles, relating to the affair in controverſy.</p>
            <p>Long before the ſitting of the council, my people had ſent to the Reverend Mr Clark of Salem village, deſiring him to write in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to my principles. Which gave me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to write to Mr Clark, that might have true information what my principles were. And in the time of the ſitting of the council, I did, for their information, make a public declaration of my principles before them and the church, in the meeting-houſe, of the ſame import with that in my letter to Mr Clark, and very much in the ſame words. And then, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſent in to the council in writing, an extract of that letter, containing the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I had given Mr Clark, in the very words of my letter to him, that the council might read and conſider it at their leiſure, and have a more certain and ſatisfactory knowledge what my principles were. The extract which I ſent in to them was in the following words.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>"I am often, and I do not know but pretty
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:049067_0084_10264F81BAEE1710"/>
generally, in the country, repreſented as of a new and odd opinion with reſpect to the terms of Chriſtian communion, and as being for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a peculiar way of my own. Whereas, I do not perceive that I differ at all from the ſcheme of Dr Watts, in his book intitled, <hi>The rational Foundation of a Chriſtian Church, and the Terms of Chriſtian Communion;</hi> which, he ſays, is the common ſentiment and practice of all reformed churches. I had not ſeen this book of Dr Watt's when I publiſhed what I have written on the ſubject. But yet, I think my ſentiments, as I have expreſſed them, are as exactly agreeable to what he lays down, as if I had been his pupil. Nor do I at all go beyond what Dr Doddridge plainly ſhews to be his ſentiments, in his <hi>Riſe and Progreſs of Religion</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his <hi>Sermons on Regeneration,</hi> and his Paraphaſe and Notes on the New Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. Nor indeed, Sir, when I conſider the ſentiments you have expreſſed in your letters to Major Pomroy and Mr Billing, can I perceive but that they come exactly to the ſame thing that I maintain. You ſuppoſe, the ſacraments are not converting ordinances: But that, <hi>as ſeals of the covenant, they preſuppoſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eſpecially in the adult; and that it is viſible ſaintſhip, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in other words, a cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible profeſſion of faith and repentance, a ſolemn conſent to the goſpel covenant, joined with a good converſation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent meaſure of Chriſtian knowledge, is what gives a goſpel right to all ſacred or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:049067_0085_10264F8347841280"/>
But that it is neceſſary to thoſe that come to theſe ordinances, and in thoſe that profeſs a conſent to the goſpel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that they be ſincere in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> or at leaſt ſhould think themſelvss ſo.— The great things which I have ſcrupled in the eſtabliſhed method of this church's proceeding, and which I dare no longer go on in, is their publicly aſſenting to the form of words rehearſed on occaſion of their admiſſion to the communion, without pretending thereby to mean any ſuch thing as an hearty conſent to the terms of the goſpel-covenant, or to mean any ſuch faith or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as belong to the covenant of grace, and are the grand conditions of that covenant: It being, at the ſame time that the words are uſed, their known and eſtabliſhed principle, which they openly profeſs and proceed upon, that men may and ought to uſe theſe words, and mean no ſuch thing, but ſomething elſe of a nature far inferior; which I think they have no diſtinct determinate notion of; but ſomething coſiſtent with their knowing that they do not chuſe God as their chief good, but love the world more than him, and that they do not give themſelves up entirely to God, but make reſerves; and in ſhort, knowing that they do not heartily conſent to the goſpel covenant, but live ſtill under the reigning power of the love of the world, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to God and Christ. So that the words of their public profeſſion, according to their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="87" facs="unknown:049067_0086_10264F84DE041CD0"/>
or any proper compliance with the covenant: For it is their profeſſion, that the words, as uſed, mean no ſuch thing. The words uſed under theſe circumſtances, do at leaſt fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a credible profeſſion of theſe things.—I can conceive of no ſuch virtue in a certain ſet of words, that it is proper, merely on the making theſe ſounds, to admit perſons to Chriſtian ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, without any regard to any pretended meaning of theſe ſounds: Nor can I think, that any inſtitution of Chriſt has eſtabliſhed any ſuch terms of admiſſion into the Chriſtian Church.— It does not belong to the controverſy between me and my people, how particular or large the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhould be, that is required. I ſhould not chuſe to be confined to exact limits as to that matter: But rather than contend, I ſhould content myſelf with a few words, briefly expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cardinal virtues or acts implied in a hearty compliance with the covenant, made (as ſhould appear by inquiry into the perſon's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal knowledge) underſtandingly; if there were an external converſation agreeable thereto: Yea, I ſhould think, that ſuch a perſon, ſolemnly mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a profeſſion, had a right to be received as the object of a public charity, however he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might ſcruple his own converſion, on account of his not remembering the time, not knowing, the method of his converſion, or finding ſo much remaining ſin, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>Thus far my letter to Mr. Clark.</p>
            <p>The council having heard that I had made certain draughts of the covenant, or forms of a public profeſſion of religion which I ſtood ready to accept of from the candidates for church communion, they, for their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> information, ſent for them. Accordingly I ſent them four diſtinct draughts or forms, which I had drawn up about a twelvemonth before, as what I ſtood ready to accept of (any one of them) rather than contend, and brake with my people.</p>
            <p>The two ſhorteſt of theſe forms are here inſerted for the ſatisfaction of the reader. They are as follows.</p>
            <p>"I hope I do truly find a heart to give up myſelf wholly to God, according to the tenor of that covenant of grace which was ſealed in my baptiſm; and to walk in a way of that obediance to all the commandments of God, which the covenant of grace requires, as long as I live."</p>
            <p>Another,</p>
            <p>"I hope I truly find in my heart a willingneſs to comply with all the commandments of God which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to give up myſelf wholly to him, and to ſerve him with my body and my ſpirit. And do accordingly now promiſe to walk in a way of obedience to all the commandments of God, as long as I live."</p>
            <p>Such kind of profeſſions as theſe I ſtood ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, rather than contend and break with my people. Not but that I think it much more convenient, that ordinarily the public profeſſion of religion that is made
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:049067_0088_10264F8DA9A4F708"/>
by Chriſtians, ſhould be much fuller and more particular. And that (as I hinted in my letter to Mr Clark) I ſhould not chuſe to be tied up to any certain form of words, but to have liberty to vary the expreſſions of a public profeſsion, the more exactly to ſuit the ſentiments and experience of the profeſſor, that it might be a more juſt and free expreſsion of what each one finds in his heart.</p>
            <p>And moreover it muſt be noted, that I ever inſiſted on it, that it belonged to me as a paſtor, before a profeſſion was accepted, to have full liberty to inſtruct the candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date in the meaning of the terms of it, and in the nature of the things propoſed to be profeſſed; and to inquire into his doctrinal underſtanding of theſe things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my beſt diſcretion; and to caution the perſon, as I ſhould think needful, againſt raſhneſs in making ſuch a profeſſion, or doing it mainly for the credit of himſelf or his family, or from any ſecular views whatſoever, and to put him on ſerious ſelf-examination, and ſearching his own heart, and prayer to God to ſearch and enlighten him, that he may not be hypocritical and deceived in the profeſſiom he makes; withal pointing forth to him the many ways in which profeſſors are liable to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think it improper for a miniſter in ſuch a caſe, to inquire and know of the candidate what can be remembered of the circumſtances of his Chriſtian expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; as this may tend much to illuſtrate his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and give a miniſter great advantage for proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: though a particular knowledge and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the time and method of the firſt converſion to God, is not to be made the teſt of a perſon's ſincerity, nor inſiſted on as neceſſary in order to his being received into full charity. Not that I think it at all improper or unprofitable, that in ſome ſpecial caſes, a declaration of the particular circumſtances of a perſon's firſt awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the manner of his convictions, illuminations, and comforts, ſhould be publicly exhibited before the whole congregation, on occaſion of his admiſſion into the church; though this be not demanded as neceſſary to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:049067_0089_10264F91359A4E28"/>
admiſſion. I ever declared againſt inſiſting on a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of experiences, in this ſenſe (viz. a relation of the particular time and ſteps of the operation of the Spirit, in firſt converſion,) as the term of communion: Yet, if by a relation of experiences, be meant a declaration of experience of the great things wrought, wherein true grace and the eſſential acts and habits of holineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this ſenſe, I think an account of a perſon's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences neceſſary in order to his admiſſion into full communion in the church. But that in whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries are made, and whatever account is given, neither miniſter nor church are to ſet up themſelveſs as ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of hearts, but are to accept the ſerious ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the well-inſtructed profeſſor, of a good life, as beſt able to determine what he finds in his own heart.</p>
            <p>Theſe things may ſerve in ſome meaſure to ſet right thoſe of my readers who have been miſled in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the ſtate of the controverſy between me and my people, by the forementioned miſrepreſentations.</p>

            <p>THE apoſtle, in the preceding part of the chapter, declares what great troubles he met with in the courſe of his miniſtry. In the text, and two foregoing verſes, he declares what were his comforts and ſupports under the troubles he met with. There are four things in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he had approved himſelf to his own conſcience, verſ. 12. "For our rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world, and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to you-wards."</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing he ſpeaks of as matter of comfort, is, that as he had approved himſelf to his own conſcience, ſo he had alſo to the conſciences of his hearers, the Corinthians, whom he now wrote to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they ſhould approve of him at the day of judgment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The hope he had of ſeeing the bleſſed fruit of his labours and ſufferings in the miniſtry, in their happineſs and glory, in that great day of accounts.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:049067_0091_10264F9659905B78"/>4. That, in his miniſtry among the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, he had approved himſelf to his Judge, who would approve and reward his faithfulneſs in that day.</p>
            <p>Theſe three laſt particulars are ſignified in my text, and the preceding verſe; and indeed all the four are implied in the text: it is implied, that the Corinthians had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him as their ſpiritual Father, &amp; as one that had been faithful among them, and as the means of their future joy and glory at the day of judgment, and one whom they ſhould then ſee, and have a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meeting with as ſuch. It is implied, that the apoſtle expected at that time to have a joyful meeting with them before the Judge, and with joy to behold their glory, as the fruit of his labours; and ſo they would be his rejoicing. It is implied alſo, that he then expected to be approved of the great Judge, when he and they ſhould meet together before him; and that he would then acknowledge his fidelity, and that this had been the means of their glory; and that thus he would, as it were, give them to him as his crown of rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But this the apoſtle could not hope for, unleſs he had the teſtimony of his own conſcience in his favour. And therefore the words do imply, in the ſtrongeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he had approved himſelf to his own conſcience.</p>
            <p>There is one thing implied in each of
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:049067_0092_10264F98E6F66168"/>
theſe particulars, and in every part of the text, which is that point I ſhall make the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe, viz.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>"Miniſters, and the people that have been under their care, muſt meet one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other before Chriſt's tribunal at the day of judgment."</p>
               <p>Miniſters, and the people that have been under their care, muſt be parted in this world, how well ſoever they have been united: If they are not ſeparated before, they muſt be parted by death; and they may be ſeparated while life is continued. We live in a world of change, where nothing is certain or ſtable; and where a little time, a few revolutions of the ſun, brings to paſs ſtrange things, ſurpriſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, in particular perſons, in families, in towns and churches, in countries and nations. It often happens, that thoſe who ſeem moſt united, in a little time are moſt diſunited, and at the greateſt diſtance.— Thus miniſters and people, between whom there has been the greateſt mutual regard and ſtricteſt union, may not only differ in their judgments, and be alienated in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but one may rend from the other, and all relation between them be diſſolved; the miniſter may be removed to a diſtant place, and they may never have any more

to do one with another, in this world.— But if it be ſo, there is one meeting more that they muſt have, and that is in the laſt great day of accounts.</p>

               <p n="2">II. For what purpoſes.</p>
               <p n="3">III. For what reaſons God has ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that miniſters and their people ſhall then meet together in ſuch a manner, and for ſuch purpoſes.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I would ſhew, in ſome particulars, in what manner miniſters and the people which have been under their care, ſhall meet one another at the day of judgment. Concerning this, I would obſerve two things in general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ſhall not then meet only as all mankind muſt then meet, but there will be ſomething peculiar in the manner of their meeting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their meeting together at that time ſhall be very different from what uſed to be in the houſe of God in this world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſhall all not meet at that day mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as all the world muſt then meet togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I would obſerve a difference in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:049067_0094_10264F9D43267520"/>(1.) As to a clear actual view, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct knowledge and notice of each other.</p>
               <p>Although the whole world will be then preſent, all mankind of all generations ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in one vaſt aſſembly, with all of the angelic nature, both elect and fallen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; yet we need not ſuppoſe that every one will have a diſtinct and particular knowledge of each individual of the whole aſſembled multitude, which will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly conſiſt of many millions of millions. Though it is probable that men's capacities will be much greater than in their preſent ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they will not be infinite: Though their underſtanding and comprehenſion will be vaſtly extended, yet men will not be deified. There will probably be a very enlarged view that particular perſons will have of the various parts and members of that vaſt aſſembly, and ſo of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that great day; but yet it muſt needs be, that according to the nature of finite minds, ſome perſons and ſome things, at that day, ſhall fall more under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of particular perſons than others; and this (as we may well ſuppoſe) according as they ſhall have a nearer concern with ſome than others in the tranſactions of the day. There will be ſpecial reaſon why thoſe who have had ſpecial concerns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this world, in their ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and whoſe mutual affairs will be then to be tried and judged, ſhould eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:049067_0095_10264FA399A2D208"/>
be ſet in one another's view. Thus we may ſuppoſe, that rulers and ſubjects, earthly judges and thoſe whom they have judged, neighbours who have had mutual converſe, dealings, and conteſts, heads of families and their children and ſervants, ſhall then meet, and in a peculiar diſtinction be ſet together. And eſpecially will it be thus with miniſters and their people. It is evident by the text, that theſe ſhall be in each other's view, ſhall diſtinctly know each, other, and ſhall have particular notice one of another at that time.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) They ſhall meet together, as having ſpecial concern one with another in the great tranſactions of that day.</p>
               <p>Although they ſhall meet the whole world at that time, yet they will not have any immediate and particular concern with all. Yea, the far greater part of thoſe who ſhall then be gathered together, will be ſuch as they have had no intercourſe with in their ſtate of probation, and ſo will have no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concerns to be judged of. But as to miniſters and the people that have been under their care, they will be ſuch as have had much immediate concern one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in matters of the greateſt moment that ever mankind have to do one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in. Therefore they eſpecially muſt meet, and be brought together before the Judge, as having ſpecial concern one with another in the deſign and buſineſs of that great day of accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:049067_0096_10264FA114F89B48"/>Thus their meeting, as to the manner of it, will be diverſe from the meeting of mankind in general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their meeting at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be very diverſe from their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one with another in this world.</p>
               <p>Miniſters and their people, while their relation continues, often meet together in this world: They are wont to meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, and at other times, for the public worſhip of God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, of ordinances, and the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn ſervices of God's houſe: And beſides theſe meetings, they have alſo occaſions to meet for the determining and managing their eccleſiaſtical affairs, for the exerciſe of church-diſcipline, and the ſettling and adjuſting thoſe things which concern the purity and good order of public adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations. But their meeting at the day of judgment will be exceeding diverſe, in its manner and circumſtances, from any ſuch meetings and interviews as they have one with another in the preſent ſtate. I would obſerve how, in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Now they meet together in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory mutable ſtate, but then in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable ſtate.</p>
               <p>Now ſinners in the congregation meet their miniſter in a ſtate wherein they are capable of a ſaving change, capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned, through God's bleſſing on the miniſtrations and labours of their paſtor,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:049067_0097_10264FA522A2B300"/>
from the power of Satan unto God; and being brought out of a ſtate of guilt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and wrath, to a ſtate of peace and favour with God, to the enjoyment of the privileges of his children, and a title to their eternal inheritance. And ſaints now meet their miniſter with great remains of corruption, and ſometimes under great ſpiritual difficulties and affliction: And therefore are yet the proper ſubjects of means of an happy alteration of their ſtate, conſiſting in a greater freedom from theſe things, which they have reaſon to hope for in the way of an attendance on ordinances, and of which God is pleaſed commonly to make his miniſters the inſtruments. And miniſters and their people now meet in order to the bringing to paſs ſuch happy changes; they are the great benefits ſought in their ſolemn meetings in this world.</p>
               <p>But when they ſhall meet together at the day of judgment, it will be far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. They will not then meet in order to the uſe of means for the bringing to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any ſuch changes; for they will all meet in an unchangeable ſtate. Sinners will be in an unchangeable ſtate: They who then ſhall be under the guilt and power of ſin, and have the wrath of God abiding on them, ſhall be beyond all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or poſſibility of change, and ſhall meet their miniſters without any hopes of relief or remedy, or getting any good by their
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:049067_0098_10264FA7A9DDAAA8"/>
means. And as for the ſaints, they will be already perfectly delivered from all their before remaining corruption, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and calamities of every kind, and ſet for ever out of their reach; and no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, no happy alteration, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be accompliſhed in the way of the uſe of means of grace, under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of miniſters. It will then be pronounced, "He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous ſtill; and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill."</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Then they ſhall meet together in a ſtate of clear, certain, and infallible light.</p>
               <p>Miniſters are ſet as guides and teachers, and are repreſented in Scripture as lights ſet up in the churches; and in the preſent ſtate meet their people from time to time in order to inſtruct and enlighten them, to correct their miſtakes, and to be a voice behind them, when they turn aſide to the right hand or the left, ſaying, "This is the way, walk in it;" to evince end confirm the truth by exhibiting the proper evidences of it, &amp; to refute errors &amp; corrupt opinions, to convince the erroneous, and eſtabliſh the doubting. But when Chriſt ſhall come to judgment, every error &amp; falſe opinion ſhall be detected; all deceit &amp; deluſion ſhall van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh away before the light of that day, as the darkneſs of the night vaniſhes at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:049067_0099_10264FAB4490F9D0"/>
of the riſing ſun; and every doctrine of the word of God ſhall then appear in full evidence, and none ſhall remain unconvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; all ſhall know the truth with the greateſt certainty, and there ſhall be no miſtakes to rectify.</p>
               <p>Now miniſters and their people may diſagree in their judgements concerning ſome matters of religion, and may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet to confer together concerning thoſe things wherein they differ, and to hear the reaſons that may be offered on one ſide and the other; and all may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual as to any conviction of the truth: they may meet and part again no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed than before; and that ſide which was in the wrong, may remain ſo ſtill: Sometimes the meetings of miniſters with their people, in ſuch a caſe of diſagreeing ſentiments, are attended with unhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and controverſy, managed with much prejudice and want of candour: not tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to light and conviction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather to confirm and increaſe darkneſs, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh oppoſition to the truth, and alienation of affection one from another. But when they ſhall hereafter meet together, at the day of judgment, before the tribunal of the great Judge, the mind and will of Chriſt will be made known; and there ſhall no longer be any debate or difference of opinions; the evidence of the truth ſhall appear beyond all diſpute, and all
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:049067_0100_10264FADCC9348B8"/>
controverſies ſhall be finally and for ever decided.</p>
               <p>Now miniſters meet their people in ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enlighten and awaken the conſciences of ſinners; ſetting before them the great evil and danger of ſin, the ſtrictneſs of God's law, their own wickedneſs of heart and practice, the great guilt they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the wrath that abides upon them, and their impotence, blindneſs, poverty, and helpleſs and undone condition: But all is often in vain; they remain ſtill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their miniſters can ſay, ſtupid and unawakened, and their conſciences unconvinced. But it will not be ſo at their laſt meeting at the day of judgment; ſinners, when they ſhall meet their miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before their great Judge, will not meet him with a ſtupid conſcience: They will then be fully convinced of the truth of thoſe things which they formerly heard from him, concerning the greatneſs and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible majeſty of God, his holineſs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, and his awful juſtice in pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing of it, the ſtrictneſs of his law, and the dreadfulneſs and truth of his threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and their own unſpeakable guilt and miſery: And they ſhall never more be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of theſe things: The eyes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will now be fully enlightened, and never ſhall be blinded again: The mouth of conſcience ſhall now be opened, and never ſhall be ſhut any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:049067_0101_10264FAF53F8BB60"/>Now miniſters me<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> with their people, in public and private, in order to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them concerning the ſtate of their ſouls; to open and apply the rules of God's word to them, in order to their ſearching their own hearts, and diſcerning the ſtate that they are in: But now miniſters have no infallible diſcerning the ſtate of the ſouls of their people; and the moſt ſkilful of them are liable to miſtakes, and often are miſtaken in things of this nature: nor are the people able certainly to know the ſtate of their miniſter, or another's ſtate; very often thoſe paſs among them for ſaints, and, it may be, eminent ſaints, that are grand hypocrites; and on the other hand, thoſe are ſometimes cenſured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into their charity, that are indeed ſome of God's jewels. And nothing is more common than for men to be miſtaken concerning their own ſtate: Many that are abominable to God, and the children of his wrath, think highly of themſelves, as his precious ſaints and dear children. Yea, there is reaſon to think, that often ſome that are moſt bold in their confidence of their ſafe and happy ſtate, and think themſelves not only true ſaints, but the moſt eminent ſaints in the congregation, are in a peculiar manner a ſmoke in God's noſe. And thus it undoubtedly often is in thoſe congregations where the word of God is moſt faithfully diſpenſed, notwithſtanding
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:049067_0102_10264FB1D8564920"/>
all that miniſters can ſay in their cleareſt explications, and moſt ſearching applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the doctrines and rules of God's word to the ſouls of their hearers, in their meetings one with another. But in the day of judgment they ſhall have another ſort of meeting; then the ſecrets of every heart ſhall be made manifeſt, and every man's ſtate ſhall be perfectly known. 1 Cor. iv.5. "Therefore judge nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſt the counſels of the hearts: And then ſhall every man have praiſe of God." Then none ſhall be deceived concerning his own ſtate, nor ſhall be any more in doubt about it. There ſhall be an eternal end to all the ſelf-conceit and vain hopes of deluded hypocrites, and all the doubts and fears of ſincere Chriſtians.— And then ſhall all know the ſtate of one another's ſouls: The people ſhall know whether their miniſter has been ſincere and faithful, and the miniſter ſhall know the ſtate of every one of their people, and to whom the word and ordinances of God have been a ſavour of life unto life, and to whom a ſavour of death unto death.</p>
               <p>Now in this preſent ſtate it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that when miniſters and people meet together to debate and manage their eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical affairs, eſpecially in a ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:049067_0103_10264FB58483E240"/>
they are ready to judge and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure one another with regard to each others views and deſigns, and the principles and ends that each is influenced by; and are greatly miſtaken in their judgement, and wrong one another in their cenſures: But at that future meeting, things will be ſet in a true and perfect light, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and aims that every one has acted from, ſhall be certainly known; and there will be an end to all errors of this kind, and all unrighteous cenſures.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In this world, miniſters and their people often meet together to hear of and wait upon an unſeen Lord; but at the day of judgment, they ſhall meet in his moſt immediate and viſible preſence.</p>
               <p>Miniſters, who now often meet their people to preach to them the King eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, immortal, and inviſible, to convince them that there is a God, and declare to them what manner of being he is, and to convince them that he governs, and will judge the world, and that there is a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, and to preach to them a Chriſt in heaven, at the right hand of God, in an unſeen world, ſhall then meet their people in the moſt immediate ſenſible preſence of this great God, Saviour, and Judge, appearing in the moſt plain, viſible, and open manner, with great glory, with all his holy angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and the whole world. They
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:049067_0104_10264FB8189DB648"/>
ſhall not meet them to hear about an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt, an unſeen Lord, and future Judge; but to appear before that Judge, and as being ſet together in the preſence of that ſupreme Lord, in his immenſe glory and awful majeſty, whom they have heard ſo often of, in their meetings together on earth.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The meeting at the laſt day, of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, and the people that have been under their care, will not be attended by any one with a careleſs heedleſs heart.</p>
               <p>With ſuch an heart are their meetings often attended in this world by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, having little regard to him whom they pretend unitedly to adore in the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn duties of his public worſhip, taking little heed to their own thoughts or frame of their minds, not attending to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are engaged in, or conſidering the end for which they are come together.— But the meeting at that great day will be very different: there will not be one careleſs heart, no ſleeping, no wandering of mind from the great concern of the meeting, no inattentiveneſs to the buſineſs of the day, no regardleſſneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence they are in, or of thoſe great things which they ſhall hear from Chriſt at that meeting, or that they formerly heard from him, and of him, by their miniſters, in their meetings in a ſtate of trial, or which they ſhall now hear their miniſters declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:049067_0105_10264FB9A096A6C0"/>
concerning them before their judge.</p>
               <p>Having obſerved theſe things, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner and circumſtances of this future meeting of miniſters and the people that have been under their care, before the tribunal of Chriſt at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I now proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">II. To obſerve to what purpoſes they ſhall then meet.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To give an account, before the great Judge, of their behaviour one to another, in the relation they ſtood in to each other in this world.</p>
               <p>Miniſters are ſent forth by Chriſt to their people on his buſineſs, are his ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and meſſengers; and, when they have finiſhed their ſervice, they muſt return to their maſter to give him an account of what they have done, and of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment they have had in performing their miniſtry. Thus we find, in Luke, xiv.16.—21. That when the ſervant who was ſent forth to call the gueſts to the great ſupper, had done his errand, and finiſhed his appointed ſervice, he returned to his maſter, and gave him an account of what he had done, and of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had received. And when the maſter, being angry, ſent his ſervant to others, he returns again, and gives his maſter an account of his conduct and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. So we read, in Heb. xiii.17. of miniſters or rulers in the houſe of God,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:049067_0106_10264FBC247148E0"/>
"that watch for ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give account." And we ſee by the forementioned Luke xiv. that miniſters muſt give an account to their maſter, not only of their own behaviour in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their office, but alſo of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples reception of them, and of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have met with among them.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as they will be called to give an account of both, they ſhall give an account at the great day of accounts, in the preſence of their people; they and their people being both preſent befor their Judge.</p>
               <p>Faithful miniſters will then give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with joy, concerning thoſe who have received them well, and made a good improvement of their miniſtry; and theſe will be given them, at that day, as their crown of rejoicing. And, at the ſame time, they will give an account of the ill treatment of ſuch as have not well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them and their meſſages from Chriſt: they will meet theſe, not as they uſed to do in this world, to counſel and warn them, but to bear witneſs againſt them; and as their judges, and aſſeſſors with Chriſt, to condemn them. And, on the other hand, the people will, at that day, riſe up in judgment againſt wicked and unfaithful miniſters, who have ſought their own temporal intereſt more than the good of the ſouls of their flock.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:049067_0107_10264FBFC8A25F78"/>2. At that time miniſters, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have been under their care, ſhall meet together before Chriſt, that he may judge between them, as to any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which have ſubſiſted between them in this world.</p>
               <p>So it very often comes to paſs in this evil world, that great differences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ariſe between miniſters and the people that are under their paſtoral care. Though they are under the greateſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to live in peace, above perſons in almoſt any relation whatever; and altho' conteſts and diſſentions between perſons ſo related are the moſt unhappy and terrible in their conſequences, on many accounts, of any ſort of contentions; yet how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent have ſuch contentions been? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a people conteſt with their miniſters about their doctrine, ſometimes about their adminiſtrations and conduct, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times about their maintenance; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch conteſts continue a long time; and ſometimes they are decided in this world, according to the prevailing intereſt of one party or the other, rather than by the word of God, and the reaſon of things; and ſometimes ſuch controverſies never have any proper determination in this world.</p>
               <p>But at the day of judgement there will be a full, perfect, and everlaſting deciſion of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The infalliable Judge, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:049067_0108_10264FC27295C0B8"/>
fountain of light, truth, and juſtice, will judge between the contending parties, and will declare what is the truth, who is in the right, and what is agreeable to his mind and will. And in order hereto, the parties muſt ſtand together before him at the laſt day; which will be the great day of finiſhing and determining all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, rectifying all miſtakes, and abol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing all unrighteous judgments, errors, and confuſions, which have before ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world of mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Miniſters, and the people that have been under their care, muſt meet together at that time to receive an eternal ſentence and retribution from the Judge, in the preſence of each other, according to their behaviour in the relation they ſtood in, one to another in the preſent ſtate.</p>
               <p>The Judge will not only declare juſtice, but he will do juſtice between miniſters and their people. He will declare what is right between them, approving him that has been juſt and faithful, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unjuſt; and perfect truth and equity ſhall take place in the ſentence which he paſſes, in the rewards he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows, and the puniſhments which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts. There ſhall be a glorious reward to faithful miniſters; to thoſe who have been ſucceſsful. Dan. xii.3. "And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament, and they that
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:049067_0109_10264FC4FB1A66D0"/>
turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever:" And alſo to thoſe who have been faithful, and yet not ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Iſai. xlix.4. "Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought; yet ſurely my judgment is with the Lord, and my reward with my God." And thoſe who have well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entertained them ſhall be gloriouſly rewarded; Matth. x.40.41. "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, ſhall receive a prophet's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous man's reward." Such people, and their faithful miniſters, ſhall he each other's crown of rejoicing. 1 Theſ. ii.19.20. "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy." And in the text, <hi>We are your rejoicing, as ye alſo are ours, in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> But they that evil-intreat Chriſt's faithful miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially in that wherein they are faithful, ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed; Matth. x.14.15. "And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe or city, ſhake off the duſt of your feet. Verily I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for the ſinners of Sodom
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:049067_0110_10264FC6ABBAAFD8"/>
and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for that city." Deut. xxxiii.8.— 11. "And of Levi he ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let thy Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim and thy Urim be with thy holy one. —They ſhall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Iſrael thy law—bleſs, Lord, his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and accept the work of his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſmite through the loins of them that riſe againſt him, and of them that hate him, that they riſe not again." On the other hand, thoſe miniſters who are found to have been unfaithful, ſhall have a moſt terrible puniſhment. See Ezek. xxxiii.6.

               <p>Thus juſtice ſhall be adminiſtered at the great day to miniſters and their people: And to that end they ſhall meet together, that they may not only receive juſtice to themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſee juſtice done to the other party: For this is the end of that great day, to reveal or declare the righteous judgment of God; Rom. ii.5. Miniſters ſhall have juſtice done them, and they ſhall ſee juſtice done to their people: And the people ſhall receive juſtice themſelves from their Judge, and ſhall ſee juſtice done to their miniſter.— And ſo all things will be adjuſted and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled for ever between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every one being ſentenced and recompenſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works, either in receiving and wearing a crown of eternal joy and glory, or in ſuffering everlaſting ſhame and pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:049067_0111_10264FCA710A94A8"/>I come now to the next thing propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To give ſome reaſons why we may ſuppoſe God has ſo ordered it, that miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the people that have been under their care, ſhall meet together at the day of judgment, in ſuch a manner and for ſuch purpoſes.</p>
               <p>There are two things which I would now obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The mutual concerns of miniſters and their people are of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>The Scripture declares, that God will bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. It is fit that all the concerns, and all the behaviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, both public and private, ſhould be brought at laſt before God's tribunal, and finally determined by an infallible Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it is eſpecially requiſite that it ſhould be thus, as to affairs of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Now the mutual concerns of a Chriſtian miniſter and his church and congregation, are of the vaſteſt importance: in many reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of much greater moment than the temporal concerns of the greateſt earthly monarchs, and their kingdoms or empires. It is of vaſt conſequence how miniſters diſcharge their office, and conduct themſelves towards their people in the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:049067_0112_10264FCCF458E8D0"/>
work of the miniſtry, and in affairs apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it. It is alſo a matter of vaſt importance, how a people receive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a faithful miniſter of Chriſt, and what improvement they make of his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry. Theſe things have a more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and direct reſpect to the great and laſt end for which man was made, and the eternal welfare of mankind, than any of the temporal concerns of men, whether public or private. And therefore it is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially fit that theſe affairs ſhould be brought into judgment, and openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and ſettled in truth and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs; and that to this end, miniſters and their people ſhould meet together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the omniſcient and infallible Judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The mutual concerns of miniſters and their people have a ſpecial relation to the main things appertaining to the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>They have a ſpecial relation to that great and divine perſon who then will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as Judge. Miniſters are his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſent forth by him; and, in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and adminiſtrations among their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, repreſent his perſon, ſtand in his ſtead, as thoſe that are ſent to declare his mind, to do his work, and to ſpeak and act in his name: And therefore it is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit that they ſhould return to him to give an account of their work and ſucceſs. The king is judge of all his ſubjects, they
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:049067_0113_10264FCE79DDD3D8"/>
are all accountable to him: But it is more eſpecially requiſite that the king's miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who are eſpecially intruſted with the adminiſtrations of his kingdom, and that are ſent forth on ſome ſpecial negociation, ſhould return to him, to give an account of themſelves, and their diſcharge of their truſt, and the reception they have met with.</p>
               <p>Miniſters are not only meſſengers of the perſon who at the laſt day will appear as Judge, but the errand they are ſent upon, and the affairs they have committed to them as his miniſters, do moſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern his honour, and the intereſt: of his kingdom: The work they are ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to promote the deſigns of his admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration and government; and therefore their buſineſs with their people has a near relation to the day of judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the great end of that day is completely to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and eſtabliſh the affairs of his kingdom, to adjuſt all things that pertain to it, that every thing that is oppoſite to the intereſts of his kingdom may be removed, and that every thing which contributes to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleteneſs and glory of it may be perfected and confirmed, that this great King may receive his due honour and glory.</p>
               <p>Again, the mutual concerns of miniſters and their people have a direct relation to the concerns of the day of judgment, as the buſineſs of miniſters with their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:049067_0114_10264FD10B8D32F8"/>
is to promote the eternal ſalvation of the ſouls of men, and their eſcape from eternal damnation; and the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the day appointed for that end, openly to decide and ſettle men's eternal ſtate, to fix ſome in a ſtate of eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to bring their ſalvation to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſummation, and to fix others in a ſtate of everlaſting damnation and moſt perfect miſery. The mutual concerns of miniſters and people have a moſt direct relation to the day of judgment, as the very deſign of the work of the miniſtry is the people's preparation for that day: Miniſters are ſent to warn them of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that day, to forewarn them of the dreadful ſentence then to be pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the wicked, and declare to them the bleſſed ſentence then to be pronounced on the righteous, and to uſe means with them that they may eſcape the wrath which is then to come on the ungodly, and obtain the reward then to be beſtowed on the ſaints.</p>
               <p>And as the mutual concerns of miniſters and their people have ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ear and direct a relation to that day, it is eſpecially fit that thoſe concerns ſhould be brought into that day, and there ſettled and iſſued; and that in order to this, miniſters and their people ſhould meet and appear together before the great Judge at that day.</p>

               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>The improvement I would make of the things which have been obſerved, is to lead the people here preſent, who have been under my paſtoral care, to ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and give them ſome advice ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our preſent circumſtances; relating to what has been lately done in order to our being ſeparated, as to the relation we have heretofore ſtood in one to another; but expecting to meet each other before the great tribunal at the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>The deep and ſerious conſideration of that our future moſt ſolemn meeting, is certainly moſt ſuitable at ſuch a time as this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there having ſo lately been that done, which, in all probability, will (as to the relation we have heretofore ſtood in) be followed with an everlaſting ſeparation.</p>
               <p>How often have we met together in the houſe of God in this relation? how often have I ſpoken to you, inſtructed, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, warned, directed, and fed you, and adminiſtered ordinances among you, as the people which were committed to my care, and whoſe precious ſouls I had the charge of? but in all probability, this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be again.</p>
               <p>The prophet Jeremiah, (chap. xxxv.3.) puts the people in mind how long he had laboured among them in the work of the miniſtry: "From the thirteenth year of Joſiah, the ſon of Amon, king of Judah,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:049067_0116_10264FD7707F6F90"/>
even unto this day (that is, the three and twentieth year) the word of the Lord came unto me, and I have ſpoken unto you, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing early and ſpeaking." I am not about to compare myſelf with the prophet Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah; but in this reſpect I can ſay as he did, that "I have ſpoken the word of God to you, unto the three and twentieth year, riſing early and ſpeaking." It was three and twenty years, the 15th day of laſt Februray, ſince I have laboured in the work of the miniſtry, in the relation of a paſtor to this church and congregation.— And though my ſtrength has been weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, having always laboured under great infirmity of body, beſides my inſufficiency for ſo great a charge in other reſpects, yet I have not ſpared my feeble ſtrength, but have exerted it for the good of your ſouls. I can appeal to you, as the apoſtle does to his hearers, Gal. iv.13. "Ye know how through infirmity of the fleſh, I preached the goſpel unto you." I have ſpent the prime of my life and ſtrength in labours for your eternal welfare. You are my witneſſes, that what ſtrength I have had, I have not neglected in idleneſs, nor laid out in proſecuting worldly ſchemes, and managing temporal affairs, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of my outward eſtate, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing myſelf and family; but have given myſelf to the work of the miniſtry, labouring in it night and day, riſing early,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:049067_0117_10264FD8F77BB088"/>
and applying myſelf to this great buſineſs to which Chriſt appointed me. I have found the work of the miniſtry among you to be a great work indeed, a work of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding care, labour, and difficulty: Many have been the heavy burdens that I have borne in it, which my ſtrength has been very unequal to. God called me to bear theſe burdens; and I bleſs his name, that he has ſo ſupported me as to keep me from ſinking under them, and that his power herein has been manifeſted in my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that although I have often been troubled on every ſide, yet I have not been diſtreſſed; perplexed, but not in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; caſt down, but not deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>But now I have reaſon to think my work is finiſhed which I had to do as your miniſter: You have publicly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and my opportunities ceaſe.</p>
               <p>How highly, therefore, does it now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us, to conſider of that time when we muſt meet one another before the chief Shepherd? When I muſt give an account of my ſtewardſhip, of the ſervice I have done for, and the reception and treatment I have had among the people he ſent me to: And you muſt give an account of your own conduct towards me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the improvement you have made of theſe three and twenty years of my miniſtry. For then both you and I muſt appear together, and we both muſt give an account, in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:049067_0118_10264FDB84436A58"/>
to an infallible righteous and eternal ſentence to be paſſed upon us, by him who will judge us with reſpect to all that we have ſaid or done in our meetings here, all our conduct one towards another, in the houſe of God and elſewhere, on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath days and on other days; who will try our hearts, and manifeſt our thoughts, and the principles and frames of our minds, will judge us with reſpect to all the controverſies which have ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, with the ſtricteſt impartiality, and will examine our treatment of each other in thoſe controverſies: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing covered, that ſhall not be revealed, nor hid, which ſhall not be known; all will be examined in the ſearching pene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trating light of God's omniſcience and glory, and by him whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire; and truth and right ſhall be made plainly to appear, being ſtripped of every veil; and all error, falſehood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and injury ſhall be laid open, ſtripped of every diſguiſe; every ſpecious pretence, every cavil, and all falſe reaſoning, ſhall vaniſh in a moment, as not being able to bear the light of that day.— And then our hearts will be turned inſide out, and the ſecrets of them will be made more plainly to appear than our outward actions do now. Then it ſhall appear what the ends are which we have aimed at, what have been the governing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:049067_0119_10264FDF24CA6178"/>
which we have acted from, and what have been the diſpoſitions we have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in our eccleſiaſtical diſputes and conteſts. Then it will appear, whether I acted uprightly, and from a truly conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious careful regard to my duty to my great Lord and Maſter, in ſome former eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical controverſies, which have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with exceeding unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and conſequences: It will appear whether there was any juſt cauſe for the reſentment which was manifeſted on thoſe occaſions. And then our late grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, concerning the qualifications ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for admiſſion to the privileges of members, in complete ſtanding, in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church of Chriſt, will be examined and judged in all its parts and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the whole ſet forth in a clear, certain, and perfect light. Then it will appear whether the doctrine which I have preached and publiſhed concerning this matter be Chriſt's own doctrine, whether he will not own it as one of the precious truths which have proceeded from his own mouth, and vindicate and honour as ſuch before the whole univerſe. Then it will appear what is meant by "the man that comes without the wedding-garment;" for that is the day ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Matth. xxii.13. "wherein ſuch an one ſhall be bound hand and foot, and caſt into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:049067_0120_10264FE1ABAA0A20"/>
of teeth." And then it will appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in declaring this doctrine, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to it, and in my general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the affair, I have been influenced from any regard to my own temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or honour, or deſire to appear wiſer than others; or have acted from any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter ſecular views whatſoever; and wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what I have done has not been from a careful, ſtrict, and tender regard to the will of my Lord and Maſter, and becauſe I dare not offend him, being ſatisfied what his will was, after a long, diligent, impartial, and prayerful inquiry; having this conſtantly in view and proſpect, to engage me to great ſolicitude not raſhly to determine truth to be on this ſide of the queſtion where I am now perſuaded it is, that ſuch a determination would not be for my temporal intereſt, but every way againſt it, bringing a long ſeries of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulties, and plunging me into an abyſs of trouble and ſorrow. And then it will appear whether my people have done their duty to their paſtor with reſpect to this matter, whether they have ſhown a right temper and ſpirit on this occaſion; whether they have done me juſtice in hearing, attending to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what I had to ſay in evidence of what I believed and taught as part of the counſel of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether I have been treated with that impartiality, candour,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:049067_0121_10264FE3314D6DF0"/>
and regard which the juſt judge eſteemed due; and whether, in the many ſteps which have been taken, and the many things that have been ſaid and done in the courſe of this controverſy, righteouſneſs, and charity, and Chriſtian decorum has been maintained; or if otherwiſe, to how great a degree theſe things have been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Then every ſtep of the conduct of each of us in this affair, from firſt to laſt, and the ſpirit we have exerciſed in all, ſhall be examined and manifeſted, and our own conſciences will ſpeak plain and loud, and each of us ſhall be convinced, and the world ſhall know; and never ſhall there be any more miſtake, miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or miſapprehenſion of the affair to eternity.</p>
               <p>This controverſy is now probably brought to an iſſue between you and me as to this world; it has iſſued in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the week before laſt: But it muſt have another deciſion at that great day, which certainly will come, when you and I ſhall meet together before the great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat: And therefore I leave it to that time, and ſhall ſay no more about it at preſent.</p>
               <p>But I would now proceed to addreſs myſelf particular to ſeveral ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To thoſe who are profeſſors of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:049067_0122_10264FE5B8C8A6D0"/>I would now call you to a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that great day wherein you muſt meet him who has heretofore been your paſtor, before the Judge whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured, according to my beſt ability, to ſearch the word of God, with regard to the diſtinguiſhing notes of true piety, thoſe by which perſons might beſt diſcover their ſtate, and moſt ſurely and clearly judge of themſelves. And theſe rules and marks I have from time to time applied to you, in the preaching of the word, to the utmoſt of my ſkill, and in the moſt plain and ſearching manner that I have been able, in order to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the deceived hypocrite, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the hopes and comforts of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. And yet it is to be feared, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that I have done, I now leave ſome of you in a deceived deluded ſtate; for it is not to be ſuppoſed that among ſeveral hundred profeſſors, none are deceived.</p>
               <p>Henceforward I am like to have no more opportunity to take the care and charge of your ſouls, to examine and ſearch them. But ſtill I entreat you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and conſider the rules which I have often laid down to you during my miniſtry, with a ſolemn regard to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture day when you and I muſt meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before our Judge; when the uſe of examination you have heard from me
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:049067_0123_10264FE946084020"/>
muſt be rehearſed again before you, and thoſe rules of trial muſt be tried, and it will appear whether they have been good or not; and it will alſo appear whether you have impartially heard them, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yourſelves by them; and the Judge himſelf, who is infallible, will try both you and me: And after this none will be deceived concerning the ſtate of their ſouls:</p>
               <p>I have often put you in mind, that whatev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er your pretences to experiences, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, comforts, and joys, have been, at that day every one will be judged according to his works; and then you will find it ſo.</p>
               <p>May you have a miniſter of greater knowledge of the word of God, and better acquaintance with ſoul caſes, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſkill in applying himſelf to ſouls, whoſe diſcourſes may be more ſearching and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; that ſuch of you as have held faſt deceit under my preaching, may have your eyes opened by his; that you may be undeceived before that great day.</p>
               <p>What means and helps for inſtruction and ſelf-examination you may hereafter have is uncertain; but one thing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the time is ſhort, your opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for rectifying miſtakes in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a concern will ſoon come to an end. We live in a world of great changes.— There is now a great change come to paſs; you have withdrawn yourſelves from my

miniſtry, under which you have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſo many years: But the time is coming, and will ſoon come, when you will paſs out of time into eternity; and ſo will paſs from under all means of grace whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The greater part of you who are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of godlineſs have, (to uſe the phraſe of the apoſtle,) "acknowledged me in part:" You have heretofore acknowledged me to be your ſpiritual father, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt good to you that ever is, or can be obtained by any of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men. Conſider of that day when you and I ſhall meet before our Judge, when it ſhall be examined whether you have had from me the treatment which is due to ſpiritual children, and whether you have treated me as you ought to have treated a ſpiritual father. As the relation of a natural parent brings great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on children in the ſight of God; ſo much more, in many reſpects, does the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a ſpiritual father bring great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations on ſuch whoſe converſion and eternal ſalvation they ſuppoſe God has made them the inſtruments of: 1 Cor. iv.15. "For though you have ten thouſand inſtructors in Chriſt, yet have ye not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fathers: for in Chriſt Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have begotten you through the goſpel."</p>
               <p n="2">II. Now I am taking my leave of this people, I would apply myſelf to ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:049067_0125_10264FED4E03EBD0"/>
them as I leave in a Chriſtleſs, graceleſs condition; and would call on ſuch ſeriouſly to conſider of that ſolemn day when they and I muſt meet before the Judge of the world.</p>
               <p>My parting with you is in ſome reſpects in a peculiar manner a melancholy part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in as much as I leave you in moſt melancholy circumſtances; becauſe I leave you in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity, having the wrath of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on you, and remaining under condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to everlaſting miſery and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Seeing I muſt leave you, it would have been a comfortable and happy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of our parting, if I had left you in Chriſt, ſafe and bleſſed in that ſure ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge and glorious reſt of the ſaints. But it is otherwiſe, I leave you far off, aliens and ſtrangers, wretched ſubjects, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ſin and Satan, and priſoners of vindictive juſtice; without Chriſt, and without God in the world.</p>
               <p>Your conſciences hear me witneſs, that while I had opportunity, I have not ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to warn you, and ſet before you your danger. I have ſtudied to repreſent the miſery and neceſſity of your circumſtances in the cleareſt manner poſſible. I have tried all ways that I could think of tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to awaken your conſciences, and make you ſenſible of the neceſſity of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving your time, and being ſpeedy in
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:049067_0126_10264FF112C8C2F8"/>
dying from the wrath to come, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough in the uſe of means for your eſcape and ſafety, I have diligently endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find out and uſe the moſt powerful motives to perſuade you to take care for your own welfare and ſalvation. I have not only endeavoured to awaken you, that you might be moved with fear, but I have uſed my utmoſt endeavours to win you: I have fought out acceptable words, that if poſſible I might prevail upon you to forſake ſin, and turn to God, and accept of Chriſt as your Saviour and Lord. I have ſpent my ſtrength very much in theſe things. But yet, with regard to you whom I am now ſpeaking to, I have not been ſucceſsful: But have this day reaſon to complain in thoſe words, Jer. vi.29. "The bellows are burnt, the lead is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed of the fire, the founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not plucked away." It is to be feared that all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as to many of you, have ſerved to no other purpoſe but to harden you; and that the word which I have preached, inſtead of being a favour of life unto life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has been a favour of death unto death. Though I ſhall not have any account to give for the future of ſuch as have openly and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely renounced my miniſtry, as of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtment committed to me; yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you muſt give account for yourſelves, of your care of your own ſouls, and your
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:049067_0127_10264FF3D10963A0"/>
improvement of all means paſt and future, through your whole lives. God only knows what will become of your poor periſhing ſouls, what means you may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after enjoy, or what diſadvantages and temptations you may be under. May God in mercy grant, that however all paſt means have been unſucceſsful, you may have future means which may have a new effect; and that the word of God, as it ſhall be hereafter diſpenſed to you, may prove as the fire and the hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces. However, let me now at parting exhort and beſeech you not wholly to forget the warnings you have had while under my miniſtry.— When you and I ſhall meet at the day of judgment, then you will remember them: The ſight of me your former miniſter, on that occaſion, will ſoon revive them in your memory; and that in a very affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. O do not let that be the firſt time that they are ſo revived!</p>
               <p>You and I are now parting one from another as to this world; let us labour that we may not be parted after our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the laſt day. If I have been your faithful paſtor, (which will that day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, whether I have or not) then I ſhall be acquitted, and ſhall aſcend with Chriſt. O do your part, that in ſuch a caſe, it may not be ſo, that you ſhould be forced eternally to part from me, and all
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:049067_0128_10264FF55A76C7C0"/>
that have been faithful in Chriſt Jeſus. This is a ſorrowful parting that now is between you and me; but that would be a more ſorrowful parting to you than this. This you may perhaps bear without being much affected with it, if you are not glad of it; but ſuch a parting in that day will moſt deeply, ſenſibly, and dreadfully, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I would addreſs myſelf to thoſe who are under ſome awakenings.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be God that there are ſome ſuch, and that (although I have reaſon to fear I leave multitudes in this large congregation in a Chriſtleſs ſtate) yet I do not leave them all in total ſtupidity and careleſſneſs about their ſouls. Some of you, that I have reaſon to hope are under ſome awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, have acquainted me with your circumſtances; which has a tendency to cauſe me, now I am leaving you, to take my leave of you with peculiar concern for you. What will be the iſſue of your preſent exerciſe of mind I know not: But it will be known at that day, when you and I ſhall meet before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt. Therefore now be much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that day.</p>
               <p>Now I am parting with this flock, I would once more preſs upon you the counſels I have heretofore given, to take heed of being ſlighty in ſo great a concern, to be thorough and in good earneſt in the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:049067_0129_10264FF7DDEB2248"/>
affair, and to beware of backſliding, to hold on and hold out to the end. And cry mightily to God, that theſe great changes that paſs over this church and congregation do not prove your overthrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is great temptations in them; and the devil will undoubtedly ſeek to make his advantage of them, if poſſible, to cauſe your preſent convictions and endeavours to be abortive. You had need to double your diligence, and watch and pray, leſt you be overcome by temptation.</p>
               <p>Whoever may hereafter ſtand related to you as your ſpiritual guide, my deſire and prayer is, that the great Shepherd of the ſheep would have a ſpecial reſpect to you, and be your guide, (for there is none teacheth like him,) and that he who is the infinite fountain of light, would "open your eyes, and turn you from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that you may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified, through faith that is in Chriſt;" that ſo, in that great day, when I ſhall meet you again before your Judge and mine, we may meet in joyful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circumſtances, never to be ſeparated any more.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I would apply myſelf to the young people of the congregation.</p>
               <p>Since I have been ſettled in the work of the miniſtry in this place. I have ever
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:049067_0130_10264FFB9A3676E8"/>
had a perculiar concern for the ſouls of the young people, and a deſire that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might flouriſh among them; and have eſpecially exerted myſelf in order to it; becauſe I knew the ſpecial opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they have beyond others, and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily thoſe whom God intended mercy for were brought to fear and love him in their youth. And it has ever appeared to me a peculiarly amiable thing, to ſee young people walking in the ways of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Chriſtian piety, having their hearts purified and ſweetened with a principle of divine love. And it has appeared a thing exceeding beautiful, and what would be much to the adorning and happineſs of the town, if the young people could be perſuaded, when they meet together, to converſe as Chriſtians, and as the children of God; avoiding impurity, levity, and extravagance; keeping ſtrictly to rules of virtue, and converſing together of the things of God, and Chriſt, and heaven.— This is what I have longed for: And it has been exceeding grievous to me when I have heard of vice, vanity, and diſorder among our youth. And ſo far as I know my heart, it was from hence that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly led this church to ſome meaſures, for the ſuppreſſing vice among our young people, which gave ſo great offence, and by which I became ſo obnoxious. I have fought the good and not the hurt of our
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:049067_0131_10264FFD618CB308"/>
young people. I have deſired their trueſt honour and happineſs, and not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; knowing that true virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion tended not only to the glory and felicity of young people in another world, but their greateſt peace and proſperity, and higheſt dignity and honour, in this world; and above all things to ſweeten, and render pleaſant and delightful, even the days of youth.</p>
               <p>But whether I have loved you, and ſought your good more or leſs, yet God in his providence, now calling me to part with you, committing your ſouls to him who once committed the paſtoral care of them to me, nothing remains, but only (as I am now taking my leave of you) earneſtly to beſeech you, from love to yourſelves, if you have none to me, not to deſpiſe and forget the warnings and counſels I have ſo often given you; remembering the day when you and I moſt meet again before the great Judge of quick and dead; when it will appear whether the things I have taught you were true, whether the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels I have given you were good, and whether I truly ſought your good, and whether you have well improved my endeavours.</p>
               <p>I have, from time to time, earneſtly warned you againſt frolicking (as it is called,) and ſome other liberties common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken by young people in the land.—
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:049067_0132_10265000E45CD680"/>
And whatever ſome may ſay in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch liberties and cuſtoms, and may laugh at warnings againſt them, I now leave you my parting teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch things; not doubting but God will approve and confirm it in that day when we ſhall meet before them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I would apply myſelf to the children of the congregation, the lambs of this flock, who have been ſo long under my care.</p>
               <p>I have juſt now ſaid that I have had a peculiar concern for the young people; and in ſo ſaying, I did not intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude you. You are in youth, and in the moſt early youth: And therefore I have been ſenſible, that if thoſe that were young had a precious opportunity for their ſoul's good, you who are very young, had, in many reſpects, a peculiarly precious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. And accordingly I have not neglected you: I have endeavoured to do the part of a faithful ſhepherd, in feeding the lambs as well as the ſheep. Chriſt did once commit the care of your ſouls to me as your miniſter; and you know, dear children, how I have inſtructed you, and warned you from time to time: You know how I have often called you together for that end; and ſome of you, ſometimes, have ſeemed to be affected with what I have ſaid to you. But I am afraid it has had no ſaving effect as to many of you;
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:049067_0133_102650036A88BF88"/>
but that you remain ſtill in an unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, without any real ſaving work wrought in your ſouls, convincing you thoroughly of your ſin and miſery, cauſing you to ſee the great evil of ſin, and to mourn for it, and hate it above all things; and giving you a ſenſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with all your hearts to cleave to him as your Saviour, weaning your hearts from the world, and cauſing you to love God above all, and to delight in holineſs more than in all the pleaſant things of this earth: And ſo that I now leave you in a miſerable condition, having no intereſt in Chriſt, and ſo under the awful diſpleaſure and anger of God, and in danger of going down to the pit of eternal miſery.</p>
               <p>But now I muſt bid you farewell: I muſt leave you in the hands of God: I can do no more for you than to pray for you. Only I deſire you not to forget, but often think of the counſels and warnings I have given you, and the endeavours I have uſed, that your ſouls might be ſaved from everlaſting deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Dear children, I leave you in an evil world, that is full of ſnares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. God only knows what will become of you. This the Scripture has told us, that there are but few ſaved; and we have abundant confirmation of it from what we ſee. This we ſee, that children die as
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:049067_0134_10265004F215F1F8"/>
well as others: Multitudes die before they grow up; and of thoſe that grow up, comparatively few ever give good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſaving converſion to God. I pray God to pity you, and take care of you, and provide for you the beſt means for the good of your ſouls; and that God himſelf would undertake for you, to be your heavenly Father, and the mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of your immortal ſouls. Do not neglect to pray for yourſelves: Take heed you be not of the number of thoſe who caſt off fear, and reſtrain prayer before God. Conſtantly pray to God in ſecret; and often remember that great day when you muſt appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, and meet your miniſter there, who has ſo often counſelled and warned you.</p>
               <p>I conclude with a few words of advice to all in general, in ſome particulars, which are of great importance in order to the future welfare and proſperity of this church and congregation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One thing that greatly concerns you, as you would be an happy people, is the maintaining of family order.</p>
               <p>We have had great diſputes how the church ought to be regulated; and indeed the ſubject of theſe diſputes was of great importance: But the due regulation of your families is of no leſs, and, in ſome reſpects, of much greater importance.—
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:049067_0135_10265008B67DE7C8"/>
Every Chriſtian family ought to be as it were a little church, conſecrated to Chriſt, and wholly influenced and governed by his rules. And family education and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are ſome of the chief of the means of grace. If theſe fail, all other means are like to prove ineffectual. If theſe are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained, all the means of grace will be like to proſper and be ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Let me now therefore, once more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I finally ceaſe to ſpeak to this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, repeat, and earneſtly preſs the counſel which I have often urged on heads of families here, while I was their paſtor, to great painfulneſs, in teaching, warning, and directing their children; bringing them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord; beginning early, where there is yet opportunity, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a conſtant diligence in labours of this kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Remembering that, as you would not have all your inſtructions and counſels ineffectual, there muſt be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as inſtructions, which muſt be maintained with an even hand, and ſteady reſolution, as a guard to the religion and morals of the family, and the ſupport of its good order. Take heed that it be not with any of you as it was with Eli of old, who reproved his children, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them not; and that, by this means, you do not bring the like curſe on your families as he did on his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:049067_0136_1026500B46FB5A80"/>And let children obey their parents, and yield to their inſtructions, and ſubmit to their orders, as they would inherit a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and not a curſe. For we have reaſon to think, from many things in the word of God, that nothing has a greater tendency to bring a curſe on perſons in this world, and on all their temporal concerns, than an undutiful, unſubmiſſive, diſorderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in children towards their parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As you would ſeek the future proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of this ſociety, it is of vaſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that you ſhould avoid contention.</p>
               <p>A contentious people will be a miſerable people. The contentions which have been among you, ſince I firſt became your paſtor, have been one of the greateſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens I have laboured under in the courſe of my miniſtry: Not only the contentions you have had with me, but thoſe which you have had one with another, about your lands, and other concerns. Becauſe I knew that contention, heat of ſpirit, evil-ſpeaking, and things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were directly contrary to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, and did, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, tend to drive away God's Spirit from a people, and to render all means of grace ineffectual, as well as to deſtroy a people's outward comfort and welfare.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore earneſtly exhort you, as you would ſeek your own future good, hereafter to watch againſt a contentious
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:049067_0137_1026500CCCAFC998"/>
ſpirit. "If you would ſee good days, ſeek peace, and enſue it." 1 Pet. iii.10.11. Let the contentions which has lately been about the terms of Chriſtian communion, as it has been the greateſt of your conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo be the laſt of them. I would, now I am preaching my farewell ſermon, ſay to you, as the apoſtle to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. xiii.11.: "Finally, brethren, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Be perfect: Be of one mind: Live in peace; and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you."</p>
               <p>And here I would particularly adviſe thoſe that have adhered to me in the late controverſy, to watch over their ſpirits, and avoid all bitterneſs towards others.— Your temptations are, in ſome reſpects, the greateſt; becauſe what has been lately done is grievous to you. But however wrong you may think others have done, maintain, with great diligence and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, a Chriſtian meekneſs and ſedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit; and labour, in this reſpect, to excel others who are of the contrary part. And this will be the beſt victory: For "he that rules his ſpirit, is better than he that takes a city." Therefore let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory. Indulge no revengeful ſpirit in any wiſe; but watch and pray againſt it: and, by all means in your power, ſeek the proſperity of this town: And never think you behave yourſelves as becomes Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:049067_0138_1026500F4CF3FAA0"/>
but when you ſincerely, ſenſibly, and fervently love all men, of whatever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or opinion, and whether friendly or unkind, juſt or injurious, to you or your friends, or to the cauſe and kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another thing that vaſtly concerns the future proſperity of the town, is, that you ſhould watch againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of error; and particularly Armin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianiſm, and doctrines of like tendency.</p>
               <p>You were, many of you, as I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, much alarmed with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the danger of the prevailing of theſe corrupt principles, near ſixteen years ago. But the danger then was ſmall in compariſon of what appears now. Theſe doctrines at this day are much more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than they were then: The progreſs they have made in the land, within this ſeven years, ſeems to have been vaſtly greater than at any time in the like ſpace before: And they are ſtill prevailing and creeping into almoſt all parts of the land, threatening the utter ruin of the credit of thoſe doctrines which are the peculiar glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the goſpel, and the intereſts of vital piety. And I have of late perceived ſome things among yourſelves, that ſhew that you are far from being out of danger, but on the contrary remarkably expoſed. The older people may perhaps think themſelves ſufficiently fortified againſt infection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:049067_0139_10265012C8801620"/>
But it is fit that all ſhould beware of ſelf confidence and carnal ſecurity, and ſhould remember thoſe needful warnings of ſacred writ, "Be not high minded, but fear; and let him that ſtands, take heed leſt he fall." But let the caſe of the older people be as it will, the riſing generation are doubtleſs greatly expoſed. Theſe principles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding taking with corrupt nature, and are what young people, at leaſt ſuch as have not their hearts eſtabliſhed with grace, are eaſily led away with.</p>
               <p>And if theſe principles ſhould greatly prevail in this town, as they very lately have done in another large town I could name, formerly greatly noted for religion, and ſo for a long time, it will threaten the ſpiritual and eternal ruin of this people, in the preſent and future generations. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have need of the greateſt and moſt diligent care and watchfulneſs with reſpect to this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another thing which I would adviſe to, that you may hereafter be a proſperous people, is, that you would give yourſelves much to prayer.</p>
               <p>God is the fountain of all beſſing and proſperity, and he will be ſought to for his bleſſing. I would therefore adviſe you not only to be conſtant in ſecret and family prayer, and in the public worſhip of God in his houſe, but alſo often to aſſemble yourſelves in private praying ſocieties. I
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:049067_0140_102650154F6B7AB0"/>
would adviſe all ſuch as are grieved for the afflictions of Joſeph, and ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the calamities of this town, of whatever opinon they be with relation to the ſubject of our late controverſy, often to meet together for prayer, and to cry to God for his mercy to themſelves, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to this town, and mercy to Zion and the people of God in general through the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt article of advice I would give (which doubtleſs does greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your proſperity) is, that you would take great care with regard to the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a miniſter, to ſee to it who, or what manner of perſon he is that you ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and particularly in theſe two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That he be a man of thoroughly ſound principles, in the ſcheme of doctrine which he maintains.</p>
               <p>This you will ſtand in the greateſt need of, eſpecially at ſuch a day of corruption as this is. And in order to obtain ſuch a one, you had need to exerciſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care and prudence.—I know the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I know the manner of many young gentlemen of corrupt principles, their ways of concealing themſelves, the fair ſpecious diſguiſes they are wont to put on, by which they deceive others, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own credit, and get themſelves into others confidence and improvement, and ſecure and eſtabliſh their own intereſt,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:049067_0141_10263A6D95F0A748"/>
until they ſee a convenient opportunity to begin more openly to broach and propagate their corrupt tenets.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Labour to obtain a man who has an eſtabliſhed character, as a perſon of ſerious religion and fervent piety.</p>
               <p>It is of vaſt importance that thoſe who are ſettled in this work ſhould be men of true piety, at all times, and in all places; but more eſpecially at ſome times, and in ſome towns and churches. And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, which is a time wherein reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in danger, by ſo many corruptions in doctrine and practice, is in a peculiar manner a day wherein ſuch miniſters are neceſſary. Nothing elſe but ſincere piety of heart is at all to be depended on, at ſuch a time as this, as a ſecurity to a young man, juſt coming into the world, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing infection, or thoroughly to engage him in proper and ſucceſsful endeavours to withſtand and oppoſe the torrent of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and prejudice, againſt the high myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious evangelical doctrines of the religion of Jeſus Chriſt, and their genuine effects in true experimental religion. And this place is a place that does peculiarly need ſuch a miniſter, for reaſons obvious to all.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould happen to ſettle a miniſter who knows nothing truly of Chriſt, and the way of ſalvation by him, nothing experimentally of the nature of vital reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; alas, how will you be expoſed as ſheep without a ſhepherd! Here is need of one in this place, who ſhall be eminently fit to ſtand in the gap, and make up the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:049067_0142_102650197A636EF8"/>
hedge, and who ſhall be as the chariots of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof. You need one that ſhall ſtand as a champion in the cauſe of truth and the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
               <p>Having briefly mentioned theſe important articles of advice, nothing remains, but that I now take my leave of you, and bid you all, farewell; wiſhing and praying for your beſt proſperity. I would now commend your immortal ſouls to him, who formerly committed them to me, expecting the day, when I muſt meet you again before him, who is the Judge of quick and dead. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that I may never forget this people, who have been ſo long my ſpecial charge, and that I may never ceaſe fervently to pray for your proſperity. May God bleſs you with a faithful paſtor, one that is well acquainted with his mind and will, thoroughly warning ſinners, wiſely and ſkilfully ſearching profeſſors, and conducting you in the way to eternal bleſſedneſs. May you have truly a burning and ſhining light ſet up in this candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick; and may you, not only for a ſeaſon, but during his whole life, and that a long life, be willing to rejoice in his light.</p>
               <p>And let me be remembered in the prayers of all God's people that are of a calm ſpirit, and are peaceable and faithful in Iſrael, of whatever opinion they may be with reſpect to terms of church communion.</p>
               <p>And let us all remember, and never forget our future ſolemn meeting on that great day of the Lord; the day of infallible deciſion and of the everlaſting and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſentence. Amen.</p>
