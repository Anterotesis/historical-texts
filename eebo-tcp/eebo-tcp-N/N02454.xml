            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AND this was the Wretched Iſſue of all the GOOD IMPRESSIONS which the Terrors of GOD had made upon them.

O! may we, on whom <hi>the End of the World is come,</hi> and who have had <hi>theſe things written for our Admonition,</hi> take warning from it!</p>
            <p>The Pſalm which relates the matter, contains a compendious <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> of Divine <hi>Favours</hi> conferred, and of Divine <hi>Judgments</hi> inflicted, on
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002908_0005_0FE692F69961A670"/>the Nation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from their Bondage in <hi>Egypt</hi> even to the Reign of <hi>David.</hi> The Rebellions of that People, againſt the glorious JEHOVAH, who made them His People, and His wondrous Patience, and Mercy, and Juſtice, towards them, under theſe Rebellions, are the main ſubject of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>In the particular Article we have now before us;</p>
            <p>Behold, firſt, a poor People under <hi>Good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> in a time of <hi>Danger;</hi> and from an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Glorious GOD coming to <hi>ſlay</hi> them. He <hi>ſlew</hi> ſome of them; Yea, an Horrendous EARTHQUAKE, was the way wherein He <hi>ſlew</hi> a Number of them. The Survivers were a while under <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> from ſuch occurrences. When they were afraid, that GOD was going to <hi>ſlay</hi> them, yea, to <hi>Damn</hi> them, for their Sins, <hi>Then</hi> they Bethought themſelves; <hi>Then</hi> they thought they would become the <hi>Diligent Seekers</hi> of GOD; <hi>Then</hi> they thought they would no more Deſpiſe their SAVIOUR. But then,</p>
            <p>Behold, next, what becomes of all theſe <hi>Good Impreſſions,</hi> when the <hi>Danger</hi> ſeems to be a little over with them. They are not <hi>Effectual</hi> ones; They are not <hi>Abiding</hi> ones; They all go off, with miſerable Demonſtrations, that their <hi>Hearts</hi> were the ſame they were before. They are not <hi>Sincere,</hi> and ſo they are not <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> in the Declarations they made, when the <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> were upon them. It becomes apparent, that all their ſhort lived <hi>Piety</hi> was but <hi>Flattery.</hi> The <hi>Good Impreſſion</hi> what are they <hi>but a Vapour, which appeareth for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and ſoon vaniſhes away?</hi> They ſoon <hi>Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate.</hi>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002908_0007_0FE692FC619E1C10"/>and <hi>Affrightment</hi> is how often, the <hi>Mother of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi> I wiſh, it may not be ſaid, a <hi>Spurious Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Imminent and ſenſible <hi>Dangers</hi> of Death, make Men grow <hi>Thoughtful;</hi> and it will be ſtrange, if the Advance of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> do not cauſe them to <hi>purify themſelves.</hi> They whom a ſenſe of <hi>Death</hi> approaching does not compel to ſome <hi>Sober Thoughts,</hi> what are they? Harden'd and Frantic — one can't ſay, <hi>What!</hi> — Not <hi>Rational Men.</hi> They do not act as Creatures exerciſing <hi>Reaſon,</hi> who caſt off all Thoughts of <hi>Religion,</hi> when they have <hi>Death</hi> ſtaring on them, ſcaring of them. It was once expoſtulated with a Malefactor in the Jaws of <hi>Death:</hi> Luk. XXIII. 40. <hi>Doſt not thou Fear GOD, ſeeing thou art under Condemnation?</hi> But that was a Monſter of a Man. Shall it be ſaid of a Man, <hi>He does not Fear GOD, when he is in a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that looks like a ſentence of Death upon him?</hi> Verily, 'Twill be a very monſtrous Character.</p>
            <p>We will Enquire, firſt, after the <hi>Ground,</hi> then, after the <hi>Proof,</hi> of this unhappy matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt; The <hi>Ground</hi> of it, is, A <hi>Conſcience</hi> excited by <hi>Dangers</hi> unto its Operations. In deadly <hi>Dangers,</hi> the <hi>Conſcience</hi> comes to operate. By <hi>Dangers,</hi> the Minds of Men are chaſed from thoſe things which drown'd the Murmurs of their <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Yea, in <hi>Dangers,</hi> People are compelled not only to bear the <hi>Murmurs</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Whiſpers</hi> are turned into <hi>Thunders.</hi> There is a <hi>Preacher</hi> in the Boſom of every Man; and upon <hi>Dangers,</hi> this <hi>Preacher</hi> becomes a <hi>Thunderer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Three Things, which the <hi>Thundering Voice</hi> of CONSCIENCE will ſpeak to People, when <hi>deadly Dangers</hi> are upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002908_0007_0FE692FC619E1C10"/>
One Admonition of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is This; O Man, There is the <hi>Providence</hi> of GOD in the <hi>Dangers</hi> that have now overtaken thee. <hi>Dangers</hi> don't come, nor ſo much as a <hi>little Bird</hi> fall into them, without the <hi>Providence</hi> of GOD. There is the Hand of GOD, in all the <hi>Dangers</hi> that are brought upon thee. GOD has taken thee into his Hand, when be thus brings <hi>Dangers</hi> upon thee. <hi>Conſcience</hi> now ſubſcribes to That; Amos III. 6. <hi>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it!</hi> O Thou expoſed one, GOD is the <hi>Doer,</hi> in all the <hi>Evil</hi> that is hanging over thee.</p>
            <p>A Second Admonition of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is This: 'Tis a GOD <hi>offended</hi> by thy <hi>Sin,</hi> who ſends thy <hi>Dangers</hi> upon thee. Thou art a <hi>Sinner.</hi> Thy <hi>Sin</hi> has been an <hi>Offence</hi> unto GOD; Thy <hi>Sin</hi> makes thee obnoxious unto the <hi>Anger</hi> of GOD; lays thee open unto the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of GOD. It is a Thing of the greateſt Importance, that the <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> of GOD, ſhould not remain burning againſt thee; A diſpleaſed GOD is an Adverſary, which — <hi>how can thy Hands be ſtrong, or how can thy Heart endure,</hi> to encounter with Him <hi>| Conſcience</hi> now ſubſcribes to Thee; Prov. XIII. 21. <hi>Evil purſueth Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Third Admonition of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is This: REPENTANCE, REPENTANCE! <hi>That</hi> is the moſt likely way to eſcape thy <hi>Dangers.</hi> O <hi>wicked</hi> one, <hi>Forſake</hi> thy <hi>ways;</hi> O <hi>unjuſt</hi> one, <hi>Forſake</hi> thy <hi>Thoughts; Return to the Lord, and He will have mercy!</hi> If thou <hi>Repenteſt not,</hi> thou mayſt Fear, that the <hi>Arrows prepared</hi> on the <hi>bent Bowe</hi> of GOD, will be let fly upon thee. The Language of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> now is That; Jon. III. 8, 9. <hi>Turn every one from his evil way, — who can tell, but GOD
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002908_0008_0FE6930D68096B90"/>may turn away from His fierce Anger, that we periſh not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Conſcience</hi> begins to <hi>Thunder</hi> at this rate, and make a Noiſe like the hideous Rumblings of an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> it muſt needs throw the Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened People into ſome <hi>Religious</hi> Diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Supplement</hi> unto this Meditation, let this be added. The Glorious GOD throws Men into <hi>Dangers</hi> on this very <hi>Deſign;</hi> To make them hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto what He ſpeaks by the Mouth of His Deputy, their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to them. Truly, Syrs, this is the very <hi>Errand</hi> that your <hi>Dangers</hi> are ſent upon. The <hi>Conſcience</hi> in Man, may complain, as in Jer. XXII. 21. <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy preſperity; But thou ſaidſt, I will not hear.</hi> Men are Deaf to <hi>Conſcience;</hi> It Groans, it Cries, it Thunders, and they do not regard it. GOD now does caſt Men into <hi>Dangers</hi> on this Intent; <hi>Man, Hear now, what thy Conſcience has to ſay unto thee: It has a Meſſage from GOD to thee!</hi> From this it is, that Men ſo <hi>ſeem to be Religious,</hi> when <hi>Dangers</hi> are upon them.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The <hi>Proof</hi> of it; For this we will repair unto <hi>Experience.</hi> And, <hi>Hear this, O all ye People, every one of you:</hi> May we not ſay, 'Tis <hi>your own Experience.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, of ſome; Iſa. XXVI. 16. <hi>Lord, In Trouble have they viſited thee; they poured out a Prayer, when thy Chaſtening was upon them.</hi> Yea, but our <hi>Experience</hi> will every day tell us, <hi>Lord,</hi> How many are they, who when they are <hi>afraid of Trouble,</hi> do ſay, <hi>They will viſit GOD every day as long as they live!</hi> How many are they who <hi>pour out a Prayer,</hi> when <hi>Danger</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them! O that the Sermon of this Day, might be a <hi>Sermon to bring unto Remembrance!</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002908_0008_0FE6930D68096B90"/>O our dear People, How many of you, may <hi>Remember</hi> the <hi>Dangers,</hi> wherein you were at that paſs; Jer. II. 20. <hi>Thou ſaidſt, I will not Tranſgreſs! Remember</hi> you not, what you ſaid, when you lay <hi>Sick,</hi> and like to <hi>Die</hi> of your Sickneſs, and pale <hi>Death</hi> look'd you in the Face, and you look'd on yourſelves as <hi>deprived of the Reſidue of your years,</hi> and Summoned before the Tribunal of GOD? <hi>Then</hi> you ſaid, <hi>Oh! If GOD will ſpare my life, I will do nothing but ſerve the GOD of my life: I will hate and loathe and ſhun all the Sin that once I loved; and lead a life of all Godlineſs and Honeſty! Remember</hi> you not, what you ſaid, when a <hi>Storm</hi> at Sea had almoſt ſwallowed you up, and you were caſt into Horror, by the <hi>Horrible Tempeſt;</hi> Your <hi>Soul</hi> was <hi>melted becauſe of Trouble;</hi> You ſaw yourſelves going down into the <hi>deep Waters;</hi> You fear'd you were going down into the <hi>Eternal Burnings? Then</hi> you ſaid; <hi>Oh! If GOD will pleaſe, that I may out-live this Death, I will never Sin againſt Him any more as heretofore! I will do nothing that may render my Death uneaſy and unwelcome to me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Memorandums</hi> are not over yet. My Friend, <hi>Remember</hi> you not, what you ſaid, when you were in the <hi>Land</hi> and the <hi>Hand</hi> of your <hi>Enemies;</hi> you <hi>ſat in Darkneſs,</hi> and in the <hi>ſhadow of Death;</hi> and you had little Hope of ever being again in the Arms of thoſe, who were now <hi>put far from</hi> you? <hi>Then</hi> you Cried unto the Lord; and you ſaid; <hi>Oh! If the Lord will Reſtore me to my Liberty, with what an Enlarged Heart ſhall I run the way of His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And will the Daughters of <hi>Eve</hi> give me leave to be a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> unto Them? When the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002908_0009_0FE6930D86D51D70"/>Time of your <hi>Travail</hi> and your <hi>Trouble,</hi> and the <hi>perils of Child bearing</hi> drew near, and you conceived yourſelves entring the <hi>Valley of the ſhadow of Death,</hi> You <hi>Then</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold, The Handmaid of the Lord! If the Lord carry me to and thro' my Time, I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever behave my ſelf as becomes an Handmaid of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, Do you Remember nothing of what you thought when you ſelf the Earth trembling and rumbling in a tremendous <hi>Earthquake</hi> under you? Did not your <hi>Hearts</hi> then <hi>ſmite</hi> you for your keeping at a diſtance from your SAVIOUR; and for the various Miſcarriages of an ungodly and unrighteous Life? And was it not the purpoſe of your Hearts, <hi>I will not offend any more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you don't <hi>Remember</hi> what you ſaid, GOD <hi>Remembers</hi> it; it is all down in the <hi>Book of His Remembrance.</hi> Perhaps, New <hi>Dangers</hi> and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are coming upon you, to bring it unto your own <hi>Remembrance; In the latter Days ye ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt now paſs on to a Second Remark. But, one that <hi>is a Lamentation, and ſhall be for a Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; Men uſe quickly to <hi>Forget</hi> how <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> they were, when their <hi>Dangers</hi> were upon them. T'was all but a <hi>Religious Pang.</hi> Ah, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful <hi>Pang!</hi> like the <hi>Morning Cloud,</hi> and the <hi>Early Dew; It paſſes away.</hi> We read of ſome, Pſal. CVI. 13. <hi>They ſoon forgot His Works.</hi> Even ſo, Men <hi>ſoon Forget</hi> what <hi>workings</hi> they had in their own Hearts, when they ſaw the <hi>Hand of GOD lifted up to ſmite them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002908_0009_0FE6930D86D51D70"/>
Of this thing, we are every where entertained with a mournful Evidence. The <hi>Bad lives</hi> of Men, make it moſt notoriouſly Evident. The moſt of Men lead <hi>Bad lives:</hi> They do not <hi>Live unto GOD.</hi> With what pungency may they feel it ſaid unto them; <hi>Can you ſay,</hi> That you lead ſuch a <hi>Life</hi> as you <hi>ſaid,</hi> you ſhould and would, when <hi>Deſtruction from GOD</hi> was a <hi>Terror</hi> to you? When our SAVIOUR was in the <hi>Temple,</hi> the Hearers that were <hi>Convicted in their own Conſcience</hi> by what He ſaid, <hi>Went out,</hi> and, <hi>Lo, He was left alone.</hi> Oh, How far, <hi>how far!</hi> — would it go towards break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Congregation, if all ſhould <hi>go out,</hi> who may be <hi>convicted in their own Conſcience,</hi> that they do not live, as under the <hi>Terrors</hi> of GOD, they ſaid, They would. A great Man once putting that Caſe to a good Man, <hi>How ſhall I order my life, that I may glorify GOD?</hi> He only gave him this Anſwer; <hi>Live as when you lately apprehended your ſelf a dying, you thought you would live, if GOD would let you live.</hi> There are many who do not <hi>glorify GOD.</hi> And we may conclude, They don't <hi>live,</hi> as in their <hi>Dangers,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>They would.</hi> Where one is <hi>Reformed,</hi> a Thouſand are <hi>as they were!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>whence does this come to paſs?</hi> 'Tis, From the <hi>Spirit of the Old Covenant</hi> in Mens Inclinations and Reſolutions. When the People of old were appall'd at the <hi>Lightnings</hi> and <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> of the Burning Mountain, they ſaid, <hi>All that the Lord ſhall ſpeak we will do.</hi> But it was with the <hi>Spirit of the Old Covenant</hi> that they ſaid it. GOD therefore ſaid upon it; Deut. V. 28. 29. <hi>I have heard the Voice of the Words of this People, which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002908_0010_0FE69314DC5042B0"/>they have ſpoken; They have well ſaid, all that they have ſpoken: Oh! That there were ſuch an Heart in them!</hi> — Even ſo. People remaining yet in the old <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> will ſay, <hi>This</hi> and <hi>That,</hi> and <hi>they will ſay very well in all that they ſpeak.</hi> Oh! But there is no more than a <hi>Voice of Words,</hi> in all that they have <hi>ſpoken:</hi> There wants a <hi>New Heart</hi> in them; There is no <hi>Heart</hi> in them to <hi>do</hi> what they <hi>ſay.</hi> Frighted People <hi>ſay,</hi> that they are <hi>Fallen out with Sin.</hi> But it is only from ſome <hi>External Compulſion</hi> upon them. The SPIRIT of GOD has not yet <hi>Internally Changed</hi> the <hi>Biaſs</hi> of their Minds: The <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> yet reigning in their Hearts is not extinguiſhed. They <hi>ſay,</hi> They will ſet themſelves to do the <hi>Things that pleaſe GOD.</hi> But they ſet themſelves about it in <hi>their own ſtrength.</hi> And thus, <hi>All</hi> preſently comes to <hi>Nothing!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No <hi>Dangers</hi> are enough to Convert a Sinner. I have ſeen Men brought from the <hi>Gallows,</hi> who yet have not been brought from the <hi>Wicked Courſes</hi> which had brought them to the <hi>Gallows.</hi> In go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their expected Execution, they have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aed unto me, <hi>That they had rather Dy that Afternoon, than return to the ways of wickedneſs which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lived in.</hi> They have had a <hi>Reprieve,</hi> and a <hi>Pardon.</hi> But how after <hi>That!</hi> Alas, I have ſeen the <hi>Dogs return to their vomit;</hi> and go on ſtill in their old <hi>ways of wickedneſs.</hi> Ah, ſinful Men! If One <hi>went unto them from the Dead,</hi> yet they <hi>will not Repent.</hi> The Devils and the Damned, with the hideous Chains and Flames of the <hi>Horrible Pit</hi> appearing to them, would not cauſe them to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> Should <hi>Hell</hi> be ſet open before their Eyes, and ſhould they be held over the <hi>Smoke of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002908_0010_0FE69314DC5042B0"/>which Aſcends forever and ever,</hi> t'wil do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to take out the <hi>Helliſh Tang</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> which is in their Souls. Till <hi>that</hi> be taken out by the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> there will be no <hi>Frighting</hi> Men out of their <hi>Sin.</hi> He that is <hi>Filthy</hi> will be <hi>Filthy ſtill.</hi> When the <hi>Dangers</hi> are over, you'l find it ſo!</p>
            <p>We read of mighty <hi>Legions,</hi> who after they have been Damned for ſeven Thouſand years, and have been actually, in the direful Torments of the Damned for one thouſand of them, yet being let looſe again, they play the <hi>Devil</hi> again juſt as they did a Thouſand years before; and again attempt with a Satanic Aſſault of <hi>Temptations</hi> to diſturb the <hi>Camp of the Saints,</hi> and with Diabolical Deluſions and Stratagems, draw in thoſe in the <hi>Hidden places of the Earth,</hi> who <hi>go up</hi> from under the <hi>Breadth of the Earth,</hi> to join with them in their War againſt the <hi>Holy ones. Hell</hi> it ſelf won't fetch out the <hi>ſinful Tendencies,</hi> in the Souls of the wicked. Not only <hi>if One went from the Dead</hi> unto the wicked that are not yet <hi>gone to the Dead,</hi> they will yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to <hi>Repent,</hi> but alſo if they that are there were permitted themſelves to <hi>go from the Dead,</hi> yet even Theſe would <hi>not Repent:</hi> Except with <hi>New Lives</hi> they ſhould alſo have <hi>New Hearts</hi> given them from Above. They that <hi>go down to Hell,</hi> with the <hi>Luſts</hi> in them which were the <hi>Weapons of their War,</hi> and have their <hi>Iniquities</hi> in their very <hi>Bones,</hi> if they that have been <hi>ſhut up in the Priſon,</hi> ſhould <hi>after many Days be Viſited,</hi> and Releaſed; they would again be as wicked as they were before.</p>
            <p>Be ſure, <hi>Earthquakes</hi> alone, will not cure the <hi>Love of Sin</hi> in Men, and cauſe them to Turn and Live unto GOD. If People ſhould feel what may
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002908_0011_0FE69315016934C0"/>force them to <hi>flee for their Lives,</hi> with the utmoſt confuſion, from an all-devouring <hi>Earthquake, — As they fled from before the Earthquake, in the Days of Uzziah King of Judah,</hi> — This will not cauſe them to <hi>flee from their Sins.</hi> If People ſhould ſee what is not now a <hi>New Thing,</hi> the <hi>Earth open its Mouth, and ſwallow up</hi> their Neighbours by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds at a Morſel, and a multitude <hi>going down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into the Pit,</hi> and the <hi>Earth cloſing upon them,</hi> yet in flying from the <hi>Tents</hi> of wicked Men at their lamentable Cry, <hi>Leſt the Earth ſwallow up them alſo,</hi> — it would be no <hi>New Thing,</hi> if they do not fly from the <hi>Ways</hi> of Wicked Men. Are there not Nefandous Inſtances of People continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Actual Commiſſion</hi> of Diſorderly Things, even in the very Time of an <hi>Earthquake?</hi> Yea, People making themſelves <hi>Drunk,</hi> and Reeling to and fro with <hi>ſtrong Drink,</hi> while the <hi>Earth</hi> has juſt been <hi>Reeling to and fro like a Drunkard</hi> under them, and roaring againſt them? And <hi>Robberies</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, even while the <hi>Earthquake</hi> has afforded an <hi>Opportunity</hi> for the Theeves to exert their curſed. Faculty? Hardened Sinners! There is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of them!</p>
            <p>It is a Remark very near akin to This. How do amazing <hi>Thunders</hi> uſually operate? People are <hi>Afraid</hi> even <hi>with much amazement</hi> under the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclaps;</hi> Afraid of Irreſiſtible and Far-terebrating <hi>Thunderbolts.</hi> When the <hi>Lightning is directed unto the Ends of the Earth, and after it a Voice roreth; and God Thunders with the Voice of His Excellency; God Thunders marvellouſly with His Voice;</hi> Lo, At this our <hi>Hearts tremble,</hi> and are even <hi>removed out of their place.</hi> But how quickly, how ſadly, do the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002908_0011_0FE69315016934C0"/>loſe their Efficacy! The <hi>Thunders do ceaſe,</hi> and yet Men do not <hi>Fear the Lord God,</hi> as when it <hi>Thundred,</hi> they ſay, <hi>They would.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> of our <hi>Carnal minds! Conſtant</hi> only in their <hi>Enmity</hi> to GOD! People ſeem to be very Good while they have the loud peals of the <hi>Thunders</hi> diſcharging over them; and they fear leſt the Next Flaſh of the <hi>Lightenings</hi> render them a <hi>Pillar of Salt.</hi> But they are not the ſame after the <hi>Thunders</hi> are over, that they were in the Time of the <hi>Thunders.</hi> — How often have I thought! — O! If my dear Neighbours were diſpoſed <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Thunders</hi> as they are <hi>under</hi> them! — How <hi>Happy</hi> would they be! How <hi>Holy</hi> would they be! What a Religious Neighbourhood; and how full of PIETY!</p>
            <p>From this Remark on <hi>Thunders,</hi> I return to <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> which are of the ſame Family with them: And, my Remark upon them is, That it is very plain, the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> which have lately ſhook the <hi>Earth</hi> under us for many Hundreds of Miles, and which in many places have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for diverſe Weeks together, have produced very <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> on many Thouſands of Minds. If there be a few <hi>Stocks</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> and Prodigies of <hi>Impiety,</hi> which have had no <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> made upon them from the <hi>mighty Voice</hi> of GOD <hi>ſent forth</hi> in theſe <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> verily, they are not only moſt unaccountably <hi>Sottiſh</hi> Wretches, but even worſe than <hi>Bruitiſh</hi> ones: I ſay, worſe than <hi>Bruitiſh</hi> ones; For it might have affected even thoſe profane <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolents</hi> themſelves, to have ſeen the <hi>Horrors</hi> which theſe <hi>Earthquakes</hi> raiſed in the <hi>Brutal World,</hi> at the Moments of the Tremors: How the greater and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002908_0012_0FE69334C1FBFAF8"/>the ſmaller <hi>Cattel,</hi> and the very <hi>Dogs</hi> themſelves, expreſs'd themſelves moved, and horribly terrified, when they felt the <hi>Earth</hi> moving under them. They that now had no Awe upon them, and no Senſe of a Glorious GOD and their Duty to Him, and felt no <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> on their Minds, what ſhall be thought of them! — I ſuppoſe, there were very few ſuch <hi>Monſters</hi> to be ſeen, in our Land. No; There have been <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> made upon the Minds of People every where in Town and Countrey. The like was never ſeen in our Land! The many that fly into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD, as unto the <hi>Horus of the Altar,</hi> that they may be ſheltered from the Miſchieſs of <hi>Earthquakes</hi> there, moſt certainly run thither with <hi>Good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> on their Minds. Yea, there are multitudes with whom it is a Time of ſuch <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> as they never felt in their Lives before. But now, O! The Extreme <hi>Hazard</hi> which there may be, left theſe <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> do <hi>quickly</hi> dy away, <hi>quickly</hi> wear off, <hi>quickly</hi> come to nothing: Extreme <hi>Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> leſt People anon be juſt what they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and <hi>will not yet Fear the Lord GOD,</hi> whoſe Voice has thus loudly called upon us. For my part, my Heart more <hi>trembles</hi> at this, than at an <hi>Earthquake.</hi>—</p>

               </gap> Wherefore from <hi>Aſſerting,</hi> we will proceed now to <hi>Exborting.</hi> And, Oh! <hi>Suffer the Word of EXHORTATION,</hi> which is now in a <hi>Few Words</hi> to call upon you.</p>
            <p>We are very ſollicitous, that when our <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> are over, the <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> which they have cauſed may not be <hi>over too.</hi> But what was
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002908_0012_0FE69334C1FBFAF8"/>it I ſaid? — when our <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are <hi>over!</hi> Who can ſay when <hi>That</hi> will be! I will mention a Thing which is not generally known among us. The Celebrated <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which terriſied <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> in the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> between the years 1662. and 1663. not only reached unto <hi>Canada</hi> to the Northward of us, and, as the French Hiſtorian ſays, <hi>Occaſion'd incredible Deſolations on the ſurface of the Earth for above four hundred Leagues throughout that Countrey:</hi> But alſo continued Five or Six Months together. Who can ſay, what may be our Portion? I am ſure, there can be nothing more ſeaſonable, than the <hi>Exhortation</hi> I am coming to.</p>
            <p>We read concerning Two Miniſters, upon whom our Lord put the Name of BOANERGES. The Name will ſignify, <hi>Sons of Earthquake,</hi> as well as what we commonly take it, <hi>Of Thunder.</hi> Our Lord in impoſing that Name on theſe two Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, might have Reſpect unto that Prophecy, <hi>I will ſhake all Nations, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come.</hi> Theſe Miniſters might have a Notable Delivery, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> intimates, by the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage whereof what they delivered might come like <hi>Thunder</hi> on the Hearers. But this is not all; There were to be mighty <hi>Commotions</hi> even like thoſe of an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> in ſubſerviency to the Intereſts of the Goſpel; and our Lord would make a ſingular uſe of theſe Miniſters in thoſe <hi>Commotions;</hi> who were to carry the Goſpel with a Force like that of <hi>Thunder</hi> alſo, thro' the Jewiſh Nation.</p>
            <p>Oh! That one of the <hi>Boanerges</hi> were here to have the management of this EXHORTATION; and that he who is <hi>a Son of Earthquake,</hi> in Eſſays to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002908_0013_0FE69334DD2F1990"/>ſerve the Intentions of the preſent <hi>Commotions,</hi> might be a <hi>Son of Thunder,</hi> in bringing with it the <hi>Right Words</hi> that ſhall be <hi>Forcible!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The EXHORTATION that now <hi>ſpeaks</hi> unto you, and muſt not be <hi>Forgotten,</hi> is This. Let thoſe that have had <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> on their Minds from the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> which have newly <hi>ſhaken</hi> us, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt they loſe the <hi>Good Impreſſions;</hi> Exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Beware, Infinitely Beware, leſt when they imagine the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are <hi>ceaſed,</hi> it appear that that their <hi>Heart was not Right</hi> in, and not <hi>Reach'd</hi> by, the <hi>Good Impreſſions,</hi> nor were they <hi>ſtedfaſt;</hi> But they Forget what they Thought and Said and Vow'd, when the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> were upon them.</p>
            <p>At the Time of the Battel between thoſe two Grand Robbers, which were diſputing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World, there was a <hi>Great Earthquake:</hi> But the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of the Battel ſo engaged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, that they took not the leaſt Notice of it. Few People have been ſo <hi>Buſy,</hi> or ſo Drowſy, or ſo Stupid, as to take no Notice of the Repeted <hi>Shocks</hi> and <hi>Roars,</hi> wherein GOD has from a <hi>Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> Earth ſent forth His Thundring <hi>mighty Voice</hi> unto us. I wiſh, we may not be ſo <hi>Buſy</hi> about our Worldly Affairs and Pleaſures, as to take too little Notice of what that <hi>Thundring Voice</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto us. But we read of ſuch a Thing as That, Hoſ. VII. 16. <hi>They are like a Deceitful Bowe.</hi> The Thing whereof there is a moſt grievous Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, is, That the Wicked <hi>Bent</hi> of many Minds for the ways of Sin, having by the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> had ſome <hi>ſtrain</hi> upon it, upon the <hi>ceaſing</hi> of the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,</hi> the <hi>Deceitful Bowe</hi> will return where it was; the <hi>ſtrain</hi> being taken off, they will return to their
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002908_0013_0FE69334DD2F1990"/>old <hi>Bent,</hi> and they will <hi>go on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O our dear People, and all you that have had the <hi>Right Thoughts of the Righteous</hi> by the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> at all awakened in you, Our <hi>Hearts Deſire and Prayer to GOD</hi> for you, is, That the <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> upon you may not end, in any thing ſhort of a Thorough TURN to GOD and CHRIST and PIETY: And that ſuch a <hi>View of Things</hi> as you had in the Minutes of the <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> may in an <hi>Effectual Work</hi> of Grace, abide with you; and the Fruit thereof be, that you will <hi>Fear GOD all the Days that you live upon Earth; and paſs the Time of your ſojourning here in the Fear,</hi> not of <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> but of the glorious GOD, who has <hi>the deep places of the Earth</hi> in His Almighty <hi>Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to THIS, let theſe <hi>Admonitions of the Lord</hi> find a due Entertainment with you.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A NEW HEART, a NEW HEART, is the <hi>Firſt Thing</hi> to be made ſure of. Be ſure, that you do not reſt in a <hi>Superficial, Defective, Deluſive Work,</hi> or ſtop ſhort in any thing leſs than a <hi>Thorough</hi> CONVERSION, from the <hi>Error of your way,</hi> with a <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Vital</hi> PIETY upon you. A lamentable thing, is that <hi>work of the Wicked,</hi> which is a <hi>Deceitful Work.</hi> If the <hi>Heart</hi> be not <hi>Right,</hi> O <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> thou wilt not be <hi>ſtedfaſt,</hi> in adhering to thy <hi>Good Impreſſions.</hi> A <hi>Thorough</hi> CHANGE of STATE, and therefore and therewith a <hi>Thorough</hi> CHANGE of HEART, is requiſite, that ſo the <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> made upon you, may <hi>continue</hi> with you; <hi>In theſe is continuance, and ſo you ſhall be ſaved!</hi> Without a <hi>principle</hi> of PIETY, reſtoring to the Glorious GOD His <hi>Throne</hi> in your Souls, your <hi>Good Impreſſions</hi> from the <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> will be a ſort
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002908_0014_0FE693581A546AE0"/>of <hi>Muſhrooms</hi> riſing from the <hi>Earth,</hi> and preſently Wither, and Moulder, and Crumble, and come to nothing. Unleſs the <hi>Love of GOD,</hi> which is the <hi>Root of the Righteous</hi> be implanted for a living <hi>Principle</hi> of PIETY in your Souls, your <hi>Good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> will be like the <hi>Alcherva</hi> of <hi>Jonah,</hi> and Wither in a Night or two.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Earth</hi> was in <hi>its</hi> Convulſions, and threw you into <hi>yours,</hi> This was the <hi>Firſt Thing,</hi> which threw you into Agonies; <hi>Alaſs, I am a miſerable Unregenerate; I am ſtill in my ſins; I am not Reconciled unto GOD; I am falling into thoſe Hands which it is a fearful Thing to fall into!</hi> And This is the <hi>Firſt Thing</hi> that you have to look to. Oh! Look to <hi>This;</hi> That you may have a Thorough CONVERSION to GOD and CHRIST, and a Life of that <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with Him, whereby <hi>Good will come unto</hi> you.</p>
            <p>But, How ſhall <hi>This</hi> be come at? Very ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is that Command; Ezek. XVI. 31. <hi>Make your ſelves a New Heart.</hi> What? When, O Sinner, Thou art <hi>Feeble and ſore Broken,</hi> and mayſtly <hi>Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by reaſon</hi> of the <hi>Deſperate Wickedneſs</hi> in thy <hi>Heart,</hi> from which, none but an Almighty GOD, <hi>Oh! wretched one that thou art!</hi> —None but an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD can <hi>deliver</hi> thee! It is none but an GOD even one who can transform <hi>Stone</hi> into <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that can give thee <hi>Another Heart;</hi> None but one who can <hi>Create</hi> a whole World, can <hi>Create a Clean Heart,</hi> and can make a <hi>New Heart</hi> in a Sinner that is <hi>Accuſtomed to do Evil.</hi> Wherefore when our GOD bids thee, <hi>Make thy ſelf a New Heart;</hi> His meaning is, <hi>Look unto me, to make it for thee!</hi> The <hi>Good Work</hi> begins, in an Hearty
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002908_0014_0FE693581A546AE0"/>
               <hi>Weeping and Making Supplication</hi> to GOD for a <hi>New Heart.</hi> Seeing and Feeling and Owning thy own <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>lying among the ſlain,</hi> Oh! Make thy Moans and thy <hi>Groans,</hi> even <hi>the Groans of a deadly wounded Man,</hi> unto a GOD, whoſe <hi>Name</hi> is, <hi>The Lord GOD, Merciful and Gracious and abundant in Goodneſs.</hi> Groan at this rate unto Him; <hi>Turn thou me, O Lord, and I ſhall be Turned! O Great GOD, Make me a New Creature, and beſtow a New Heart upon me!</hi> It looks <hi>Hopefully,</hi> —as if the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> were actually <hi>beginning</hi> in thee, and as if the <hi>Beginning of Wiſdom</hi> were dawning on thee, when thou art come into a <hi>deſire to Fear His Name.</hi> The <hi>Good Work</hi> has its <hi>Beginning</hi> in the <hi>deſire</hi> of it. GOD will be <hi>attentive</hi> to the <hi>Prayer</hi> of ſuch as <hi>deſire to Fear His Name. Life</hi> is beginning to ſhew it ſelf in <hi>Breathing</hi> after it.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, The Method of CONVERSION is This. The <hi>Foundation</hi> of the work muſt be laid in a <hi>deep Humiliation</hi> of Soul, confeſſing, That thou art <hi>Unable</hi> to <hi>Turn</hi> unto GOD, and <hi>Unworthy</hi> that He ſhould enable thee, and yet <hi>moſt Worthy</hi> to periſh if thou do it not. Being thus <hi>Humbled unto the Duſt,</hi> now <hi>Cry</hi> from thence to the glorious GOD. <hi>Quicken me, O GOD of Sovereign Grace, Quicken me, to Turn unto thee, and Fly unto my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR.</hi> And hereupon <hi>Try,</hi> whether He do not Help thee. <hi>Try</hi> particularly, whether thou canſt not give an Hearty Anſwer to the Calls of the Goſpel. The Goſpel calls, <hi>Be ſorry for thy Sin. Try</hi> whether thou canſt not Heartily ſay, <hi>Lord, I am ſorry, I am ſorry, that I have wandred from thee!</hi> The Goſpel calls, <hi>Let the great Salvation which thy JESUS has for thee, be welcome to thee. Try</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002908_0015_0FE693584D85BB20"/>thou canſt not Heartily ſay; <hi>Lord, The Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a JESUS, are all welcome to me, all welcome to me!</hi> The Goſpel calls, <hi>Reſolve upon a Life of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to GOD all thy Days. Try</hi> whether thou canſt not Heartily ſay, <hi>Lord, The way of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with paying of acknowledgments to Thee in all my ways, I Reſolve upon it, I Reſolve upon it!</hi>— Behold, Thy <hi>Calling and Election made ſure</hi> in thy Arrival unto this.</p>
            <p>To ſet the Matter in a yet further light; The CONVERSION ſo importunately urged for, is, A <hi>Tranſlation</hi> from the <hi>Firſt Adam</hi> to the <hi>Second Adam.</hi> Wherefore, O <hi>Convert paſſing from Death to Life;</hi> Get thy Heart very ſtrongly affected with the <hi>Evil Circumſtances,</hi> into which thy Fall from GOD in the <hi>Firſt Adam</hi> has reduc'd and ruin'd thee. Let <hi>Horror take hold</hi> on thee when thou doſt behold the Univerſal <hi>Diſorder</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> with which the <hi>Poiſon of the old Serpent</hi> ſo imbibed has infected thee; and behold the Innumerable <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions</hi> and <hi>Rebellious</hi> wherein thou haſt wickedly <hi>denied the GOD that is Above.</hi> Go on to behold the violated <hi>Law</hi> of GOD binding thee over to ſuffer all the <hi>Evil that purſueth ſinners:</hi> Behold the <hi>powers of Darkneſs</hi> enſlaving of thee, and thy Soul ciſtempered and languiſhing with <hi>grievous Diſeaſes;</hi> Behold how obnoxious thou art unto the <hi>Strange Puniſpment reſerved for the workers of Iniquity</hi> in a Future World. And now, Fly away to the <hi>Second Adam</hi> for thy <hi>Help</hi> under all theſe Diſtreſſes; <hi>Help</hi> laid on one that is <hi>mighty to ſave.</hi> Behold the Bleſſed JESUS offering to take thee and make thee <hi>His own,</hi> and <hi>ſave thee to the uttermoſt.</hi> Beg of Him, and Hope in Him, That by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:002908_0015_0FE693584D85BB20"/>which he made of Himſelf on the <hi>Accurſed Tree,</hi> and by Influences, derived from Him, all the Miſeries convey'd unto thee from the <hi>Forbidden Tree,</hi> may be releeved and removed. Put thy Truſt in the Bleſſed JESUS, for a <hi>life</hi> that ſhall be the <hi>Reverſe</hi> of all the <hi>Death,</hi> which the unhappy parent of thy Fleſh has entailed upon thee. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of Him; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, let thy Spirit fill me with the life of GOD.</hi> Entreat of Him; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, Fit me for, and fetch me to, all the ſpiritual Bleſſings of the Heavenly places.</hi> Rely on Him, as thy Redeemer. And this with a <hi>Comfortable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi> of thy <hi>Favourable Reception</hi> with Him. Thus a CONVERSION is accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>But yet, efteem it not accompliſhed until you can ſay thoſe Things, which are the Three Grand MAXIMS of <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Vital</hi> PIETY.</p>
            <p>The Firſt. <hi>The ſerving and pleaſing of the Glorious GOD, and my being and my doing of what may be a grateful Spectacle unto Him, who is acquainted with all my ways, is what I cloſe withal as the chief END, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And they will fail if you keep up the Spirit of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> when you ſet about the Execution of them. The Firſt Thing you muſt ſee to, is, That your <hi>Good purpoſes</hi> be not made in your <hi>own ſtrength:</hi> Or with an Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your being Able to <hi>will and to do at your own pleaſure;</hi> If they be ſo, there will be no <hi>ſtrength</hi> in them.

There is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal COVENANT between GOD the FATHER, and GOD our SAVIOUR. In that <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> your SAVIOUR promiſed, not only that He will pay the <hi>Price of Redemption</hi> for you, <hi>[which has been done!]</hi> but alſo, that He will <hi>Quicken</hi> and <hi>Incline</hi> and <hi>Strengthen</hi> the People, whom He brings under the <hi>Shadow of His Wings,</hi> to Glorify GOD, and Live unto Him. Your <hi>Good Purpoſes</hi> are beſt expreſſed in the Form of giving the <hi>Conſent</hi> of your Souls, that the Bleſſed JESUS, who is your <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Surety,</hi> ſhould <hi>Aſſiſt</hi> you unto the Doing of all the Good, which you <hi>Purpoſe</hi> to do. I freely own to you, that I am not entirely ſatisfied in a <hi>Form of Covenanting with GOD,</hi> wherein we act our ſelves as <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,</hi> and a Glorious CHRIST is brought in only as an <hi>Acceſſary.</hi> Tho' <hi>an exceeding great Multitude which no Man can Number,</hi> have been brought home to GOD in that <hi>Form,</hi> yet, I judge, the more <hi>Evargelical</hi> the <hi>Form</hi> is, and the more that
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002908_0020_0FE693BA64D9C2F8"/>CHRIST is <hi>All</hi> in it, it is the Better, and the <hi>Surer,</hi> and the <hi>Faſter.</hi> The Style of your <hi>Good Purpoſes</hi> is to be ſuch as This; <q>O Great GOD, Be Thou <hi>my GOD.</hi> I am not able to pay unto Thee the Homage of PIETY, in the Duties of it, which I owe unto Thee. But, I Deſire, I Deſire to do it; I deſire to do theſe <hi>Duties.</hi> My Bleſſed JESUS has engaged that His People ſhall, thro' Him acting as a <hi>Principle of Life</hi> in them, do theſe <hi>Duties;</hi> And it is my Deſire to be comprehended in this Engagement, and be <hi>Found in Him.</hi> I Conſent, I Conſent, That He ſhould cauſe me to do them; and <hi>work in me all that is well-pleaſing in the ſight of GOD.</hi> I put my ſelf under His Conduct, that He may do ſo. And even in my giving this <hi>Conſent,</hi> it is His Help that has brought me to it.—</q> Now, O <hi>Evangelized</hi> Soul, <hi>Go on, and proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Oh! Remember at the ſame time, to lay aſide all Thoughts of going to <hi>Eſtabliſh your own Righteouſneſs,</hi> or of making to your ſelves a <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> of your own <hi>Obedience,</hi> to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD; No, Tho' it ſhould be in the <hi>Evangelical Way</hi> carried on. You muſt propoſe to ſtand <hi>Juſtified</hi> before the <hi>Thrice-Holy</hi> GOD, only in the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of that <hi>Obedience,</hi> which the Bleſſed JESUS yielded unto His <hi>Law</hi> for you. And you muſt not ſo much as Propoſe to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended,</hi> unto the Liberty and Priviledge of pleading that ſpotleſs <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> by your own <hi>Obedience,</hi> or by your <hi>Good Purpoſes</hi> of it: But come to it with no <hi>Recommendation,</hi> but the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Poor</hi> that muſt make This their <hi>only Refuge.</hi> If you take up <hi>Good Purpoſes,</hi> with the

            <p n="5">V. Allow me to Conclude with one brief Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which I tender as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the reſt. There is a <hi>Stratagem</hi> of your <hi>Adverſary the Devil,</hi> which you are to be warned of.</p>

            <p>As for <hi>Garments,</hi> by all means, let all <hi>Exorbitances</hi> and <hi>Extravagances</hi> be rebuked, and retrenched; All Treſpaſſes againſt the <hi>Modeſt,</hi> and <hi>Shamefac'd,</hi> and <hi>Sober Apparrel,</hi> which the <hi>Word of GOD</hi> requires, be Redreſſed.
