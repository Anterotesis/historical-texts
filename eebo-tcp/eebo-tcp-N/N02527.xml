            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT GOD is not only deſirous to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Service and Obedience of his People, but of the Welfare</hi> &amp; <hi>Happineſs of them and their Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhall be ſpoken to under theſe following Poſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That GOD deſires and ſeeks his own Glory.</hi> For this He ſpoke a World into Being, and by His Almighty Power &amp; Reſiſtleſs Arm, doth ſo rule &amp; govern all the things contained, and all the actions by His Creatures done therein, as to ſhew forth the <hi>honour</hi> and magnify the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom of their Creator.</hi> The things which He hath made ſhew forth His <hi>Eternal Power and Godhead</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 21.</note>, and all things ſhew forth the Praiſes of the moſt High. For this end, the Lord, agreable to the ſaying of the wiſe Man<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov 16 4.</note>, <hi>Made all things for himſelf,</hi> i. e. The ultimate and ſupream end and deſign of GOD in making of them, was the advancement of His own <hi>Glory:</hi> And indeed it would be below and inconſiſtent with a <hi>Perfect Being,</hi> to have any other than this, as His principal aim &amp; end. The <hi>moſt Perfect Being</hi> will have the moſt perfect End and Deſigns in all His Actions. And it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the Divine Nature, to do any thing, that ſhall derogate from His moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfections; ſo is it likewiſe to Him to form
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002998_0011_0FEFADB2264B3900"/>
any other principal End in His Actions, than His own Glory. That which was in appearance, a diſhonour done to the Divine Nature; (I mean its union to the Humane Nature in the perſon of our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Who appeared in the form of a ſervant</hi>) was in reality the greateſt and brighteſt manifeſtation of the Glory of GOD that ever was made to a ſinful world. So many times in the Divine Actions, tho' we don't ſee how GOD conſults His own Glory; for Clouds and Darkneſs are round about His Throne: Yet in the Event it ſhall be made apparent, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of <hi>an Infinite Wiſdom</hi> could ſo have ordered and diſpoſed of all things and actions, for the accompliſhing of that great &amp; glorious end. 'Tis true that ſome of His Rebellious and perverſe Creatures refuſe to give Him Glory Actively, but GOD will make their perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Rebellion to ſerve the ſame great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and will Glorify Himſelf upon them paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who refuſe to give that Tribute of Honour and Praiſe to Him, to whom its due.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That GOD is honoured and glorified by the ſervice and obedience of His People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we have ſaid before, for this end they were made to Glorify GOD; ſo this is the way by which they do Him Honour. Not that there can be any addition made to His <hi>Eſſential Glory,</hi> for that is <hi>Infinite:</hi> but by the Obedience of His People, the Divine Honour &amp; Glory is declared in the <hi>World.</hi> Tho' this <hi>Eſſential Glory</hi> can't ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of or ſuffer diminution, yet His <hi>Declaritive</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002998_0012_0FEFADB48E062DF0"/>
may; with reſpect to the former, it may be ſaid, that neither our Obedience nor Diſobedience can't affect it. <hi>It is as high as heaven what canſt thou do?</hi> Conſonant to what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith<note n="*" place="bottom">Job 35. 6,7,8.</note> 
               <hi>If thou ſinneſt what doſt thou againſt him; or if thy Tranſgreſſions be multiplied what doſt thou unto Him? Or if thou be Righteous what giveſt thou him; and what receiveth he at thy hand? Thy wickedneſs may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteouſneſs may profit the ſon of man.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it cannot be diminiſhed as to its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> yet as to its <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> it may ſuffer an <hi>Eclipſe.</hi> As the light of the Sun, is not leſſened by the interpoſition of the Moon between us and that, where by its rays are intercepted; yet the manifeſtation of that light to us, is. When we by a conſtant courſe of Obedience have <hi>our light to ſhine before men:</hi> They by that light have manifeſtations of the Divine Glory, and will <hi>glorify our Father which is in Heaven</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 16.</note> And indeed the way of Obedience, is the only way by which we can give an Active Glory to GOD, and for this end He gave us Being; and ſuch a ſervice and obedience are His juſt and righteous expectations from us: and which we can't deny, without laying our ſelves open to the <hi>ſevere rebukes</hi> and <hi>hot diſpleaſure,</hi> of an injured &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſhould Object, That ſince our ſervices and our iniquities can't really make any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to, nor abridge, his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Happineſs;</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002998_0013_0FEFADB630C18588"/>
wherefore ſhould He be deſirous of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or reſent our tranſgreſſions of His laws?</p>
            <p>To which this may be replied, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the making GOD <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs Glorious or Happy,</hi> be out of the reach of any created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yea, and in its own nature an Impoſſibility, and therefore not to be effected by OMNIPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENCY <hi>it ſelf.</hi> Yet there may be reaſons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. why GOD ſhould take complacency and ſatisfaction in the faithful &amp; ſincere endeavours of His People to ſerve and honour Him; and to have a holy fire of reſentments enkindled in His breaſt (tho' not to the diſturbance of the divine Calm, or the diſcompoſure of His ſerene Mind, as it too frequently on ſuch occaſions diſcovered in His Creatures, in their ſtate of imperfection) at the tranſgreſſors of His <hi>Holy &amp; Righteous Laws.</hi> For the true and juſt cauſe of <hi>Love &amp; Hatred,</hi> is not for any <hi>benefit</hi> received, or <hi>injury</hi> done, but the account &amp; intention where with ſuch Actions are done, which deſerve <hi>love &amp; reſpect,</hi> or <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure.</hi> For a perſon may <hi>accidentally</hi> and <hi>fortuitouſly</hi> do another a ſervice and benefit, which had it been done <hi>willingly and with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,</hi> had merited his eſteem and favour, but the want of this circumſtance entitles him to neither. So alſo on the other hand, a Perſon that <hi>miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly</hi> or by a <hi>meer chance</hi> injures another in his Intereſts, deſerveth not his Anger, which had been otherwiſe, had there been <hi>deſign</hi> in it. He deſerved no thanks who by <hi>ſtabbing</hi> gave vent to an <hi>Impoſtume,</hi> and thereby ſaved a <hi>Life,</hi> which was his <hi>Intention</hi> by that act to have deſtroyed;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002998_0014_0FEFADB9751391F8"/>
and to bring this to the preſent caſe: GOD is not deſirous of the Obedience of his Servants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any Advantage acruing to Him, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the Sins of his People, becauſe of any real diſſervice done him: but He eyes the Intention and Deſign of the Agents, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly will graciouſly Reward thoſe that deſign his <hi>Honour,</hi> and aim at his <hi>Glory:</hi> While he will expreſs his Reſentments and terrible Indignation, againſt thoſe that pour Contempt on his <hi>Holy and Righteous Laws,</hi> by living in an avowed and open Tranſgreſſion of them, tho' neither really is GOD made <hi>more or leſs happy</hi> by them, but He is the ſame <hi>Unchangeable</hi> GOD in his Eſſence and Glory, <hi>Yeſterday to day and for ever</hi>

But we ſhall proceed to ſhow that our bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and gracious GOD hath in many ways and inſtances innumerable, diſcovered a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the welfare of His People, in all Ages of the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD when He created Man diſcovered this concern in the great &amp; noble entertainment He made for him: A <hi>Paradiſe</hi> abounding with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; and in every thing that had any tendency to render a perſon happy. He was made Lord of the World, and all things therein, the Birds in the Air, the Beaſts on the Earth, and the Fiſhes in the Sea, paid Him homage; all which he might have held to Eternity, had he not by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal miſtake hearkened to the deluſion of a wily Serpent, rather than to his great and bountiful Creator, which procured his Exile from that happy Station, and was juſtly turn'd into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon'd World overun <hi>with thorns &amp; thiſtles, with the ſweat of his brows to earn his bread, and in ſorrow to eat thereof all the days of his Life;</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 17, 18.</note> and this horrible Ingratitude to his <hi>bountiful Benefactor,</hi> and vile Contempt of his <hi>Righteous Sovereign,</hi> laid the fatal foundation for that Deluge of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous Woes &amp; Miſeries which hereupon broke in upon a ſinful World, which his wretched Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity this day, and ſhall to the end of time, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, and muſt have done to Eternity, had not the ſame <hi>gracious Deſires</hi> in the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Welfare of Mankind, interpoſed, and infinite Wiſdom contrived a way for their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

from that horrible pit, into which the ſin of their prime Anceſtor had caſt them. But this leads to another inſtance of the ſame gracious <hi>deſires</hi> in GOD, of the welfare of His Creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>GOD has further manifeſted the ſame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful Diſpoſition, in the Methods He took for the delivery of miſerable Man out of his loſt and undone eſtate,</hi> by ſending His <hi>Only Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son,</hi> to undertake their Redemption, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance there-from. Never was there ſuch a demonſtration given, of the intenſsneſs of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine deſires of Man's Happineſs, as in this: the love of GOD herein manifeſted paſſeth <hi>Knowledge: the length, the breadth, the heighth, the depth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is incomprehenſible</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 3. 18, 19.</note>. When there remained nothing for forlorn Man to look for but the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frowns &amp; fiery indignation of the <hi>Almighty GOD,</hi> who is a <hi>Conſuming fire.</hi> Then even then, <hi>was a time of love: He ſpread his skirt over them, and covered their nakedneſs; ſware unto them, and entred into Covenant with them,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. 16. 8.</note>. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than <hi>a Love as ſtrong as Death, which many waters can't quench, nor flouds drown;</hi> was evidenced by this Undertaking of the Son of GOD, for the reſtoring of Mankind to his primitive, or rather a ſuperior happineſs, to that which he had by ſin made a forfeiture of. And if we ſhould enter upon a retail of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars and overt acts, by which he gave mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of his gracious Affections towards us, Time would fail, and Eternity not be too long to

            <p n="3">3. <hi>GOD's gracious dealings with his Ancient People the Seed of Abraham, whom GOD graces with the honourable title of</hi> His Friends. There are amazing inſtances of the admirable Patience, Forbearance, and long-Suffering of GOD, towards that ſtiff-necked and perverſe People, which are clear and ſhining evidences of GOD's <hi>gracious deſires towards them;</hi> and that there is nothing more agreable to Him than to ſhow and exerciſe his loving kindneſs and tender compaſſions, to promote and further their happineſs, and to make his People a bleſſed People. If we trace them thro' the Wilderneſs, where they had ſo many ſigns of GOD's immediate preſence with them by going before them in a Pillar of fire by Night and of ſmoke by Day; (for this I muſt look upon as miraculous notwithſtanding what has been offered by a late numouriſt to the contrary<note n="*" place="bottom">Toland.</note>) His giving them food from Heaven, and ſprings of water from the Rock, and innumerable other inſtances of His goodneſs with them; we ſhall ſee ſo much of the <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> as will fully diſcover the merciful regards of a compaſſionate GOD.

His giving to us Being, and by the <hi>word of His Power upholding</hi> us in Being, gives him a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Command,</hi> and bringeth us under an obligation to fear &amp; obey.

               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Exod. 5. 2.</note>, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice, I know not the Lord</hi> &amp;c. But if we conſider a Circumſtance herein it will not appear ſo black and blaſphemous, as at firſt ſight. For when <hi>Moſes</hi> came to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his Meſſage, he delivereth himſelf as in the firſt Verſe; Thus ſaith <hi>Jehovah</hi> the GOD of Iſrael: which Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> we may juſtly ſuppoſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> wholly unacquainted with, and might imagine it to be the Name of ſome <hi>petty Deity,</hi> to whom that enſlaved People paid Adoration; and therefore accordingly replies, Who is <hi>Jehovah?</hi> that I ſhould obey his Voice! I know not <hi>Jehovah</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I let Iſrael go: which conſideration ſoftens the expreſſion. By the Fear of GOD in our Text we are to underſtand that gracious Habit or Principle in the Soul, whereby the Heart is inclined or diſpoſed to have an awful reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial regard to GOD, to his whole Will and all his ways; ſo as to fear to do what he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, or forbear what he preſcribes: Conſonant hereto GOD ſaith, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> And this Affection is what a glorious GOD hath a juſt expectation of from his People; and it is the

I would in the next place humbly Addreſs my ſelf to the Honourable and Worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are veſted with the power of the <hi>Elections</hi> of this Day.</p>
            <p>It is our juſt and reaſonable Expectation from You, that you faithfully diſcharge the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in you by GOD, your KING and <hi>Country;</hi> that you your ſelves ſeek the Proſperity of this People; and that you make Choice of ſuch to be of his Majeſty's Council, as ſhall be true to the Temporal and Religious Intereſts of this Land. That in your Elections you be not under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of any private or ſiniſter view: That you chooſe Men that Fear GOD and Honour the KING; Men of approved Fidelity to their Prince and Country; Men of Courage &amp; Reſolution, that dare aſſert the Rights and Liberties of the People, and will give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar's,</hi> and to GOD the things that are GOD's; and that will not give into any meaſures deſtructive to our true Intereſts Civil &amp; Religious, tho' they ſhould miſs of popular Applauſe, and endanger a being dropt at the next Election: Men of Wiſdom and Skill, equal to the Province they undertake, and that know what Iſrael ought to do in ſuch a Day as this; who ſhall not tremble at the frowns of the Great, nor have a fondneſs for that inſignificant toy &amp; trifle, <hi>popular Praiſe:</hi> That in your Choice you be not biaſſed by perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, nor prejudiced by ſecret Suggeſtions: Nor ſuppoſe a Man qualified to ſet at the Honourable Board meerly becauſe he will be a Tool to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſome particular Deſign or Intereſt in view;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002998_0042_0FEFAE0039D1C5E8"/>
but Men of known Character for Piety towards GOD, Loyalty to their Prince and Probity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men; Men who ſhall act up to their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſcorn to be under the malign Influences of a Party Spirit, who ſhall always have the true Intereſt of their KING and Country in view, and ſteadily proſecute all meaſures conducive thereunto; whom neither Frowns nor Bribes can divert therefrom.</p>
            <p>Your Wiſdom, Piety and Zeal for the Glory of GOD, and the Welfare of this his People are greatly relied upon; and a Unanimity in puſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all proper Methods for the accompliſhing hereof is much deſired and wiſhed for. This will ſhow you to be Fathers to your Country, and will give us a joyful Proſpect that it ſhall be well with us and our Children for ever.</p>
            <p>I would in the next place apply my ſelf to my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry;</hi> not for their Information, but to excite and quicken them to the induſtrious Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Talents, Advantages and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities put into their hands to promote the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the People that the great Shepherd of the Sheep hath committed to their Charge. <hi>We</hi> of all Men are the moſt deeply obliged to Fear GOD and keep his Commandments, and to lay out ourſelves, that others may do ſo too; that we may be able, when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, to give up a joyful Account of our ſelves and them that He hath committed to our Care; and may receive a Crown of Glory that

fadeth not away. To promote practical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be the great end of our Miniſtry: This is what is worthy to expend our Zeal upon, and not in unhappy Jangles about ſpeculative Opinions that have no influence on our Morals. Though <hi>by the Deeds of the Law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified, yet without the Deeds of the Law, can none be ſaved:</hi> Though a Man be a ſound Believer; (I mean Orthodox in the faith) unleſs he be a ſincere Convert, his <hi>Religion is as a ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Braſs and a tinkling Cymbal.</hi> I would not be underſtood to intimate as if Moral vertues, were to be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For this end CHRIST, when perſonally here preached them: and for this he gave Himſelf for us, <hi>that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to Himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People zealous of good works.</hi> And to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſame glorious End, &amp; by the ſame Means, is incumbent on Goſpel Miniſters who will never more ſuccesfully promote the intereſts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than by Preaching the Doctrines of Faith and Repentance. In this let us labour, and be unwearied: Tho' the work be difficult in it ſelf, and many diſcouragements attending of it, ariſing from Hell beneath, and its children here on Earth;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002998_0044_0FEFAE0560605C50"/>
yet we have this to encourage us, that He that hath ſent us hath promiſed to be with us unto the End of the World. Our Work is great, our Strength is ſmall, our Time is ſhort, ſome of our beſt &amp; moſt induſtrious Labourers in GOD's Vineyard, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away to receive their Wages; &amp; we are left to bear the heat &amp; burden of the Day. All which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ſhould make us more prayerful, more diligent, more laborious in our miniſterial Work, that we may approve ourſelves faithful to GOD, faithful to his People, faithful to our own Souls; and this will intitle us to an untarniſhed, unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Crown of Glory when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear.</p>
            <p>I ſhall Conclude when I have briefly addreſſed my ſelf to the People of this Land, that they would lay theſe things to Heart and ſtrenuouſly apply themſelves to ſeek their own and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Welfare and Happineſs in the way &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in our Text preſcribed. Without you, all that our Rulers in Civil and Sacred Orders can do, will not avail. Tho' our Legiſlators enact never ſo many good Laws for the regulation of the Morals of a People, unleſs You do your part, and improve the Power and Liberty you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with in your ſeveral Towns to make choice of ſuch for your Grand-jurors, Tything men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are Men fearing GOD, Men of Truth &amp; Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Men of Wiſdom equal to the Truſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them and have the intereſts of Religion at heart; who will carefully inſpect the Manners of the People, and bring the Tranſgreſſors to open

ſhame and puniſhment. I ſay, unleſs you are careful and conſcientious in this, all our Laws for the reforming the Manners of a corrupt People, are inſignificant, and our Law-makers labour in vain. And tho' the Miniſters of the Everlaſting Goſpel ſhould ſet the Doctrines thereof in the cleareſt and brighteſt Light, and with the moſt cogent Arguments, and forcible Motives preſs practical Religion upon their People; unleſs you encourage their hearts &amp; ſtrengthen their hands, and joyn with them in their endeavours to ſtem that torrent of Vice &amp; Profaneneſs which has broke in upon us; They will take up that Melancholly complaint, <hi>we have laboured in vain, and ſpent our ſtrength for nought and in vain.</hi> Oh! that there were ſuch an heart in this People to Fear GOD and Keep His Commandments: And to exert themſelves in their ſeveral Capacities ſo to promote the Peace and Proſperity of our Church and State: to put up ſtrong Cries to our Fathers GOD, that He would pour out a Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reformation on their degenerate Offspring. Then the LORD our GOD will be with us, as He was with our Fathers, and never leave us nor forſake us. This GOD of His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy grant for the ſake of His only SON our bleſſed Saviour, to whom be Glory &amp; Praiſe for ever, AMEN.</p>
