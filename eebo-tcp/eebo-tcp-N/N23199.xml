         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ned, and with which it ſtill continues to be tortured, the following ſheets ſhould afford ſome degree of entertainment, as a relaxation from more grave and ſolid ſtudies, to an inquiſitive and candid reader (thoſe of an oppoſite deſcription are not to be pleaſed with the ableſt performance) and he ſhould deem it not the worſt, nor the moſt expenſive among the numerous tribe, I ſhall eſteem myſelf amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; had I, however, been diſpoſed to be more attentive to entertainment, and leſs to vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, I might, to many, have rendered it much more agreeable, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs ſatisfactory to myſelf, as I believe the obſervation long ſince made to be juſt, that few books are ſo ill written, but that ſomething may be gleaned from their peruſal.</p>
            <p>Should the inſignificance of <hi>my</hi> life induce any perſon better qualified to preſent the world with <hi>his,</hi> big with intereſting events, my diſpoſing of ſeveral large editions of that performance will afford me more <hi>ſolid</hi> ſatisfaction as a <hi>bookſeller,</hi> than any ſucceſs or emolument which can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ariſe from this, my firſt, and moſt probably laſt, eſſay as an <hi>author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If unfortunately any of my kind readers ſhould find the book ſo <hi>horrid dull</hi> and <hi>ſtupid,</hi> that they cannot get through it, or if they do, and wiſh not to travel the ſame road again, I here declare my

               </gap>tty, much more— whatever they pleaſe, they never ſhall want books while L. is able to aſſiſt them; and whether they prefer one of his writing, or that of any other author, he proteſts he will not be in the ſmalleſt degree offended; let every author make the ſame declaration if he can.</p>
            <p>Should my memoirs be attended with no other benefit to ſociety, they will at leaſt tend to ſhew what may be effected by a perſevering habit of induſtry, and in upright conſcientious demeanour in trade towards the public, and probably inſpire ſome one, of perhaps ſuperior abilities, with a laudable ambition, to emerge from obſcurity, by a proper application of thoſe talents with which Providence has favoured him, to his own credit and emolument, as well as the benefit of the community. To ſuch an one I ever have, and ever ſhall wiſh every poſſible ſucceſs, as it has uniformly been my opinion, that whatever is thus acquired, is more honourable to the parties than the poſſeſſion of wealth obtained without any intrinſic merit or exertion, and which is too frequently conſumed with rapidity in the purſuit of vice and diſſipation.</p>
            <p>One word to my old <hi>friends</hi> the bookſellers under <hi>number three</hi> of my dedication. This pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication it is to be expected will tend to excite ſome degree of mirth in them. Conſcious that I have often been the cauſe (however unintentional on my part) of exciting leſs pleaſing ſenſations in them, I will readily allow them full ſcope; however, according to the well known adage,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:030668_0007_0FE8568E87E8B658"/>"Let them laugh who win," I hope they will indulge me in the ſome propenſity of laughing, if not <hi>at</hi> them, at leaſt <hi>with</hi> them.</p>
            <p>As a proof of my friendly diſpoſition, I ſhall here add a piece of advice, which I do not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to pronounce will, if attended to, entitle them to promotion in my <hi>firſt</hi> claſs of bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and eventually prove more beneficial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they obſerve any perſon by induſtry and application endeavouring to obtain an honeſt livelihood in that line for which his talents or diſpoſition have qualified him, never to attempt, by dark inuendoes, ſly hints, and falſe aſperſions, to injure him, as, if he happens to be a man of a becoming ſpirit, ſuch conduct will only tend to increaſe his exertions, and render him ſtill more cautions to obtain a good character; in ſo doing their weapons will recoil on themſelves, and they will have the mortification to ſee him flouriſh, whilſt they become objects of contempt in the eyes of the public, and will of courſe be avoided by them.</p>

            <p>But, left I ſhould be over vain, I muſt at the ſame time declare, that I have received ſcurrilous abuſive letters from ſeveral of Mr. Weſley's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, merely becauſe I have expoſed their ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous principles and abſurd practices; but more particularly, for having pulled off the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal veil from ſome of thoſe ſanctified deceivers which are among them.</p>
            <p>The numerous letters of approbation which I have received from rational intelligent gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, convinces me that I have not wronged the cauſe of manly and rational chriſtianity, nor was it ever my intention ſo to do.</p>
            <p>I here alſo preſent my compliments and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere thanks to my impartial friends, under the ſecond claſs of my dedication, for the friendly diſpoſition they have ſhews, in freely diſtributing my Memoirs among their cuſtomers and they may be aſſured, that I will not let ſlip any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making them proper returns for all their favours.</p>

               <p>YOU have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted me to devote what few leiſure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I could ſpare, in minuting down ſome of the principal occurrences of my life, with a view, ſooner or later, of exhibiting the account to the public eye; who, as you were pleaſed to ſay, could not but be ſomewhat curious to learn ſome well au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated particulars of a man, well known to have riſen from an obſcure origin to a degree of notice, and to a participation of the favor of the Public, in a particular line of buſineſs, I may without vanity ſay, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto unprecedented. This will appear more conſpicuous if you conſider, that I was not only poor, but laboured under every other diſadvantage.</p>

Ever willing to pay a becoming defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the judgment of a perſon of your acknowledged merits, and whom I have the felicity of numbering among my firmeſt friends. yet being leſs anxious to appear as an adventurer among the numerous tribe of authors, than to continue a conſiderable vender of the produce of their labours, I have continually delayed complying with your kind wiſhes.</p>

               <p>IN my laſt I hinted that I ſhould conſine myſelf to a plain nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030668_0015_0FE856AEA9342820"/>of facts, unembelliſhed with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retricious aid of lofty figures, or repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of things which never had exiſtence, but in the brain of the author. I ſhall therefore not trouble you with a hiſtory of predictions which foretold the future great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your humble ſervant, nor with a minute account of the aſpects of the planets at the very auſpicious and important criſis when firſt I inhaled the air of this buſtling orb; for, extraordinary as it may appear, it has never yet occurred to me, that any of the adepts in the aſtrological ſcience have made a calculation of my nativity; 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable this high honour is by the planets deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to adorn the ſublime lucubrations of the very ingenious Mr. SIRLEY, in the next edition of his ſtup—endous work! And here for the honour of the craſt let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that this moſt ſubline genius, has with myſelf to boaſt (and who would not boaſt of their genealogy in having a prince for their anceſtor?) in being a Son of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned PRINCE CRISPIN.</p>
               <p>A volume has been written with the title of "The Honour of the Taylors; or the Hiſtory of Sir JOHN HAWKWOOD." But were any learned writer to undertake— The honour of the Shoemakers or the hiſtory
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030668_0016_OFE856B34FEFE908"/>of—, how inſignificant a figure would the poor Taylors make, when compared with the honourable craft!</p>

                  <l>"And all are upright downright men of merit."</l>
               </q>
               <p>Should I live to ſee as many editions of my Memoirs publiſhed, as there have been of the Pilgrim's Progreſs, I may be induced to preſent the world with a Folio on that important ſubject.</p>
               <p>But to begin— Were I inclined to pride myſelf in genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical deſcent, I might here boaſt that the family were originally ſettled at White Lackington, in Somerſetſhire, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its name from one of my famous anceſtors, and give you a long detail of their grandeur, &amp;c. but having as little leiſure as inclination to boaſt of what if true would add nothing to <hi>my</hi> merits, I ſhall for the prefent only ſay. that I was born at Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington in Somerſetſhire, on the 31ſt of Auguſt, (old ſtyle) 1746. My father George I ackington was a Journcyman Shoemaker, who had incurred the diſpleaſure of my grandfather for marrying my mother, whoſe maiden name was Joan Trott. She was the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ughter of a poor weaver in Wellington; a good honeſt man, whoſe end was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030668_0017_0FE856B4F68BF570"/>though not very fortunate; in the road between Taunton and Wellington he was found drowned in a ditch where the water ſcarcely covered his face: He was, 'tis conjectured,</p>
               <l>"—Drunk when he died."</l>
               <p>This happened ſome years before the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of my Father and Mother.</p>
               <p>My grandfather George Lackington had been a Gentleman Farmer at Langford, a village two miles from Wellington, and acquired a pretty confiderable proper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.— But my father's mother dying when my father was but about thirteen years of age, my grandfather who had two daughters, bound my father apprentice to a Mr. Hord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a maſter ſhoemaker in Wellington, with an intention of ſetting him up in that buſineſs at the expiration of his time. But my father worked a year or two as a journeyman and, then diſpleaſed his father by marrying a woman without a ſhilling, of a mean family and who ſupported herſelf by ſpinning of wool into yarn, ſo that my mother was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of your friend and humble ſervant, her firſt-born, and hope of the family, in my grandmother Trott's poor cottage; and that good old woman carried me privately to church unknewn to my father who was
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030668_0018_0FE856BD4CEFFB30"/>(nominally) a Quaker, that being the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of his anceſtors.</p>
               <p>About the year 1750 my father having three or four children, and my mother prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an excellent wife, my grandfather's reſentment had nearly ſubſided, ſo that he ſupplied him with money to open a ſhop for <hi>himſelf.</hi> But that which was intended to be of very great ſervice to him and his family, eventually proved extremely unfortunate to himſelf and them: for as ſoon as he found he was more at eaſe in his circurnſtances, he contracted a fatal habit of drinking, and of courſe his buſineſs was neglected; ſo that after ſeveral fruitleſs attempts of my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to keep him in trade, he was, partly by a very large family but more by his habitual drunkenneſs, reduced to his old ſtate of a journeyman ſhoemaker: Yet ſo infatuated was he with the love of liquor, that the endearing ties of huſband and father could not reſtrain him; by which baneful habit himſelf and family were involved in the extremeſt poverty.</p>

               <p>AS I was the eldeſt, and my father for the firſt few years a careful
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030668_0021_0FE856CA2D9F2B30"/>hard-working man, I fared ſomething better than my brothers and ſiſters. I was put for two or three years to a day-ſchool kept by an old woman: and well remember how proud I uſed to be to ſee ſeveral ancient dames lift up their hands and eyes with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment, while I repeated by memory ſeveral chapters out of the New-Teſtament, concluding me from this ſpecimen to be a prodigy of Science. But my career of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſoon at an end, when my mother became ſo poor that ſhe could not afford the mighty ſum of two-pence per week for my ſchooling. Beſides I was obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of a nurſe to ſeveral of my brothers and ſiſters. The conſequence of which was, that what little I had learned was preſently forgot; inſtead of learning to read, &amp;c. it very early became my chief delight to excel in all kinds of boyiſh miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs; and I ſoon arrived to be the captain and leader of all the boys in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>
               <p>I was about ten years of age, when a man began to cry <hi>apple-pies</hi> about the ſtreets, I took great notice of his methods of ſelling his pies, and thought I could do it much better than him. I communicated to a neighbouring baker my thoughts on the ſubject in ſuch a manner as gave him a very

               <p>During the time I continued with this baker, many complaints were repeatedly made againſt me for the childiſh follies I had been guilty of, ſuch as throwing ſnow-balls, frightening people by ſlinging ſerpents and crackers into their houſes, &amp;c.

               <p>I Muſt not forget an odd adventure that happened when I was about twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>I had one day walked with my father to Holywell lake, a village two miles from Wellington, where meeting with ſome good ale, he could not ſind in his heart to part from it until lato at night. When we were returning home by the way of Rock-well-Green, (commonly called <hi>Regue-Green</hi> from a gang of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030668_0024_0FE856DA9C4C4B10"/>juſt paſſed the bridge, we were met by ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral men and women, who appeared to be very much frightened, being in great agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They informed us that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning back to Rogue-Green, in order to ſleep there that night, having been prevented from going home to Wellington by a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apparition, which they had all ſeen in the hollow way, about a quarter of a mile diſtant; adding, that a perſon having been murdered there formerly, the ghoſt had walked ever ſince; that they had never before paid much attention to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known report; but now they were obliged to crediti, having had ocular demonſtration. My father had drank too large a quantity of ale to be much afraid of any thing, and I (who could not let ſlip ſuch an opportunity of ſhewing my courage) ſeconded matters for the poor terrified people to return with is; and as I offered to lead the van, they were prevailed on to make the attempt once nore; but ſaid, that it was rather preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and hoped that no dreadful confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would enſue, as all the company, they truſted, were honeſt-hearted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no harm to any perſon; they more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over added, that "God certainly was above the Devil." I then advanced, and kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before the company about fifty yards,</p>

"Whiſtling aloud to bear my courage up."</l>
               <p>But when we had walked about a quarte of a mile, I ſaw at ſome diſtance before u in the hedge, the dreadful apparition that had ſo terrified our company. Here it is! (ſaid I "Lord have mercy upon us!" replied ſome of me company, making a full ſtop; and woold have gone back, but ſhame prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. I ſtill kept my diſtance before, and called out to them to follow me, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that I was determined to fee what it was. They then fell one behind another, and advanced in ſingle files. As I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded I too was ſeized with a timid appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, but durſt not own it; ſtill heeping on before, although I perceived my hair to heave my hat from my head, and my teeth to chatter in my mouth. In fact I was greatly agitated at what I ſaw; the object much reſembled the human figure as to ſhape but the ſize was prodigious. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I had promiſed to ſee what it was, and for that purpoſe I obſtinately ventured on about thirty yards from the place, where I firſt had ſight of it. I then perceived that it was only a very ſhort tree, whoſe limbs had been newly cut off, the doing of which had made it much reſemble a giant. I then called to the company, and informed them
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030668_0026_0FE856E36C2671C8"/>with a hearty laugh, that they had been frightened at the ſtump of a tree.</p>
               <p>This ſtory cauſed excellent diverſion for a long time afterwards in Wellington, and I was mentioned as an hero.</p>
               <p>The pleaſure and ſatisfaction I received from the diſcovery, and the honour I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the courage I poſſeſſed in making it, has, I believe, had much influence on me ever after; as I cannot recollect that in any one inſtance I have ever obſerved the leaft fear of apparitions, ſpirits, &amp;c. ſince.</p>

               <p>In the workhouſe belonging to the pariſh of St. James, there lived a young woman who was an idiot. This poor creature had a gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>In order to break her of this bad cuſtom, two men agreed to try if they could not frighten her out of it. And one night, when
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030668_0027_0FE856E4F97A66B8"/>they knew that ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> took a white ſheet with them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the place, one of the men concealed himſelf to ſee the event while the other wrapped himſelf up in the ſheet, and walked back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards cloſe before the cowſhed in which ſhe lay. It was ſome time before Molly paid any attention to the apparition; but at laſt up ſhe got. "Aha! (ſaid ſhe) a white devil!" and by her manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing herſelf ſhe thought it was very ſtrange to ſee a <hi>white</hi> devil. And ſoon after ſhe exclaimed, "A black devil, too! a black devil, too!" With that the man who had the ſheet on, looked over his ſhoulder, and ſaw (or imagined he ſaw) a perſon all over black behind him; the ſight of which made him take to his heels. Molly then clapped her hands as faſt as ſhe could, crying out at the ſame time, "Run, black devil, and catch white devil! Run, black devil, and catch white devil!" and was highly divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this proved a ſerious adventure to the white devil, as he expired within a few minutes after he had reached his own houſe; and from that time poor Molly was left alone to ſleep in peace.</p>
               <p>About ten years after the above affair, at Wivelſcombe, nine miles from Taunton, a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030668_0028_0FE856ECA9CE35A0"/>gentleman farmer's houſe was alarmed every night between twelve and one o'clock. The chamber doors were thrown open, the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes pulled off the beds, and the kitchen furniture thrown with violence about the kitchen, to the great terror of the family, inſomuch that the ſervants gave their maſter and miſtreſs warning to leave their places, and ſome of them actually quitted their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This dreadful affair had laſted about ſix weeks, when a young gentleman who was there on a viſit, being in bed one night, at the uſual hour he heard his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door thrown open, and a very odd noiſe about his room. He was at firſt frightened; but the noiſe continuing a long time, he became calm, and laid ſtill, revolving in his mind what he had beſt do. When on a ſudden he heard the ſpirit creep under his bed, which was immediately lifted up, &amp;c. This convinced him that there was ſome ſubſtance in the ſpirit; on which he leaped cut of bed, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cared the door, and with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ken ſtaff belaboured the ghoſt under the bed as hard as he could, until he heard a female voice imploring mercy. On that he opened his chamber door, and called aloud for a light. The family all got up as faſt as poſſible, and came to his room. He then informed them that he had got the ſpirit
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030668_0029_0FE856EE37DA3BA8"/>under the bed; on hearing which, moſt of them were terribly frightened, and would have run off faſter than they came, but he aſſured them, they had nothing to fear; then out he dragged the half-murdered ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from its ſcene of action. But how great was their ſurpriſe and ſhame, when they diſcovered that this tormenting devil was no other than one of their ſervant girls about ſixteen years of age, who had been confined to her bed ſeveral months by illneſs.</p>
               <p>This ghoſt was no ſooner laid, than two others alarmed the neighbourhood; one of which for a long time ſhook a houſe every night, and terribly diſtreſſed the family; at length they all reſolved one night to go over the whole houſe in a body, and ſee what it was that ſo agitated the building. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined every room, but in vain, as no cauſe could be diſcovered. So they very ſeriouſly as well as unanimouſly concluded, that it muſt be <hi>the devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But about a fortnight after this, one of the family being out late in the garden, ſaw a great boy get in at the window of an old houſe next door (part of which was in ruins), and ſoon after the houſe began to ſhake as uſual, on which the family went out of their own habitation, and entered the old houſe where the boy was ſeen to get in; yet for a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030668_0030_0FE856F5B3D948F0"/>long time they could not diſcover any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and were juſt turning to come out again, when one of the company obſerved the boy ſuſpended above their heads, ſtriding over the end of a large beam that ran acroſs both houſes.</p>
               <p>It was then apparent that the violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the adjoining houſe was occaſioned by nothing more than his leaping up and down on the unſupported end of this beam.</p>
               <p>Another apparition had for a long time ſtolen many geeſe, turkeys, &amp;c. and altho' it had been ſeen by many, yet nobody would venture to go near it, until at length one perſon a little wiſer than the reſt of his neighbours, ſeeing the famous apparition all over white ſtealing his fowls, was determined to be fully ſatisfied what kind of ſpirit it could be that had ſo great a predilection for poultry. He accordingly went round the yard, and as the apparition was coming over the wall, he knocked it down. This ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ghoſt then proved to be a neighbouring woman, who had put on her ſhroud in order to deter any perſons ſhould they by chance ſee her, from coming near her.—. Thus, though ſhe had for a long time ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully practiſed this ingenious way of procuring poultry, the old fox was caught at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:030668_0031_0FE856F7485CD2C8"/>
This is ſo prolific a ſubject, that I could fill many pages with relations of dreadful ſpectres, which for a while have reigned with tyrannic ſway over weak minds, and at length when calm Reaſon was ſuffered to aſſume its power, have been diſcovered to be no more objects of terror than thoſe I have here noticed. But doubtleſs many ſuch inſtances muſt have occurred to you.</p>
               <p>It has indeed often aſtoniſhed me, that in this enlightened age there ſhould yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main numbers, not in the country only, but even in the metropolis, who ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be made miſerable by vain fears of pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now and then, indeed, theſe terrors are owing to accidental and ridiculous cauſes. As an inſtance, I ſhall give you an account of a terrible alarm which ſome years ſince took place in an Hoſpital of this city, as related to me by a gentleman, who at the time reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the houſe, for the purpoſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting his medical education, and on whoſe veracity I can confidently rely.</p>

For ſeveral nights ſucceſſively a noiſe had been heard in the lower part of the building, like the continual tapping againſt a window, which led the night nurſes <hi>wiſely</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it muſt certainly be occaſioned by the Spirit of one of the bodies depoſited in the dead-houſe endeavouring to eſcape; the ſound ſeeming to proceed from that partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This you may ſuppoſe they did not neglect doing, though at the ſame time they were ſhocked at his temerity, and apprehenſive for the conſequences.— Impreſſed with an idea of the alarm being occaſioned by ſome ſervant or patient in the houſe, he immediately ſallied forth, with a candle in one hand, and a good tough twig in the other, accompanied by two of the men ſervants of the Hoſpital, accountred in the ſame manner, reſolved that if detected
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030668_0033_0FE857004C3BAEF0"/>the party ſhould meet with an ample reward. The dead-houſe was paſſed; the noiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; though it evidently proceeded from a window at ſome diſtance in the area— When the cavalcade came near the ſcene of action, the window ſuddenly and violently broke, without any thing being ſeen.

Mr. Higley, the bookſeller famous for ſelling odd volumes or broken ſets of books, lived next door to a public-houſe in Ruſſell-court, Drury-lane; this public-houſe was ſeparated from his habitation only by a ſlight wainſcot partition, through which Mr. Higley cauſed an hole to be cut and a ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der put over it, ſo that when he wanted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>AT the time that I was bound apprentice, my maſter had two ſons, the eldeſt about ſeventeen years old, the youngeſt fourteen. The eldeſt had juſt been baptized, and introduced as a member of the arianiſtical dipping community where my maſter and his family attended. The boy was a very ſober induſtrious youth, and gave his father and mother much pleaſure. The youngeſt was alſo a good lad. Thus every thing continued well for ſome time aſter I had been added to the family. Both of the boys had very good natural parts, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030668_0039_0FE8571ACADFAD18"/>had learned to read, write, keep accounts, &amp;c. But they had been at ſchools where no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of books had been introduced, ſo that all they had read was the Bible.

               <p>Thus was the good man's family jogging eaſily and quietly on, no one doubting but he ſhould go to heaven when he died, and every one hoping it would be a good while firſt.</p>

               <p>But alas! the dreadful criſis was at hand that put an end to the happineſs and peace of this little family.

                  </gap> ſame effect on ſuch as have lived a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent life as it has upon the moſt notorious offenders; this conviction (as they call it) is brought about by the preachers heaping all the curſes in the Bible on the heads of the moſt virtuous as well as moſt vicious; for, ſay they, he who keepeth the whole law and offendeth but in one point, is as much in a ſtate of damnation, as he that hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every one of the commandments, or commitied robbery, murder, &amp;c. ſo that
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030668_0047_0FE8573EE0731930"/>they pour out every awſul denunciation ſound in the Bible, and many not ſound there, againſt all who have not the method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical faith: this they call ſhaking the people over the mouth of hell.</p>
               <p>Thus are many who before poſſeſſed "conſiences void of offence towards God and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               <p>If the above terror of conſcience was only to take place in knaves and raſcals, there would be no reaſon for blaming the method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts on that head; "the wretch deſerves the hell he feels."</p>
               <p>But the caſe is otherwiſe amongſt the methodiſts, they work on the fears of the moſt virtuous; youth and innocence fall victims daily before their threats of hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the poor ſeeble minded, inſtead of being comforted and encouraged are often by them ſunk into an irrecoverable ſtate of gloomy deſpondence and horrible deſpair.</p>
               <p>It is true that many of their hearers are not only methodiſtically convinced, or alarmed,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030668_0048_0FE8574636D03DE8"/>but are alſo <hi>hocus pocuſly</hi> converted; but with thouſands that is not the caſe, even with thoſe who join their ſociety, where ſo much of divine love, aſſurance, and extaſies are talked of, where enthuſiaſtic, rapturous, intoxicating hymns are ſung, and befides the unhappy mortals in their own community, thouſands there are who have loll their peace of mind by occaſionally hearing their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>

Between twenty and thirty years ſince ſome thouſands of them in London took it into their heads that the world would be at an end on ſuch a night, and for ſome days previous to this fatal night, nothing was attended to but faſting and praying, and when it came, they made a watch-night of it, and ſpent it in prayer,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030668_0049_0FE8582977204E00"/>&amp;c. expecting every moment to be the laſt; and it is remarkable, that thouſands who were not methodiſts gave credit to this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous prophecy, and were terribly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the next morning they were aſhamed to look at one another, and many durſt not appear in their ſhops for ſome time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But others of them ſaid that God had heard the prayers of the righteous, and ſo ſpared the world a little longer. Some years after that Mr. Weſley alarmed his people all over England with the tail of a comet; great numbers were dreadfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive leſt this comet ſhould ſcorch the carth to a cinder; but the ſaints by prayer made the comet keep a proper diſtance.</p>
               <p>Charnock, of the laſt century, in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on Providence, has proved (in his way) that the univerſe was created and kept agoing for the ſake of the elect, and that as ſoon as their number is complete, the whole will be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>The fanatics in every age have found their account in making their followers believe the end of the world was at hand. In ſome of the wills and deeds by which eſtates have been given to monaſteries, &amp;c. in France, they have expreſſed their belief of the world's being nearly at an end, as a reaſon for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch liberal donations to the church.—
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030668_0050_0FE85747D56ADD48"/>But it is happy for us that in England ſuch wills would be ſet aſide. A caſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occurred while Lord Northington was at the head of the law department. Reilly the preacher, had whedled, or frightened, an old woman (Mrs. Norton) out of a deed of giſt of fiſty pounds per year, but after the old woman's panic and fear of damnation was over, ſhe had recourſe to Chancery and his Lordſhip annulled the deed of giſt. His Lordſhip's remarks on ſuch kinds of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition are very curious, and worth your reading. See Collectanea Juridica, vol. 1. p. 458.</p>
               <p>In fact, the very beſt of the methodiſts are like children, elated or depreſſed by mere triſles; and many who joined them while young and ignorant, quit their ſociety as they attain to years of diſcretion, or as their judgment is better informed.</p>

               <p>THE enthuſiaſtic no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I had imbibed, and the deſire I had to be talking about religious myſteries, &amp;c. anſwered one valuable purpoſe; as it cauſed me to embrace every opportunity to learn to read, ſo that I could ſoon read the eaſy parts of the Bible, Mr. Weſley's Hymns, &amp;c. and every leiſure minute was ſo employed.</p>
               <p>In the winter I was obliged to attend my work from ſix in the morning until ten at night. In the ſummer half year, I only worked as long as we could ſce without can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; but notwithſtanding the cloſe attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I was obliged to pay to my trade, yet for a long time I read ten chapters in the Bible every day; I alſo read and learned many hymns, and as ſoon as I could procure ſome of Mr. Weſley's Tracts, Sermons, &amp;c. I read them alſo; many of them I peruſed in <hi>Cloacina's</hi> Temple, (the place where my Lord Cheſterfield adviſed his ſon to read the claſſics, but I did not apply them after reading to the farther uſe that his Lordſhip hints at.)</p>
               <p>I had ſuch good eyes, that I often read by the light of the Moon, as my maſter would
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030668_0052_0FE85750B3B2ECA0"/>never permit me to take a candle into my room and that prohibition I looked upon as a kind of perſecution, but I always comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf with the thoughts of my being a dear child of God; and as ſuch, that it was impoſſible for me to eſcape perſecution from the children of the devil, which epithets I very <hi>piouſly</hi> applied to my good maſter and miſtreſs. And ſo ignorantly and imprudently zealous (being a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al methodiſt) was I for the good of their <hi>precious</hi> ſouls, as ſometimes to give them broad hints of it, and of the dangerous ſtate they were in. Their pious good old miniſter, the Reverend Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, I called <hi>"a blind leader of the blind;"</hi> and I more than once aſſured my miſtreſs, that both he and his whole ſtock were in a ſtate of damnation being "ſtrangers to the hope of Iſrael, and without God in the world." My good miſtreſs wifely thought that a good ſtick was the beſt way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch an ignorant infatuated boy as I was, and had often recourſe to it; but I took care to give her a deal of trouble; for whenever I was ordered in my turn to read in the Bible, I always ſelected ſuch chapters as I thought militated againſt Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Socinians, &amp;c. and ſuch verſes as I deemed ſavorable to the doctrine of Orgined Sin, Juſtification by Faith, imputed Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030668_0053_0FE8575961B6A938"/>the doctrine of the Trinity, &amp;c. On ſuch parts I always placed a particular emphaſis, which puzzled and teazed the old lady a good deal.</p>
               <p>Among other places I thought (having ſo been taught by the methodiſts) that the ſixteenth chapter of Ezekiel very much favored the doctrines of original ſin, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs, &amp;c. that chapter I often ſelected and read to her, and ſhe as often read the eighteenth chapter of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, for the ſake of the parable of the Father's eating <hi>ſour grapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whenever I read in St. Paul's Epiſtles on Juſtification by faith alone, my good miſtreſs would read in the Epiſtle of St. James, ſuch paſſages as ſay that a man is not juſtified by faith alone, but by faith and works, which often embarraſſed me not a Jittle. However I comforted myſelf with the conceit of having more texts of Scripture on my ſide of the queſtion than ſhe had on her ſide. As to St. James, I was almoſt ready to conclude, that he was not quite orthodox, and ſo at laſt I did not much mind what he ſaid.</p>

Hitherto I had not frequented the metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt meetings by the conſent or knowledge of my maſter and miſtreſs; nor had my zeal been ſo great as to make me openly violate their commands. But as my zeal increaſed much faſter than my knowledge I ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded their orders, and without heſitation ran away to hear a methodiſtical ſermon as often as I could find opportunity. One Sunday morning at eight o'clock my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſeeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I opened the Bible for direction what to do (ignorant methodiſts often prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the ſame ſuperſtitious method) and the firſt words I read were theſe, "He has given his angels charge concerning thee, leſt at any time tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was enough for me; ſo without a moments heſitation, I ran up two pair of ſtairs to my own room, and out of the window I leaped, to the great terror of my poor miſtreſs. I got up immediately, and ran about two or three hundred yards, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the meeting-houſe; but alas! I could run no farther; my feet and ancles were moſt intolerably bruiſed, ſo that I was
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030668_0055_0FE8576240E05998"/>obliged to be carried back and put to bed; and it was more than a month before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the uſe of my limbs. I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough to think that the Lord had not uſed me very well, and reſolved not to put ſo much truſt in him for the future.</p>
               <p>This my raſh adventure made a great noiſe in the town, and was talked of many miles round. Some ſew admired my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing ſtrength of faith, but the major part pitied me, as a poor ignorant, deluded and infatuated boy.</p>

               <p>IN the fourth year of my apprenticeſhip my maſter died; now although he was a good huſband, a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a good maſter, &amp;c. yet as he had not the methodiſtical faith, and could not pronounce the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> of that ſect, I <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> feared that he was gone to hell.</p>
               <p>My miſtreſs thought that his death was haſtened by his uneaſy reſlections on the bad behaviour of his ſons after they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced methodiſts, as before they were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> each was dutiful and attended to his trade, but after they became <hi>ſaints</hi> they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo much to their ſpiritual concerns that they acted as though they ſuppoſed they were to be fed and cloathed by miracles, like Mr. Huntingdon, who informs us in his book called "The Bank of Faith," that the Lord ſent him a pair of breeches, that a dog brought him mutton to eat, fiſh died at night in a pond on purpoſe to be eaten by him in the morning; money, and in ſhort every thing he could deſire he obtained by prayer. Thus as foot ſays,

To give you a better idea of methodiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ignorance and neglect of ordinary means of living, &amp;c. I will relate one inſtance more. Mary Hubbard (an old woman of Mr. Weſley's ſociety) would often waſh her linen, hang it out to dry, and go away to work in the fields, or to Taunton market, four miles from her houſe; and when blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe would anſwer "that the Lord watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over her, and all that ſhe had, and that he would prevent any perſon from ſtealing her two old ſmocks, or if he permitted them to be ſtolen he would ſend her two new in their ſtead." And I ſeriouſly aſſure you, ſir, that there are many thouſand Mary Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards amongſt the methodiſts.</p>
               <p>As I had been bound to my miſtreſs as well as my maſter, I was of courſe an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice ſtill. But after my maſter's death I obtained more liberty of conſcience (as I called it) ſo that I not only went to hear the meth diſt ſermons, but was alſo admitted into their ſociety; and I believe they never had a more devou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> enthuſiaſtical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for ſeveral years I regularly attended every ſermon and all their private meetings.</p>
               <p>As you are probably unacquainted with the nature of theſe <hi>private meetings,</hi> a ſhort account of them may perhaps afford you ſome amuſement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:030668_0058_0FE8576F993677C0"/>
The late Mr. Weſley inſtituted amongſt his people, beſides the public preachings, ſeveral kinds of private meetings; and as the <hi>prayer-meeting</hi> is the leaſt private of any of them, I will ſirſt take notice of that.</p>
               <p>To the prayer-meetings, which were in general held in private houſes, they often invited people who were not of their ſociety. An hymn was firſt ſung, then they all knelt, and the firſt perſon who felt a motion made an extemporary prayer; when he had done another began, and ſo on, for about two hours.</p>
               <p>But it ſo happened ſometimes, that one of the brethren began to pray without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the giſt</hi> of prayer (as they call it) and then he often ſtuck faſt, like ſome of the young orators at Coach ker's Hall, &amp;c. Prayer-meetings were held in ſuch high eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem amongſt them that they aſſerted, more were <hi>"born again",</hi> and more "<hi>made free</hi> from all the remains of ſin," or in other words of their own, "made <hi>perfect</hi> as God is perfect" in theſe kinds of meeting, than at public preaching, &amp;c. Thus, as Pomſret ſays,</p>
               <l>"The ſpirite heated will ſtrange things produce."</l>
               <p>But it is impoſſible for you, my friend, to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030668_0059_0FE8577617B922A8"/>form any juſt idea of theſe aſſemblies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you had been preſent at them: one wheedles and coaxes the Divine Being, in his addreſſes; another is amorous and luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and a third ſo rude and commanding, he will even tell the Deity that he muſt be <hi>a liar</hi> if he does not grant all they aſk. In this manner will they work up one another's imaginations until they may actually be ſaid to be in a ſtate of intoxication, and whilſt in this intoxicated ſtate, it often happens that ſome of them recollect a text of ſcripture, ſuch as "thy ſins are forgiven thee," or "go and ſin no more," &amp;c. and then they declare themſelves to be born again, or to be ſanctified, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They have another kind of private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the public preaching on Sunday evenings, in which the preacher meets all the members of the ſociety, who ſtay behind after the general congregation is diſmiſſed. To this ſociety the preacher gave ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as he deemed better ſuited to a godly few than to a promiſcuous multidue of "<hi>outvard court</hi> worſhippers."</p>
               <p>Their <hi>love-feaſt</hi> is alſo a private meeting of as many members of the community as pleaſe to attend; and they generally come from all parts within ſeveral miles of the place where love-feaſts are held.</p>
               <p>

At ſuch ſeaſons as this I have heard many of them declare they had juſt received the pardon of all their ſins while Brother ſuch-a-one was in prayer; another would then get up and aſſert that he was joſt at that inſtant made perfectly free from ſin.</p>
               <p>At theſe times the ſpirit is ſuppoſed to be very powerfully at work amongſt them; and ſuch an <hi>uniſon</hi> of ſighing and <hi>groaning</hi> ſucceeds, that you would think they had all loſt their ſenſes. In this frantic ſtate, many apply to themſelves ſuch texts of ſcripture as happen to come into their heads.</p>
               <p>In the love-feaſt they have <hi>buns</hi> to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In London, Briſtol, and other large places, they have ſome <hi>private</hi> meetings, unknown to the community at large. Theſe meetings conſiſt of all married men at one time, young and ummarried men at another time, the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030668_0061_0FE8577D665D2AC0"/>married women by themſelves, and the ſingle women by themſelves; and to each of theſe claſſes Mr. Weſley went, and gave ſuch advice or exhortations as he thought ſuitable to their ſituation in life, ſeldom fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak much in praiſe of celibacy, to the <hi>Maids</hi> and <hi>Bachelors</hi> under his paſtoral care.

               <p>THE <hi>Watch-night</hi> begins about ſeven o'clock. They ſing hymns, pray, preach, ſing, and pray again;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030668_0062_0FE857844ACDABB8"/>then exhort, ſing and pray alternately, until twelve o'clock. The hymns which they ſing on thoſe nights, were wrote for ſuch occaſions, and abound with gloomy ideas, which are increaſed by the time of night; and it muſt be remarked, that the major part of thoſe who attend theſe nocturnal meetings having faſted the whole of the day (according to Mr. Weſley's orders) are in a very proper ſtate of mind to entertain the moſt extravagant whims or enthuſiaſtic no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that can poſſibly enter the heads of any viſionaries. So that ſuch nights are often very prolific, as numbers are ſaid to be born again, and become the temples of the Holy Ghoſt on watch-nights, which makes thoſe nights eſteemed by them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weſley, in every place where his people were numerous, had divided them into <hi>claſſes,</hi> conſiſting of twelve or fourteen brothers or ſiſters. Sometimes men and women met together in the ſame <hi>claſs</hi> (as they called it) and other claſſes conſiſted of all men or all women. Each of theſe claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had one in it who was called the <hi>leader.</hi> In ſuch claſſes where men and women met together, the leader was always a brother: and ſo of courſe when the claſs conſiſted of men alone. But in the women's claſſes a ſiſter was always the leader.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:030668_0063_0FE85785D874E8F8"/>
When they met together, the leader firſt gave out an hymn, which they all ſang; after the hymn they all knelt, and their leader made an extemporary prayer; after which they were ſeated, and when the leader had informed them of the ſtate of his own mind, he enquired of all preſent, one after another, how they found the ſtate of their ſouls. Some he found were full of faith and <hi>aſſurance,</hi> others had dreadful doubts and fears; ſome had horrid temptations; others complained of a lukewarm ſtate, &amp;c. In theſe meetings ſome of the members ſpoke of themſelves, as though they were as pure as angels are in heaven, but with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them, it was far otherwiſe, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more common among them than to hear the major part exclaiming againſt themſelves, and declaring that they were the moſt vile and abandoned wretches on this ſide hell, that they wondered why the earth did not open and ſwallow them up alive. But they generally added, that "the blood of Chriſt cleanſes from all ſin," and that "where ſin abounded there would grace much more abound." Indeed it was eaſy to remark that the reaſon why they painted themſelves in ſuch odious colous, was only to boaſt of an aſtoniſhing quantity of grace
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030668_0064_0FE8578D9623E860"/>that God had beſtowed on them, in thus pardoning all their abominations and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering them with the houſehold of faith, who ought to have been ſhut up in the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hell. To each of theſe the leader gave a word of comfort, or of correction in the beſt manner he was able. They then ſang and prayed again. This laſted about one hour. And every one in Mr. Weſley's connection did, or was expected to meet, each in his own claſs once in a week. In theſe claſſes each made a weekly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the general ſupport of the preachers, &amp;c. Such as were very poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed a penny per week, others two-pence, and ſome who could afford it, ſix-pence. This money was entered in a book kept for that purpoſe, and one in every claſs called the ſteward, had the care of the caſh.</p>
               <p>I now come to ſpeak of the <hi>Bands,</hi> which conſiſted only of <hi>juſtified</hi> perſons; that is ſuch as had received the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of their ſins being pardoned. In the claſſes, both the <hi>awakened</hi> (as they call them) and the juſtified, and even thoſe that we e made <hi>perfect</hi> met all together, as did the married and the ſingle, and often men and women. but none were admitted into any <hi>band</hi> but ſuch as were at leaſt in a juſtified ſtate, and the married of each ſex met by themſelves,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030668_0065_0FE8578F2152E628"/>and the ſingle by themſelves. About ten was the number generally put in one band; all theſe muſt belong to and meet in ſome claſs, once a week, when not hindered by ſickneſs &amp;c. and they were alſo to meet weekly in their band. When met, they firſt ſung, then made a ſhort prayer; that done, the <hi>band-leader</hi> informed them of the ſtate of his mind during the laſt week, &amp;c. He then made enquiry into the ſtate of all preſent, and each related what had paſſed ſince they laſt met; and what viſitations they had received from God, what tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the devil, the ſleſh, &amp;c. And it is a maxim amongſt them that expoſing to one another what the devil has particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly tempted them to commit, will make the old fellow more careful how he tempts, when he knows that all his ſecrets will be told the next meeting. In the claſſes they only confeſſed in general terms, that they have been tempted by the world, the fleſh and the devil. But in the bands they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the particular fins which they had been tempted to commit, or had actually committed.</p>
               <p>The laſt time I met in band was in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where an old man (near ſeventy years of age) informed us that he had for ſeveral weeks together laboured under a very griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030668_0066_0FE8579818321398"/>temptation of the devil, who all this time had been conſtantly tempting him to commit adultery; he farther informed us, that having let too much of his houſe to lodgers, they were obliged to put the maid's bed in the room where he and his wife ſlept; and that one morning he had ſeen the maid lying aſleep, nearly or quite uncovered, and he again aſſured us that ever ſince that time the devil had been every day tempting him to do that which was nought with the maid. I could not help thinking the old gentleman was right in charging it on the <hi>devil,</hi> as there was little reaſon to think it was any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the fleſh.</hi> Permit me to add, that this <hi>old buck</hi> had a wiſe about half his own age. I have been informed that ſome young men of the brotherhood, have at times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed themſelves in women's clothes, and have ſo got into the women's bands; it may be very curious to hear the confeſſions of the holy ſiſters. By this time I ſuppoſe you have had enought of <hi>band meetings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Weſley inſtituted another kind of private meeting for the higheſt order of his people, called the <hi>ſelect bands;</hi> to which none were admitted but ſuch as were ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, or made <hi>perfect</hi> in love, and freed from all the remains of fin. But as I never proſeſſed <hi>perfection,</hi> I was not permitted
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030668_0067_0FE8579F8115C948"/>to enter into this holy of holies. But I have known a great number of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſaints, of both ſexes; and I alſo lived in the ſame houſe a whole year with one of theſe intire holy ſiſters. A few days before I came to live in Chiſwell-ſtreet, one of theſe perfect ſiſters was detected in ſtealing coals out of the ſhed of one of the ſanctified biothers, but ſhe, like the old fellow above mentioned ſaid it was the devil that tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to do it.</p>
               <p>Four times every year new <hi>tickets</hi> are diſtributed to all Mr. Weſley's people throughout the three kingdoms. Their ticket is a very ſinall ſlip of paper, with a text of ſcrip ure on it, which is exchanged every quarter for ſome other text. Such as are only in a <hi>claſs,</hi> have a different text from ſuch as are in a <hi>band,</hi> ſo that no one can be admitted into a general meeting of the bands, appointed by any of the preach ers when he intends to give them an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor into any particular band, by a common ſociety ticket. On the common tickets are ſuch texts as theſe: "Now is the accepted time."—" Awake thou that ſleepeſt," and ſuch like. But thoſe for the <hi>band;</hi> are in a higher ſtrain; as, "Be ye perſect as your heavenly father is perfect." "Go on unto perfection,"—"Ye are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030668_0068_0FE857A10CA77C98"/>of the light."—"Your bodies are temples of the Holy Ghoſt;" and other texts of a ſimilar tendency. For theſe tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, each poor perſon paid one ſhilling, ſuch as were rich paid more; indeed the money ſeemed to be the principal end of iſſuing tickets, at leaſt in country places, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the community being ſo well known to each other, that they ſcarce ever ſhewed their tickets in order to gain admittance. I forgot to inform you that prayer-meetings, claſs-meetings, band-meetings, &amp;c. were in general held in private houſes, belonging to ſome of the brethren.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU now ſee what ſort of a ſociety I was got into. In country places particularly, they conſiſt of ſarmers,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030668_0069_0FE857A84DD28F18"/>huſbandmen, ſhoemakers, woolcombera, weavers, their wives, &amp;c. I have heard Mr. Weſley remark that more women are converted than men; and I believe that by far the greateſt part of his people are females; and not a few of them four, diſappointed old ma ds, with fome others of a leſs prud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>Lavater in his eſſay on phyſiognomy ſays, "Women ſink into the moſt incurable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, as they alſo riſe to the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured heights," In another place he ſays, "By the irritability of their nerves, their incapability for deep inquiry and firm deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they may eaſily from their extreme ſenſibility, become the moſt irreclaimable, the moſt rapturous enthuſiaſts."</p>
               <p>There are thouſands in this ſociety who will never read any thing beſides the bible, and books publiſhed by Mr. Weſley. For ſeveral years I read very little elſe, nor would I go (at leaſt very ſeldom) to any other place of worſhip; ſo that inſtead of hearing the ſenſible and learned miniſters of Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, I would often go four, five, or ſix miles to ſome country village, to hear an inſpired huſbandman, ſhoemaker, black ſmith, or wool comber; and frequently in froſt and ſnow have I roſe a little after midnight (not knowing what time of night it was) and have
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030668_0070_0FE857A9DA2540A8"/>wandered about the town until five o'clock, when the preaching began; where I have often heard a ſermon preached to not more than ten or a dozen people. But ſuch of us as did attend at this early hour, uſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to congratulate each other on the great privilege we enjoyed, then off we went to our work, ſhivering with cold.</p>
               <p>I was firſt converted to methodiſm when I was about ſixteen years of age, from that time until I was twenty-one I was a very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere enthuſiaſt, and every ſpare hour I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed I dedicated to the ſtudy of the bible, reading methodiſtical books, learning hymns, hearing ſermons, meeting in ſocieties, &amp;c. My memory was very tenacious, ſo that every thing I read I made my own. I could have repeated ſeveral volumes of hymns; when I heard a ſermon, I could have peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it again, and nearly in the ſame words; my bible had hundreds of leaves folded down, and thouſands of marks againſt ſuch texts as I thought favoured the doctrines (or whims) which I had imbibed. So that I ſtood forth as the champion of methodiſm wherever I came.</p>
               <p>But alas! my godly ſtrict liſe at length ſuffered interruption. I will give you a ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of the method <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The election for two members of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſtrongly conteſted at Taunton, juſt as I attained my twenty-firſt year; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now of age, the fix or ſeven months, which I had to ſerve of my apprentiſhip were purchaſed of my miſtreſs by ſome friends of two of the contending candidates; ſo that I was at once ſet free in the midſt of a ſcene of riot and diſſipation.

I often privately took the bible to bed with me, and in the long ſummer mornings read for hours together in bed, but this did not in the leaſt influence my conduct. As you know great events often ariſe from lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſes, I am now going to relate a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, trivial in itſelf, though product<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive of a more conſiderable change in my ſituation, then any I had yet experienced.</p>
               <p>I was twenty-one years of age the 11th of September, 1767, the election was over the latter end of March, 1768. It was in this year that my new maſter's wife infiſted on my purchaſing milk of a milk-maid who was a cuſtomer at the ſhop; which command I refuſed to comply with, as I had a ſmart little milk-maid of my own. But as my miſtreſs <hi>wore the breeches,</hi> my maſter was obliged, by his wife's order, to inform me that I muſt comply with her mandate, or get another maſter. I leſt him without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation; and the ſame afternoon went to Wellington, took leave of my father and mother, and informed them of my intention to go to Briſtol.

               <p>A few days after I went to the inn where the Taunton carrier put up, to onquire after <hi>Miſs Trott,</hi> as I wanted to know if ſhe had returned ſafe to Taunton.

               <p>The Taunton carrier gave me a letter from my good miſtreſs Bowden (who by marrying again had changed her name to Dingle). The contents of this letter very much ſurpriſed me.

               <p>Our gentleman on entering the ſhop, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the ſhop-maid for her miſtreſs, but the maid being uſed to ſerve in the ſhop, and knowing that her miſtreſs had ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with her, informed the gentleman that ſhe could help him to any thing that he wanted. But on his ſaying he had ſome private buſineſs with her miſtreſs, he was ſhewed into a back parlour, and the miſtreſs being informed a gentleman wanted to ſpeak to her, ſhe went directly to him. The moment ſhe entered the room, he claſped her in his arms, called her a divine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c. This ſo alarmed Miſs A—d—n that ſhe ſereamed aloud; on hearing of which, the ladies preceded by the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid and ſhop-maid repaired to the parlour, where they found Miſs A—d—n almoſt in fits.

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030668_0079_0FE857D6DCBE0C28"/>not to attempt to put tricks on travellers, and ordered them to leave the room. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of obeying his injunctions they in a reſolute tone ordered our ſpark to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly about his buſineſs. However he ſtill kept his ground, until the mayor of the town, who happened to live juſt by, was called in. Mr. mayor demanded to know why he took ſuch freedom with the lady? Our gentleman, ſeeing that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair began to look very ſerious, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came calm, and informed the company that having an inclination for a frolic, he had inquired for a bad houſe, and had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected there; adding that if there had been any miſtake, he was very ſorry for it, and would beg the lady's pardon. On hearing this, the company was more ſurpriſed than before, and demanded of the gentleman, who had informed him that that houſe was a bawdy-houſe? He, without heſitation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the hoſtler at the White Hart. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the hoſtler was ſent for, and on his being aſked, if he had directed that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to Miſs A—d—n's as to a bawdy, houſe? The poor fellow, with marks of terror and ſurpriſe anſwered, no. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman never aſked me for a bawdy-houſe, he only aſked me for a houſe where they took in the news. So that he hoſtler's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030668_0080_0FE857D86752B620"/>him in a literal ſenſe, cauſed all the confuſion. The affair however had got ſo much air that our ſpark was glad to leave the town immediately.</p>
               <p>A very ſtrange unaccountable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance happened in this Inn, about the ſame time; one of thoſe occurrences that puzzle the philoſopher, and ſtrengthen ſuperſtition in weak minds. Three or four gentlemen of the neighbourhood were drinking wine in one of the rooms, when the landlord of the Inn (as it appeared to them) walked into the room, and coming up to the table, around which they were ſeated, they addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with Mr. Baldwin, how do you do? ſit down and take a glaſs of wine with us; but inſtead of doing as requeſted, the ſuppoſed Inn-keeper walked out of the room, without making any reply; which not only ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but offended the company, who rung the bell violently, and on the waiter's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, they ordered him to ſend in his maſter. The waiter informed them that his maſter was not at home. The gentlement repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was at home a ſew minutes ſince, and therefore they inſiſted on ſeeing him; but the man aſſured them they were miſtaken, as his maſter was in Briſtol, and had been there ſeveral days. They then ordered the waiter to ſend in Mrs. Baldwin, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030668_0081_0FE857DFB3413358"/>appearing, the gentlemen aſked her where Mr. Baldwin was, and ſhe informed them as the waiter had already done, that he was in Briſltol, and had been there feveral days, on which the gentlemen grew very angry, and ſwore that Mr. Baldwin had juſt before come into the room, and on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting him to partake of their wine, had inſulted them by going out of the room, without deigning to give them an anſwer. Mrs. Baldwin then drew out of her pocket aletter ſhe had that morning received from Mr. Baldwin, by which it was apparent, that he really was in Briſtol. The ſtory was then told round the neighbourhood, and all the old women concluded that Mr. Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win muſt certainly be dead, and that he died at the very inſtant that the gentlemen ſaw him come into the room; but Mr. Baldwin returning two days after, rendered it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to vary their ſtory; they then aſſerted that it was a token, or ſome warning of his death, and had no doubt but it would very ſoon happen. It was generally tho't that Mr. Baldwin was weak enough to pay ſuch attention to the ſtory and the inſerence, as to hurt his health, as he really died within a year after, and the old women were not a litile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A more ridiculous affair happened about ten years ſince, at the two bells, oppoſite Whitechapel church. The landlord was ſitting one night with ſome jovial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, one of whom happened to ſay that he prayed to God, that ſuch a thing ſhould not come to paſs, the landlord replied in a good humoured manner, your prayers will neither do good or harm; upon which the other ſaid a deal to perſuade the hoſt that his prayers would do great things; but the more he ſaid in praiſe of his prayers, the more the landlord laughed at, and ridiculed him. The man at laſt inſiſted that he could pray the landlord to death in two months time, and offered to bet him a crown bowl of punch to the truth of it, which the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord accepting, the wager was laid, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every night after this, the man came to the houſe, and conſtantly laughed at the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and aſſured him that he would loſe his wager; and however ſtrange in may appear, our hoſt did die within the time, and his wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow paid the wager. I think there cannot remain a doubt but that the ridiculous talk of the fellow actually affected the landlord's mind, and haſtened his death, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances tend alſo to ſhew how eaſily the lives of ſome are ſhortened.</p>
               <p>Being at Briſtol about ſour years ſince, I
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030668_0083_0FE857E89B06D6A8"/>enquired after a worthy leather ſeller whom I had ſormerly known, and was informed that he was lately dead, and that his death was ſuppoſed to have been haſtened by a famous fortune-teller, who having caſt his nativity, declared that he would die within ſix months, which afflicted his mind ſo as to accompliſh the prediction. The ſtory of the late Dr. Pitcairn, of Edinburgh, and the collier is well known.</p>
               <p>I have ſet down the above inſtances, in order to ſhew how eaſy it is to trifle away the lives of our fellow creatures, and ſurely ſuch who wantonly do it, muſt afterwards have very gloomy reflections.</p>

               <p>We followed this courſe about four months. During this time Mr, Jones once perſuaded me to go with him to the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. where we ſaw Shakeſpear's fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy of "As you like it."

I believe it is not generally known, and as ſew would ever have ſuſpected, that this child of Momus was alſo a child of grace.</p>
               <p>Since the publication of the firſt edition of theſe memoirs, I have read "The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of Mr. Tate Wilkinſon," patentee of the Theatres Royal of York and Hull, and was much ſurpriſed to learn that the famous Ned Shuter was a <hi>gracious ſoul.</hi> I will give you a paſſage or two out of Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon's memoirs, vol. ii. page 142, 12mo edition, &amp;c. "Mrs. Rich was a methodiſt, not that I mention it as a recommendation, or that ſhe was a better chriſtian for bowing at the ſhrine of nonſenſe and hypocriſy. Mr. Foot's laſh on methodiſin at that time was ſeverely ſelt by that ſect; their compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is gloom, melancholy, envy, and ſpleen; cheerfulneſs is ſeldom obſerved to dawn upon their countenances. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their boaſted inſpirations, if me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt preachers had a little reflection, what muſt they think of daring to pronounce eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry theatre the devil's houſe, and all the players the devil's children! I hope they are joking; and though it may be joking,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030668_0086_0FE857F30A4C90F0"/>I am ſorry to ſay it is wicked. To make a complete actor requires more requiſites to univerſally excel than almoſt any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion whatever.</p>
               <p>"The amazing powers diſplayed by a Garrick, a Barry, a Mrs. Cibber, and a Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and many others, is evidently the hand of God; he alone could give the finiſh to ſuch intrinſic merit. And that the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has intended them for that very work is evident; which, if not ſo produced, the world would have loſt ſeeing the higheſt pitch of admiration the human frame can aſpire to. To mention Shakeſpeare only, prove more than all the before-mentioned perſons; as he is a hoſt, and ſtands une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled as a moral writer, in many points, as well the wonder of the world, as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal genius. I do not wiſh to inſinuate that <hi>every methodiſt</hi> is an hypocrite, but I mean that I think the greateſt part are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo.

He recollected, he ſaid, the laſt Saturday he ever played at cards; that the rubber at whiſt was longer than he expected, and on obſerving the tediouſneſs of the game, he pulled out his watch, when to his ſhame he found it was ſome minutes paſt eight, which was beyond the time he had appointed to meet the Lord: he thought the devil had certainly tempted him to ſtay beyond his hour, he therefore ſuddenly gave his cards to a gentleman near him to finiſh the game, and went to the place appointed, beſeeching forgiveneſs for his crime, and reſolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030668_0092_0FE8580D9EAC6AC0"/>to play with the devil's pops again. That reſolution he had never broken; and what was more extraordinary, that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter, though diſtant from Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, experienced ſigns of grace on that ſame day, on that ſame hour, in the month of October. After the eaſy acquaintance he had made, the idea of which I think too ſolemn to declare and mention in the familiar manner thoſe ſelf elected people do; what muſt have become of all the tribes before us for the laſt, ſeventeen hundred years but damnation? how unfortunate that methodiſm did not ſtart up through a trap-door many centuries ago! what a hypocritical led-by-the-noſe world it would then have been!</p>
               <p>"Mr. Weſley, after expatiating on the devil's pops, ſaid, "Now, my dear friends! if you think there is no harm follows from playing at cards, why play at cards: if you think, my dear brethern, there is no harm in hunting a poor little hare and depriving it of life, why you may go a hunting without being guilty of ſin: I do not ſay you will be d—d for that, provided in your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you do not think you are doing wrong. If you think there is no harm in playing with the devil's books, or going to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, where you ſhall ſtay till two or three o'clock in the morning, and where they
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030668_0093_0FE85815260A76E0"/>dance belly to belly and back to back, and put themſelves in the moſt unſeemly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; why if you think there is no harm in going to that aſſembly, you may go. "I am told," continued Weſley, "you have a wicked play-houſe in Leeds—I do not ſay you will be d—d for going to ſee a play, if you think there is no harm in ſeeing a play. But now, my dear brethren, let me call you to a recollection of thoſe triſling matters; though you have heard me repeat that I do not pronounce damnation on my hearers for playing on the devil's pops, or for killing a harmleſs hare and depriving it of life—though I have not ſaid the devil is with ſpreading arms expecting to receive you, but that you may go to an aſſembly, or even to the devil's houſe, without damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet, my dear brethren, if inſtead of the devil's pops, the going a hunting, or to the dancing aſſembly, or to ſee a play, you can, like me, get acquainted and enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and intimacy with the Lord, who will talk, who will hold converſe with you here on earth—how can you prefer ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this fooliſh world to real bliſs in this and the world to come? Here ends Mr. Weſley.</p>
               <p>"The Rev. Mr. Whitefield (the firſt actor in the methodiſt walk) was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030668_0094_0FE8581711E183C0"/>caſt entirely, and not without humour here and there. His dialect was very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; <hi>Lurd</hi> inſtead of Lord, <hi>Gud</hi> inſtead of God, as, <hi>O Lurd Gud.</hi> I remember a text of his was, <hi>May we all work the harder.</hi> "There was a poor woman, and ſhe was a long time before ſhe was converted: ſhe was three ſcore years and ten—yes ſhe was; ſhe was three ſcore years and ten:—"Sir (ſays ſhe to the good man that converted her) ſir (ſays ſhe) I am three ſcore years and ten, I have been a long time about it; but ſir (ſays ſhe) I will work the harder; yes, ſir (ſays ſhe) I will work the harder!" And O! may you all like that dear good woman "work the harder." Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a groan of applauſe; for he had, like Mr. Bayes, a ſelected number of his pit that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their cues, and was ſure to applaud, and the reſt of the houſe followed of courſe. Then Whitefield, looking round the rails of his little deſk below—"What, you young ones! why you are ſome of you twelve, ſome fourteen, and ſome ſixteen years of age, yet you do not think of going to hell? What?" exclaimed Whitefield, "twelve and fourteen years of age and not think of going to hell! O ye little brats you!" and at that inſtant the old woman groaned, and like ſell Charybdis, murmured hoarſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030668_0095_0FE8581EDEC7D260"/>and Whitefield ſhook his head, and growled in his white whig exactly like my performance of ſquintum, as I exactly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed it from the ſerious comical diſcourſe I am now relating. Whitefield then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus, "You go to plays! and what do you ſee there! Why, if you will not tell me, I will tell you what you ſee there!—When you ſee the players on the ſtage, you ſee the devil's children grinning at you; and when you go to the play-houſe, I ſuppoſe you go in ruffles—I wonder whether St. Paul wore ruffles? No; there were no ruffles in thoſe days." "I am told," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he archly, "that people ſay I bawl —well I allow it, I do bawl, and I will bawl—I will not be a velvet-mouthed preacher, I will not ſpeak the word of <hi>Gud</hi> in a ſleepy manner, like your church preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers —I'll tell you a ſtory.</p>
               <p>"The Archbiſhop of Canterbury in the year 1675, was acquainted with Mr. Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton the player. One day the arch biſhop of Canterbury ſaid to Butterton the player, "pray inform me Mr. Butterton, what is the reaſon you actors on the ſtage can affect your congregations with ſpeaking of things imaginary, as if they were real, while we in church ſpeak of things real, which our congregations only receive
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030668_0096_0FE8582070FC8AE8"/>as if they were imaginary?' "Why, my lord (ſays Butterton the player) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is very plain. We actors on the ſtage, ſpeak of things imaginary, as if they were real, and you in the pulpit ſpeak of things real, as if they were imaginary." "There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore," added Whitefield, "I will bawl, I will not be a velvet-mouthed preacher." I leave the reader to judge on the good reaſoning of methodiſm. I Cannot help noticing for the honour of the ſtage, that Mr. Whitefield could not have betrayed himſelf into a better ſtory for its credit (his point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out an intimacy between the lord arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, and Mr. Butterton) and for the actor, he could not have given a more ſubſtantial and revered authority: and what a joke for Mr. Whitefield to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce damnation on players, when he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly avowed in his own opinion, that Mr. Butterton was, what all the world ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him to be, a ſcholar and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of honour; and Mr. Whitefield gave the players reaſoning and exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for his own mode of preaching.

What pity it is that our fears only, and not our reaſon, will bring conviction; but reaſon, handled by unaffected pure piety and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, would be a day of woe to methodiſm, and leſſen their audiences in many taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, where they are certain to lament
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030668_0098_0FE85834F8CEB598"/>preaching to nobody, though at the ſame time wedged to the outer doors, and on the Sunday exclaiming at the full crowded the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres, which have probably been almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. But Mr. Foote was only a ſpy at Whitefield's academy, while I had been a zealot for ſome ſeaſons before my encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at Covent Garden with Mr. Foote. My attendance had been conſtant with my friend Shuter, and as he was actually one of the new-born, and paid large ſums to White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, I was always permitted to ſtay with him, for he really was bewildered in his brain, more by wiſhing to acquire imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace, than by all his drinking; and whenever he was warm with the bottle, and with only a friend or two, like Maw-worm he could not mind his ſhop, becauſe he thought it was a ſin, and wiſhed to go a preaching; for ſhuter, like Maw-worm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he had a call. I have gone with Shuter at ſix in the morning of a Sunday to Tottenham Court Road, then before ten to Mr. Weſley's in Long Acre, at eleven again to Tottenham Court Road tabernacle, dined near Bedlam in Moorfields (a very proper place for us both) with a party of the holy ones, went at three to Mr. Weſley's theatre there (the tabernacle I mean) from that to Whitefield's in Moorfields till eight, and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030668_0099_0FE858336C5DF8A0"/>then ſhut up to commune with the family compact. Now with all this practice and attention, and with my natural talents, I muſt have been a blockhead indeed not to have gleaned ſome good things (and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mr. Whitefield was at times a good preacher, and truly excellent). I therefore really exhibited and obtained a much ſtronger likeneſs as Dr. Squintum, than Mr. Foote did. The week before my Covent Garden exhibition, I met my friend Shuter at the tabernacle; a great coolneſs had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time, as we had not ſpoke to or even looked at each other ſince the breach between us in the year 1758; but as we were met together in a place of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and forgiveneſs to all who ſubſcribed to the dictator, we became very ſociable, and before the concluſion of Whitefield's lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were perfectly reconciled. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the Roſe, and by three the next morning were ſworn friends, and contunued ſo till death called him away. Indeed he was above cleven years older than me, and would have been ſixty three had he lived to this time. Ned Shuter was a lively, ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhrewd companion; ſuperior natural whim and humour ſurely never inhabited a human breaſt, for what he ſaid and did was all his own, as it was with difficulty he could
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030668_0100_0FE8583C0F9C79A8"/>read the parts he had to play, and could not write at all; he had attained to <hi>ſign</hi> an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but no more. Nature could not have beſtowed her gifts to greater advantage than on poor Ned, as what ſhe gave he made ſhine not only conſpicuouſly but brilliant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that to the delight of all who knew him on or off the ſtage—he might be truly dubbed "The Child of Nature:"—He was no man's enemy but his own. Peace, reſt, and happineſs. I hope he now peſſeſſes—for the poor, the friendleſs, and the ſtranger he often comforted; and when ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his follies, he never could ſee a real object in miſery, and reſiſt giving at leaſt half he was worth to his diſtreſſed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creature."</p>
               <p>It is ſingular enough that about this time, although I could not write, yet I compoſed ſeveral ſongs, one of which was ſold for a guinea; ſome were given to the Briſtol printers, who printed them and the ballad-fingers ſung them about the ſtreets; on which occaſions I was as proud as though I, had compoſed an opera. My friend Mr. Jones was my ſecretary, who before I came to live with him had not the leaſt reliſh for books, and I had only read a few enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic authors, together with Pomfret's poems, this laſt I could almoſt repeat by memory;
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030668_0101_0FE858408DB9A818"/>however I made the moſt of my little ſtock of literature, and ſtrongly recommended the purchaſing of books to Mr. Jones. But ſo ignorant were we on the ſubject, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us knew what books were fit for our peruſul, nor what to enquire for, as we had ſcarce ever heard or ſeen even any <hi>title pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> except a few of the religious ſort, which at that time we had no reliſh for. So that we were at a loſs how to increaſe our ſmall ſtock of ſcience. And here I cannot help thinking that had fortune thrown proper books in our way, we ſhould have imbibed a juſt taſte for literature, and ſoon made ſome tolerable progreſs; but ſuch was our obſcurity, that it was next to impoſſible for us ever to emerge from it.</p>
               <p>As we could not tell what to aſk for, we were aſhamed to go into the bookſellers ſhops; and I aſſure you, my friend, that there are thouſands now in England in the very ſame ſituation: many, very many have come to my ſhop, who have diſcovered an enquiring mind, but were totally at a loſs what to aſk for, and who had no friend to direct them.</p>

               <p>One day as my friend Jones and I were ſtrolling about the fair that is annually held in and near St. James's church yard, we ſaw a ſtall of books, and in looking over the title pages, I met with Hobbes's tranſlation of Homer's Iliad and Odyſſey. I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how or other heard that Homer was a great poet, but unfortunately I had never heard of Pope's tranſlation of him, ſo we very eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſed that by Hobbes. At this ſtall I alſo purchaſed Walker's poetical paraphraſe of Epictetus's morals; and home we went, perfectly well pleaſed with our bargains.</p>
               <p>We that evening began with Hobbes's Homer; but found it very difficult for us to read, owing to the obſcurity of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which together with the different language, and want of poetical merit in the tranſlator, ſomewhat diſappointed us: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we had from time to time many a hard puzzling hour with him.</p>
               <p>But as to Walker's Epictetus, although that had not much poetical merit, yet it was very eaſy to be read, and as eaſily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The principles of the <hi>ſloics</hi> charmed me ſo much, that I made the book my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panior
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030668_0103_0FE85849D4459B10"/>wherever I went, and read it over and over in raptures, thinking that my mind was ſecured againſt all the ſmiles or frowns of fortune.</p>
               <p>I now grew weary of diſſipating my time, and began to think of employing my ſpare hours in ſomething more ſatisfactory. For want of ſomething elſe to do, I went one evening to hear Mr. John Weſley preach in Broadmead, and being completely tired of the way of life that I had lived (more or leſs) ever ſince I had been out of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip, and happening to have no other purſuit or hobby-horſe, there was a kind of vacuity in my mind; in this ſtate I was very ſuſceptible of any impreſſions, ſo that when I came to hear Mr. Weſley, my old fanatical notions returned full upon me, and I was once more carried away by the tide of enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>My friend Mr. Jones ſoon ſaw with grief and indignation the wonderful alteration in me; who, from a gay, volatile, diſſipated young fellow, was at once metamorphoſed into a dull, moping, praying, pſalm-ſinging fanatic, continually reprehending all about me for their harmleſs mirth and gaity.</p>

Nothing is more common than to ſee mankind run from one extreme to another: which was my caſe once more.</p>
               <p>About this time we left our habitation in Queen-ſtreet and took lodgings of Mr. Jones's mother, on St. Philip's Plain, where lived a brother of Mr. Jones, who was about ſeventeen years of age. Soon after we had removed to this place, the brother, whoſe name was Richard Jones, was permitted to work in the ſame room with my friend and me. They had alſo a ſiſter about twenty years of age, who frequently joined our company.</p>
               <p>Our room over-looked the church-yard, which contributed to increaſe my gloomy ideas; and I had ſo much of ſpiritual quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm in me, that I ſoon began to think that it was not enough for me to ſave my own ſoul, but I ought in conſcience to attempt the converſion of my companions, who (I really believed) were in the high road to hell, and every moment liable to eternal damnation.

A laughable affair happened during my reſidence here. A captain of a ſhip one day brought a parrot as a preſent to a family, the miſtreſs of which being a methodiſt, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to have one of the preachers call in juſt as the dinner was putting on the table, ſo that the captain and the preacher were both aſked to ſtay.

               <p>MR. John Jones and myſelf were now greater friends than ever, ſo that one would on no account ſtir out of the houſe without the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones had the advantage of me in temporals, he could get more money, than I could; but as to grace, and ſpiritual giſts, I had much the advantage of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; ſo that I was their ſpiritual direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and if they thought that any of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance held any opinions that were not quite found and orthodox, ſuch were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to me, in order that I might convince them of their errors. In ſact, I was looked upon as an apoſtle, ſo that whatever I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted was received as pure goſpel; nor was any thing undertaken without my advice.</p>

               <p>We had indeed a few of a better ſort, as Gay's Fables; Pomfret's Poems; Milton's Paradiſe Loſt; beſides Hobbes's Homer, and Walker's Epictetus, mentioned in my laſt letter.</p>
               <p>But what we wanted in judgment in chooſing our library, we made up in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſo anxious were we to read a great deal, that we allowed ourſelves but about three hours ſleep in twenty-four, and for ſome months together we never were all in bed at the ſame time (Sunday nights ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted). But leaſt we ſhould overſleep the time allowed, one of us ſat up to work until the time appointed for the others to riſe, and when all were up, my friend John and your humble ſervant, took it by turns to read aloud to the reſt, while they were at their work.</p>
               <p>But this mad ſcheme of ours had nearly
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030668_0111_0FE8586F70BA3670"/>been attended with very ſerious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. One night it being my turn to watch, I removed to the ſire ſide, to read ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paſſage, and the candleſtick which we worked by not being convenient to move about, and there being no other at that time in the room, I ſet up the candle againſt the handle of a pewter pot, and was ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heavy (owing to much watchfulneſs) that I ſell faſt aſleep and had like never to have awaked again; for the candle burned down to the handle of the pot, melted it off, and then fell on the chair on which it ſtood; ſo that Mr. Jones ſound me in the morning, faſt aſleep, and part of the chair conſumed; which alarmed us all very much, and made us more cautious.</p>
               <p>But ſtill we continued our plan of living, ſo that we made a napid progreſs in what we called ſpiritual and divine knowledge; and were ſoon maſters of the various arguments made uſe of by moſt polemical divines, &amp;c.</p>

And after they had ſaid all they could to confute me, I would point out where they had failed, and added ſuch arguments as I was maſter of, and in general we were all ſatisfied. But when we happened to have any doubts, we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the bible and commentators of our own ſide of the queſtion, and I aſſure you, my dear friend, this was a very fine hobby-horſe; which, like Aaron's ſerpent, ſwallowed up all the other hobby-horſes.</p>

               <p>The pleaſures of eating and drinking I entirely deſpiſed, and for ſome time carried this diſpoſition to an extreme. The account of Epicurus living in his garden, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of about a halfpenny per day, and that when he added a little cheeſe to his bread on particular occaſions, he conſidered it as a luxury, ſilled me with raptures. From that moment I began to live on bread and tea, and for a conſiderable time did not partake of any other viands, but in thoſe I indulged myſelf three or four times a day.

And here I cannot help remarking, that the term <hi>Epicure</hi> when applied to one who makes the pleaſures of the table his chief good caſts an unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on <hi>Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I continued the above ſelf-denying life until I left Briſtol, which was, on Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in 1769. I had for ſome time before been pointing out to my friend John Jones ſome of the pleaſures and advantages of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, ſo that I eaſily prevailed on him to accompany me towards the weſt of England; and in the evening we arrived at Bridgowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where Mr. Jones got work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When my friend was offered work by Mr. Caſh, I prevailed on him to accept of it, aſſuring him that I had no doubt of my being able to get work at Taunton: but in that I was diſappointed, nor could I get a conſtant ſeat of work until I came to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter, and of that place I was ſoon tired; but being informed that a Mr. John Taylor of Kingſbridge (forty miles below Exeter) wanted ſuch a hand, I went down, and was gladly received by Mr. Taylor, whoſe name inſpires me with gratitude, as he never treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me as a journeyman, but made me his companion: Nor was any part of my time ever ſpent in a more agreeable pleaſing manner than that which I paſſed in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired place, or I believe more profitable to a maſter. I was the firſt man he ever had that was able to make ſtuff and ſilk ſhoes, and it being alſo known that I came from Briſtol, this had great weight with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ladies, and procured my maſter cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who generally ſent for me to take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their ſeet, and I was looked upon by all to be the beſt workman in the town, although I had not been brought up to ſtuff work, nor had ever entirely made one ſtuff

Nor ſhould I have preſumed to proclaim myſelf a ſtuff-man, had there been any ſuch workmen in the place; but as there were none, I boldly ventured, and ſucceeded very well; nor did any one in the town ever know that it was my firſt attempt in that branch.</p>
               <p>During the time that I lived here, I as uſual was obliged to employ one or another of my acquaintance to write my letters for me; this procured me much praiſe among the young men as a good editor of letters; (I need not inform you that they were not good judges). My maſter ſaid to me one day, he was ſurpriſed that I did not learn to write my own letters; and added, that he was ſure that I could learn to do it in a very ſhort time. The thought pleaſed me much, and without any delay I ſet about it, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up any pieces of paper that had writing on them, and imitating the letters as well as I could. I employed my leiſure hours in this way for near two months, after which time I wrote my own letters, in a bad hand you may be ſure; but it was plain and eaſy to read, which was all I cared for: nor to the preſent moment can I write much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I never would have any perſon to teach me, nor was I ever poſſeſſed of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience enough to employ time ſufficient to
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030668_0118_0FE84D2C16E28540"/>learn to write well; and yet as ſoon as I was able to ſubſcribe, I wrote verſes on ſome triſle or other every day for years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>But I always wrote as faſt as I could, without endeavouring to write well, and that this is my preſent practice I need not inform you.</p>
               <p>I came to this place in but a weak ſtate of body, however the healthy ſituation of the town, together with bathing in the ſalt water, ſoon reſtored me to perfect health. I paſſed thirteen months here in a very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py manner: but the wages for work being very low, and as I had ſpent much time in writing hymns to every ſong tune that I knew, beſides a number of love verſes, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c. I was very poor; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete all, I began to keep a deal of company, in which I gave a looſe to my natural gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of diſpoſition, much more than was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the grave, ſedate ideas which I had ſormed of a religious character; all which made me reſolve to leave Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, which I did in 1770.</p>

                  </gap>ed about a fortnight, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient to carry me to Bridgewater, where I worked two or three weeks more. Before I arrived there Mr. John Jones had
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030668_0119_0FE85895568D4120"/>gone back to reſide at Briſtol, but as ſoon as he heard of my being in Bridgewater, he and his brother Richard ſent me an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come to Briſtol again and live with them. Finding that I did not immediately comply, they both came to Bridgewater, and declared their intentions of not returning to Briſtol without me; ſo that after a day or two I yielded to their ſolicitations, and again lived very comfortably with them, their mother and ſiſter.</p>
               <p>I think it was about this period, that I went ſeveral times to the tabernacle, and heard Mr. George Whitefield; and of all the preachers that ever I attended, never did I meet with one that had ſuch a perfect command over the paſſions of his audience. In every ſermon that I heard him preach, he would ſometimes make them ready to burſt with laughter, and the next moment drown them in tears; indeed it was ſcarce poſſible for the moſt guarded to eſcape the effect.</p>

               <p>In one of my excurſions I paſſed many agreeable hours with the late Mr. La Bute, at Cambridge, who was well known, he having taught French in that univerſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of forty years. He informed me that near forty years ſince, Mr. Whitefield hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed himſelf to preach at Gog-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog hill, many thouſand people collected together from many miles round. While he was preaching he was clevated on the higheſt ground, and his audience ſtood all round on the declivity; during his ſermon, a young country-woman, who had come ſome miles to hear him, and waited ſeveral hours, being very faint, owing to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat of the ſun, the breaths of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as well as the want of refreſhment; and it is very likely much agitated in her mind by the extraordinary doctrines of the preacher, ſhe fell backwards, juſt under the orator, and there lay kicking up her heels. On ſeeing the poor girl lie in a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, ſome of the company moved to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her, and the women began to draw down her apron and petticoats over her ſeet; but Mr. Whitefield cried out, <hi>"Let her alone! let her alone! A glorious ſight! a glorious
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030668_0121_0FE8589E659A7318"/>ſight!"</hi> No doubt the holy man meant that it was a glorious ſight to ſee a ſinner fall before the power of the word; but the young college bucks and wits conſtrued his meaning differently, and put the audience into ſuch immoderate ſits of laughter, that even Mr. Whitfield's utmoſt efforts were not able to reſtore their gravity, but he was obliged to diſmiſs his congregation abruptly.</p>
               <p>For a long time after this happened, the Cantabs as they reeled homewards in the night time, diſturbed the ſober inhabitants, by loudly exclaiming, "A glorious ſight! A glorious ſight! as Doctor Squintum ſays."</p>

But alas! theſe comfortable Sunday walks were ſoon at an end; as my charming Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Smith for ſome reaſon or other (I have forgot what) left her place, and went to live as dairy-maid with a farmer in the marſh country, between Bridgewater and Briſtol, ſeventeen miles from Taunton; ſo that I did not ſee her for near two years afterwards, during which time I gave ſpiritual advice to another holy ſiſter, whoſe name was Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah Allen.</p>
               <p>I prevailed on this lovely maid to attend the methodiſt preaching at five o'clock on Monday mornings, and we often met at three or four; ſo that we had an hour or two to ſpend in walking and converſation on ſpiritual affairs.

               <p>We kept our wedding at the houſe of my friends the Meſſrs. Jones's, and at bed-time retired to ready-furniſhed lodgings, which we had before provided, at half-a-crown per week. Our finances were but juſt ſufficient to pay the expences of the day, for the next morning in ſearching our pockets (which we did not do in a careleſs manner) we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that we had but one halfpenny to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the world with.

               <p>After having worked on ſtuff work in the country, I could not bear the idea of returning to the leather branch; ſo that I attempted and obtained a ſeat of ſtuff in Briſtol. But better work being required there than in Kingſbridge, &amp;c. I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take ſo much care to pleaſe my maſter, that at firſt I could not get more than nine
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030668_0130_0FE858D994C6DCE8"/>ſhillings a week, and my wife could get but very little, as ſhe was learning to bind ſtuff ſhoes, and had never been much uſed to her needle; ſo that what with the expence of ready furniſhed lodging, fire, candles, &amp;c. we had but little left for purchaſing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>To increaſe our ſtraits, my old friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat diſpleaſed at our leaving him and his relations, took an early oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to tell me that I was indebted to him near forty ſhillings, of two years ſtanding. I was not convinced of the juſtice of the claim, but to avoid diſpute, I paid him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two months, during nearly the whole of which time it was extremely ſevere weather, and yet we made four ſhillings and ſixpence per week pay for the whole of what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in eating and drinking. Strong beer we had none, nor any other liquor (the pure element excepted) and inſtead of tea, or rather coffee, we toaſted a piece of bread; at other times we fried ſome wheat, which when boiled in water made a tolerable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for coffee; and as to animal food, we made uſe of but little, and that little we boiled and made broth of.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN a few days after we had paid the laſt five ſhillings of the debt claimed by my friend Mr. Jones, we were both together taken ſo ill as to be confined to our bed, but the good woman of the houſe, our landlady, came to our room and did a ſew trifles for us. She ſeemed very
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030668_0132_0FE858E2E3C09E50"/>much alarmed at our ſituation, or rather for her own, I ſuppoſe, as thinking we might in ſome meaſure become burthenſome to her. We had in caſh two ſhillings and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, half a crown of which we had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully locked up in a box, to be ſaved for a reſource on any extraordinary emergence. This money ſupported us two or three days, in which time I recovered without the help of medicine; but my wife continued ill near ſix months, and was confined to her bed the greateſt part of her time; which ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may very eaſily be accounted for.</p>
               <p>Before ſhe came to Briſtol, ſhe had ever been uſed to a very active life, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lived in the country, ſo that in coming to dwell in a populous city, ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed much exerciſe and good air for a ſedentary life and very bad air; and this I preſume was the cauſe of all her illneſs from time to time, which at length, as unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately as effectually undermined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. During her firſt ſix months illneſs I lived many days ſolely on water gruel; for as I could not afford to pay a nurſe, much of my time was taken up in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on her, and moſt of my money expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in procuring medicines, together with ſuch trifles as ſhe could eat and drink. But what added extremely to my calamity was
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030668_0133_0FE858E46E4EB0C8"/>the being within the hearing of her groans, which were cauſed by the excruc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is impoſſible for words to deſcribe the keenneſs of my ſenſations during this long term; yet as to <hi>myſelf,</hi> my poverty and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to live upon water-gruel gave me not the leaſt uneaſineſs.</p>

               <p>How I ſupported this long dreary ſcene, I know not; the bare recollection of which is exceedingly painful, even at this diſtance of time. At laſt, when every thing that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030668_0134_0FE858EE39C35E68"/>to promiſe relief had been ried in vain, ſome old woman recommended <hi>Cephalic</hi> ſnuff. I own I had not much faith in it; however I procured it, and in a ſhort time after ſhe was much relieved from the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pain in her head, but yet continued in a very bad ſtate of health; her conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having ſuffered ſuch a dreadful ſhock, I thought that no means could be uſed ſo likely to reſtore it, as a removal to her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive air. Accordingly I left my ſeat of work at Briſtol, and returned with her to Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which is about ſeven miles from Peth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erton, her native place. But in Taunton I could not procure ſo much work as I could do; ſo that as ſoon at I thought ſhe could bear the air of Briſtol, we returned thither, where ſhe ſoon relapſed, and we again went back to Taunton. This removing to Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was repeated about five times in little more than two years and a half.</p>
               <p>But at laſt, finding that ſhe had long fits of illneſs at Taunton alſo, as well as at Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, with a view of having a better price for my work I reſolved to viſit London; and as I had not money ſufficient to hear the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of both to town, I left her all the money I could ſpare, and took a place on the outſide of the ſtage coach, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day arrived in the metropolis, in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt

               <p>AT this time I was as viſionary and ſuperſtitious as ever I had been at any preceding period, for although I had read ſome ſenſible books, and had thereby acquired a few rational ideas, yet having had a methodiſtical wife for near three years, and my keeping methodiſtical company, together with the gloomy notions which in ſpite of reaſon and philoſophy I had imbibed during the frequent, long, and indeed almoſt conſtant illneſs of my wife, the conſequence was, that thoſe few rational or liberal ideas which I had before treaſured up, were at my coming to London in a dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſtate, or borne down by the torrent of enthuſiaſtic whims, and fanatical chimeras.</p>
               <q>

So that I ſoon procured a lodging and work, my next enquiry was for Mr. Weſley's <hi>Goſpel-ſhops:</hi> and on producing my <hi>claſs</hi> and <hi>band</hi> tickets from Taunton, I was put into a claſs, and a week or two after admitted into a band.</p>
               <p>But it was ſeveral weeks before I could firmly reſolve to continue in London; as I really was ſtruck with horror for the fate of it; more particularly on Sundays, as I found ſo few went to church, and ſo many were walking and riding about for pleaſure, and the lower claſs getting drunk, quarrelling, fighting, working, buying, ſelling, &amp;c. I had ſeen ſo much of the ſame kind in Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol that I often wondered how God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to ſtand; but London I found infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worſe, and ſeriouſly trembled for fear the meaſure of iniquity was quite full, and that every hour would be its laſt. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I at length concluded, that if London was a ſecond <hi>Sodom,</hi> I was a ſecond <hi>Lot;</hi> and theſe comfortable ideas reconciled me to the thought of living in it. Beſides, ſome of Mr. Weſley's people gave me great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by aſſuring me, that "the Lord had much people in this city:" which I ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be true, as I got acquainted with many of thoſe righteous choſen ſaints, who modeſtly arrogate to themſelves that they
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030668_0138_0FE85902F7920360"/>are the peculiar favourites of heaven, and conſequently that any place they reſide in muſt be ſafe.</p>
               <p>In a month I ſaved money ſufficient to bring up my wife, and ſhe had a pretty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſtate of health; of my maſter I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome ſtuff-ſhoes for her to bind and nearly as much as ſhe could do. Having now plenty of work and higher wages, we were tolerably eaſy in our circumſtances, more ſo than we ever bad been, ſo that we ſoon procured a few clothes. My wife had all her life before done very well with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfine broad cloth cloak, but now I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on her to have one of ſilk.</p>
               <p>Until this winter I had never found out that I wanted a <hi>great coat,</hi> but now I made that important diſcovery; and my landlord ſhewed me one made of a coarſe kind of Bath coating, which he purchaſed new at a ſhop in Roſemary-lane for ten ſhillings and ſix pence; ſo that the next half guinea I had to ſpare, away I went to Roſemary-lane (and to my great ſurpriſe) was hauled into a ſhop by a fellow who was walking up and down before the door of a ſlopſeller, where I was ſoon fitted with a great coat of the ſame fort as that of my landlord. I aſked the price; but how great was my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the honeſt ſlop-man told me,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030668_0139_0FE85906AD080BB0"/>that he was ſo taken with my clean, honeſt, induſtrious looks, that he would let <hi>me</hi> have it cheaper than he would his own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo in one word he would oblige <hi>me</hi> with it for five and twenty ſhillings, which was the very money that it coſt him. On hearing this I croſſed the ſhop in a trice, in order to ſet off home again, but the door had a ſaſtening to it beyond by comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor would the good man let me out before I had made him an offer. I told him I had ſo little money about me that I could not offer any thing, and again deſired that he would let me out. But he perſiſted and at laſt I told him that my landlord had informed me that he had purchaſed ſuch another coat for ten ſhillings and ſix pence; on which he began to give himſelf airs, and aſſured me that however ſome people came by their goods, that for his part, he always paid for <hi>his.</hi> I heartily wiſhed myſelf out of the ſhop, but in vain; as he ſeemed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to part with me until I had made ſome offer. I then told him that I had but ten ſhillings and ſix pence, and of courſe could not offer him any more than I had got. I now expected more abuſe from him, but inſtead of that the patient good man told me, that as he perhaps might get ſomething by me another time, I ſhould have the coat for
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030668_0140_0FE8590E702EBB68"/>my half guinea, although it was worth more than double the money.</p>
               <p>About the end of November I received an account of the death of my grandfather; and was alſo informed that he had left a will in favour of my grandmother-in-law's rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who became poſſeſſed of all his effects, except a ſmall freehold eſtate, which he left to my youngeſt brother, becauſe he happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be called George (which was the name of my grandfather) and ten pounds a piece to each of his other grand-children.</p>
               <p>So totally unacquainted was I with the modes of tranſacting buſineſs, that I could not point out any method of having my ten pounds ſent up to London, at leaſt no mode that the executor of the will would approve of; it being ſuch-a <hi>prodigious</hi> ſum, that the greateſt caution was uſed on both ſides, ſo that it coſt me about half the money in going down for it, and in returning to town again. This was in extremely hard froſty weather (I think ſome time in December) and being on the outſide of a ſtage-coach, I was ſo very cold, that when I came to the inn where the paſſengers dined, I went directly to the fire, which ſtruck the cold inward, ſo that I had but a very narrow eſcape from death. This happened in going down. In returning back to town I had other misfortunes to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030668_0141_0FE85910078E76A8"/>The cold weather ſtill coutinuing, I thought the baſket warmer than the roof, and about ſix miles from Saliſbury, I went back into the baſket. But on getting out of it, in the inn yard at Saliſbury, I heard ſome money jingle, and on ſearching my pockets, I diſcovered that I had loſt abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſixteen ſhillings, two or three of which I found in the baſket, the reſt had fallen through on the road; and no doubt the whole of what I had left of my ten pounds would have gone the ſame way, had I not (for fear of highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) ſewed it up in my clothes. The loſs of my ſilver I bore with the temper of a ſtoic, and like Fpictetus reaſoned, that I could not have loſt it, if I had not firſt had it; and that as I had loſt it, why it was all the ſame as though it had never been in my poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>But a more dreadful misfortune befel me the next morning; the extreme ſevere wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill continuing, in order to keep me from dying with cold, I drank ſome purl and gin, which (not being uſed to drink any thing ſtrong) made me ſo drunk, that the conchman put me inſide the carriage for fear I ſhould ſall off the roof. I there met with ſome of the jovial ſort, who had alſo drank to keep out the cold, ſo that I ſound them in high glee; being aſked to ſing them a ſong, I immediately complied, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030668_0142_0FE859194EE5EB48"/>that I was one of the holy brethren, I ſung ſong for ſong with the merrieſt of them; only ſeveral times between the acts, I turned up the whites of my eyes, and uttered a few ejaculations, as "Lord forgive me!" "O Chriſt! What am I doing?" and a few more of the ſame pious ſort. However af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eating a good dinner, and refraining from liquor, I became nearly ſober, and by the time I arrived in town quite ſo; though in a terrible agitation of mind, by reflecting on what I had done, and was ſo aſhamed of the affair, that I concealed it from my wife, that I might not grieve her righteous ſoul with the knowledge of ſo dreadful a fall: ſo that ſhe with great pleaſure ripped open the places in my clothes, which contained my treaſure, and with an heart full of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, piouſly thanked providence for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording us ſuch a ſupply, and hoped that the Lord would enable us to make a good uſe of it.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WITH the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the money we purchaſed houſe hold goods, but as we then had not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to furniſh a room, we worked hard, and lived ſtill harder, ſo that in a ſhort time we had a room furniſhed with our own goods; and I believe that it is not poſſible for you to imagine with what pleaſure and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we looked round the room and ſurveyed our property: I believe that Alexander the Great never reflected on his immenſe acquiſitions with half the heart-felt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we experienced on this capital attainment.</p>
               <p>After our room was furniſhed, as we ſtill enjoyed a better ſtate of health than we did at Briſtol and Taunton, and had alſo more work and higher wages, we often added ſomething or other to our ſtock of wearing apparel. Nor did I forget the old-book ſhops: but frequently added an old book to my ſmall collection, and I really have often purchaſed books with the money that
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030668_0144_0FE85921A9D430E0"/>ſhould have been expended in purchaſing ſomething to eat; a ſtriking inſtance of which follows:
At the time we were purchaſing houſhold goods, we kept ourſelves very ſhort of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and on Chriſtmas-eve we had but half a crown left to buy a Chriſtmas dinner. My wife deſired that I would go to market, and purchaſe this feſtival dinner, and off I ſet for that purpoſe; but in the way I ſaw an old-book ſhop, and I could not reſiſt the temptation of going in; intending only to expend ſixpence or ninepence out of my half-crown. But I ſtumbled upon Young's Night Thoughts—down went my half-crown —and I haſtened home, vaſtly delighted with the acquiſition. When my wiſe aſked me where was our Chriſtmas dinner? I told her it was in my pocket.—"In your pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et (ſaid ſhe) that is a ſtrange place. How could you think of ſtuffing a joint of meat into your pocket?" I aſſured her that it would take no harm. But as I was in no haſte to take it out, ſhe began to be more particular, and enquired what I had got, &amp;c. On which I began to harrangue on the ſuperiority of intellectual pleaſures over ſenſual gratifications, and obſerved that the brute creation enjoyed the latter in a much higher degree than man. And that a man,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030668_0145_0FE8592334A8E560"/>that was not poſſeſſed of intellectual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was but a two-legged brute.</p>
               <p>I was proceeding in this ſtrain: "And ſo (ſaid ſhe) inſtead of buying a dinner, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have, as you have done before, been buying <hi>books</hi> with the money?" I then confeſſed I had bought Young's Night Thoughts: "And I think (ſaid I) that I have acted wiſely; for had I bought <hi>a din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> we ſhould have eaten it to-morrow, and the pleaſure would have been ſoon over, but ſhould we live fifty years longer, we ſhall have the <hi>Night Thoughts</hi> to feaſt upon." This was too powerful an argument to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any further debate; in ſhort, my wife was convinced. Down I ſat, and began to read with as much enthuſiaſm as the good doctor poſſeſſed when he wrote it; and ſo much did it excite my attention as well as approbation, that I retained the greateſt part of it in my memory. A couplet of Perſius, as Engliſhed, might have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to me:
<q>
                     <l>"—For this you gain thoſe meagre looks,</l>
                     <l>"And ſacrifice your dinner to your books."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Some time in June 1774, as we ſat at work in our room, Mr. Boyd, one of Mr. Weſley's people, called and informed me that a little ſhop and parlour were to be let
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030668_0146_0FE8592C041F0208"/>in Featherſtone-ſtreet; adding, that if I was to take it, I might there get ſome work as a maſter. I without heſitation told him that I liked the idea, and hinted that I would ſell books alſo. Mr. Boyd then aſked me how I came to think of ſelling books? I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that until that moment it had never once entered into my thoughts; but that when he propoſed my taking the ſhop, it inſtantaneouſly occurred to my mind, that for ſeveral months paſt I had obſerved a great increaſe in a certain old book ſhop; and that I was perſuaded I knew as much of old books as the perſon who kept it. I farther obſerved, that I loved books, and that if I could but be a bookſeller, I ſhould then have plenty of books to read, which was the greateſt motive I could conceive to induce me to make the attempt. My friend on this aſſured me, that he would get the ſhop for me, and with a laugh added, "when <hi>you</hi> are Lord Mayor, you ſhall uſe all your intereſt to get <hi>me</hi> made an Alderman." Which I engaged not to forget to perform.</p>
               <p>My <hi>private library</hi> at this time conſiſted of Fletcher's Checks to Antinomianiſm, &amp;c. 5 volumes; Watt's Improvement of the Mind; Young's Night Thoughts; Wake's Tranſlation of the Apoſtolical Epiſtles; Fleetwook's Life of Chriſt; the firſt twenty
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030668_0147_0FE8592D91CF8E18"/>numbers of Hinton's Dictionary of the Arts and Sciences; ſome of Weſley's Journals, and ſome of the pious lives publiſhed by him; and about a dozen other volumes of the latter ſort, beſides odd magazines, &amp;c. And to ſet me up in ſtile, Mr. Boyd recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to the friends of an holy brother lately gone to heaven, and of them I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a bagful of old books, chiefly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for a guinea.</p>
               <p>With this ſtock, and ſome odd ſcraps of leather, which together with all my books were worth about five pounds, I opened ſhop on midſummer-day, 1774, in Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone-ſtreet, in the pariſh of St. Luke; and I was as well pleaſed in ſurveying my little ſhop with my name over it, as was Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, when he ſaid "Is not this great Babylon that I have built?" and my good wife often perceiving the pleaſure that I took in my ſhop, piouſly cautioned me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſetting my mind on the riches of this world, and aſſured me that it was all but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. "You are very right, my dear (I ſometimes r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030668_0148_0FE85934C8F86EB8"/>mind nothing but the good of our ſouls: our ſmall beer ſhall be fetched in on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day nights, nor will we dreſs even a potatoe on the ſabbath. We will ſtill attend the preaching at five o'clock in the morning; at eight go to the prayer meeting; at ten to the public worſhip at the Foundery; hear Mr. Perry at Gripplegate, at two; be at the preaching at the Foundery at five; meet with the general ſociety at ſix; meet in the united bands at ſeven, and again be at the prayer meeting at eight; and then come home to read and pray by ourſelves."</p>

               <p>NOtwithſtanding the obſcurity of the ſtreet, and the mean appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my ſhop, yet I ſoon found cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for what few books I had, and I as ſoon laid out the money in other old traſh which was daily brought for ſale.</p>
               <p>At that time Mr. Weſley's people had a ſum of money which was kept on purpoſe to lend out, for three months, without inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to ſuch of their ſociety whoſe characters were good, and who wanted a temporary relief. To increaſe my little ſtock, I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed five pounds out of this fund, which was of great ſervice to me.</p>
               <p>In our new ſituation we lived in a very frugal manner, often dining on potatoes, and quenching our thirſt with water, being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely determined if poſſible to make ſome proviſion for ſuch diſmal times as ſickneſs, ſhortneſs of work, &amp;c. which we had been ſo frequently involved in before, and could ſcarce help expecting to be our fate again. My wife ſoreboded it much more than I did, being of a more melancholy turn of mind.</p>
               <l>"A ſad prophetic ſpirit dwells with woe."</l>
               <p>I lived in this ſtreet ſix months, and in
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030668_0150_0FE8593D9B8DA278"/>that time increaſed my ſtock from five pounds, to twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>"London—the public there are candid and generous, and before my merit can have time to create me enemies, I'll ſave money, and a fig for the Sultan and Sophy."</p>
               <p>ROVER.</p>
               <p>This immenſe ſtock I deemed too valuable to be buried in Featherſtone-ſtreet; and a ſhop and parlour being to let in Chiſwell-ſtreet, No. 46, I took them. This was at that time, and for fourteen years afterwards a very dull and obſcure ſituation: as few ever paſſed through it, beſides Spitalfield weavers on <hi>hanging days,</hi> and methodiſts <hi>on preaching nights;</hi> but ſtill it was much better adapted for buſineſs than Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>A few weeks after I came into Chilwell-ſtreet, I bade a final adieu to the <hi>gentle craſt,</hi> and converted my little ſtock of leather, &amp;c. into old books; and a great ſale I had, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my ſtock; which was not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſmall, but contained very little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, as it principally conſiſted of divinity; for as I had not much knowledge, ſo I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ventured out of my depth. Indeed there was one claſs of books, which for the firſt year or two that I called myſelf a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030668_0151_0FE8593F27C1A878"/>I would not ſell, for ſuch was my ignorance, bigotry, ſuperſtition (or what you pleaſe) that I conſcientiouſly deſtroyed ſuch books as fell into my hands which were written by freethinkers; for really ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be dictated by the devil, I would neither read them myſelf, nor ſell them to others.</p>
               <p>I went on proſperouſly until ſome time in September, 1775, when I was ſuddenly taken ill of a dreadful fever; and eight or ten days after, my wife was ſeized with the ſame diſorder.</p>
               <p>At that time I only kept a boy to help in my ſhop, ſo that I ſear, while I lay ill, my wife had too much care and anxiety on her mind. I have been told that before ſhe was confined to her bed ſhe walked about in a delirious ſtate; in which ſhe did not long continue, but contrary to all expectation died, in enthuſiaſtic rant, on the ninth of November, ſurrounded with ſeveral me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſtical preachers.</p>

               <p>A Friend of mine, of whoſe veracity I entertain the higheſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has favoured me with an account of a lady, who has to the full as much, indeed more of the ſpirit, but without the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of Nancy Lackington. The fact is as follows:</p>
               <l>"'Tis true 'tis pity: and pity 'tis it's true."</l>
               <p>Mr. R—t, a genteel tradeſman with whom I am acquainted, having loſt his ſecond wife early in 1790, courted and married one of the holy ſiſters a few months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. They had lived together about ſix months, when Mr. R—t, one Sunday, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſober religious man, took down Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's Lectures, and began to read them to his wife and family. But this holy ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter found fault with her huſband for reading ſuch learned rational diſcourſes, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured too much of human reaſon and vain
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030668_0154_0FE8594F70EB0A70"/>philoſophy, and wiſhed he would read ſomething more ſpiritual and edifying. He attempted to convince her that Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge was not only a good rational divine, but to the full as ſpiritual as any divine ought to be; and that to be more ſpiritual he muſt be leſs rational, and of courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fanatical and viſionary. But theſe obſervations of the huſband ſo diſpleaſed his ſpiritual wife, that ſhe retired to bed, and left her huſband to read Doddridge's Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as long as he choſe to his children by a former wife.</p>
               <p>The next morning while Mr. R—t was out on buſineſs, this holy ſiſter, without ſaying one ſyllable to any perſon, packed up all her clothes, crammed them into a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However after ſome buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the ſtreet, I took a farewell kiſs. Poor dear ſoul! (ſigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I muſt give you one more ſtory of the ſame nature with the preceding.</p>
               <p>A gentleman of London happening to be on a viſit at Briſtol about three years ſince, fell in love with a handſome young lady who was one of the holy ſiſterhood; after a few weeks acquaintance he made her an offer of his perſon and fortune, and the young lady after proper enquiry had been
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030668_0156_0FE859585F6D5D48"/>made into the gentleman's family, fortune, &amp;c. conſented to make our lover happy. They were ſoon after married, and the ſame day ſet off in a poſt-chaiſe towards London, in order to ſleep the firſt night at an inn, and ſo ſave the lady the bluſhes occaſioned by the jokes common on ſuch occaſions; this happy couple had been in bed about an hour when the cry of murder alarmed the houſe, this alarm proceeding from the room that was occupied by the bride and bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, drew the company that way; the inn-keeper knocked at the door and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded admittance, our Benedict appeared at the door, and informed the hoſt that his lady had been taken ſuddenly ill in a kind of fit he believed, but that ſhe was better; and after the inn-keeper's wife had been ſent into the room to ſee the young lady, and had ſound her well, all retired to bed.</p>
               <p>They had, however, not lain more than two hours, when the cry of murder, fire, &amp;c. again alarmed the houſe, and drew many out of their beds once more.</p>
               <p>Our young gentleman then dreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and opening the door, informed the company that he had that morning been married to the young lady in bed, and that being married, he had inſiſted on being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the privilege of an huſband, but
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030668_0157_0FE85959EC6D2B40"/>that the young lady had talked much about the good of her poor ſoul, her ſpiritual huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp;c. and that inſtead of granting what he conceived to be the right of every huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe had thought proper to diſturb all in the houſe. He added, that having been thus made very ridiculous, he would take effectual care to prevent a repetition of the ſame abſurd conduct.</p>
               <p>He then ordered a poſt-chaiſe and ſet off for London, leaving our young ſaint in bed to enjoy her ſpiritual contemplations in their full extent, nor has he ever ſince paid her any attention.</p>
               <p>Some time ſince being in a large town in the weſt, ſhe was pointed out to me by a friend, as ſhe was walking in the ſtreet.</p>
               <p>The above puts me in mind of what Ovid ſays was practiſed by young maids on the feſtival of the celebrated nymph <hi>Anna Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renna,</hi> thus tranſlated by I know not who:
<q>
                     <l>"With promiſes the amorous god ſhe led,</l>
                     <l>"And with fond hopes his eager paſſion fed,</l>

                     <l>"My pray'rs have gain'd the victory o'er pride.</l>
                     <l>"With joy the god prepares the golden bed;</l>
                     <l>"Thither, her face conceal'd, is Anna led,</l>
                     <l>"Juſt on the brink of bliſs, ſhe ſtands confeſs'd</l>
                     <l>"The diſappointed lover is her jeſt,</l>
                     <l>"While rage and ſhame alternate ſwell his breaſt.</l>

I am informed from good authority that there are now in Mr. Weſley's ſociety, in London, ſome women, who ever ſince they were converted, have refuſed to ſleep with their huſbands, and that ſome of thoſe will not pay the leaſt attention to any temporal concern whatever, being as they term it, wholly wrapped up in divine contemplation, having their ſouls abſorbed in divine love, ſo as not to be interrupted by the trifling concerns of a huſband, family, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>BECAUSE ſome of the holy ſiſters are in their amours altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual, you are by no means to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030668_0159_0FE85962EABB4908"/>that they are all totally diveſted of the carnal propenſity.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe good creatures are ſo far from thinking that their huſbands are too carnal in their affections, that they really think that they are not enough ſo; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are not wanting, in which, owing to their having huſbands too ſpiritual, they have been willing to receive aſſiſtance from the huſbands of other women.</p>
               <p>It is but about a year ſince a certain cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated preacher uſed to adminiſter carnal conſolation to the wife of his clerk. This holy communication was repeated ſo often, and ſo open, that at laſt it came to the clerk's ears, who watching an opportunity, one day ſurpriſed the pious pair at their <hi>devotion,</hi> and ſo <hi>belaboured</hi> the preacher with his walking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, that the public were for near a month deprived of the benefits reſulting from his remarkable gift of eloquence.</p>
               <p>As I am got into the ſtory-telling way, I cannot reſiſt the temptation of telling ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>A certain holy ſiſter who lately kept a houſe in a country village, within ten miles of London; and <hi>took in</hi> (as they called it) Mr. Weſleys preachers, by taking <hi>in</hi> is only meant, that when they came in their turn to
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030668_0160_0FE8596A1B41DFF0"/>preach in the village ſhe uſed to ſupply each with victuals and a bed; (<hi>no doubt</hi> but they ſlept <hi>alone.</hi>) This lady was ſo very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for her <hi>ſpiritual experience</hi> and divine gifts, that ſhe attracted many to her houſe, beſides ſuch as came in the regular courſe of their duty, and among the former a preacher from London, from whom I learnt the affair. This preacher happening to want a wife, and being very ſpiritually-minded, actually married her in December 1790, merely for her great gifts and grace, as her fortune was not above the fiftieth part as much as his own; and as to perſon, ſhe is ſcarce one degree above uglineſs itſelf; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her huſband is well-proportioned, and upon the whole a handſome man. They had not been married a week, when this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preacher diſcovered that his gifted gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſaint was an incarnate devil, who had married him only to job, plunder, and —him, and in a few months between her and her gallants, they bullied him out of a ſettlement to the amount of four times the ſum ſhe brought him, and the poor pious preacher thinks that he has cheaply got rid of her.</p>

What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much to my misfortunes, ſeveral nurſes that were hired to take care of me and my wife, proved ſo abandoned and depraved as to have loſt all ſenſe of moral obligation, and every tender feeling for one who to all appearance was juſt on the point of death: ſeveral of theſe monſters in female ſhape robbed my drawers of linen, &amp;c. and kept themſelves drunk with gin, while I lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to move in my bed, and was ready to periſh, partly owing to want of cleanlineſs and proper care. Thus ſituated, I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably have fallen a victim, had it not been for my ſiſter Dorothy, wife of Mr. Northam of Lambeth, and my ſiſter Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth wife of Mr. Bell in Soho. Theſe kind ſiſters, as ſoon as they were informed of he deplorable ſtate in which I lay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome miſunderſtanding which
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030668_0166_0FE8598D696D31B0"/>ſubſiſted between us, and prevented me from ſending for them, haſtened to me and each ſat up with me alternately, ſo that I had one or the other with me every night; and, contrary to all expectation, I recovered. But this recovery was in a very ſlow man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I was able to enquire into the ſtate of my affairs, I found that Mr. Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ſack and rope-maker in Old-ſtreet, and Meſſrs. Bottomley and Shaw, carpenters and ſaſh-makers in Bunhill-row, had ſaved me from ruin, by locking up my ſhop, which contained my little <hi>all.</hi> Had not this been done, the nurſes would no doubt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived means to have emptied my ſhop, as effectually as they had done my drawers.</p>
               <p>The above gentlemen not only took care of my ſhop, but alſo advanced money to pay ſuch expences as occurred: and as my wife was dead, they aſſiſted in making my will in favour of my mother.</p>
               <p>Theſe worthy gentlemen belong to Mr. Weſley's ſociety (and notwithſtanding they have imbibed many enthuſiaſtic whims) yet would they be an honour to any ſociety, and are a credit to human nature.

               <p>On my recovery I alſo learnt that Miſs Dorcas Turton (the young woman that kept the houſe, and of whom I then rented the ſhop, parlour, kitchen and garret) having out of kindneſs to my wife, occaſionally aſſiſted her during her illneſs, had caught the ſame dreadful diſorder, ſhe was then very dangerouſly ill, and people ſhunned the houſe as much as if the plague had been in it. So that when I opened my ſhop again, I was ſtared at as though I had actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the other world; and it was a conſiderable time before many of my former cuſtomers could credit that I really was in exiſtence, it having been repeatedly report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I was dead.</p>
               <p>Miſs Dorcas Turton, was a charming young woman, and you muſt now be made farther acquainted with her. She is the daughter of Mr. Samuel Turton of Stafford-ſhire; her mother by marriage, ſtill retained her maiden name, which was Miſs Jemima
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:030668_0168_0FE859966561C748"/>Turton, of Oxfordſhire. Mr. Samuel Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had a large fortune of his own, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty thouſand pounds with his wife Miſs Jemima, but by an unhappy turn for gaming he diſſipated nearly the whole of it, and was obliged to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He opened a ſhop as a ſaddlers ironmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but as he was but little acquainted with trade, and as his old propenſity to gaming never quitted him, it is no wonder that he did not ſucceed in his buſineſs; and to crown all his other follies, he was bound for a falſe friend in a large ſum; this completed his ruin.</p>
               <p>His wife died in Jan. 1773 and his final ruin enſued a few months after; ſo that from that time to his death he was partly ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his daughter Miſs Dorcas Turton, who cheerfully ſubmitted to keep a ſchool, and worked very hard at plain work, by which means ſhe kept her father from want. The old gentleman died a few months after I came into the ſhop. Being partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this young lady's goodneſs to her father, I concluded that ſo amiable a daughter was very likely to make a good

Add to the above, my having won a ſecond time in a game where the odds were ſo much againſt me; or to uſe another ſimile, my having drawn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:030668_0171_0FE85997F025F168"/>prize in the lottery of wedlock, and thus like John Buncle repaired the loſs of one very valuable woman by the acquiſition of another ſtill more valuable.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Reflecting on the above united circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I found in my heart an unuſual ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſuch as until then I had been a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to; my mind began to expand, intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light and pleaſure broke in and diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the gloom of fanatical melancholy; the ſourneſs of my natural temper which had been much increaſed by ſuperſtition, (called by Swift, "the ſpleen of the ſoul,") in part gave way, and was ſucceeded by cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſome degree of good nature.</p>
               <p>It was in one of theſe cheerful moods that I one day took up the life of John Buncle; and it is impoſſible for my friend to imagine with what eagerneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I read through the whole four volumes
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030668_0172_0FE8599F3116BDF0"/>of this whimſical, ſenſible, pleaſing work; it was written by Thomas Amory, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (who was living in the year 1788, at the great age of 97) and I know not of any work more proper to be put into the hands of a poor ignorant bigotted ſuperſtitious method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt; but the misfortune is, that ſcarce one of them will read any thing but what ſuits with their own narrow notions, ſo that they ſhut themſelves up in darkneſs, and exclude every ray of intellectual light; which puts me in mind of the enthuſiaſts on the banks of the Ganges, who will not look at any thing beyond the tip of their moſes. By the time I had gone through the laſt volume,</p>

               <p>I alſo received great benefit from reading Coventry's Philemon to Hydaſpes; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of dialogues on falſe religion, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant devotion, &amp;c. in which are many very curious remarks on viſionaries of various ages and ſects. The works is complete in five parts octavo. There has alſo been a decent Scotch edition, publiſhed in twelves, both editions are now rather ſcarce.</p>
               <p>I now began to enjoy many innocent pleaſures and recreations in life, without the fear of being eternally damn'd for a laugh,

               </q>
               <p>Having begun to think rationally, and reaſon freely on religious matters, you may be ſure I did not long remain in Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's ſociety. What is remarkable, I well remember that ſome years before, Mr. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley told his ſociety in Broadmead, Briſtol, in my hearing, that he could never keep a bookſeller ſix months in his ſtock, (all fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics are enemies to reaſon.) He was then pointing out the danger that attended cloſe reaſoning in matters of religion and ſpiritual concerns, in reading controverſies, &amp;c, at that time I had not the leaſt idea of my ever becoming a bookſeller: but I no ſooner began to give ſcope to my reaſoning facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than the above remarkable aſſertion oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to my mind.</p>
               <p>But that which rather haſtened my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from methodiſm was this. The
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030668_0175_0FE859A0C14DBD80"/>methodiſt preachers were continually repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the practice of maſters and miſtreſſes keeping ſervants at home on Sundays, to dreſs dinners, which prevented them from hearing the word of God (by the word of God they mean their own jargon of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe) aſſuring them if the ſouls of ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were damned, they might in a great meaſure lay their damnation at the doors of ſuch maſters and miſtreſſes, who rather than eat a cold dinner, would be guilty of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſabbath, and riſking the ſouls of their ſervants. But how great was my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize on diſcovering that theſe very men who were continually preaching up faſting, abſtinence, &amp;c. to their congregations, and who wanted others to dine off cold dinners, or eat bread and cheeſe, &amp;c. would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not even <hi>ſup,</hi> without roaſted fowls, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This I found to be fact, as I ſeveral times had occaſion after attending the preaching to go into the kitchen hehind the <hi>old Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery,</hi> (which at that time was Mr. Weſley's preaching houſe) there I ſaw women who had been kept from hearing the ſermon, &amp;c. they being employed in roaſting fowls, and otherwiſe providing good ſuppers for the preachers.</p>
               <p>"So," ſaid I, "you lay burthens on
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030668_0176_0FE859A7EB2E2B30"/>other men's ſhoulders, but will not ſo much as touch them yourſelves with one of your ſingers."</p>
               <p>A ridiculous inſtance of the ſame nature happened alſo ſome years ſince at Taunton. One of Mr. Weſley's preachers, whoſe name was Cotterrell, aſſured his congregation from time to time, that every baker that bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meat on Sundays would be damned, and every perſon that partook of ſuch meat would alſo be damned; on which a poor baker ſhut up his oven on Sundays; the conſequence was that he loſt his cuſtomers, as ſuch bakers as baked their victuals on Sunday, had their cuſtom on other days, ſo that the poor baker's family was nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the workhouſe; when one Sunday paſſing before the door where he knew the preacher was to dine, he was very much ſurpriſed to ſee a baked leg of pork carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the houſe, and after a few minutes reflections he ruſhed in and found the pious preacher eating part of the baked leg of pork, on which he bid farewell to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts, and again took care for his family.</p>
               <p>It perhaps is worth remarking, that many poor hair-dreſſers in Mr. Weſley's ſociety are reduced to extreme poverty, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get employment, as they will not dreſs hair on Sundays; and I find that a poor
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:030668_0177_0FE859A978A09118"/>milk woman, who until the beginning of this year 1792, maintained her family in a decent manner, was lately frightened out of her underſtanding by a methodiſt preacher; her crime was the ſelling milk on Sundays. The poor wretch is now confined in Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, and her five children are in a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>
               <p>I at this time know a bookſeller, who being a methodiſt, is ſo conſcientious as to have his hair dreſſed on the evening of every Saturday, and to prevent its being diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the night, he on thoſe nights al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſleeps in his elbow chair. Indeed ſome tell the ſtory different, and ſay, that his hair is dreſſed on Saturday morning, and by ſleeping in his chair he ſaves the expence of dreſſing on Sundays; others ſay, that the firſt is the fact, and that he hinted at it in his ſhop-bills, in order that the public may know where to find a tradeſman that had a very tender conſcience.</p>
               <p>I was one day called aſide and a hand-bill was given me, and thinking it to be a quack doctor's bill for a certain diſeaſe, I expreſſed my ſurpriſe at its being given to me in ſuch a particular manner; but on reading it I found it contained a part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>I Had no ſooner left Mr. Weſley's ſociety, and began to talk a little more like a rational being, but I found that I had incurred the hatred of ſome, the pity of others, the envy of many, and the diſpleaſure of <hi>all</hi> Mr. Weſley's—<hi>old women!</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:030668_0179_0FE859B230814068"/>So that for a long time I was conſtantly teaſed with their impertinent nonſenſe. I believe that never was a poor devil ſo plagued.</p>

               <p>Some as they paſſed by my door in their way to the foundery would only make a ſtop and lift up their hands, turn up the whites of their eyes, ſhake their heads, groan, and paſs on. Many would call in and take me aſide, and after making rueful faces, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs me with, "O, Brother Lackington! I am very ſorry to find that you who began in the ſpirit are now like to end in the fleſh. Pray brother, do remember Lot's wife.' Another would interrupt me in my buſineſs, to tell me, that, "he that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is unfit for the kingdom." Another had juſt called as he was paſſing by, to caution me againſt the bewitching ſnares of proſperity. Others again called to know if I was as happy then as I was when I conſtantly ſought the Lord with my brethren, in prayer meeting, in claſs, in band, &amp;c. When I aſſured them that I was more happy, they in a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030668_0180_0FE859B9631523E0"/>manner aſſured me, that I was under a very great deluſion of the devil; and when I by chance happened to laugh at their enthuſiaſtic rant, ſome have run out of my ſhop, declaring that they were afraid to ſtay under the ſame roof with me, leſt the houſe ſhould fall on their heads. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have been accoſted in ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming manner as though the houſe was on fire, with "Oh! brother! brother! you are faſt aſleep! and the flames of hell are taking hold of you!"</p>
               <p>A certain preacher aſſured me, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſeveral gentlemen, that the devil would ſoon toſs me about in the flames of hell with a pitchſork. This ſame eloquene mild preacher uſed occaſionally to ſtrip to his ſhirt to <hi>dodge</hi> the devil.</p>
               <p>Mr. E. a gentleman of my acquaintance, going through ſome alley, one Sunday, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very uncommon noiſe, was led by curioſity to the houſe from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and there he ſaw elevated above an aſſembly of old women, &amp;c. this taylor, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> ſaints aſſured me, that I never had one grain of ſaving grace, and that when I thought myſelf a child of God, I was only deluded by the devil, who being now quite ſure of me, did not think it worth his while to deceive me any longer. Others adviſed me to take care of ſinning againſt light and knowledge, and piouſly hoped that it was not quite <hi>too late;</hi> that I had not (they hoped) committed the <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable</hi> ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Others again, who happened to be in a better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, often told'me that they ſhould ſee me brought back to the true ſheepfold, as they really hoped I had once been in a ſtate of grace, and if ſo, that I always was in grace, in ſpite of all I could do: the Lord would never quit his hold of me; that I might fall <hi>foully,</hi> but that it was impoſſible for me to fall <hi>finally,</hi> as in the end I ſhould be brought, back on the ſhoulders of the everlaſting goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for when God came to number his jewels, not one would be miſſing.</p>
               <p>One of theſe righteous men, after paſſing ſome encomiums on me for my moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, aſſured me that I had by no means fallen ſo law as many of God's dear children
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030668_0182_0FE859C277118CA8"/>had fallen, but fall as low as they poſſibly can, ſaid he, they are ſtill God's children, for although they may "be black with ſin they are fair within" He then read to me the following paſſage out of a pamphlet writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt Mr. Fletcher by Mr. R. Hill. <q>David ſtood as completely juſtified in the everlaſting righteouſneſs of Chriſt, at the time when he cauſed Uriah to be murdered, and was committing adultery with his wife, as he was in any part of his life. For all the ſins of the elect, be they more or be they leſs, be they paſt, preſent, or to come, were forever done away. So that every one of thoſe <hi>elect</hi> ſtand ſpotleſs in the ſight of God.</q> Is not this a very comfortable kind of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? The pernicious conſequences of ſuch tenets impreſſed on the minds of the ignorant followers of theſe quacks in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, muſt be obvious to every perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reflection. They have nothing to do but to enliſt themſelves in the band of the elect, and no matter then how criminal their life!</p>
               <p>Thus, my dear friend, I was for a long time coaxed by ſome, threatened with all the tortures of the damned by others, and conſtantly teazed ſome how or other by all the methodiſts who came near me.</p>

               </q>
               <p>I at laſt determined to laugh at all their ridiculous perverſions of the ſcripture, and their ſpiritual cant. The conſequence (as might be expected) was, they piouſly and charitably conſigned me over to be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the devil, and every where declared that I was turned a downright atheiſt.

               <p>IT being generally known that I had for many years been a ſtrict methodiſt, ſince I have freed myſelf
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030668_0185_0FE859CCCF4C2728"/>from their ſhackles, I have been often aſked if I did not believe or rather know, that the methodiſts were a vile ſect of hypocrites altogether? My reply has been uniformly in the negative. I am certain that they are not in general ſo. The major part of them indeed are very ignorant (as is the caſe with enthuſiaſts of every religion) but I believe that a great number of the methodiſts are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, honeſt, friendly people; in juſtice to thoſe of that deſcription it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that many artful, ſly, deſigning perſons, having noticed their character, connections, &amp;c. and knowing that a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſon is in general ſuppoſed to be honeſt and conſcientious, have been induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to join their ſocieties, and by aſſuming an appearance of extraordinary ſanctity, have the better been enabled to cheat and defraud ſuch as were not guarded againſt their hypocritical wiles.</p>

               </q>
               <p>I have alſo reaſon to belleve that there are not a few, who think that they can as it were afford to cheat and defraud, on the ſcore of having right notions of religion in their heads, hearing what they deem ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox teachers, going to prayer meetings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:030668_0186_0FE859D487202090"/>
There are again others who think, that grace is ſo free and ſo eaſy to be had, or in other words, that as they can have pardon for all kinds of ſins, and that at any time whenever they pleaſe, they under this idea make very little conſcience of running up large ſcores, to which practice I fear ſuch doctrines as I noticed in my laſt, from the pen of Mr. Hill, have not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.</p>
               <p>I have often thought that great hurt has been done to ſociety by the methodiſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, both in town and country, attending condemned malefactors, as by their fanatical converſation, viſionary hymns, bold and impious applications of the ſcriptures, &amp;c. many dreadful offenders againſt law and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, have had their paſſions and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo worked upon, that they have been ſent to the other world in ſuch raptures, as would better become martyrs innocently ſuffering in a glorious cauſe, than criminals of the firſt magnitude.</p>
               <p>A great number of narratives of theſe ſudden converſions and triumphant exits have been compiled, many of them publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and circulated with the greateſt avidity, to the private emolument of the editors, and doubtleſs to the great edification of all ſiuners, long habituated to a courſe of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030668_0187_0FE859D61803EF18"/>depredations on the lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the honeſt part of the community; and many ſuch accounts as have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in print, have been aſſiduouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in all the methodiſt chapels and barns, throughout the three kingdoms; by which the good and pious of every denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation have been ſcandalized, and notorious offenders encouraged to perſevere, truſting ſooner or later, to be honoured with a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar degree of notice, and thus by a kind of hocus pocus, be ſuddenly transformed into ſaints.</p>
               <p>The following remarks made by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the Monthly Review for 1788, page 286, are ſo applicable to the preſent ſubject, that I hope my introducing the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage will not be deemed improper. After mentioning a couplet in one of the method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical hymns, where it is ſaid</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"<hi>Believe</hi> and all your ſin's forgiven."</l>
                  <l>"Only <hi>believe</hi> and yours is heaven."</l>
               </q>
               <p>they proceed thus:
"Such doctrine no doubt muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to poor wretches ſo circumſtanced as thoſe were to whom this pious preacher had the goodneſs to addreſs his diſcourſe; but ſome (and thoſe not men of ſhallow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlection) have queſtioned whether it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030668_0188_0FE859DD5E9160E0"/>right, thus to free the moſt flagitious outcaſts of ſociety from the terrrors of an <hi>after-reckoning;</hi> ſince it is too well known, that moſt of them make little account of their puniſhment in <hi>this</hi> world. Inſtead of the "fearful <hi>looking for of</hi> (future) <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>" they are enraptured with the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a joyful flight "to the expanded arms of a loving ſaviour—longing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his long loſt chidren." Surely this is not the way (humanly ſpeaking) to check the alarming progreſs of moral depravity; to which, one would think <hi>no</hi> kind of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> ought to be given,"</p>
               <p>I muſt obſerve farther, that the unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner in which the methodiſt preachers make tenders of pardon and ſalvation, has induced many to join their fraternity, whoſe conſciences wanted very large plaiſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! many of thoſe had need to be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a courſe of mortification and penance, but they generally adopt another method; a ſew quack noſtrums, which they call faith and aſſurance, drys up the wound, and they then make themſelves as hateful by affecting to have ſqueamiſh conſciences, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have been obnoxious, for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of very wide latitude indeed. And notwithſtanding the affected change, they often are as bad, or worſe than ever. As a
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030668_0189_0FE859DEE8920068"/>friend, permit me to adviſe you never to purchaſe any thing at a ſhop where the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it crams any of his pious nonſenſe into his ſhop-bills, &amp;c. as you may be aſſured you will nine times out of ten ſind them, in the end, arrant hypocrites, and as ſuch, make no ſcruple of cheating in the way of trade, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>This puts me in mind of one of theſe pious brethren in Petticoat-lane who wrote in his ſhop-windown; "Rumps and Burs ſold here, and baked Sheep's heads will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued every night, <hi>if the Lord permit.</hi>" The Lord had no objection: ſo Rumps, Burs, and Baked <hi>Sheep's heads</hi> were ſold there a long time. And I remember to have ſeen on a board, near Bedminſter-down, "Tripe and cow-heels ſold here as uſual, except on the Lord's-day, which <hi>the Lord help me to keep.</hi>" And on my enquiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the perſon who exhibited this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhew-board, at the inn juſt by, I was informed that the pious Tripe-ſeller gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally got drunk on Sundays, after he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the barn-preaching; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for his not ſelling tripe on that day, having full employment (though poſſibly not ſo inoffenſive) elſewhere.</p>
               <p>I alſo ſaw in a village near Plymouth in Devonſhire, "Roger Tuttel, <hi>by God's grace
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030668_0190_0FE859E5D56222E8"/>and mercy,</hi> kill rats, moles, and all ſorts of vermin and venomous creatures." But I need not have gone ſo far, as, no doubt you muſt remember that a few years ſince, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pious common-council man of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, advertiſed in the public papers for a porter that could carry <hi>three hundred</hi> weight and <hi>ſerve the Lord.</hi>
               </p>

                  <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is very remarkable that while I was writing the laſt five lines of my former letter to you, on Wedneſday the 2d of March 1791, I reccived the news of the death of Mr. John Weſley, who I am informed, died that morning at his own houſe, in the city-road, Moorfields, in the eighty-eighth year of his age. He had no illneſs, but the wheels of the machine being worn out, it ſtopt of courſe. As I am on the ſubject of methodiſin, I hope you will not deem it impertinent, if I devote a few lines to this great parent of a numerous ſect, whom I well knew, and feel a pleaſure in ſpeaking of with ſome reſpect.</p>
               <p>Several days preceding his interment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid in his coffin, in his gown and band, he was expoſed to the view of all who came, and the public; and I ſuppoſe that forty or fifty thouſand perſons had a ſight of him. But the concourſe of people was ſo great, that many were glad to get out of the crowd without ſeeing him at all; and although a number of conſtables were preſent, yet the pick-pockets contrived to eaſe many of their purſes, watches, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To prevent as much as poſſible the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030668_0192_0FE859EEB526EF00"/>effects of a mob, he was interred on Wedneſday, March the 9th, between five and ſix o'clock in the morning, in the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ground behind his own chapel in the city-road. After which Dr. Whitehead (the phyſician) preached his funeral ſermon, but notwithſtanding the early hour, many thouſands attended more than the chapel would hold, although it is very large.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was known that Mr. Weſley was deceaſed, a number of needy brethren deemed it a fair opportunity of proſiting by it, and each immediately ſet his ingenuity to work to compoſe what he choſe to call a <hi>life</hi> of him; and for ſome weeks ſince the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the chapel-yard and its vicinity has exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a truly ludicrous ſcene, on every night of preaching, owing to the different writers and venders of theſe haſty perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances exerting themſelves to ſecure a good ſale; one bawling out, that <hi>his</hi> is the <hi>right</hi> life, a ſecond with apious ſhake of the head, declares <hi>his</hi> the real life, a third proteſts <hi>he</hi> has got the <hi>only genuine</hi> account; and a ſourth calls them all vile chea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I cannot help thinking that Mr. John Weſley, the father of the methodiſts, was one of the moſt reſpectable enthuſiaſts that ever lived; as it is generally thought that he believed all that he taught others, and lived the fame pious exemplary life, that he would have his followers practiſe. The ſale of his numerous writings produced nett profits to the amount of near TWO THOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAND POUNDS per annum; and the weekly collection of the claſſes in London and Weſtminſter amounted to a very large ſum; beſides this, great ſums were collected, at the ſacraments and love feaſts, for quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tickets, private and public ſubſcriptions, &amp;c. &amp;c. In a pamphlet which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the beginning of this year 1792, by an old member of their ſociety, it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that for the laſt ten years, the ſums
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030668_0194_0FE859F4EE9848A0"/>collected in Great Britain and Ireland, have amounted to no leſs than FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS per annum. Beſides the above, many private collections are made in all his ſocieties throughout the three kingdoms, ſo that Mr. Weſley might have amaſſed an immenſe fortune, had riches been his object. But inſtead of accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating wealth, he expended all his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property; and I have been often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, from good authority, that he never denied relief to a poor perſon that aſked him. To needy tradeſmen I have known him to give ten or twenty pounds at once. In going a few yards from his ſtudy to the pulpit, he generally gave away an handful of half-crowns to poor old people of his ſociety. He was indeed charitable to an extreme, as he often gave to unworthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor would he keep money ſufficient to hold out on his journies. One of his friends informs me that he left but £4 10<abbr>s.</abbr> behind him; and I have heard him declare that he would not die worth twenty pounds, except his books for ſale, which he has left to the "general methodiſt fund, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the work of God, by itinerant preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers," charged only with a rent of eighty-five pounds a year, which he has left to the wife and children of his brother Charles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:030668_0195_0FE859F934430358"/>
His learning and great abilities are well known. But I cannot help noticing that in one of his publications (ſtepping out of his line) he betrayed extreme weakneſs and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, though no doubt his intentions were good. What I allude to is his <hi>"Primitive Phyſic,"</hi> a work certainly of a dangerous tendency, as the majority of remedies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in preſcribed are moſt aſſuredly inefficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and many of them very dangerous, if adminiſtered. The conſequence of the firſt is, that while poor ignorant people are try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe remedies (beſides the very great probability of their miſtaking the caſe) the diſeaſes perhaps become ſo inveterate as to reſiſt the power of more efficacious reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies properly applied, and with regard to thoſe of a highly dangerous nature, how raſh to truſt them in the hands of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed people as this book was almoſt ſolely intended for, eſpecially when ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the name of an author whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence impreſſed the minds of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate patients with the moſt powerful convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many fatal effects, I fear, have been producad by a blind adherence to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation; which carries with it more the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being the production of anigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>A very worthy phyſician to whom the community is highly indebted for his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable and ſucceſsful exertions in the cauſe of humanity, publiſhed ſome very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious "Remarks on the Primitive Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic," which however, for obvious reaſons, were not ſo generally noticed as the ſubject deſerved; as almoſt all the admirers of Mr. Weſley's work conſiſted of his followers (ſufficiently numerous indeed to inſure a very extenſive ſale) theſe were too bigoted to condeſcend to peruſe any production tending to enlighten their underſtandings; and the public at large, not having paid much attention to it, did not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo materially intereſted in the "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks," though I am firmly of opinion, if they are peruſed with that candour with which they appear to be written, they will have a very beneficial tendency in guarding the public againſt the miſchief too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſing from the "Primitive Phyſic," and other quack publications, as abſurd as they are injurious.</p>
               <p>Permit me juſt to give you one ſpecimen
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030668_0197_0FE85A024294C440"/>of the author's wonderful abilities, by quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a receipt, which if not an <hi>infallible reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> muſt at leaſt be acknowledged to be a ſingular one.</p>

               <p>Some of the receipts there inſerted are ſo truly <hi>curious,</hi> I can ſcarce refrain from treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with a ſpecimen or two, but being at the ſame time not <hi>very</hi> delicate, I muſt decline inſerting them, for like Simpkin,</p>
               <l>"I pity the ladies ſo modeſt and nice."</l>
               <p>Should you, however, deem it worth the trouble of turning to the volume, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the ſubject muſt excite a ſmile at the amazing credulity of the writer, as well as his folly in expofing ſuch wretched traſh to the public eye, indeed I can hardly perſuade myſelf he could be ſerious when he wrote them.</p>
               <p>The two following receipts I muſt give
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030668_0198_0FE85A49225DCE48"/>you, one being no doubt an effectual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a grievous complaint of that uſeful quadruped the horſe, the other at leaſt equally certain for the cure of one of the moſt dangerous diſorders human nature is ſubject to.</p>
               <p>"To cure a foundered Horſe."</p>
               <p>"Let him take one or two ſpoonfuls of <hi>common ſalt</hi> in half a pint of water."</p>
               <p>"For a malignant Fever."</p>
               <p>"A live tench applied to the ſcet for <hi>twelve hours,</hi> then buried <hi>quietly,</hi> or thrown down <hi>the houſe of office,</hi> and the patient will ſoon recover."</p>
               <p>But as I well know you do not poſſeſs the faith either of a methodiſt or a papid, to put implicit truſt in whatever the trachers of either chooſe to write or ſay. I ſear leſt I have beſtowed on you labour in vain, I therefore decline quoting any more of thoſe extracrdinary remedies.</p>
               <p>It was a circumliance pecularly happy for the practitioncrs of phyſic, though no doubt a terrible misfortune to the public, that the diſſerence in religious principles of theſe two reverend gentlemen proved an effectual bar to the union of their medical obilities, which appear ſo exactly coneſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; had ſuch an event taken place, that
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030668_0199_0FE85A0B13EF2A28"/>horrid monſter <hi>diſeaſe</hi> might by this time have been baniſhed from the earth, and the ſons of AEligſculapius would be doomed to feed on their own compoſitions or ſtarve! The Rev. Dr. Fordyce, in a late publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has alſo given the world a remedy for the cramp, as <hi>delicate</hi> as efficacious.</p>
               <p>What a pity that ſuch a character as Mr. Weſley ſhould have been a dupe and a rank enthuſiaſt! A believer in dreams, viſions, immediate revelations, miraculous cures, witchcraft, and many other ridiculous abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, as appears from many paſſages of his Journals, to the great diſgrace of his abilities and learning; which puts me in mind of Sir Iſaac Newton's Expoſition of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Milton's Paradiſe Regained, Dr. Johnſon's unmanly Devotions, &amp;c. &amp;c. However, we may ſaſely affirm that Mr. Weſley was a good ſincere and honeſt one, who denied himſelf many things; and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought that he diſregarded the praiſe and blame of the world, when he was more courted, reſpected, and followed than any man living, and he ruled over a hundred and twenty thouſand people with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſway, and the love of power ſeems to have been the main ſpring of all his actions. I am inclined to believe that his death will be attended with conſequences ſomewhat
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030668_0200_0FE85A126599F618"/>ſimilar to thoſe which followed the death of Alexander the Great. His ſpiritual gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals will be putting in their pretentions, and ſoon divide their maſter's conqueſts. His death happened at a time rather critical to the methodiſts, as the <hi>Swedenborgians,</hi> or <hi>New Jeruſalemiſts,</hi> are gaining ground very faſt: Many of the methodiſts, both preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and hearers, are already gone over to their party, many more will now, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, follow; and the death of that great female champion of methodiſm, the Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of Huntingdon, which has ſince happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will in all probability occaſion another conſiderable defection from <hi>that</hi> branch of methodiſts, and an additional reinforcement to the Swedenborgians; a proof of the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind for novelty, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, even in religious matters.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude my remarks on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts in my next.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>ALTHOUGH Mr. Weſley was poſſeſſed of a very great ſhare both of natural and acquired abilities, yet I ſuppoſe it ſcarcely neceſſary to inform you, that this is by no means the caſe with his preachers in general: for although there are amongſt them ſome truly ſenſible, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent men, yet the major part are very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and extremely illiterate: many of theſe excellent ſpiritual guides cannot even read a chapter in the bible, though containing the deep myſteries which they have the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and preſumption to pretend to explain. Many others cannot write their own names. But ſo great is the ignorance of Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's people in general, that they often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the more rational and ſenſible of their preachers, and are better pleaſed with ſuch as are even deſtitute of common ſenſe; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030668_0202_0FE85A1BC180EB10"/>believing that the incoherent nonſenſe which they from time to time pour forth, is dictated by the holy ſpirit; for which ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reaſons may be aſſigned.</p>
               <p>It is always obſervable, that the more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people are, the more confidence they poſſeſs. This conſidence or <hi>impudence,</hi> paſſes with the vulgar, as a mark of their being in the right; and the more the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the preachers is diſcovered, the more are they brought down to their own ſtandard. Again, the more ignorant preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers having very contracted ideas of real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and manly virtue, of courſe ſupply the want of it with a ridiculous fuſs about trifles, which paſſes with the ignorant for a more ſanctified deportment, and hence ariſes much of the miſchief which has been ſo juſtly charged on the methodiſts. For by making the path to heaven ſo very narrow, and beſet with ten thouſand bugbears, many deſpairing to be ever able to walk in it, have thrown off all religion and morality, and ſunk into the abyſs of vice and wickedneſs. Others have their tempers ſo ſoured as to become loſt to all the tender connections of huſband, wife, father, child. &amp;c. really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that they are <hi>literally</hi> to <hi>hate</hi> father, mother, &amp;c. for Chriſt's ſake. Many have in a fit of deſpondency put a period to their
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030668_0203_0FE85A1D4C568608"/>exiſtence, it having become a burthen too intolerable to be borne. Some have been ſo infatuated with the idea of ſaſting to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the ſleſh, that their ſtrict perſeverance in it has been productive of the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences: Two inſtances of which lately occurred in one family, in the City Road—The miſtreſs was deprived of her ſenſes, and the maid <hi>literally</hi> faſted herſelf to death; and Bedlam and private mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes now contain many, very many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy inſtances of the dreadſul effects of religious deſpondency; not to mention the hundreds that have died from time to time in ſuch places, and the numerous ſuicides which have been traced to the ſame ſource.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bentley ſays, in his letter to the members of the houſe of commons, dated May 12th, 1791, that although he had a fortune of one thouſand pounds, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally liked good living, yet that he lived on horſe and aſs fleſh, barley bread ſtinking butter, &amp;c. and when he found that his eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things gave offence to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. he left off eating aſs fleſh- and only lived on vegetables, as the common ſort of food by their dearneſs hurt his conſcience,</p>
               <p>A few years ſince I ſaw in a ſield not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles from China-hall a man toſſing up
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030668_0204_0FE85A2471337198"/>his bible in the air. This he often repeated, and raved at a ſtrange rate.

On the third day after this I ſaw with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe an account in one of the public papers of that very building having been ſet on fire, and burnt to the ground, and thus the poor itinerant diſciples of Theſpis loſt the whole of their wardrobe and ſcenery.</p>
               <p>This religious maniac ſoon after preached very often in Smithfield and Moorfields; but he did not wholly depend on the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Spirit, as at laſt he ſeldom began to preach until he was nearly drunk, or filled with another kind of ſpirit, and then he was "a very powerful preacher indeed!" But the good man happening ſeveral times to exert himſelf rather too much, had nearly tumbled headlong out of his portable pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; theſe accidents the mob <hi>uncharitably</hi> aſcribed to the liquor that he had drank, and with mud, ſtones, dead cats, &amp;c. drove him off every time he came, until at laſt our preacher took his leave of them with ſaying "that he perceived it was in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their converſion, as he ſaw that God had given them over to the hardneſs of their hearts."</p>

But although this holy man deſerted them, yet other ſpiritual knights-errant were not wanting, ſo that a little time before the heaps of ſtones which lay for years in Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields were removed for the purpoſe of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſpot, I have ſeen five or ſix in a day preaching their initiation ſermons from thoſe clevated ſituations, until they could collect a ſufficient ſum of money to purchaſe pulpits. Some of theſe excellent preachers received the whole of their divine education and took up their degrees in Moorfields, and in due time, after having given ample and ſuis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

One of theſe who cannot
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030668_0206_0FE85A2AA3492078"/>read, lately informed me that he had quitted all temporal concerns for the good of poor ignorant ſinners. However after all, "there is (poſſibly) a pleaſure in being mad, which none but madmen know." The ſubject of methodiſm is ſo fertile a one, that were I diſpoſed to enlarge thereon, my correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would be extended to a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able length; but inſtead of purſuing it, I think it better to apologize for having ſo long digreſſed from the main ſubject of my narrative.</p>
               <p>But before I take my leave of the ſubject, I will in a few words inform you how the preachers were governed and ſupported. Mr. Weſley every year ordered the major part of his travelling preachers in great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Ireland, which were upwards of two hundred in number, to meet together, one year at London, the next at Briſtol, and the following at Mancheſter; this meeting he called a conference. At thoſe confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the buſineſs of the whole ſociety was tranſacted, new preachers admitted, and ſome turned off, or ſilenced; complaints heard, differences adjuſted, &amp;c. Mr. Weſley having divided great Britain into circuits, at thoſe conferences, he appointed the preachers to every circuit for the following year, and as he well knew the general want
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030668_0207_0FE85A2C2EEE8AA8"/>of abilities among his preachers, he limited their time of preaching in one circuit to a year, and ſo in ſome meaſure, made up the want of abilities by variety, moſt of thoſe circuits had three or four preachers every year, and in many country places, they had but one ſermon a week from the travelling preachers, ſo that each preacher preached about twelve ſermons in the year, (ſometimes it may be twenty) at each place. In every circuit one of the preachers was called the aſſiſtant: to him the various contributions were paid, and of him might be had any of Mr. Weſley's publications. He alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted new members, or turned out any who were judged unworthy of bearing the high appellation of a methodiſt.</p>
               <p>Each itincrant preacher had a horſe found him, which, with himſelf, is maintained by ſome brother or ſiſter wherever they go, as the preachers do not put up at any inn, and yet they have as regular ſtages to call at as the coaches have, they having made converts at convenient diſtances in moſt parts of Creat Britain and Ireland.</p>
               <p>Each travelling preacher was then allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twelve pounds a year, to find himſelf cloaths, pay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> beſides what they could get privately out of the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030668_0208_0FE85A3604480608"/>pockets. But beſides thoſe circuit-preachers, there "are in the year 1790, in Europe and America, thirteen or fourteen hundred," of local holdersforth, who do not preach out of their own neighbourhood, and thoſe in general are the moſt ignorant of all.</p>
               <p>Many of the circuit-preachers only travel until they can marry a rich widow, or ſome ignorant young convert with money, which has often been the cauſe of great unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in many reſpectable families. The following poetical deſcription of the metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt preachers, is ſo much to my purpoſe, that I muſt inſert it:

               <p>"To begin then with the late Rev. John Weſley. As the founder and head, he muſt be conſidered as the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or firſt mover of this mighty machine of <hi>hypocriſy, fraud,</hi> and <hi>villainy!</hi> Yet were his motives originally laudable in their intention, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their object, but unhappy in their conſequences. This I will endeavour to make appear, by an impartial review of his life, character, and conduct. I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that I am in ſome meaſure qualified, being totally diveſted of prejudice, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no intereſt in repreſenting him either as a <hi>ſaint</hi> or a <hi>devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"From what I have obſerved during near twenty-eight years that I have known him, I have uniformly found him an bitious, imperious, and poſitive even to obſtinacy
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030668_0217_0FE85A5AA4AD2CE8"/>His learning and knowledge various and general, but ſuperficial; his judgment too haſty and deciſive to be always juſt—his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration acute; yet was he conſtantly the dupe of his credulity, and his unaccountable and univerſal good opinion of mankind. Humane, generous and juſt. In his private opinions liberal to a degree inconſiſtent with ſtrict chriſtianity; in his public declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations rigid almoſt to intolerance. From this obſervation of the inconſiſtency of his private opinions and public declarations, I have often been inclined to doubt his ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even in the profeſſion of the chriſtian ſaith. In his temper impetuous, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of contradiction; but in his heart, a ſtranger to malice or reſentment; incapable of particular attachment to any individual; he knew no ties of blood or claims of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; never violently or durably affected by grief, ſorrow or any of the paſſions to which humanity is ſubject; ſuſceptible of the groſſeſt flattery, and the moſt fulſome panegyric was conſtantly accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. In his views and expectations, ſanguine and unbounded, but though often diſappointed, never dejected; of his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and charity much has been ſaid; but it is to be obſerved, benevolence is but a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive virtue, and his charity was no more than
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:030668_0218_0FE85A61DD025888"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bery; he know no other uſe of money but to give it away, and he found out that an hundred pounds would go farther in half crowns than in pounds; ſo that his charity was little more than parade, as he hardly ever eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially relieved an object of diſtreſs: in fact his charity was no more than putting his money to intereſt, as the example excited his followers to the practice of the ſame vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and doubled their ſubſcriptions and contributions. In his conſtitution warm, and conſequently amorous; in his manner of living luxurious and ſtrictly epicurian and fond of diſhes highly reliſhed, and fond of drinking the richeſt wines, in which he indulged often, but never to exceſs. He was indebted more to his commanding, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, and authoritative manner, than to any intrinſically ſuperior abilities.</p>
               <p>"Having thus given the outlines of his character, I ſhall only obſerve, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been more a philoſopher than a chriſtian: and ſhall then proceed to ſome anecdotes and circumſtances which will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate my aſſertions, and juſtify my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>"As the <hi>work of God,</hi> as it is called, was the ſphere of action in which he was more particularly and conſpicuouſly engaged, and as I have ventured to queſtion the ſincerity
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030668_0219_0FE85A63695329A0"/>of his profeſſions, it is proper that I ſhould ſtate my reaſons for ſo doing. Firſt then of converſion: in the <hi>methodiſtical</hi> ſenſe of the word, for in the true ſenſe, I apprehend to be neither more or leſs, than forſaking vice and practiſing virtue; but however, the methodiſtical ſenſe imports quite a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing, and it is in that ſenſe we ſhall view it. I have made it an invariable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that Mr. Weſley, although he was often in the company of ſenſible men, who were capable of forming an opinion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to judge for themſelves by the light of nature, the evidence of the ſenſes, and the aid of reaſon and philoſophy; but of ſuch, he never attempted the converſion. In his own family and amongſt his relations, he never attempted, or if he did attempt he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſucceeded: except now and then with a ſemale, in whom he found a heart ſuſcept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible of any impreſſion he pleaſed to give. It is remarkable, that even the children of Mr. C. W. were never converted—becauſe they, and moſt of his relations, poſſeſſed ſenſe enough to diſcover hypocriſy, and honeſty enough to reject the advantage they might have derived from aſſuming it. But what is ſtill more e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon is pretty obvious, they were taught too much to imbibe the ridiculous prejudices the founder wiſhed to be inſtilled into their minds: philoſophy and methodiſm, are utterly incompatible. When the human mind is informed by the ſtudy of philoſophy, it expands itſelf to the contemplation of things.</p>
               <p>"It is true indeed, the <hi>work</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attended with power among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at <hi>Kingſwood. Converſions</hi> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; but never durable.

               <p>"A general converſion among the boys, was once effected, by the late crcellent Mr.

               <p>"As the converſion of men and women, is a more ſerious concern than that of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I will deſcribe one, to which I was an eye witneſs among the poor Colliers at <hi>Kingſwood.</hi> One of thoſe preſumptuous and impious ſanatical wretches, who aſſume the character of miniſters of God, and take upon them in his moſt holy name, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his curſes and vengeance againſt thoſe who are far leſs guilty than themſelves: a fellow of this deſcription, of the name of <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> preaching to a congregation of ignorant, but harmleſs people; this ſellow, took upon himſelf in the name of God, to condemn them all to eternal damnation, painting their deplorable ſtate in the moſt dreadful colours: ſome of his hearers were ſoon evidently affected by this diſcourſe, which be took care to improve, and taking the advantage of the kindling ſpark, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf more particularly to them, whom he ſoon "made roar for the diſquictude of

The whole congregation were quickly affected in the like manner, one and all exclaimed "What ſhall I do to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Oh! I'm damned! I'm damned! I'm damned to all eternity! What ſhall I do? Oh! Oh! Oh! Our performer obſerving to what a ſtate he had reduced his audience, redoubled his threats of divine wrath and vengeance, and with a voice terrible as thunder, demanded, "Is there any back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders in the preſence of God?" A dead and ſolemn pauſe enſued—till he exclaimed "Here is an old grey-headed ſinner:" at the fame time ſtriking with his hand vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently on the bald pate of an honeſt old man who fat under the deſk; the poor man gave a deep groan: whether from conviction, or from the pain of the blow, I know not, for it was far from being gentle. The farce was not yet concluded: when they were ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>convulſed</hi> with theſe <hi>convictions,</hi> he ſell down upon his knees, and with the greateſt fervency, accompanied with abundance of tears, he entreated the Lord in mighty prayer, to have compaſſion on the poor deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding ſinners whom he had brought to a proper ſenſe of their danger; the prayer continued about ten minutes, accompanied by the ſighs and groans of the converted and alarmed ſinners, in concert making a moſt

Where! Where! Where! was the cry of every contrite and returning ſinner, (and they were all of that deſcription) There! (continued the preacher, extending his arms towards the window where he pretended firſt to have eſpied the Lamb.) In Heaven! In <hi>Colo!</hi> making interceſſion for your ſins!

                     <p>Our opinions for the moſt part perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coincide reſpecting the ſtability of the connection, after my head is laid in the duſt. This, however, is a ſubject, about which I am not ſo anxious as you ſeem to imagine; on the contrary, it is a matter of the utmoſt indifference to me; as I have long foreſeen that a diviſion muſt neceſſarily enſue, from cauſes ſo various, unavoidable and certain, that I have long ſince given overall thoughts and hopes of ſettling it on a permanent foundation. You do not ſeem to be aware of the moſt effective cauſe that will bring about a diviſion. You apprehend the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences from a ſtruggle between the preachers for power and pre-eminence, and there being none among them of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority or abi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ities to ſupport the dignity, or command the reſpect and exact the implicit obedience which is ſo neceſſary to uphold our conſtitution on its preſent principles. This is one thing that will oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate very powerfully againſt unity in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and is, perhaps, what I might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have prevented, had not a ſtill greater difficulty ariſen in my mind: I have often wiſhed for ſome perſon of abilities to ſucceed
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030668_0226_0FE85A860BBF08C8"/>me as the head of the church I have with ſuch indefatigable pains, and aſtoniſhing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs eſtabliſhed; but convinced that none but very ſuperior abilities would be equal to the undertaking, was I to adopt a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of this deſcription, I ſear he might gain ſo much influence among the people, as to uſurp a ſhare, if not the whole of that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and uncontroulable power, which I have hitherto, and am determined I will maintain ſo long as I live: never will I bear a rival near my throne.—You no doubt ſee the policy of continually changing the preachers from one circuit to another at ſhort periods: for ſhould any of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come popular with their different congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inſinuate themſelves into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their hearers, they might poſſibly obtain ſuch influence, as to eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves independently of me, and the general connection. Beſides the novelty of the continual change, excites curioſity, and is the more neceſſary, as few of our preachers have abilities to render themſelves in any degree tolerable, any longer than they are new.</p>
                     <p>The principal cauſe which will inevitably effect a diminution and diviſion in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion after my death, will he the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030668_0227_0FE85A8796ACEE80"/>the ſupport of the cauſe, for money is as much the ſinews of religious, as of military power. If it is with the greateſt difficulty that even I can keep them together, for want of this very neceſſary article, I think no one elſe can. Another cauſe, which with others will effect the diviſion, is the diſputes and contentions that will ariſe between the preachers and the parties that will eſpouſe their ſeveral cauſes, by which means much truth will be brought to light, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſo much to their diſadvantage, that the eyes of the people will be opened to ſee their motives and principles, nor will they any longer contribute to their ſupport, when they ſind all their pretentions to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and love are founded on motives of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and ambition. The conſequence of which will be, a ſew of the moſt popular will eſtabliſh themſelves in the reſpective places where they have gained ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over the minds of the people; the reſt muſt revert to their original humble callings. But this no way concerns me: I have attained the object of my views, by eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing a name that will not ſoon periſh from the face of the earth; I have founded a ſect that will boaſt my name, long after my diſcipline and doctrines are forgotten.</p>

                     <p>Another cauſe that will operate more powerfully and effectually than any of the preceding, is the rays of philoſophy which begins now to pervade all ranks, rapidly diſpelling the miſts of ignorance, which has been long in a great degree the mother of devotion, of ſlaviſh prejudice, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic bigotry of religious opinions: the decline of the papal power is owing to the ſame irreſiſtable canſe nor can it be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that methodiſm can ſtand its ground, when brought to the teſt of truth, reaſon, and philoſophy.</p>

                     <p>IT is with the utmoſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I preſume to addreſs ſuperior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence: emboldened by a violent, yet virtuous paſſion, kindled by the irreſiſtable rays, and encouraged by the ſweetly attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive force, of tranſcendant beauty, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſimplicity of your manners, the facinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melody of your voice, and above all, the inexpreſſible fire of an eye, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of the Muſes has given to the goddeſs of love: but which Nature has beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towed on you alone.</p>
                     <p>"They ſpackle with the right <hi>Promethean</hi> fire!"</p>
                     <p>Believe me, my dear madam, this is not the language of romance; but the genuine exuberant effuſions of an enraptured ſoul. The impreſſion of your charms was no leſs inſtantaneous than irreſiſtable: when firſt I ſaw you, ſo forcibly was I ſtruck with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and love of your divine perfections, that my ſoul was filled with ſenſations ſo wild and extravagant, yet delightful and pure!—But I will not indulge in declaring what are my real ſentiments, leſt I ſhould incur a ſuſpicion of flattery. Your mind, ſuperior to fulſome panegyric, unſuſceptible of the incenſe of affected adulation, would, with juſt indignation, ſpurn at thoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030668_0230_0FE85A975E76FB10"/>compliments, which are commonly offered with a view to impoſe upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and credulity of the weaker part of your ſex: I will not attempt it; but confine myſelf to the dictates of ſincerity and truth, nor ſhall a compliment eſcape my pen, that is not the ſentiment of a devoted heart.</p>
                     <p>As beauty has no poſitive criterion, and fancy alone directs the judgment and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences the choice, we ſind different people ſee it in various lights, forms, and colours, I may therefore, without a ſuſpicion of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery declare, that in my eye you are the moſt agreeable object, and moſt perfect work of created nature, nor does your mind ſeem to partake leſs of the divinity than your perſon.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>"I view thee over with a lover's eye;</l>

                     </q>
                     <p>The reaſon I did not before declare myſelf, was the profound and reſpectful diſtance I thought it became me to obſerve, from a conſeious ſenſe of my own compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unworthineſs to approach, much leſs to hope for favour from, the quinteſſence of all female perfection.—Forgive me, my dear Eliza, and compaſſionate a heart too deeply impreſſed with your divine image, ever to be eraſed by time, nor can any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030668_0231_0FE85A98EA4BF508"/>but the cold hand of death, ever obliter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from my mind the fond imagination and ſweet remembrance of Eliza's charms! Nor can even death itſelf divide the union that ſubſiſts between kindred ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday, my dear Eliza, the charms of your converſation detained me too late to meet the <hi>penitents,</hi> as I had promiſed to do; but
<q>
                           <l>"With thee converſing, I forget</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>I hope however, the diſappointment of my company did not-deprive them of a bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>This being my birth-day, reſſlections on the revolution of years and the ſhortneſs of life, naturally intrude on my mind. I am now <hi>eighty-one</hi> years of age, and I thank God I enjoy the ſame vigour of conſtitution I poſſeſſed at <hi>twenty-one!</hi> None of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities that uſually accompany v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My new wiſe's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to books was a very ſortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance for us both, not only as it was a perpetual ſource of rational amuſement, but alſo as it tended to promote my trade: her extreme love for books made her delight to be in the ſhop, ſo that ſhe ſoon became per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectly acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inted with every part of it and (as my ſtock increaſed) with other rooms where I kept books, and could readily get any article that was aſked for. Accordingly, when I was out on buſineſs, my ſhop was well attended. This conſtant attention and good uſuage, procured me many cuſtomers; and I ſoon perceived that I could ſeil dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and treble the quantity of books if I
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:030668_0233_0FE85AA1F8B8F730"/>had a larger ſtock. But how to enlarge it, I knew not, except by ſlow degrees, as my profits ſhould enable me; for as I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a ſtranger in London, I had but few acquaintances, and theſe few were not of the opulent ſort. I alſo ſaw that the town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with cheats, ſwindlers, &amp;c. who obtained money and other property, under falſe pretences, of which the credulous were defrauded, which often prevented me from endeavouring to borrow, leſt I ſhould be ſuſpected of having the ſame bad deſigns.</p>
               <p>I was ſeveral times ſo hard put to it, for caſh to purchaſe parcels of books which were offered to me, that I more than once pawned my watch, and a ſuit of cloaths, and twice I pawned ſome books for money to purchaſe others; but I ſoon was tired of pawnbrokers, and at that time they were not ſo reſtricted, as now, in reſpect to intereſt, and thinking myſelf impoſed on, by being charged more than was reaſonable, I never redeemed the laſt parcel at all; for, indeed, they were books that I had bought extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheap, ſo that I borrowed more money on t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d myſelf what I had been overcharged. 'conſeſs we <hi>were</hi> poor; but, while that is the worſt our enemies can ſay of us, we are content."</p>

                  <pb n="236" facs="unknown:030668_0234_0FE85AA930453D20"/>
Soon after I commenced bookſeller, I became acquianted with what Pope calls "the nobleſt work of God," an HONEST man. This was Mr JOHN DENIS, an oil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Cannon-ſtreet (father of the preſent Mr. John Denis, bookſeller.) This gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had often viſited me during my long illneſs, and having ſeen me tranquil and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene when on the very point of death, he formed a favourable concluſion that I too muſt be an honeſt man, as I had ſo quiet a conſcience at ſuch an awful period. Having retained theſe ideas of me after my recovery, and being perfectly well acquainted with my circumſtances, he one day offered to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a partner in my buſineſs, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance money in proportion to my ſtock. This confidential ofter I ſoon accepted; early in 1778 he became partner; and we very ſoon laid out his money in ſecond-hand books, which increaſed the ſtock at once to double.</p>
               <p>I ſoon after this propoſed printing a ſale catalogue, to which, after making a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, Mr. Denis conſented. This cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of twelve thouſand volumes (ſuch as they were) was publiſhed in 1779. My partner's name was not in the title page, the addreſs was only "J. LACKINGTON and Co. No. 46, Chiſwell-ſtreet." This our firſt
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030668_0235_0FE85AAABADF74F8"/>publication produced very oppoſite effects on thoſe who peruſed it; in ſome it excited much mirth, in others an equal proportion of anger. The major part of it was written by me, but Mr. Denis wrote many pages of it; and as his own private library conſiſted of ſcarce old myſtical and alchymical books, printed above a century ago, many of them were in bad condition; this led him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>neat</hi> in the catalogue to many articles, which were only neat when compared with ſuch as were in very bad condition; ſo that when we produced ſuch books as were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>neat</hi> in our catalogue, we often got our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves laughed at, and ſometimes our <hi>neat</hi> articles were heartily <hi>damned.</hi> We had alſo a deal of trouble on another ſcore; Mr. Denis inſerted a number of articles without the authors' names, and aſſured me that the books were well known, and to mention the authors was often uſeleſs. The fact was, Mr. Denis knew who wrote thoſe articles; but was ſoon convinced that many others did not, as we were often obliged to produce them merely to let our cuſtomers ſee who were the authors: we however took twenty pounds the firſt week the books were on ſale, which we thought a large ſum. The increaſe of our ſtock augmented our cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers in proportion; ſo that Mr. Denis,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:030668_0236_0FE85AB213996520"/>finding that his money turned to a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in bookſelling than in the funds, very ſoon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent the ſtock near two hundred pounds which I ſtill turned to a good account. We went on very friendly and proſperouſly for a little more than two years; when one night Mr. Denis hinted that he thought I was making purchaſes too faſt, on which I grew warm, and reminded him of an article in our partnerſhip agreement by which I was to be ſole purchaſer, and was at liberty to make what purchaſes I ſhould judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I alſo reminded him of the proſits which my purchaſes produced, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded me of his having more money in the trade than I had. We were inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d both very warm; and on my ſying, that if he was diſpleaſed with any part of my conduct, he was at liberty to quit the partnerſhip, he in great warmth replied that he would. The above paſſed at Mr. Denis's houſe in Hoxton-ſquare, I then bade him good night. When Mr. Denis called at the ſhop the next day, he aſked me if I continued in the ſame mind I was in the preceding night? I aſſured him that I did. He then demanded of me whether I inſiſted on his keeping his word to quit the partnerſhip? I replied, I did not <hi>inſiſt</hi> on it, as I had taken him a partner for three years, nearly one third part
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:030668_0237_0FE85AB39F1C5330"/>of which time was unexpired; but, I added, that, as I had always found him ſtrictly a man of his word, I ſuppoſed he would prove himſelf ſo in the preſent inſtance and not aſſert one thing at night and another in the morning. On which he obſerved, that as he was not provided with a ſhop, he muſt take ſome time to look for one. I told him he might take as long a time as he thought neceſſary. This was in March 1780. He appointed the twentieth of May, following. On that day we accordingly diſſolved the partnerſhip; and, as he had more money in the trade than myſelf, he took my notes for what I was deficient. We parted in great friendſhip, which continued to the day of his death; he generally called every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee us, and learn our concerns, and we conſtantly informed him of all that had paſſed the preceding day; as how much caſh we had taken, what were the profits, what purchaſes we had made, what bills we had to pay, &amp;c. and he ſometimes lent me money to help to pay them.</p>
               <p>At his death he left behind him in his private library the beſt collection of ſcarce, valuable, myſtical, and alchymical books, that ever was collected by one perſon. In his lifetime he prized theſe kinds of books above every thing; in collecting them he
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:030668_0238_0FE85ABAA26C60C0"/>never cared what price he paid for them. This led him to think, after he became a bookſeller, that other book-collectors ſhould pay their money as freely as he had done his, which was often a ſubject of debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me, as I was for ſelling eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing cheap, in order to ſecure thoſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers already obtained, as well as increaſe their numbers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Denis was, at the time of his death, about fifty years of age. He informed me that in his childhood and youth he was weakly to an extreme, ſo that no one who knew him ever thought he could live to be twenty years of age; however he enjoyed an uninterrupted ſtate of health for nearly the laſt thirty years of his life; this he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to his ſtrictly adhering to the rules laid down by <hi>Cornaro</hi> and <hi>Tryon</hi> in their books on Health, Long Life and Happineſs. His unexpected death was in conſequence of a fever caught by ſitting in a cold damp room.</p>

               <p>IT was ſome time in the year ſeventeen hundred and eighty, when I reſolved from that period to give no perſon whatever any credit. I was induced to make this reſolution from various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: I had obſerved, that where credit was given, moſt bills were not paid within ſix months, many not within a twelvemonth, and ſome not within two years. Indeed, many tradeſmen have accounts of ſeven years ſtanding; and ſome bills are never paid. The loſſes ſuſtained by the intereſt of money in long credits, and by thoſe bills that were not paid at all; the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending not having the ready-money to lay out in trade to the beſt advantage, together with the great loſs of time in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounts, and collecting debts, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me, that if I could but eſtabliſh a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-money buſineſs, <hi>without any exceptions,</hi> I ſhould be enabled to ſell every article
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:030668_0240_0FE85AC371FBC2D8"/>very cheap. When I communicated my ideas on this ſubject to ſome of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, I was much laughed at and ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it was thought, that I might as well attempt to rebuild the tower of Babel, as to eſtabliſh a large buſineſs without giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But notwithſtanding this diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and even <hi>You,</hi> my dear friend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing your doubts of the practicability of my ſcheme, I determined to make the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; and began by marking in every book the loweſt price that I would take for it; which being much lower than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon market prices, I not only retained my former cuſtomers, but ſoon increaſed their numbers. But, my dear ſir, you can ſcarce imagine what difficulties I encountered for ſeveral years together. I even ſometimes thought of relinquiſhing this my favourite ſcheme altogether, as by it I was obliged to deny credit to my very acquaintance; I was alſo under a neceſſity of reſuſing it to the moſt reſpectable characters, as <hi>no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was, or now is made, not even in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of nobility; my porters being ſtrictly enjoined, by one general order, to bring back all books not previouſly paid for, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they receive the amount on del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ery. Again, many in the country found it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to remit ſmall ſums that are below ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:030668_0241_0FE85AC501833118"/>notes, and others to whom I was a ſtranger, did not like to ſend the money firſt, as not knowing how I ſhould treat them, and ſuſpecting by the price of the articles, there muſt certainly be ſome deception. Many unacquainted with my plan of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were much offended, until the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages accruing to them from it were duly explained, when they very readily acceded to it. As to the anger of ſuch, who though they were acquainted with it, were ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to deal on credit only, I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that as of little conſequence, from an opinion that ſome of them would have been as much enraged when their bills were ſent in, had credit been given them.</p>
               <p>In the firſt three years after I refuſed to give credit to any perſon, my buſineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed much, and as the whole of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits (after paying all expences) was laid out in books, my ſtock was continually enlarged ſo that my catalogues in the year ſeventeen hundred and eighty-four, were very much augmented in ſize. The firſt contained twelve thouſand, and the ſecond thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand volumes: this increaſe was not merely in numbers, but alſo in value, as a very great part of theſe volumes were <hi>better,</hi> that is, books of an higher price.</p>

               <p>Not to trouble you with a long enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inſtances in confirmation of this aſſertion, I ſhall barely mention the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>

It is owing to the encouragement of bookſellers that the public is poſſeſſed of that valuable work Johnſon's Dictionary; and the ſame liberality to the doctor in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to that publication, his edition of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, and the Engliſh Poets will always reſlect honour on the parties.

               <p>It ought alſo to be conſidered, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the money which is paid for the copy, is but triſling, compared with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of printing, paper, advertiſing, &amp;c. and hundreds of inſtances may be adduced of publiſhers having ſuſtained very great loſſes, and many have been made bankrupts, through their liberality in purchaſing manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts and publiſhing them; and on the other hand, it muſt be acknowledged that ſome publiſhers have made great fortunes by their copy rights, but their number is comparitively ſmall.</p>
               <p>It ſhould alſo be remarked that authors in general, are apt to form too great expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from their productions, many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which I could give you, but I will only produce one.</p>

A gentleman a few years ſince ſhewed a manuſcript to a publiſher, which he refuſed to purchaſe, but offered to be the publiſher if the gentleman would print it, &amp;c. at his own expence which he readily agreed to do, the publiſher then deſired to know how many copies ſhould be printed, on which the gentleman began to compute how many families there were in Great Britain, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the publiſher that every family would at <hi>leaſt</hi> purchaſe one copy, but the publiſher not being of the ſame opinion, our author then ſaid that he would print ſixty thouſand copies <hi>only,</hi> but added, he was afraid that another edition could not be got ready as ſoon as it would be wanted.

                  <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT has been aſked, times innumerable, how I acquired any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable degree of knowledge, ſo as to enable me to form any ideas of the merits or deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of books; or how I became ſufficiently acquainted with the prices that books were commonly ſold for, ſo as to be able to buy and ſell; particularly books in the learned and foreign languages.</p>
               <p>As to the little knowledge of literature I poſſeſs, it was acquired by dint of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the beginning I attached myſelf very cloſely to the ſtudy of divinity and
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030668_0248_0FE85AE5D8278860"/>moral philoſophy, ſo that I became tolerably acquainted with all the points controverted between the divines; after having read the great champions for chriſtianity, I next read the works of Toulmin, Lord Herbert, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, Chubb, Morgan, Collins, Hammond, Woolſton, Annet, Mandeville, Shafteſbury, D'Argens, Bolingbroke, Williams, Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Voltaire, and many other free-thinkers. I have alſo read moſt of our Engliſh poets, and the beſt tranſlations of the Greek, Latin, Italian and French poets; nor did I omit to read Hiſtory, Voyages, Travels, Natural Hiſtory, Biography, &amp;c. At one time I had a ſtrong inclination to learn French, but as ſoon as I was enabled to make out and abridge title pages, ſo as to inſert them right in my catalogues, I left off for what appeared to me more pleaſing as well as more neceſſary purſuits; reflecting that as I began ſo late in life, and had probably but a very ſhort period to live (and I paid ſome regard to what Helvetius has aſſerted, viz. that "No man acquires any new ideas after he is forty-five years of age.") I had no time to beſtow on the attainment of languages. I therefore contented myſelf with reading all the tranſlations of the claſſics, and inſerting the originals in my catalogues as well as I could; and when ſometimes I
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030668_0249_0FE85AE76593DB98"/>happened to put the <hi>Genitive</hi> or <hi>Dative</hi> caſe inſtead of the <hi>Neminative</hi> or <hi>Accuſative,</hi> my cuſtomers kindly conſidered this as a venial fault, which they readily pardoned, and bought the books notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>As I have indefatigably uſed my beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to acquire knowledge, I never thought I had the ſmalleſt reaſon to be aſhamed on account of my deficiency, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as I never made pretentions to erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or affected to poſſeſs what I knew I was deficient in. Dr. Young's couplet, you will therefore think equally applicable to many others as well as myſelf:

Another great ſource of amuſement as well as knowledge, I have met with in reading almoſt all the beſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; by the <hi>beſt,</hi> I mean thoſe written by Cervantes, Fielding, Smollet, Richardſon, Miſs Burney, Voltaire, Sterne, Le Sage, Goldſmith, and ſome others. And I have
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030668_0250_0FE85AEE29F034C0"/>often thought, with Fielding, that ſome of thoſe publications have given us a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine hiſtory of man, in what are called Romances, than is ſometimes to be found under the more reſpectable titles of Hiſtory, Biography, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In order to obtain ſome ideas in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, Geography, Electricity, Pneumatics, &amp;c. I attended a few lectures given by the late eminent Mr. Ferguſon, the preſent very ingenious Mr. Walker, and others; and for ſome time ſeveral gentlement ſpent two or three evenings in a week at my houſe, for the purpoſe of improvement in ſcience. At theſe meetings we made the beſt uſe of our time with globes, teleſcopes, microſcopes, electrical machines, air pumps, air guns, <hi>a good bottle of wine,</hi> and <hi>other philoſophical</hi> inſtruments.</p>
               <p>I cannot help regretting the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages I labour under by having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the benefits of an early education, as it is a loſs that can ſcarcely be repaired, in any ſituation. How much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then was it for me to attain any degree of proficiency, when involved in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of a large buſineſs?</p>

               <p>I Thas been long ſince remarked, that a perſon may be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with books, or in other words, may be a very learned man, and yet remain almoſt totally ignorant of men and manners, as Mallet remarks of a famous divine:
<q>
                     <l>"While Bentley, long to wrangling ſchools con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd,</l>
                     <l>"And but by books acquainted with mankind,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The reading and ſtudying of Hiſtory, Voyages, Travels, &amp;c. will no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to that kind of knowledge, but will not alone be ſufficient. In order to become a proficient in that uſeful branch of knowledge, "MAN KNOW THYSELF!"
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030668_0252_0FE85AF6B5269140"/>was a precept of the ancient philoſophers. But I can ſcarce think it poſſible for any man to be well acquainted with himſelf, without his poſſeſſing a tolerable degree of knowledge of the reſt of mankind. In the former part of my life I ſaw a deal of what is called <hi>low life,</hi> and became acquainted with the cuſtoms, manners, diſpoſitions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, &amp;c. of the labouring part of the community, in various cities, towns and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages; for years paſt, I have ſpent ſome of my leiſure hours among that claſs of people who are called opulent or genteel tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; nor have I been totally excluded from higher circles; but among all the ſchools where the knowledge of mankind is to be acquired, I know of none equal to that of a <hi>bookſeller's ſhop,</hi> eſpecially if the maſter is of an inquiſitive and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive turn, and is in a conſiderable line of buſineſs; His ſhop will then be a place of reſort for men, women, and children, of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nations, and more of various capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, diſpoſitions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Would my health permit my conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, I ſhould prefer it, to every thing in life (reading excepted) and you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that for ſome years I ſought no other amuſement whatever.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, I cannot help obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:030668_0253_0FE85AF8467C1860"/>that the ſale of books in general has increaſed prodigiouſly within the laſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years. According to the beſt eſtimation I have been able to make, I ſuppoſe that more than four times the number of books are ſold now than were ſold twenty years ſince. The poorer ſort of farmers, and even the poor country people in general, who before that period ſpent their winter evenings in relating ſtories of witches, ghoſts, hobgoblins, &amp;c. now ſhorten the winter nights by hearing their ſons and daughters read tales, romances &amp;c. In ſhort all ranks and degrees now READ. But the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid increaſe of the ſale of books has been ſince the termination of the late war.</p>
               <p>A number of book-clubs are alſo formed in every part of England, where each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſubſcribes a certain ſum quarterly to purchaſe books; in ſome of theſe clubs the books after they have been read by all the ſubſcribers, are ſold among them to the higheſt bidders, and the money produced by ſuch ſale, is expended in freſh purchaſes, by which prudent and judicious mode, each member has it in his power to become poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the work of any particular author he may judge deſerving a ſuperior degree of attention; and the members at large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the advantage of a continual ſucceſſion
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:030668_0254_0FE85AFF51A53E10"/>of different publications, inſtead of being reſtricted to a repeated peruſal of the ſame authors; which muſt have been the caſe with many if ſo rational a plan had not been adopted.</p>
               <p>I am informed that when circulating li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries were firſt opened, the bookſellers were much alarmed, and their rapid increaſe added to their fears, and led them to think that the ſale of books would be much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by ſuch libraries. But experience has proved that the ſale of books, ſo far from being diminiſhed by them, has been greatly promoted, as from thoſe repoſitories, many thouſand families have been cheaply ſupplied with books, by which the taſte for reading has become much more general, and thouſands of books are purchaſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, by ſuch as have firſt borrowed them at thoſe libraries, and after reading, approving of them, become purchaſers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sunday-Schools</hi> are ſpreading-very faſt in moſt parts of England, which will accelerate the diſſuſion of knowledge among the lower claſſes of the community, and in a very few years exceedingly increaſe the ſale of books.—Here permit me earneſtly to call on every honeſt bookſeller (I truſt my call will not be in vain) as well as on every friend to the extention of knowledge,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:030668_0255_0FE85B00DCA0A4D0"/>to unite (as <hi>you</hi> I am confident will) in a hearty AMEN.</p>

Accordingly in July laſt, 1791, we ſet out from Merton, which I now make my chief reſidence, taking Bath, Briſtol, &amp;c. in our way to my native place Wellington.</p>
               <p>In Briſtol, Exbridge, Bridgewater, Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Wellington, and other places, I amuſed myſelf in calling on ſome of my maſters, with whom I had about twenty years before worked as a journeyman ſhoemaker. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them with, <hi>"Pray Sir, have you got any occaſion?"</hi> which is the term made uſe of by journeymen in that uſeful occupation, when ſeeking employment. Moſt of thoſe honeſt men had quite forgot my perſon, as many of them had not ſeen me ſince I work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them: ſo that it is not eaſy for you to conceive with what ſurpriſe and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they gazed on me. For you muſt know that I had the vanity (I call it <hi>humour</hi>) to do this in my chariot, attended by my ſervants; and on telling them who I was, all appeared to be very happy to ſee me. And I aſſure you, my friend, it afforded me much real pleaſure to ſee ſo many of my old acquaintances alive and well, and tolerable happy. The following lines often occurred to my mind:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Far from the madding crowd's ignoble ſtriſe,</l>
                  <l>"Their ſober wiſhes never learn'd to ſtray;</l>
                  <l>"Along the cool ſequeſtered vale of life</l>
                  <l>"They keep the noiſeleſs tenor of their way."</l>

At Taunton and Wellington it ſeemed to be the unanimous determination of all the poorer ſort, that I ſhould by no means be deficient in <hi>old acquaintance.</hi> Some poor ſouls declared that they had known me for <hi>fifty</hi> years (that is, years before I was born) others had danced me in their arms a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times; nay, better ſtill, ſome knew my grandmother; but, beſt of all, one old man claimed acquaintance with me, for having ſeen me many times on the top of a ſix-and-twenty round ladder, balanced on the chin of a merry Andrew! The old man was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever egregiouſly miſtaken, as I never was ſo precariouſly exalted. But that was of no conſequence: all the old fellow wanted was a <hi>ſhilling</hi>—and I gave it him. No mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as Sterne ſays) from what motive. I never examine into theſe things. This I obſerved, that none of them were common beggars, but poor uſeful labouring people. Giving to common ſtrollers is but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging idleneſs and every other vice. <hi>And as ſmall matters made many happy,</hi> I was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely ſo, to be the means of contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their comfort. And indeed who would heſitate at being the means of diffuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs on ſuch eaſy terms, and with ſo little trouble?</p>
               <p>

But to proceed with my journey. I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem myſelf peculiarly happy, on one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in particular, that I undertook it; and have only to regret it did not take place ſooner, as it tended to undeceive me in a matter in which I had long been in an error. The caſe was this: I had for ſeven years paſt ſuppoled that the parents of my firſt wiſe were dead; and on enquiring after them of Mr. Caſh at Bridgewater, he confirmed the report. However as we paſſed through South Petherton, being but a mile from the place where they formerly lived, I could not help ſtopping to find out the time when they died, and what other particulars I could learn relative to them, but to my very great ſurpriſe, I was informed that they were both living at Newton, two miles diſtant. On this information I gave the coachman or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to drive us there, but ſtill could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credit that they really were alive.—But, O my dear friend, it is utterly impoſſible for me to deſcribe the ſenſations of Mrs. Lackington and myſelf on entering</p>

Amidſt this dreary ſcene, it was ſome alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation to learn that their pious ſon had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them weekly as much as he could afford from his own little family, and I have added enough to render them as comfortable as their great age can poſſibly admit of.

               <p>During our continuance at Wellington, I one morning rode over to Black Down, on purpoſe to inſpect an immenſe heap of ſtones on the top of the hill, ſtrait before the town, which I remembered to have ſeen when a boy. The diſtance from Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is about two miles. Thoſe ſtones cover about an acre of ground, and riſe to a great height.

Camden has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of a large camp at Roach Caſtle, three or four miles from hence; It is ſtrange that neither he nor Gough ſhould take any notice of ſo ſingular a Barrow as this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is.</p>
               <p>I have now, ſir, given you the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial circumſtances of my life. And ſhould the fine air of Merton preſerve my ſtock of health and ſpirits which I have acquired in this laſt excurſion, I intend during the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to ſpend a few hours in the middle of three or four days in every week in Chiſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, devoting the mornings and evenings to my rural retreat,
<q>
                     <l>"Where cheerfulneſs triumphant fair,</l>
                     <l>"Diſpels the painful cloud of care,</l>
                     <l>"O, ſweet of language, mild of mein,</l>
                     <l>"O, virtue's friend, and pleaſure's queen!</l>
                     <l>"By thee our board with flow'rs is crown'd,</l>
                     <l>"By thee with ſongs our walks reſound;</l>
                     <l>"By thee the ſprightly mornings ſhine,</l>
                     <l>"And ev'ning hours in peace decline."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>During the winter I purpoſe ſpending moſt of my time in town; where I hope again to enjoy the company of you, ſir, and ſome others of our old philoſophical friends.</p>
