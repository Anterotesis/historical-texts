            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE Authors of the enſuing Diſcourſes think proper to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the world, that their appearance is in compliance with the deſires of thoſe, to whom they could deny nothing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And as they contain nothing injurious to thoſe whoſe concerns lie in</hi> peace <hi>and</hi> truth, <hi>they are the more readily prevailed upon to comply with their requeſt. How they may be received, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay. They have no reaſon, however, conſidering the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of mankind, to expect that they will meet with general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; much leſs, with general approbation. Should any be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at their contents, they wiſh them to remember, that not the</hi> perſons, <hi>but the</hi> ERRORS <hi>and</hi> INIQUITIES <hi>of men, are expoſed. The Author of the former could have ſaid much more upon the ſubject, but he forbore, (Jude</hi> 9.<hi>) for he is perſuaded more is ſaid than will be well received.</hi>—<hi>The ſubſtance of both Diſcourſes is here exhibited. The Authors, however, think themſelves juſtified, in ſometimes changing the phraſeology, and adding an illuſtrative ſentence; though this is but ſparingly done, as thoſe who heard them attentively will find.</hi>—<hi>Should any find themſelves ſtimulated to take public notice of them, they need not expect the Authors to make any reply, except they advance ſomething</hi> new <hi>upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: for they are perſuaded, that the objections to theſe doctrines, that have hitherto tranſpired, have been ſufficiently refuted by learned and judicious pens. Conſcious of the pureſt motives—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by the fear of being accounted ſingular, and prompted by a generous zeal for the honour of their</hi> GREAT REDEEMER <hi>and the intereſts of his ſpiritual kingdom,</hi>—<hi>they chearfully commit theſe Diſcourſes to the inſpection of the Public.</hi>

                  <p>"GOD is love."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 John iv. 8.</note> From this inexhauſtible fountain, through the ſacred channel of Emmanuel's mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are all the bleſſings of our ſalvation derived. And, "unto the place from whence the rivers" of ſovereign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy "come, thither they return,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccl. i. 7.</note> in all pure affections and holy obedience to the commandments of Zion's King. To keep his commandments, we are here informed, is the only evidence of our having partaken of his grace. To give this evidence, whatever difficulties may lie in the way, the leaſt of his ſaints are required. And in the performance of it, whatever may be their inward weakneſs, and how formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo ever their external foes, yet are they not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. "The bruiſed reed he will not break, and the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not quench."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xii. 20.</note> For, when he ſends try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpenſations to his dear children, he is pleaſed to favour them with grace to ſuſtain the load. Yea, more, he takes them and all their concerns upon his Divine ſhoulders. "The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath thee are the everlaſting arms."<note n="§" place="bottom">Deut. xxxiii. 27.</note> He is pleaſed, from time to time, to ſmile upon them, and embraceth them with his mercy and goodneſs on every ſide. And thus, whilſt the God of their ſalvation cauſes his face to ſhine upon them, unboſoms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, and opens unto them the inexhauſtible treaſures of his grace, as their afflictions abound, their conſolations do much more abound. Forever bleſſed be his glorious Name, he never leaves his people <hi>wholly</hi> comfortleſs.</p>
                  <p>And, O how ineffably delightful and reviving is it, to the truly gracious ſoul, to hear the ſounding of his bowels, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and marvellous loving kindneſs!—Then, O then, the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022146_0006_0FB6FCB4E9EFA438"/>
heart is pliant and flexible like melted wax, and its language is, "Speak, Lord, for thy ſervant heareth." "If ye love me," ſays Chriſt, "keep my commandments." The graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul replies, 'Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I love thee, and being, by rich, free, and ſovereign grace, one of thoſe redeemed by thy moſt precious blood, and plucked as a brand out of the fire, I deſire to be found amongſt thoſe who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jeſus.'</p>
                  <p>The text I have ſelected upon this occaſion, is the words of King Jeſus, our adorable Redeemer, which are a part of his divine, incomparable, and unparalleled <hi>Farewell-Sermon</hi> to his beloved diſciples. What a holy flame of love muſt have glowed in the hearts of this ſelect company, when they were hanging upon their dear Redeemer's lips, and attending, with great eagerneſs, to the gracious accents, which ſweetly dropped from the mouth of Him, "who ſpoke as never man ſpake!"—and that at a period too, when he was going to leave, as to his bodily preſence, this little tender flock of his.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Jeſus, the glorious King, ſet upon the holy hill of Zion, foreſeeing, I apprehend, (for known unto God are all things from eternity) the various corruptions and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which would obtain, or take place in future times, embraceth this opportunity of inculcating a careful and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obſervation of his loving commands up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> his diſciples, as the only evidence of love to his ſacred perſon, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing characteriſtic of true diſcipleſhip: That they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now peculiarly affected with an account of his departure, might come from under his divine diſcourſe, like a ſheet from the preſs, with all the ſtamps and lively impreſſions of the truths they heard, and the commands enjoined them, deeply and <hi>indelibly</hi> engraven upon their hearts. And, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, all thoſe who love the Lord Jeſus, in ſincerity, will keep all his commandments, according to the meaſure, not of gifts, but of grace received; for his "love conſtraineth us." And love is a very powerful principle.</p>
                  <p>The words before us, naturally, reſolve themſelves into two branches:
<list>
                        <item>I. A ſuppoſition, or hypotheſis,—"If ye love Me."</item>
                        <item>II. A loving command, or kind exhortation,—"Keep my commandments."</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt we are further meditating upon theſe words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the gracious King of Zion, may we, under the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022146_0007_0FB6FCBDD6791128"/>
kind and powerful influences of his bleſſed Spirit, experience our too contracted hearts expanding abundantly, in love to Chriſt; the breadth and length, and depth and height, of whoſe amazing love to the children of Zion, ſurpaſs their utmoſt knowledge; that we may be filled with all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and, having our hearts enlarged, may run the way of his commandments.</p>
                  <p>I. A ſuppoſition,—"If ye love me." We are not, I preſume, to underſtand our Redeemer, as queſtioning whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or not, his Apoſtles loved him.

And, in the fulneſs of time, according to covenant tranſactions in the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing council of peace, "having made peace by the blood of his croſs," and ſlain the law-enmity thereby; at the <hi>ſet time</hi> to favour his choſen, by his word and Spirit, he ſlays the natural enmity of their minds, by manifeſting his love to them, and ſhedding it abroad in their hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt given unto them.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. v. 10.</note> He wins them over to himſelf, by the power of divine grace.

                  <p n="4">(4.) Becauſe ſhe embraceth the doctrine of eternal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, perſonal and immutable election to grace and glory.

"For whom God did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conformed to the image of his Son; moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified." What gigantic proweſs can break this gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den chain?

                     </gap>ſons of my reſignation, the following are the principal:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The conſtitution, or eſtabliſhment of the Church of England.

tranſacted within themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. viii. 5. Eph. iv. 5. Matt. xxiii. 8—10.</note>—and knew nothing of ſpiritual courts and their various officers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The church of England is of a national form, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the magiſtrate into metropolitan, dioceſan, and paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial, comprehending all the impious, erroneous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, within her bowels: On the contrary, the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment churches were all of them congregational, or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, including thoſe only, who, profeſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The clergy of the church of England, are not only, in general, irregular in their lives,<note n="‡" place="bottom">What an awful, worthleſs, profane character, is a ſwearing drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, clergyman? And are there <hi>none ſuch</hi> in the church of England? How dare ſuch perſons attempt the inſtruction of others?

And what communion can be enjoyed with ſuch?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ordinance of baptiſm, as it is uſed in the Church of England, is wholly unſcriptural. For—1. Nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the rubric enjoins <hi>dipping,</hi> according to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet ſprinkling, or pouring, is now univerſally practiſed.

After the moſt accurate inveſtigation of the New Teſtament, I can find neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, precedent, nor certain conſequence for baptizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: in that ſacred book, I find none but thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed repentance for ſin and faith in Jeſus Chriſt, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this holy ordinance.—3. I cannot, in conſcience, after the performance of this work, declare, that "the child is regenerate and grafted into the body of Chriſt's church, nor declare unto God, that it hath pleaſed him "to regenerate

                  <p>That this is the real meaning of theſe words appears from the rubric, wherein we read, "It is certain by God's word, that children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved,"—and in the catechiſm the child is taught to ſay, "in baptiſm—I was made a member of Chriſt, the child of God, and an inheritor of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven."<note n="†" place="bottom">Baptiſm, and Catech.</note> For any thing I know, all infants, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, are ſaved; but it is not baptiſm that ſaveth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth children of God, and heirs of the kingdom of Heaven, but the grace of God, in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—1.

As I embrace the doctrine of particular redemption, I cannot, in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, declare concerning every individual, that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this ordinance, "the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt—was given for <hi>thee,</hi>" &amp;c.—"The blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was given for <hi>thee,</hi>" &amp;c. ſince many may come here, who are wholly <hi>deſtitute</hi> of true faith, as well as licentious in their lives.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. Once more: In the burial of the dead, I cannot ſee that Chriſtian charity will admit <hi>believing miniſters and people,</hi> with pure conſciences, to call every man or woman, <hi>our dear brother,</hi> or <hi>our dear ſiſter;</hi> ſince it is notorious that many who have lived the moſt abandoned lives, die without any appearance of repentance. Nor can I think myſelf juſtified in ſaying any longer, of every individual, "we commit <hi>his</hi> body to the ground, in <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> hope of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eternal life. We meekly beſeech thee, O Father, to raiſe us from a death of ſin unto a life of righteouſneſs, that when we ſhall depart this life, we may reſt in him 'as <hi>our hope</hi> is this <hi>our brother doth;</hi>" ſince I am fully aſſured that there will be a reſurrection of the wicked to eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as of the righteous to everlaſting life: and, tho' I ſhould ſuſpend my judgment, as becometh us, upon the final ſtate of the vileſt ſinner, that dies without any evidence of repentance, yet it is certainly very daring preſumption to tell the Almighty, that we have <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> hope of his being gone to glory.</p>

The things I have noticed have long been the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of my ſoul. The example of ſome perſons whom I highly venerated for a conſiderable time, prevailed upon me to continue in my place; tho' in performing ſome parts of my duty, I have, with a trembling heart, adopted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Syrian's prayer: "In this thing the Lord pardon thy ſervant, when I bow down myſelf in the houſe of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy ſervant in this things."<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Kings v. 18.</note> But when the caſe of Nadab and Abihu, who "offered ſtrange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not,"<note n="§" place="bottom">Lev. x. 1,2.</note> ſtruck my mind, and that <hi>awful</hi> interrogation of the Almighty, "who hath required this at your hands?"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. i. 12.</note> reached my heart, I was made to tremble in the divine preſence, and immediately to reſolve upon my reſignation.

                  <p>Ye ſons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, who are princes in diſguiſe, though, in the eſteem of carnal men, you are the filth and off scouring of all! my ſoul is troubled for you, not knowing into whoſe hands you may <hi>now</hi> fall; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into theirs, who will feed you with the ſincere milk of the word, or into theirs, who will "care for none of theſe things." Suffer, therefore, I beſeech you, the word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, from one who can truly ſay with the apoſtle, that he is leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints, and the chief of ſinners; but who, thro' free, rich, and ſovereign grace, hath obtained mercy to be faithful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Flee from ſin, every ſin, as from the face of a ſerpent; for, however ſweet it may appear in the enjoyment, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, afterwards, it bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Reſt not in any duties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. "There is a way (of external duties) that ſeemeth right unto a man, but (O how awful!) the end thereof are the ways of death." Content not yourſelves with ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without enjoying the ſpiritual and gracious preſence of the God of ordinances. True believers have real fellowſhip and ſenſible communion with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, at which golden ſeaſons they rejoice with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory. Be often viewing, by the eye of faith, our dear Lord groveling in Gethſemene and bleeding on mount Calvary, and your ſouls ſhall proſper.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whatever it coſt you, never part with theſe ſacred truths, "knowing of whom you received them," and that they contain the ſalvation of your ſouls. Never yield up your faith, nor part with a good conſcience, at any rate. "For we are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our confidence, ſtedfaſt unto the end." If you ſhould be called to it, rather than part with it, take "joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in yourſelves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring ſubſtance." And never repine, though you be "poor in this world," whilſt you are but "rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom,"—and of ſuch a glorious kingdom too!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be much employed in prayer and reading the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Pray for yourſelves, for one another, and for me alſo. Pray frequently and fervently; "for the effectual fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." Read the ſacred ſcriptures with care and attention, accompanied with fervent prayer and ardent ſupplication. Inexhauſtible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of divine wiſdom are contained in them. "They are more to be deſired than gold, yea, than much fine gold: ſweeter alſo than honey, or the honey-comb." Here are the many "exceedingly great and precious promiſes, which in chriſt are all yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God," and the comfort and everlaſting ſalvation of his people.</p>

                  <p>Now, unto Him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his Father; to Him be glory and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, forever and ever. AMEN.</p>

                  <p>THIS part of ſacred hiſtory, from whence my text is taken, contains, the famous defence of the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, in the preſence, and with the licence of Claudius Lyſius, commander in chief of the Roman band, who had reſcued him from the hands of a furious populace. In this noble ſpeech, replete with true eloquence, divine wiſdom, and fervent piety, he informs the aſſembly of his birth, education, and zealous attachment to the Jewiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of his cruel hatred, and virulent, perſecution, in the days of his ignorance, of the Chriſtian, religion and the profeſſors of it; how the glorious Redeemer appeared unto him <hi>graciouſly,</hi> and converted him <hi>effectually</hi> unto himſelf.—In particular, he relates the bleſſed meſſage with which Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias was ſent unto him from the Lord, to comfort him in his great diſtreſs; which is concluded with this expoſtulatory reprehenſion, and pathetic exhortation: "And, now, why tarrieſt thou?

                  <p>What an amazing change is here! what an illuſtrious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of omnipotent power, of everlaſting love, and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace!—Behold the young Phariſee, who thought himſelf blameleſs in the ſight of God, yet filled with pride, involved in groſs ignorance, and in a ſtate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

All the blood that had been ſhed in Jeruſalem, was ſo far from ſatisfying his luſt, that it only makes him thirſt after blood more greedily. His heart is meditating freſh ſlaughter, and his feet run ſwiftly to ſhed blood. His throat is an open ſepulchre. He ſpreads devaſtation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he comes. Commiſſioned from the high prieſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to viſit Damaſcus. In his journey, he is ſuffered to proceed until he comes <hi>near</hi> the city. But, oh! amazing grace! this poor ſinner is <hi>a choſen veſſel!</hi> Electing love now diſplays her ſtores! Emmanuel claims the purchaſe of his blood! The ſhining majeſty and powerful voice of Jeſus ſurrounds him, awakens him, quickens and confounds him! He is humbled for his ſins, obtains mercy, and is filled with the graces, comforts and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt? He is qualified for the ſervice of the church, and called unto it; that he may feed her whom he ſo lately hated; watch over, plant and build, what he ſo lately made havock of, and with ſuch fury deſtroyed! From ſuch a <hi>ſingular pattern,</hi> or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of mercy and grace, let us be encouraged to pray for the converſion of the vileſt and moſt bloody perſecutors of the church of God. And, ſince he obtained mercy, let the vileſt ſinner, the moſt abandoned profligate, and the proudeſt Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, being humbled for ſin, be encouraged to hope in, to depend upon, and wait for the mercy of the Lord. At the ſame time, let no licentious profeſſor, nor abandoned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider preſume, but remember, that what he did was in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and unbelief.</p>

                  <p>I. The ſacred inſtitution referred to in my text, to which the apoſtle is exhorted to ſubmit, is baptiſm. In order to obtain juſt notions concerning it, we muſt enquire more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
                  <p>FIRST. Into the true nature of it. And, as it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of divine revelation, we muſt confine our enquiries purely to that ſacred volume. For, from whence can we obtain juſt ideas of an inſtitution, but from the records which enjoin it, and explain the nature of it? From hence</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We learn that it is a <hi>poſitive</hi> inſtitution. I do not mean to trouble you with the various diſtinctions that have been made between things, or duties, which are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into <hi>natural, moral,</hi> and <hi>poſitive.</hi> By a poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, I mean, one that is confined to certain ſubjects. Not to any particular nation, or race of men: but unto ſuch perſons of every kindred, tongue, and people, as fall under the character of thoſe whom John the Baptiſt, Chriſt and his apoſtles, baptized. They preached the word unto all; they exhorted all men to repent and believe the goſpel;—to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022146_0028_0FB6FD0B53B2CD08"/>
adore, and call upon the true God, and to attend unto every branch of moral worſhip: but never admitted any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unto this ordinance, until they received the word; at leaſt profeſſed ſo to do. They were careful to inform the perſons, who deſired to be admitted unto this ordinance, that, <hi>'if they believed with all their hearts, they might'.</hi>—Acts viii.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This inſtitution is of divine original. The firſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator of this ordinance, informs us, that he was <hi>ſent</hi> or <hi>commiſſioned</hi> from God <hi>to baptize.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">John i. 33.</note> I ſcarce need to remind you, into what a dilemma "the chief prieſts and elders of the people" were involved, when they were interrogated by our Divine Saviour, concerning the original of John's bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.—"If we ſhall ſay from Heaven," ſay they in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning amongſt themſelves, "He will ſay unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? But if we ſhall ſay of men, we fear the people: for all hold John as a prophet."—Theſe people, you ſee, wanted to be conſiſtent with their former principles and conduct.—They could not deny in their hearts the divine original of John's baptiſm: but then they well foreſaw what a weighty objection to their unbelief would ariſe, if they publicly admitted the truth. On the other hand, their conſciences would have allowed them to have aſſigned its origin to human invention; but the fear of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular clamour conſtrained them.—They, therefore, impiouſly anſwer, "We cannot tell."<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxii. 23—27.</note> This anſwer, it muſt be owned, was entirely conſiſtent with their preceding conduct. But it is an awful thing to be conſiſtent in a courſe of ſin, of pride, unbelief, hypocriſy, and falſehood, as theſe people were. But if the baptiſm of John was from heaven, from whence was the baptiſm of Jeſus?—From heaven alſo, without all doubt; though "Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his diſciples,"<note n="‡" place="bottom">John iv. 2.</note> who received their authority from their divine Maſter. And, when he renewed their commiſſion, after his reſurrection from the dead, he particularly, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly commanded them to teach and to baptize the diſciples, ſo made: ordaining this as a divine inſtitution, to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the church unto the end of the world.<note n="§" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 19</note> Wherefore, let us ever eye the divine original of this inſtitution, that our faith may be converſant with God in it; and then thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ends, worthy of its author, will be anſwered by it.—
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022146_0029_0FB6FD11E44C57D8"/>
At the ſame time remember, that it will be found in the end dangerous to trifle with it, deſpiſe and neglect it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This inſtitution is purely a goſpel one, confined unto the laſt diſpenſation; and, therefore, durable and abiding.—The Jews had divers ceremonial purifications, which were performed <hi>by dipping of the whole body in water;</hi> therefore the apoſtle calls them <hi>divine baptiſms;</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">That John the Baptiſt and our Saviour did not take up this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from ſome <hi>human cuſtom</hi> obſerved by the Jews, in admitting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes into their community, is well known to the learned; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be afterwards, they had no ſuch practice at that time. Thoſe who want information in this point, may conſult Dr. Gale's Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Mr. Wall's Hiſt, p. 329, &amp;c. Owen's Theologum, lib. 1. c. 9. p. 109. Dr. Jennings's 'Jewiſh Antiquities,' vol. i. c. 3. p. 138. And above, all Dr. Gill's 'Diſſert, on Jewiſh baptiſms," at the end of his Body of Divinity, vol. iii.</note> but they bear no relation to the inſtitution in my text, except in the code of <hi>dipping.</hi> This had no exiſtence until God ordained it in the miniſtry of John the Baptiſt. And, as the King of Zion in renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commiſſion of his apoſtles, joins this with the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word, to follow upon its being received, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhows that it is one of thoſe things which remain.<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 27.</note> To ſay the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt put an end to this ordinance, or rendered it uſeleſs, is, to ſay the leaſt of it, <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>fooliſh.</hi> So far from this, that Peter argues, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of baptizing, or admitting to baptiſm the houſe of Cornelius, becauſe they had received the Holy Ghoſt.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts x. 47.</note> The ſame divine authority which <hi>ordains</hi> an inſtitution, is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>diſannul</hi> it. And, until it can be ſhown, that God hath ſet it aſide, it remains in full force; and will be regarded by "them that fear God," yea, by all them that truly "fear before him."<note n="§" place="bottom">Eccl. viii.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>only</hi> proper mode of adminiſtering the ordinance is, by <hi>immerſion in water.</hi> I well know that this is a tender ſubject, and that the far greater part of that body of people, called Chriſtians, both think and practiſe otherwiſe. Nay, is it not lamentable, that in an age of refinement like ours, "he that departeth (from ſuperſtition and human invention herein) maketh himſelf a prey."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſ. lix. 15.</note> not only to the licentious wit and profane ſcoffs of the multitude, but even to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent temper and ſpeeches of thoſe who profeſs a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the word and inſtitutions of the Lord?

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022146_0030_0FB6FD14BA1F70B8"/>
whereby this controverſy can be decided, and they are all in our favour.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The radical meaning of the word <hi>baptize,</hi> muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſingular light in this matter.

                  <p n="2">(2.) The adminiſtrations of this ordinance, which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly recorded, manifeſtly ſhow this to be the proper mode. "And they were <hi>baptized</hi> of him (<hi>dipped by him) in Jordan,</hi> confeſſing their ſins." "And Jeſus, when he was <hi>baptized (dipped),</hi> went up ſtraightway <hi>out of the water."</hi>

                  <p n="3">(3.) The things alluded unto, and figured forth by this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, will agree with no other mode of adminiſtration. Theſe are, a burial and a reſurrection. "Therefore, we <hi>are buried</hi> with him by baptiſm into death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection."<note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. vi.</note> And again: "<hi>Buried</hi> with him <hi>in baptiſm,</hi> wherein alſo ye <hi>are riſen</hi> with him through the faith of the operation of God, who raiſed

It is not a thing they may do, or not do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring the Redeemer's diſpleaſure.

He beholds him not only brought into the duſt of death, but raiſed from it, having put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf. And, while he thus has fellowſhip with his dear Redeemer in his ſufferings, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influence of his bleſſed Spirit gives him a ſweet diſcovery of pardon and juſtification, of peace and ſalvation herein; and not only makes him to know the power of his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and experience conformity unto his death, but often affords, or ſeals ſuch a knowledge of intereſt in him, and all divine bleſſings through him, as makes him "rejoice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory."

                  <p n="2">(2.)

This is the initiating ordinance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt.

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022146_0033_0FB6FD2600DDF838"/>
a believer puts on Chriſt as his Lord and Maſter, profeſſes a ſeparation from the world, and ſolemnly, in that awful name in which he is baptized, devotes himſelf to the ſervice, worſhip, and fear of the true God. "For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, <hi>have put on Chriſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death: that, like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo <hi>ſhould walk in newneſs of life."</hi>

For their own welfare, we wiſh them duly to conſider this matter,—leſt it be found out another day, "that they have tranſgreſſed the laws, and changed the ordinances" of the Lord's houſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time we conclude from the preceding inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of baptiſm, and from Chriſt's commiſſion, wherein they who are taught, or made diſciples by teaching, are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be baptized; that the <hi>only proper ſubjects</hi> of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance are ſuch perſons as profeſs "repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." Theſe ought to ſubmit, without delay, to the ſame. And the Lord requires it of ſuch.—The words of our text are expreſs: "Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins." This brings me,</p>
                  <p>III. To ſhew, in what ſenſe ſin is waſhed away by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or <hi>in</hi> it. For the words do not ſuppoſe that ſin is waſhed away by any virtue in the ordinance; but only that purification from ſin is enjoyed from God <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through it.</hi> But more of this afterwards. It is to be obſerved,</p>
                  <p>FIRST. That ſin is a pollution or defilement. This, the very idea of waſhing it away ſuppoſes and implies. The luſts of the fleſh in their various diverſifications, idolatry, and profanation of the ſabbaths and ordinances of God, are more eſpecially repreſented under the idea of pollution and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the ſacred ſcriptures; tho' it is applied unto all ſin whatever. It is all a defilement, and of a defiling nature. There is no touching the accurſed unhallowed thing, but it will ſtain and pollute us. Concerning ſin, under this idea, we may obſerve:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is a pollution of a moral nature. All natural defilements are the dire effects of moral pollution. Sin is the very reverſe of righteouſneſs and morality. And ſinful pollution is the moral depravity of the heart, the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will, affections, and all the powers of the mind. It
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022146_0036_0FB6FD2C0709C200"/>
is this which makes ſin, all ſin, an abomination in the ſight of God. He is "of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look on iniquity," but with great abhorrence and deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hab. i. 13.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin is a general, epidemical pollution. Neither age, nor ſex, are exempted from it. "All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God."<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 21.</note> Some are more polluted with the groſs defilements of ſin than others, yet all are polluted with it; are eſtranged from God by it; and pollute all they engage in with it. The dire ferment hath leavened our whole nature. The animal deſires are deeply tinctured with it. Not only are their ſtreams polluted, but in ſome their very current is <hi>changed,</hi> and they, ſhocking to mention, becauſe ſo ſinful, run even <hi>againſt nature!</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. i. 26, 27.</note>—In others they are ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſuch a height as to break down all the fences, which nature, reaſon, and all human and divine laws have erected, to direct and keep them in proper bounds. Every power and paſſion of the ſoul is defiled by ſin The underſtanding is become the ſeat of darkneſs, error, and deception. The will is in a ſtate of open rebellion againſt the laws, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and grace of the Moſt High. The affections are a fountain of impurity, enmity, and irregular deſires. The conſcience is even polluted and defiled, and often becomes ſo ſeared as to be paſt all feeling. What an epidemical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement then muſt ſin be!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This dreadful diſorder is truly loathſome and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Thoſe who labour under its power, and are ſubject unto its prevalence, are in love with it. They take pleaſure in "fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the carnal mind, ſporting themſelves with their own deceivings"<note n="§" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 4. 2 Pet. ii. 13.</note> Nay, ſome there are, "who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit ſuch things are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. i. ult.</note> But in the ſight of God, it is loathſome and abominable. He invariably hates it, and will never be reconciled unto the vile turpitude of it: in all its vaſt extent, he is perfectly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, and therefore he loaths and deteſts it, and will by no means let it go unpuniſhed. And of every true penitent it may be truly ſaid, that iniquity is loathed by him. "My wounds ſtink and are corrupt," ſays David, "becauſe of my
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022146_0037_0FB6FD2EFAE963F0"/>
fooliſhneſs."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſ. xxxviii. 5.</note> If ſin be not loathſome and diſagreeable, we have juſt reaſon to conclude that we have not the ſpirit of Chriſt. Nay, whatever we may eſteem in religion, will be of no account, if we have any fellowſhip with the throne of iniquity, which frameth miſchief by a law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is a diſeaſe equally ſhameful and diſhonourable. Of all our native original rectitude and true honour, ſin has bereaved us. Nor can there ever be true honour enjoyed in connection with it. How many have had an honourable character deeply ſtained by it? Neither prince nor peaſant, prieſt nor people can have honour by it. "Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is a reproach to <hi>any people."</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xiv. 34.</note>—And tho there are ſome ſinner hardy enough to glory in their ſhame, yet all who have believed thro' grace are greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of it.

                     </note> And as for thoſe enemies of the Lord, who live without fear, and die without ſhame or remorſe for ſin, he "will clothe them with ſhame," and everlaſting confuſion.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſ cxxxii. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> Sin is the ſource of ſhame, and where <hi>that</hi> is not, you need fear no ſhame.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a pollution of a dangerous and deadly nature. It is dangerous to a man's beſt intereſts. It expoſes him to the wrath of God Almighty. And therefore, of every ſinner, who willingly perſiſts in, and labours under this dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement, it may be truly ſaid, "Deſtruction and miſery are in his ways.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. iii.</note> For luſt, when it is conceived, bringeth forth ſin, and ſin, when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death."<note n="**" place="bottom">James i. 15.</note> In vain have ſome diſtinguiſhed between <hi>venial</hi> and <hi>mortal</hi> ſin.

                     </note> Neither is there any forgiveneſs of it, but through the blood of Chriſt. And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a pollution, which none but God can cleanſe from, and a defilement which nothing but the blood of Chriſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022146_0038_0FB6FD355C897350"/>
can purge away. Every other expedient applied unto it hath failed. "For tho' thou waſh thee with nitre and take thee much ſoap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, ſaith the Lord God." Jer. ii 22. But many are they who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed healing and ſalvation from it, in the atonement and righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus. "Neither is there ſalvation in any other: for there is no other name under Heaven gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among men whereby we may be ſaved" from the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtains of this direful pollution, Acts iv. 12. The faithful in all ages have experienced, and have been enabled to ſay, "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin. Unto him that loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 John. 1. 7. Rev. i. 5.</note> But,</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY. The apoſtle is commanded to "ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away his ſins." And as it is the blood of Chriſt, which alone has procured pardon, and cleanſeth the guilty conſcience, and the influence of the Holy Ghoſt, which applies this to the believer, leadeth him to it, and cleanſeth him by it; ſo baptiſm cannot be ſaid to cleanſe us from ſin, either <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> or <hi>influentially.</hi> Therefore, ſome other ſenſe or ſenſes, muſt be ſought for; and which I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend are the following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In baptiſm there is a figurative waſhing away of ſin.—The apoſtle Peter ſays that <hi>baptiſm ſaveth us,</hi> as it is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>antitype</hi> or <hi>correſponding figure</hi> of the ſalvation of Noah and his family in the ark, by the waters of the flood. The ark, and not the waters, being a type of Chriſt, was the principal mean in the ſalvation of Noah and his family. And ſo, in like manner, not the waters of baptiſm, but Chriſt, the ark of the covenant, the author of baptiſm, is the ſalvation of believers.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. iii. 21.</note> His death, burial, and reſurrection, are figured forth in a very lively manner in this ordinance. The waters repreſent the free grace and love of God, from whence ſalvation ſprings, frequently compared to water in the ſacred ſcriptures; as alſo, the tempeſtuous waves and flowing billows of divine wrath and diſpleaſure, into which our glorious Redeemer was plunged, when he obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal redemption for us.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal lxix. 15.—xlii. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In going down into the water, being overwhelmed in it, and coming up out of it, we have a figurative view of Chriſt's
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022146_0039_0FB6FD37F9EDAE70"/>
voluntary ſufferings and deep abaſement; of his burying our ſins in oblivion, and ſweetening the grave for us; of his riſing from the dead, and triumphing over all the powers of darkneſs; and of our communion and fellowſhip with him herein, and conformity unto him, in conſequence thereof. In reſpect of all which we behold in baptiſm a figure of our cleanſing from ſin in different ways.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Baptiſm waſheth away the defilements of ſin profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally. Every ſubject of this ordinance profeſſeth faith in Chriſt, as his Saviour and Redeemer, whoſe blood cleanſeth from all ſin, and by whoſe obedience the church is redeemed. He profeſſeth to forſake ſin, to cleanſe himſelf from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, and to purſue perfect holineſs in the fear of the Lord. Hence we are ſaid to be "buried with him by baptiſm unto death: that, like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we would walk in newneſs of life." Hence many of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were wont to ſpeak of being cleanſed from ſins in this ordinance: "We go down into the water," ſays St. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,<note n="*" place="bottom">BARNAB.

They are ſuch as have heard the word, and were willing to be baptized in the name of the Lord, but when it comes into their minds what ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity the profeſſion of truth requireth, they withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and walk again according to their own wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires."<note n="†" place="bottom">"Caeteri vero qui cadebant juxta aquas, et non poterant volvi in aquas, qui ſunt? ii ſunt, qui verbum audierunt, volentes baptizari in nomine Domini, quibus cum venit in memoriam ſanctitas veritatis, retrah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Above all, baptizing may be ſaid to waſh away ſin, inſtrumentally, or ſacramentally, as ſome perſons ſpeak, it being a mean of directing our ſouls to look by faith unto the perſon, blood, and righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022146_0040_0FB6FD398664BBE8"/>
for peace, pardon, and purity; and an ordinance, in which the influence of the Holy Ghoſt, with an increaſe of his gifts, graces, and conſolations, are enjoyed: hence the apoſtle Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commanded his newly awakened hearers, who were cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for ſalvation, to "repent and be baptized for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive," ſays he, "the gift of the Holy Ghoſt." Many <hi>poor ſpirited</hi> diſciples have been ſweetly comforted in this ordinance, and have had gracious diſcoveries, of pardoning mercy, increaſe of grace and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, with the bleſſed ſealings of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby their doubts have been removed, and their intereſt in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, graciouſly evidenced. And therefore, ſuch as are ſeeking theſe bleſſings, ought not to be diſcouraged, but confeſs their ſins, profeſs their <hi>little faith,</hi> and wait upon God herein. Nor can I doubt but Ananias had a ſpecial reſpect to this waſhing away of ſin in my text. The apoſtle was but newly converted. His eyes were opened, and ſome rays of comfort, ſpread through his mind. But he wanted ſpiritual ſtrength and clearer diſcoveries of purification from ſin. And what mean could be more proper to direct him thereto than this; wherein the Redeemer and his grace are ſo fully repreſented? "Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins." q. d. 'The Lord hath graciouſly met with thee, appeared for thee, and deſigns thee for his ſervice; and though thou labour under much weakneſs and many fearful apprehenſions, yet as he hath opened thine eyes, and ſent me to inform thee of his gracious deſigns, follow him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay in all his appointed inſtitutions; eſpecially be baptized in his name, for the remiſſion of ſins, expecting his preſence and the application of pardoning mercy, while thou vieweſt him by faith in the ſufferings of his death, and the triumphs of his reſurrection.' This brings me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                  <p>IV. That devotion is required in this ordinance, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt take place, if we enjoy and purification from ſin by it. The apoſtle is required to "call upon the name of the Lord."</p>

At the ſame time it is evident, that all that which is called DIVINE, is included in the glorious object: for whoever worſhippeth the Lord Jeſus aright, draws near the triune God through his mediation, worſhippeth and adoreth his ſacred Majeſty in this Bleſſed Mediator. "I AM <hi>in</hi> THE FATHER <hi>and</hi> THE FATHER <hi>in</hi> ME." "I <hi>and</hi> THE FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER <hi>are</hi> ONE<note n="‡" place="bottom">John xiv. 2—x. 30.</note>."</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY. The ſubject of this devotion is the ſubject of the ordinance. The adminiſtrator of it, and thoſe who are ſpectators thereof, are to unite in pious addreſſes unto God; but the immediate ſubject is here required, in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to call upon the name of the Lord. Howſoever exact, as to the external form of an inſtitution we may be, yet without true devotion in it, neither the glory of God, nor our own comfort and conſolation can be promoted by it. If we expect our ſouls to enjoy purification from ſin, in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, we muſt, after the glorious example of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,<note n="§" place="bottom">Luke iii. 21.</note> and in obedience to my text, be engaged, fervently engaged, in ſpiritual devotion.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY. The ſubject matter of this devotion, or the devotion itſelf, is prayer, "calling upon the name of the Lord." Prayer is not only an ordinance itſelf, but an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant upon all others, and is that which in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner denotes them to be religious and divine. This duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required, includes the whole of inward devotion, faith, hope, love, and all thoſe holy affections, which ought ever to accompany this, and all divine ordinances. And it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the proper ſubjects of baptiſm to be believers in Chriſt.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022146_0042_0FB6FD4036293430"/>
For, "How ſhall they call on him <hi>in whom</hi> they have not believed<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. x. 14.</note>"? as without faith, no acceptable prayer can be made to God, ſo the perſon who lives without prayer, hath no reaſon to conclude himſelf poſſeſſed of true faith. But Saul was now poſſeſſed of the ſpirit of prayer. The Lord ſaid to Ananias when he ſent him to Saul, "Behold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts ix. 11.</note>" which expreſſes the merciful regard, which the Lord had to his cries, and the ſpirituality and fervency of his prayers, in contradiſtinction to his former Phariſaical le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſervices, which were no prayers in God's account; as alſo, the efficacious power of ſovereign grace, in enabling, teaching, and conſtraining ſuch a perſon to pray. Grace is not more illuſtriouſly diſplayed, in bringing an abandoned profligate to pray, than in bringing <hi>a formal devotioniſt</hi> to the throne of grace. Upon the whole, it evidently appears, that devotion in the ſubject of this ordinance is required by the Lord, which is another, tho' collateral proof, that not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but profeſſing believers, are the only proper ſubjects of it. I come now,</p>
                  <p>V. To ſhew the weakneſs and inſufficiency of the moſt popular objections that are made, againſt ſubmiſſion to this inſtitution. Under this head, however, I muſt recede from the method preceding; and inſtead of taking our account from the Bible, attend unto the moſt common arguments, under which I have heard pious perſons ſheltering themſelves from conviction of their duty.</p>
                  <p>FIRST. I have known ſome, who have acknowledged baptiſm to be a divine ordinance, binding on all Chriſt's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the end of the world, and yet have lived in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of it, though they profeſſed to believe in Jeſus Chriſt; and gave this, as a reaſon of their conduct, that they did not ſee it to be <hi>their duty in particular.</hi> The foundation of this objection, if I am not far deceived, ariſes from a very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſtake in the very fundamental of true godlineſs, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we ought, by the ſudden ſuggeſtion, or powerful application of ſome paſſage of ſcripture, to be <hi>particularly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,</hi> that it is our <hi>particular duty</hi> to be baptized, &amp;c. Whatever others may do, I freely own that it is with unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs I expoſe the enthuſiaſm and deluſion of the human
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022146_0043_0FB6FD4CB4748B08"/>
mind; of which I take this to be a real inſtance. That the divine ſpirit doth open the ſcriptures to believers, bring them to their remembrance, ſhow to them the things of Chriſt thereby, and produce ſalutary effects in their ſouls through theſe means, is an undoubted ſoul-refreſhing truth: but to ſay, that when we are brought to place all our hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Redeemer for ſalvation,—we ought ſtill to wait for ſuch impulſes as the above, to point out our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this ordinance, is certainly to ſpeak deceitfully in the matters of the Lord. Can you expect your duty more clearly ſtated than in the ſacred page? What other authority would you have than theſe words of the Lord, "Repent and be baptized; he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved"? What other, what better encouragement would you have than this, "If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt?" If you are of thoſe who <hi>tremble at the word of God,</hi> you will duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the ſacred text and obey it, without expecting to be <hi>thunderſtruck from heaven</hi> upon the occaſion. As the devil is capable of bringing paſſages of ſcripture to the mind, as well as the Holy Spirit, ought we not to fear, leſt we ſlight the authority of King Jeſus in the ſacred records, and follow the deluſions of that lying ſpirit, who ever lieth in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? and inſtead of obeying the Prince of Life, be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his greateſt foe?</hi> As you tender your ſoul's welfare and the honour of our Lord Jeſus, let me beſeech you to beware of ſuch deluſions as theſe. Trifle no longer with matters of this moment. But, without further delay, "Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away your ſins, calling upon the name of the Lord."</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY. Others there are who neglect this holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and church communion, on account of their doubts and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ears concerning their ſtate and condition before God. Theſe are the doubtful, who are afraid leſt they preſume. They are ready to think it would be daring boldneſs in them, under all their unworthineſs, ſo attended with doubts and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with fears, to confeſs Chriſt, and follow him in this and other ſacred inſtitutions. Had they but ſuch comforts, and ſo many promiſes as they have heard of ſome perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, they could take encouragement. But alas! as for them, it is quite otherwiſe. They are weak and feeble; have had no promiſe, at leaſt abiding ones, and conclude that their profeſſion would only terminate in the diſhonour of the Redeemer's cauſe. But how weak and futile are ſuch objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022146_0044_0FB6FD5190127C98"/>
as theſe? How are we to expect a removal of our doubts and fears but by an augmentation of our ſpiritual light and ſtrength in the ways of obedience, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? "They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. ix. ult.</note>" In this way did the apoſtle Paul enjoy ſtrength and comfort. In this way did Peter direct his newly-awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſin-convinced, ſoul-converted, hearers, to look for it<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts ix. and ii.</note> Though I would ſuſpect that faith which is never combated with doubts and fears, yet remember they are directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto true faith, and, if encouraged, deſtructive of all true peace. Therefore, oppoſe them continually, and give no place to them. "Fear not, only believe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lu. viii. 50.</note>" With regard unto your comfort from the promiſes of God, give me leave to warn you againſt a common, but dangerous miſtake. Think not, that your right to the promiſes, and comfort from them, depend in any wiſe on <hi>the manner</hi> in which they are brought into your minds. Your right to them depends upon the free grace of God—your liberty to apply them, on his free declaration, and your firm belief of them—and your comfort from them lieth in the glorious grace contained in them in conjunction with the veracity, faithfulneſs, and power of God to fulfil them. If you underſtand this ſubject aright, and firmly believe the ſacred promiſes of the Lord, whatever doubts and fears you labour under, or are attended with, you never will have occaſion to ſay, "I have no promiſe—once I had a promiſe, but now it is taken away—<hi>doth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fail for evermore</hi>
                     <note n="§" place="bottom">Pſ. lxxvii.</note>?" As to your fears, leſt a profeſſion of the Redeemer ſhould terminate in the diſhonour of his name, howſoever plauſible they may appear, they are no better founded than the other.—True it is, that many have diſhonoured Chriſt by their apoſtacy, error, and licentiouſneſs who have made a profeſſion of him. But inſtances like theſe are not to diſcourage, but to caution you. You know who hath promiſed, "As the day is, ſo ſhall thy ſtrength be<note n="‖" place="bottom">Deut. xxx. 25.</note>." Is he not able to keep and preſerve you under a religious profeſſion, and at laſt preſent you faultleſs before the throne? And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he keep you, tho' you ſhould not profeſs his name, into what ſhame and diſhonour would you be daily plunged?—Let me beſeech you no more to take ſhelter beneath ſuch a covering as this, leſt you repent it in the end. The only
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022146_0045_0FB6FD530342F9E8"/>
way to be delivered from your fears, to obtain evidence of intereſt in Chriſt, and to be preſerved from diſhonouring his name, is to caſt your care, and roll all your burdens upon the Lord—to receive his word, and to follow him in this and all other Divine ordinances. "Repent and be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins. and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt."</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY. Another objection I have met with, is, that baptiſm, not being eſſential to ſalvation, may be diſpenſed with on that account. This objection is big with abſurdity. We are far from aſſerting that it is any way meritorious, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curative of the bleſſings of ſalvation. Yet, we have ſhown how the enjoyment of the bleſſings of ſalvation ſtand cloſely connected with a proper ſubmiſſion to it. It is <hi>eſſential</hi> to a holy profeſſion of Chriſt, and a regular admiſſion into Zion. And, I muſt own, that to me it appears charging God with folly, to ſay, that any thing he had revealed, or any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he has inſtituted, <hi>is not eſſential.</hi> Tho' not eſſential to the ſalvation of ſinners, which is obtained by the blood of his Son; yet <hi>every truth</hi> he hath thought proper to reveal, and <hi>every ordinance</hi> his wiſdom hath ordained, are <hi>all eſſential</hi> to ſome great and glorious end, worthy of their divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Beſides, the very ſame objection lieth with equal ſtrength againſt every other divine ordinance, and againſt every branch of moral converſation. It diſcovereth no ſmall degree of ingratitude againſt the Redeemer, when we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect his inſtitutions, becauſe we are ſaved by grace. And it manifeſteth a legal, unfilial ſpirit, to intimate that any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is procurative of ſalvation. And I will venture to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that thoſe ſlothful ſervants, who never perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion but with an eye to their being ſaved by them, will find themſelves, notwithſtanding their mercenary, fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter doings, expoſed to everlaſting condemnation for their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. vii. 22, 23.—xxiii. 5, 14.</note> Let us hear no more of ſuch an abſurd objection as this. But, on the contrary, be ſtimulated to obſerve this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordinance, as well as all others, not becauſe we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it, but by the ſovereign mercy and grace of God in his dear Son, have a promiſe of enjoying the bleſſings of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in it, and are informed of its being <hi>eſſential</hi> to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, reputable and orderly admiſſion into Zion, and to the glory of God. "He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved: he that believeth not, ſhall be damned."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="unknown:022146_0046_0FB6FD554436FAC0"/>
FOURTHLY. Another very formidable objection in ſome people's eſteem, is that by being baptized, they muſt break their religious connections, and ſo prevent their greater ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and utility in the kingdom of Chriſt. To this I anſwer, that it appears at firſt view, that there is a great defection in ſuch connections as cannot be reconciled to the obedience of faith. And tho' no one more regardeth the <hi>external order</hi> of the kingdom of Chriſt than myſelf, yet I am certain that a practical ſubmiſſion to a divine inſtitution, can never be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of it: tho' it may break our rank in the <hi>worldly ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary,</hi> it is the only way to render us <hi>orderly</hi> in the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's <hi>ſpiritual kingdom.</hi> Tho' it may <hi>diveſt us of that populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which a <hi>popular connection</hi> hath inveſted us with, yet it will be the way to <hi>clothe us with that applauſe</hi> which is truly honourable in the ſight of God. And, as to a ſuppoſition of its preventing our <hi>greater uſefulneſs,</hi> it beſpeaketh a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of pride, vanity, and ſelf-ſufficiency. No doubt, but the God of wiſdom will make his choſen ſaints and ſervants uſeful, more or leſs, in every connection: but to think, or ſay, that in theſe connections in which they cannot keep his commandments, but muſt often offend againſt their conſciences, they are like to be more uſeful, is to eſtabliſh that dangerous, antinomian, damnable poſition, ſo greatly deteſted by the apoſtle, that we may do evil and neglect to do good, that good may come.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 8.</note>—Does not all our <hi>real uſefulneſs,</hi> in every connection, depend upon the bleſſing of God? Are we of <hi>ſuch conſideration,</hi> that his work cannot be done without us? Are we likely to do more for him, where <hi>we</hi> chooſe to <hi>ſtand,</hi> or to <hi>bow,</hi> than in the <hi>good old way,</hi> in which he biddeth us go?<note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. vi. 16.</note> Are we more likely to have his bleſſing in walking after the traditions of men, than in the ſacred inſtitutions of his word? Surely we muſt be highly elevated in our own eſteem, if after the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things, we can be prevailed upon to offend our conſciences and neglect the inſtitutions of the Lord, in order to preſerve popular connections, and be more uſeful in the kingdom of Chriſt. Obedience to his revealed will is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely preferable in the divine eſteem, to all the ſacrifices of intereſt, human tradition, and popular applauſe that you can offer him; and to hearken with a filial ear to his counſels, is more acceptable than the fat of rams, than the moſt delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022146_0047_0FB6FD56B60F5EE8"/>
of human inventions that you can reſerve from the fire of his word, as a ſacrifice unto the Lord.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. xv. 12.</note> Therefore, break through every oppoſition to follow your Redeemer. Devote yourſelves to ſerve him in the way of obedience, and leave your uſefulneſs to him, who only can make us of real uſe in his ſervice. "Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and I will be a fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty."</p>
                  <p>FIFTHLY. The fear of offending their friends and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is a ſtumbling block to ſome, and an objection to their ſubmiſſion to this ordinance. This is ſo weak and trifling, that one would think ſuch are either not ſerious in religion, or that they have never read theſe awful words of the Lord: "If any man come to me, and hate not father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and ſiſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple."<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 26.</note> If therefore, we can prefer the pleaſing of any relation upon earth unto our duty towards God, we have no evidence of being Chriſt's diſciples: may, he declares expreſsly, that <hi>we cannot</hi> be his diſciples. Conſider this matter well, ye who are obſtructed in your duty by theſe fears. Will your relations anſwer for you at <hi>the judgment ſeat of Chriſt?</hi> Will they be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you in the day of the Lord? Are they the Lords of your conſciences? Have they redeemed your ſouls? Alas! Alas! you know the contrary full well. Therefore, comply with your duty. Their hearts, their hands, and all they have, are in the hands of the Lord, and he can turn them as he will, and into what channel is beſt for you too. Be not therefore diſmayed. If father and mother forſake you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and diſinherit yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, for diſcharging a good conſcience, yet the Lord will take you up."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. xxviii. 10.</note> "Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken to them more than unto God, judge ye."</p>
                  <p>SIXTHLY. Others are kept back and overawed from their duty in this matter, on account of the ſhame and reproach that attend it. Few, indeed, care to expreſs themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly on this head, becauſe it is ſo <hi>exceedingly weak</hi> and <hi>cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly;</hi> yet from the tenor of their conduct, it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that they are afraid of bearing the reproach. But
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022146_0048_0FB6FD58436727A0"/>
what are ye afraid of? The reproaches and revilings of men? The ſinful breath of thoſe vile wretches who blaſpheme their Maker's name from day to day? Why, do you not know that the ſpotleſs immaculate Saviour, was not only reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made the drunkard's ſong, and ſcornfully treated, as a madman, and a devil, by the proud, ſelf-righteous phariſees; but that he chearfully endured all the ſufferings of the croſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> deſpiſed the ſhame, which our ſins expoſed him unto, in order to obtain our ſalvation? Why are you afraid of ſuffering reproach, ſince that is your greateſt honour?—And why ſhould you be aſhamed of the beſt of all intereſts? You can ſuffer neither ſhame nor reproach for Chriſt's ſake, but he ſuffereth with you. In his cauſe you can ſuſtain no loſſes, but he will repay them. "There is no man that hath left houſe, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's ſake, who ſhall not receive mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold more in this preſent life, and in the world to come life everlaſting."—And how will ye be able to face him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day? Have ye not juſt reaſon to fear, that he will then be aſhamed of you, and reject you? Trifle no longer, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, with fleſh and blood. "Fear ye not the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of men, neither be afraid of their revilings. Let us go forth therefore unto him, without the camp, bearing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach."</p>
                  <p>SEVENTHLY. The only remaining objection deſerving any notice, that I have heard of, is, that ſome perſons, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any proſpect of church fellowſhip, at leaſt ſuch as is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, think themſelves juſtified in neglecting it, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But how trifling and weak is ſuch an objection as this?—Are we juſtified in neglecting one branch of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, becauſe we have not an opportunity of regarding another? Certainly we are not: but, on the contrary, ought with all readineſs, to make the beſt uſe of ſuch ordinances as we have the privilege of obſerving. The eunuch, treaſurer of Candace, the Ethiopian queen, had no proſpect of church fellowſhip in his own country, whither he was going; and yet he never made the leaſt heſitation upon this head. He ſubmitted unto baptiſm the very firſt opportunity. For when Philip and he were in the chariot diſcourſing upon divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, "as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water. And the eunuch ſaid, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?" No ſooner had he profeſſed himſelf a believer in the Son of God, than "they went
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022146_0049_0FB6FD59CF8D3F38"/>
both down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him." Here is a bleſſed example, worthy of our imitation! This eunuch is ſaid to have ſpread the goſpel in ſeveral parts. And how do you know but your ſubmiſſion to the Redeemer may be a mean of ſpreading the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his name? Beſides, this objection has leſs weight in it, when we remember, that there are few counties in England, in which there is not an opportunity for ſuch to join with perſons of their own perſuaſion. All theſe things conſidered, I hope none that fear the Lord will any longer be prevailed upon to neglect their duty, and live ſhort of their privileges. "And <hi>now,</hi> why tarrieſt thou? Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, calling upon the name of the Lord." I come now,</p>
                  <p>VI. To point forth the folly and danger of neglecting this inſtitution, that none may remain ignorant of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequences of their conduct.</p>
                  <p>FIRST. The folly of ſuch a conduct is very conſpicuous in every point of light, more eſpecially if we conſider,—1. That it is our intereſt and real welfare which we are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein. To neglect the Redeemer's poſitive inſtitution, is to diſregard his authority, and to ſin againſt him. And he aſſures us, that ſuch perſons really injure themſelves: "He that ſinneth againſt me, <hi>wrongeth</hi> his own ſoul." What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is it to wrong our own ſouls, to deprive them of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, comfort, and conſolation adminiſtered in the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's houſe!—2. The folly of ſuch a conduct is moſt of all declared, inaſmuch as ſuch perſons reject the counſel of God. "But the ſcribes and phariſees <hi>rejected the counſel of God</hi> againſt themſelves, not being <hi>baptized</hi> of him." What folly to reject the counſel of God, of which baptiſm is a part? to deſpiſe, or treat with contempt, the wiſdom, power, majeſty, and holineſs of God, which ſhine forth herein? All ſinners act a fooliſh part, in their wild rebellion againſt the Lord and his Anointed; and certain it is, that the neglecters of the Redeemer's inſtitutions, fall under the ſame predicament.—Nor is this folly of a ſimple nature. It is big with miſchiefs of a perilous kind. This brings me,</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY. To point forth the danger of it. I ſcarce need remind you, that all diſobedience whatever, the neglect of poſitive inſtitutions not excepted, is ſurrounded with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022146_0050_0FB6FD5C14DF6A10"/>
On whatſoever ſide we turn our eyes, perils encompaſs it around. But, in particular—</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The danger of delaying baptiſm appeareth in our ſlighting the communion of ſaints, in order to which, this ordinance is to be previouſly embraced. In theſe days of coldneſs, error, and lukewarmneſs, the communion of ſaints, is but little eſteemed. It is, however, the greateſt privilege of a ſocial nature, that we can enjoy here on earth. "One day in thy courts, is better than a thouſand" elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Of what a dangerous conſequence may it be to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect theſe things? It will be well if ſuch perſons be not debarred the fellowſhip of the ſaints in glory, who neglect it in the militant ſtate. They who are not numbered with them, <hi>now,</hi> have no juſt grounds to expect they will aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with them <hi>hereafter.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The danger of this delay appears, in expoſing us to the painful reflections of our own conſciences. No wiſe man would chooſe to feel the bitter, the painful ſtings of an accuſing conſcience, in his laſt ſtage. And yet there are ſome who have felt it. A multitude of other things, carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and an encouraged indifference hereto, may ſtifle conviction <hi>now;</hi> but depend upon it, your conſciences will ſpeak our <hi>another day.</hi> What pain and anguiſh muſt it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>then,</hi> to be reminded, that <hi>when</hi> health and opportunity were preſent, theſe duties and privileges were fooliſhly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, which we ſhall have no more opportunity to regard! Surely, if you have ever felt the auguiſh of <hi>a wounded conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> you will dread the danger of being expoſed to her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations again.—</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Is it not a dangerous thing to live without practical evidence of our being related to Jeſus Chriſt? Certainly it is: But if in baptiſm there be a putting on of Jeſus Chriſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 27.</note> as there really is, then it undoubtedly follows, that where baptiſm is not regarded, there is no profeſſional, practical evidence or relation to him. It will be an awful thing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day not to be found in Chriſt; and I muſt own, that we appear to have a deceitful confidence about this important ſubject, if we do not practically and profeſſionally put him on.—</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) It is certainly a dangerous thing to ſin againſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of ſinners. If they who deſpiſed the law of Moſes,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022146_0051_0FB6FD5EF8E62D68"/>
eſcaped not without puniſhment, ſhall the neglecters of the Redeemer's holy inſtitutions paſs with impunity?<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. x. 28.</note> How then will you account for your conduct, or how can you think yourſelves ſecure from his frowns, in the daily neglect of his ordinances?—You have no reaſon to expect the gracious protection of this glorious King, who are not found in the obſervation of his commandments; nor to expect his ſacred preſence and his ſweet conſolations, who neglect to appear among his ſaints, before him, in Zion. On the contrary, you certainly have juſt cauſe for fear, leſt, knowing the will of the Lord, and not performing it, ye be beaten with many ſtripes.<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xii. 47.</note>—</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) The danger of neglecting this, and other divine ordinances, appears in this, that it is grieving the Holy Spirit. Of old, "Iſrael rebelled againſt the Lord," among other things, by forſaking the Lord's inſtitutions, and going in the ways of the heathen, whereby they vexed "his holy ſpirit." But what did they get by it? Why, the Spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of conforting, leading, and ſupporting them, "was turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſ. lxiii. 10.</note>" It is awful enough to have the painful reflections of an accuſing conſcience; but to have the Holy Ghoſt to be our enemy, is awful indeed! Do we not continually ſtand in need of his benign influence and gracious leadings? How then do we expect to bear his frown?—There are ſeveral who have laboured under theſe, and it is to be feared that many ſtill do. The decreaſe of ſpiritual gifts, the bondage of mind, and the leanneſs of ſoul, under which many labour, miniſters perhaps as well as people, are palpable evidences of the Spirit being grieved. It is a dangerous caſe. Beware of continuing in it. Take heed, leſt by trifling thus in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, you provoke the Lord to give you up to a mind void of judgment. Be honeſt, and, without any heſitation, act according to the light you have. "Grieve not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption."</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) The only thing I ſhall further notice in this affair, is, that by perſiſting in ſuch a conduct, we ſhall expoſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the force of theſe words, in the day of judgment: "For whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of Man ſhall be aſhamed, when he ſhall
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022146_0052_0FB6FD67097EE0B0"/>
come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke ix. 26.</note>. But whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I deny before my Father who is in Heaven<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. x. 33.</note>." From the force of theſe words we may now defend ourſelves; but in the day of judgment, thoſe artful turns, thoſe flimſy ſhields, will be of no avail. From the Redeemer's two-edged ſword, brandiſhed with a holy indignation, they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us. His words will then be explained in their proper ſenſe, appear in all their majeſty, power, and importance, and be directed againſt their proper objects with that irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able force, and demonſtration, which will ſpread horror, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may, and confuſion, around all that fall under their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. What a dangerous, what an awful thing then muſt it be to neglect his inſtitutions, and expoſe ourſelves to the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God? Surely, no perſon that regardeth the words of our Lord Jeſus, will any longer perſiſt in a line of conduct ſo fooliſh, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, ſo fatal, to their peace, comfort, and proſperity,—ſo grieving to the Spirit,—and ſo offenſive to the Redeemer!</p>
                  <p>Having gone through the plan propoſed, though I have already treſpaſſed upon your time, yet I cannot conclude without a reflection or two in the method of improvement.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let thoſe of you who are wallowing in ſin, and lying under the guilt and pollution of it, remember what an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate you are in. You are enemies to God, and expoſed to his wrath and diſpleaſure. If you die in that ſtate, you muſt be as ſurely damned, as you ſtand or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it there to-day. Let me beſeech you to forſake ſin, to repent of it, and to turn to God.—"Repent ye, therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out. Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh." O then, "labour, not for the bread that periſheth, but for that which endureth to everlaſting life." You have the privilege of hearing the word of God, almoſt daily; how great will your condemnation be, if in the end you are found unbelievers! Nor will any thing ſhort of an entire change ſerve to ſecure you from eternal miſery. Sin muſt not only be left in practice, but your hearts formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new to hate it. An inward reformation, as well as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one, muſt have place, or you cannot be ſaved. Your ſins muſt be pardoned, your perſons juſtified and your ſouls
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022146_0053_0FB6FD67F907F9C0"/>
ſanctified, or you can never enter into kingdom of God. Theſe are things that none but Jehovah can do. This ought to make you tremble, ſinners, when you hear it. Salvation is not a work within the compaſs of human power. O then I beſeech you, no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> trifle with this matter. The Lord Jeſus, in all his fulneſs, grace, and glory, is preached unto you. Receive this bleſſed meſſage. Search into the inſpired volume. Vile and ignorant as you are, he is able to ſave you. But if you continue to deſpiſe and reject him, you muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in your folly. "How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?"</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let all penitent tranſgreſſors, howſoever burdened, roll all their burdens upon the Lord, and follow him in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith. Your weakneſſes, doubts and fears, are no ſufficient objection. Take heed that, by poring upon theſe, you are not loſing ſight of the Saviour of ſinners. Is he not <hi>able to ſave</hi> you? Is he not <hi>willing to ſave</hi> you? He is. Why then are you diſcouraged in following him? How do you expect comfort and peace, but in ſo doing? The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent in my text delayed but a little, a very little, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what you have done, and yet he met with a cutting rebuke:—"And <hi>now</hi> why tarrieſt thou?" With how much greater propriety, if ſo I may ſpeak, may this be applied to many now? No longer indulge yourſelves in neglecting his commands.—"Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away your ſins, calling upon the name of the Lord." Give your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to him and his people, to walk with them in all the order of his goſpel, "in a perpetual covenant, never to be forgotten."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah i. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let all who have been baptized, remember the ends of this inſtitution, and ſhew them forth. You have profeſſed repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Does it appear that your repentance is genuine, your faith unfeigned? You have been buried with Chriſt; but, what will this avail any of you, if you are now alive to this world, in love with it, ſunk in the luſts and pleaſures of it, and walking <hi>again</hi> according to the courſe of it?—Alas! alas! how often has it happened, in every age of the church, unto a race of licentious profeſſors, "The dog is turned to his vomit again, and the ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire?" If any ſuch backſliders hears me to-day, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022146_0054_0FB6FD6A5CBA89B8"/>
you to remember from whence you are fallen, to repent and do your firſt works. "Awake to righteouſneſs and ſin not." You may attempt to cover your folly, but God will not ſuffer it long to remain hid. You may attempt the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of your eſtate with a ſtate of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ce; but without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it will be all in vain. Without repentance for your folly and backſliding you will prove hypocrites and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers in the end, who ſhall receive the greater damnation. "Return, return, thou backſliding Iſrael, faith the Lord; and I will not cauſe my anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, faith the Lord, and I will not keep anger forever."<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. ii. 12.</note>

                  <p>As for you who have bravely withſtood, hitherto, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of the world, ſee that ye continue ſo to do. Walk cloſe with your dear Redeemer. Fill up your place in the houſe of God with reputation and uſefulneſs. Set your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on things above. Remember what obligation your bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm lays you under, to walk in newneſs of life.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. A few words to you, my dear brother, the immediate ſubject of this ordinance, ſhall cloſe my diſcourſe at this time. you have reſigned a place in a popular connection, merely from a conſcientious regard to the order and inſtitutions of the Lord's houſe. You have known that neither a liberal education nor a ſacred office, with the proſpects of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in a worldly ſanctuary, are ſufficient to excuſe us in acting contrary to the will of God and our own conſciences. Your conduct in this affair will be condemned by all the worſhippers of mammon; nor will the ſober evangelical part of the clergy, in general, look upon your proceeding in any very favourable light; for this very reaſon, that by your doing ſo, they are reproached. However, all thoſe who make the Bible the <hi>ſole rule</hi> of their faith, will applaud you. And, what is infinitely more, I believe the MOST HIGH will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it. Such a ſingular event as this, generally excites popular admiration. But, with all due reſpect to you, Sir, give me leave to obſerve, that it is your future conduct, which will reflect the greateſt honour upon this day's tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and your preſent devotion, which will render it moſt
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022146_0055_0FB6FD75E58E74C8"/>
honourable to your heavenly Father, and, through his grace, comfortable to yourſelf. The ſolemn profeſſion that you are now making, will engage the attention of many, and their oppoſition to it, will prompt them to ſcrutinize every branch of your conduct, with more abundant exactneſs, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would have done. Nor will the grand enemy of our ſalvation be leſs vigilant in tempting and ſifting you, ſo far as he is permitted. Peculiar watchfulneſs and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection are therefore highly needful, with a humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the keeper and preſerver of Iſrael. Be firm and immoveable in adhering unto the truths of the goſpel. To that conſiderable acquiſition of claſſical learning, which you have already obtained, be daily making ſome addition, more eſpecially in divine ſcience, and her kindred ones; but at the ſame time be humble, depending upon your Redeemer, and looking unto him for divine ſtrength, all needful gifts for his ſervice, and grace to make a proper uſe of them. In this line of conduct a man will become <hi>great</hi> in the ſight of the Lord and his people, but <hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> in his own; he will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and uſeful;—but whatever attainments in the ſciences he may acquire, if he be puffed up with them, become leſs dependent on the Redeemer and his grace, and indifferent about the gifts and influences of the Bleſſed Spirit, he may be aſſured that his acquirements are a ſnare to him, that he is entangled therein, and, without ſpeedy repentance, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, in the end, contemptible, both in the eyes of God, and of all good men. To theſe things, I hope, dear ſir, you will ever have a due regard, ſince the glory of our God and King, your uſefulneſs and reputation, as well as the credit of the intereſt you now eſpouſe, are involved therein.—In order to your preſent comfort in this bleſſed inſtitution, you are now immediately going to ſubmit to, have your eyes unto the Holy One of Iſrael. In fervent addreſſes unto the God of mercy, I now expect your concurrence. In the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance itſelf, properly ſo called, be meditating upon the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſufferings, death, burial,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> of our dear Redeemer, accompanied with <hi>calling upon his name.</hi> In go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into the water, reflect upon his voluntary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his wonderful incarnation, and his deep abaſement. In paſſing through it, call to mind what amazing ſufferings he underwent; how he was <hi>baptized in blood,</hi> that we might be <hi>ſaved from the fire:</hi> look to him as your Surety and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, your Juſtifier and Sanctifier,—through whoſe obedience

unto death the waters of divine grace iſſue forth in rich abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance unto the everlaſting ſalvation of all true believers—With a humble recumbency upon him, you will then emerge from the water, viewing your dear Redemer, as having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried your ſins, overcome death, worſted the devil, ſweetened the grave, brought life and immortality to light, and go on your way triumphing in his glorious reſurrection. In every branch of your conduct purſue the grand ends of this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mentioned already, and you may be aſſured that "the Lord of all peace himſelf" will "give you peace always by all means,"—in life, in death, and to all eternity.</p>
