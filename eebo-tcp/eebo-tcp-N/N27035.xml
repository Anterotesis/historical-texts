            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TWENTY THREE years have elapsed since America wearied with repeated acts of oppression imposed by Great Britain, under impressions of the duty which she owed to posterity, made a solemn appeal to heaven for the rectitude of her intentions, and declared herself an independent nation.</p>
            <p>To do justice to the merits of that worthy and honorable band of patriots, who in succession from the first settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of America bravely withstood British oppression, and insured to the colonies the exercise of just and equal laws, would take more time than is alloted to me on this occasion. With a prophetic view they foresaw that this vast continent would at some future day be covered with inhabitants: And from a disposition discovered in Great Britain from the earliest infancy of the colonies not, only to regulate their external but internal concerns, they judged that instead of those mild and conciliatory meas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, which would have insured to her the friendship and affection of the colonies, and have been her interest as well as policy to cultivate; she would become jealous of their growing strength, and attempt by tyrannical measures to destroy that sensibility, for which the colonies had been distinguished from their first settlement in America. But with such wisdom did that firm band of patriots conduct, their affairs that no measures formed against them were successful, which had a tendency to enervate public sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, or to prepare the way for the introduction of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean despotism. Unawed by danger, steadily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the interests of their country, every measure they adopted had the designed effect, and prepared the way for, the introduction of that great and eventual day, which gave birth to the American Nation.</p>

IN tracing the events of this ever memorable day, the successes and victories obtained in a severe war of eight years, no nation could with more propriety pronounce those sacred words, "If God be for us, who can be against us." We began the war destitute of every military pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Agents and ministers were appointed to the different courts in Europe to procure military stores, and form such alliances as would be useful to America. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the severe struggles of war, patriotism gave law. The different States had confederated together, and a power was given to Congress to estimate the expences, and make requisitions on the individual States for their just proportions. Some of them were punctual in obeying those requisitions, others were delinquent.</p>
            <p>AT the close of the war the delinquent States were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to pay up their arrearages. The expenditures of the contest had nearly exhausted the circulating wealth of the country. Those States which had contributed their just proportions, and those which had not, seemed to be equally exhausted. That patriotism which gave rule during the continuance of the war, and influenced men to contribute to the l<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st of their property, now languished.—The brave old soldier who had fought the battles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica with success, now returned to his family poor and worn out in his country's service. Widows, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans of those who had been slain in the field, together with those who had advanced their all to government, men who had been in affluence and ease, but now in pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty all appeared pentioning for relief; setting forth that the faith of America was pledged to do them justice.—Commerce had now deserted our coasts, for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial regulations: Agriculture had declined; and for a moment the fruits of our independence seemed to have been blasted.</p>
            <p>BUT the American genius under the smiles of a kind providence, was not to be conquered but by insurmounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obstacles. A convention of the elders, men experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in difficulties, was assembled from one end of this vast continent to the other, to consult on such measures as would give relief. Solemn were their deliberations: such a variety of difficulties were to be surmounted, and such different interests were to be combined, as seemed to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036021_0005_1007FE86F12E87C8"/>
defy human wisdom—The necessity of union was strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt. A spirit of conciliation prevailed. A consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was formed, and adopted by the people, which has been the admiration of the lovers of liberty, containing the fundamental principles of freedom, good government and social order—Europe was astonished at the policy and wisdom of America. They had seen her carry on a successful war with one of the most powerful nations on the globe. They had seen her form two constitutions, and a change from one to the other effected without shedding a single drop of blood. History does not furnish one soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary instance of a similar nature. Attempts to effect even a change in the European constitutions, have at different periods drenched one half of their fields in blood. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica once more began to flourish. Commercial regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were formed, and the American commerce was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to every part of the globe. Agriculture was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and infant manufactures were erected, which began to vie even with those of Europe.</p>
            <p>EUROPE now became the theatre of war. France in aid to America had sent men who became enamored with American liberty. At the close of the war they returned to their native country, with the most laudable designs of procuring some amendments in their own government. Without considering the necessity of first disseminating the American knowledge and principles, among every class of the people, before the pillars of their own government were removed, they began the revolution, which like an overflowing deluge swept the vast fabric of the French government to its foundations, that its traces could not be seen but in blood.</p>
            <p>THE tried friends of America were swept away in the deluge. The enormities which succeeded are too awful to be related among men: and in decency to religion, to virtue and morality, we would here draw a veil over her vices, had they not reached America and polluted some of her sons.</p>
            <p>WHEN the news of the revolution first reached Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, an universal joy spread from one end of the continent to the other. And never was joy more generous and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. But when the evils became general, and instead of a blessing their revolution became a sword in the hand of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036021_0006_1007FE8879F9A8D8"/>
the most profligate, and devoured the innocent and the guilty in one common destruction, the Americans who were attached to the purest principles of republicanism, and to those mild and gentle laws dictated by a spirit of philanthrophy, began to shudder and abhor those devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws dictated by revenge, and sealed with the blood of the innocent.</p>
            <p>THE contagion now threatened all Europe. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contiguous to France coaleseed to prevent its bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence. Washington our president, who had fought the American battles, and seen the distresses to which our country had been reduced, was convinced of the necessity of peace, to give to the people of America an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to recover from the distresses of the war just termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and resolved to steer the American ship through the storm that gathered, without becoming a party. Those talents so remarkable for wisdom and prudence were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain exerted, and shone forth with redoubled lustre. A proclamation enjoining the duties required by the strictest principles of neutrality, and forbidding any practices not conformable thereto, was published. The conduct of Genet who had arrived in America, and before his arrival was known to our government, had enlisted both citizens and foreigners, and commissioned them to cruise against nations with which we were at peace, was a convincing proof that the French government meant to force us into a war, and awakened the keenest sensibilities in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. Faucher, his successor, finding our government determined to maintain their neutrality resolved on other measures, which the western counties of Pennsylvania, and the precious consessions of a Randolph can witness. Adet his successor, pursued measures as hostile as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor. The conduct of the French ministers occasioned difficulties with the British nation, which threatened the destruction of our commerce. The American policy was to negotiate before an appeal to arms was made. An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy extraordinary to Great Britain was appointed. The disputes between the two nations were adjusted, and a commercial treaty formed.</p>
            <p>PREVIOUS to this period vast quantities of American produce had been carried into France, and sold in her ports, for which no other payment could be obtained but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036021_0007_1007FE8A6AAE50B8"/>
assignats, a species of paper without value, which now gave such an alarm to the American merchants who had given them unbounded credit, that they avoided their ports. The French government now ordered the most piratical and indiscriminate seizures to be made of our vessels, and justified their rapacity on account of the treaty made with Great-Britain, which the conduct of their own ministers made indispensably necessary. Munroe, our minister then in France, an apostate from the true American character, represented to the French government, that the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can people would submit to be plundered of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, if it would be useful to France. Such unworthy conduct occasioned his recal. A minister whose integrity was unquestionable, was appointed; a man who would not barter his countrymen's property to the gratification of any foreign despotism. Integrity seems not to have been a necessary qualification for a minister in France: He was not received by that perfidious government. The President still inclined to peace, determined to make use of every expedient before he would recede from concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory measures: two envoys were appointed to join the one already there, with instructions, as liberal as the French government could have desired, if justice and peace had been their object. The fate of their mission has been delineated in the publication of their dispatches. The conduct of the French government is unequalled for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and will remain a stain on their character to all future ages; and be recorded on the heart of every true American characteristic of French perfidy, and serve as a caution to all future alliances.</p>
            <p>THE measures of our executive to maintain peace have met with an almost unanimous approbation, and have been applauded in the addresses of the people to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident from one end of the confederation to the other, promising their warmest support to such measures as should be thought expedient for that purpose. Defensive measures have been adopted, such as prudence dictated, and the exigences of our situation required. Merchants have been allowed to arm in their own defence, a meas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure as rational as politic. Government has built several armed vessels which have given safe passages to our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Although no declaration of war has been made
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036021_0008_1007FE8BF5A91368"/>
against France, such an actual state of hostilities exists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two nations, that it becomes the good man, and lover of his country to give firm support to our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enable it to preserve our independence against foreign despotism. We deprecate a war with any nation, if it can be avoided with safety; but rather than become tributary to France, war would not only be justifiable, but the present generation could not justify themselves to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity without resorting to it.</p>
            <p>LET us examine for a moment, into the situation of the those nations which have been drawn within the vortex of French revolution, and in their fate learn our own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by timely exertions we avert the dangers which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us. Let their conduct to other nations, serve as a caution against confidence in that nation of atheists, who spurn at peace, and from whose impious embraces have issued all those plagues which destroy human happiness.</p>
            <p>HOLLAND, one of the most industrious and opulent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, and under a republican form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had rendered herself respectable to all the nations of the earth. If we look among the ruins occasioned by French diplomatic skill, we shall find her name blotted from the catalogue of nations; a poor needy French colony, requisition after requisition, until her wealth has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted.—Geneva a republic too small to excite the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of the monarchs of Europe, and too happy to wish for innovation, but too wealthy not to excite French licentiousness, is now robbed of her wealth and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionized—Switzerland, we compassionate thy unhappy lot! The mountains which surround thee have not been able to protect thee from the all devouring armies of France. Negociation benumbed thy exertions until French perfidy had ruined thee. We mourn the fate of thy hardy sons, who though too late, exerted themselves to save their country from impending ruin. Happy hast thou been for many years in thy retired situation, free from the contentions which have embroiled Europe. Thy freedom and hospitality have invited many of the destroying nations, to seek repose in thy happy country: But thy generous and unsuspecting temper has well suited the designs of thy rapacious enemy.</p>

perfidious ally, until the king found himself surrounded with French missionaries altenating the affections of his citizens from their government, and too late roused by the dangers which surrounded, collected an army sufficient in numbers to have drove the disturbers of mankind from his dominions; but to the disgrace of his army they were corrupted by the promises of promotion, and the alluring prospects of plunder, to desert him. Such indiscriminate massacres and plunder succeeded, as seemed to touch the feelings even of the five-headed monster.—Rome and Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia two nation who had sought by tributary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to appease the desires of the French government, little thought that these desires would increase in proportion to their exertions to appease them. The pampered ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my excited quarrels among the populace and some French soldiers, and charged them upon the citizens; and under pretence of chastising them for the abuse which they themselves had occasioned, have destroyed the two gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, and plundered them of their wealth, and are now forcing their requisitions by standing armies.</p>
            <p>IN every nation in Europe which France has conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they have first gained a party in their councils, who were in favor of negociating until a French army had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived within their territory; introduced large numbers of incendiaries, whose business it was to excite jealousies and provoke contentions; and under some pretext of abuses, justified themselves in seizing on the government; and the plenipotentiary generals with constitutions in their pockets, manufactured by the French directory at Paris, have ordered the people to receive and adopt them, who at the point of the bayonet are compelled to become a military republic, under the control and direction of the French armies.</p>
            <p>IT has ever been acknowledged in America, that the views of the first movers of the French revolution were good: That there were radical evils in their government, and in the modes of administrating justice among the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens of that nation, have never been controverted. And the idea of the people's obtaining some amelioration in their situation, afforded to the freemen of America the most sincere pleasure.—The Americans had from their first setttlement of this country, then inhabited by beasts of prey and men more savage, considered themselves as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036021_0010_1007FE93463E5F98"/>
martyrs for civil and religious liberty; and as having sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed the case and luxury of Europe to establish colonies where freedom might be triumphant. These ideas have been handed down from generation to generation to their present descendents. The genuine principles of religion and liberty, have been constantly inculcated among every order of people. Their effects were obvious: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the rights of all nations, and their good will was extended to all men; considering themselves in possession of liberty, they wished it to be extended to all others.</p>
            <p>THESE sentiments and feelings of the people of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States were favorable to the views of the French government. The conduct of the first French minister, who came to America was a convincing proof that he so considered them. The people expressed themselves in term of the warmest approbation at his first arrival. The American government was the first of all nations to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the new government of France, and receive its ministers. Those persons who began the revolution with designs to give freedom to France were opposed to those violent outrages which began to be introduced, and were compelled either to suffer under the guillotine, or quit their country to preserve their lives. The succeeding parties have exercised a despotism hitherto unknown, even to the French nation. The people now found that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of obtaining freedom and liberty, they had exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a mild and gentle prince for the most unprincipled tyrants, who by their acts of barbarous cruelty and murder had disgraced the name of man. These new crimes had not reached America. That irregularities would succeed for a time, every person of political knowledge foresaw.</p>
            <p>THE minister from France began now to dictate to our government the part they had to act in the great drama, which his matters had planned. The American councils were composed of men of too much knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience not to discern that the men of France would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with the ideas of liberty, which were as little understood in France as in Algiers; and that nothing but a thorough knowledge of the true principles on which the happiness of society depends, joined with great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, could ever teach them. They gave them every privilege within the limits of a neutral station, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored by the most friendly and conciliatory measures
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036021_0011_1007FE9597F9F850"/>
to convince them that the happiness and prosperity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica greatly depended, on taking that ground. But French haughtiness was not to be satisfied with principle. They had now formed a party in America, who became obsequious to their wishes. This party, from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have never ceased to revile our own government, and to oppose every measure adopted for defence. If Robespierre and Talleyrand, whose acts of cruelty and murder would blacken the pages of savage barbarity, had been represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in our national legislature from the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their cause could not have been better advocated.</p>
            <p>AMONG the many objects of their execration I will mention a few: The British treaty, on which the alarm was first sounded with so much vehemence from one end of the union to the other, what has been the effect of it? Has any mortal heard of any evil occasioned by it, except that France and her partizans have been disgusted by it? And what then? Ought not the freedom and happiness of America to be consulted? I do not propose this question, to have it answered by the French party: But I ask it of men, who have fought to establish the independence of their country, of men who are cultivating their farms to obtain their support. Among these I have from my infancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided, and know their integrity, which I revere. Has the treaty with Britain contravened any article of agreement with France? And their right to object to it, never existed. Commercial men have approved of it, who are principally governed by it. My soul would abhor any connection with great Britain, or any other nation on earth, which could not be justified on the present principles of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can safety and freedom. But that we should be obliged to ask leave of France, whether America may form com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial regulations with any nation with whom her citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens have intercourse, is a degree of degradation, to which I pray God, America may never submit.</p>
            <p>THE alien and sedition laws have also been execrated by the French partizans. The legislatures of the States which have had a session since those laws were passed, (Virginia and Kentuckey excepted) have expressly declared their approbation of them; not only as constitutional but as expedient and necessary. Should it be demanded what is their use, the answer is at hand. The alien law was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly provided to remove foreigners, who by their hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036021_0012_1007E61F7714DC50"/>
practices had rendered their reesidence in America dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to our independence; precisely such men, as have been the principle instruments in overturning every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government in Europe, &amp; are avowedly enemies to that order both in religious and civil affairs, which the God of nature has dictated to men in civil society, not only by creation, but by the express revelation of his will, as necessary to preserve even the appearance of the social state.—The purposes for which the sedition law was made are equally obvious, to prevent falshhood and imposition, and to punish persons who should be guilty of them. Such persons as should be guilty of speaking or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing false, scandalous, libellous things against the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of government, with a malicious intent to defame and render them odious, and excite seditious practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. The malice and falshhood constitute the crime; and on proof of the truth of the things spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or published, by law the accused is discharged. As soon should I have thought that a law punishing men for murdering their fellow creatures, should be considered an abridgment of the freedom of men's actions, as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing the foul crime of wilfully disseminating falshood and abuse, should be considered as an abridgment of the liberty of speech or of the press.</p>
            <p>THE imperfection of man subjects him to imposition, and the cry of liberty and patriotism too often covers the base designs of a corrupt heart, and too frequently give to men consequence, who like Judas for thirty pieces of silver betrayed his Lord and Saviour; so would they for a small reward sacrifice the independence of their country. To avoid the evils occasioned by the exertions of such men, to pervert the measures of government from the true and legitimate principles on which the safety of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety depends, such measures will be resorted to as will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually counteract the evils designed. In the execution of such measures the minds of men too frequently become heated, and without examination adopt the sentiments of the most noisy and profligate. The wisdom of men would be to examine with candor, and investigate every subject to its source, and decide with accuracy and impartiality on every measure, on which their interest and happiness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. The variety of relations in which every individual in society stands, imposes this as a solemn duty. And the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036021_0013_1007FE9ADC61EA38"/>
true interests of America as a nation possessing freedom, and wishing its continuance, will enforce it.</p>
            <p>WE are situated far from Europe, where the passion for war seems to predominate. We are in possession of a country with such a variety of soil and climate as to be able to raise on our own American ground, almost ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing necessary for the common comforts of life, or even its luxuries. Could America preserve peace with all nations, and when the ravages of war depopulate Europe enter her ports without danger, how interesting would be the event? These seem to be the blessings which heaven designed for the people of the United States. And noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the want of a national unanimity, has prevented their enjoying them long before this. But to make these blessings permanent in America a national character must be established. Not as a nation cap<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious of her rights, but determined deliberately and perseveringly to defend them, it is our business when injuries and insults are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us by any power, with firm and steady measures to pursue redross; and if the measures pointed out by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son fail, to extirpate from our land and coasts every nation that dare invade our rights.</p>
            <p>How constantly have our great and good presidents, WASHINGTON and ADAMS, exerted themselves to preserve peace in America? Men whose lives have been devoted to the service of their country, and whose measures have been marked with the greatest prudence and wisdom. Their conduct deserves the gratitude and applause of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freeman in America. Their exertions to maintain peace have been unexampled.—Difficulties had existed with Great Britain, ever since the war with that nation. Others had arisen which became intolerable, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the most violent hostilities. An envoy was appointed with competent powers to a just existing disputes. The result has been mentioned.—Spain has territory lying contiguous to the United States: Questions arose res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the rights of the two nations, and occasioned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, which for a time wore a serious aspect; but they have been amicably adjusted.—With France, repeated have been the attempts for peace; and in some instances the most submissive measures to obtain an audience of that government, have been adopted, but without success. They have plundered us of our wealth, excited insurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against our government, and threatened even the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036021_0014_1007FE9E55329AF0"/>
of our independence. By the aid of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plomatic skill, joined with their party here, they have boasted that they would revolutionize our own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This party have justified their insinuations by the most vindictive virulence, and outrageous falshoods circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated against our government; approving even of the most vile and brutal conduct, of which the French gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment have been guilty; conduct too disgraceful to name on this anniversary of our independence.</p>
            <p>NOTHING is more common than to hear this party boast, that if France should invade us, they would be the first to oppose and fight them. The experience of every nation in Europe contradicts their assertion. Just such fighting zealots were in Holland: Just such fighting zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots were in Venice: Just such such fighting zealots were in Geneva: Just such fighting zealots were in Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sardinia and Naples, who boasted of their patriotism, courage and bravery. But the moment the French army arrived within their territory, to the disgrace of humanity, they joined them and fought their own countrymen: and are now rioting on the plunder wrested from the possession of the honest industrious laborer. Let Americans look into the records of the destruction of these nations, and learn the truth of these assertions, before their liberties shall be consigned to the abodes of despotism.</p>
            <p>To use arguments with men devoted to the interest and views of France, determined that religion and liberty shall have an end in America, would be futile. These men are implacable in their views, and nothing can save them from the just indignation due to traitors, and the destroyers of human happiness—But to those men who are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the corrupt conduct of the French government, and are opposed to our own from a conviction arising from the false representations of the French partizans, our breasts ought to feel compassion. But even to these men, since the most undeniable proofs exist, of the hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile design of the French nation against our liberties, should they continue their opposition to our government, that GOD who has been bountiful in his gifts to fallen man, has never required charity to be extended. An injured coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can never permit them to escape a just punishment.</p>
            <p>LET us be reminded of the obligations we are under to the author of all mercies, who inspired our forefathers
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036021_0015_1007FEA132F87A28"/>
with resolution to cross the wide Atlantic, where they could form colonies for the worship of GOD according to their consciences; that he encircled them with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and protection; that he caused them to increase in number, beyond human calculation: That he at all times of difficulty and distrust, caused his guardian angels to protect and defend them; and that at a time when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came necessary for their happiness to be separated from their mother country, he conducted their armies to success and victory, and enabled them to become an independent nation; that he caused wisdom and knowledge to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seminated among all orders of men; and that he has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to us their descendants, a government, where the true principles of representation are clearly displayed in the great body of the people, from whence all authority flows, and at stated periods return. This is a privilege granted only to the people of America. There is not another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on earth, where this right remains exclusively to the people. Let our gratitude ascend to the author of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that we participate in the rights of a people, who under his providence govern themselves.</p>
            <p>SHALL the people of America let the syren song of an insidious foreign foe divert them from the true point on which their happiness and interest depends, and rob them of these privileges which were given to them by that GOD who deals bountifully to his people. Those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who deny his providence he permits to perish. And whether that providence which has afforded its fostering care to America, did not permit the French Directory to harden their hearts to refuse our ministers of peace, to prevent the contagious effects of their baneful influence from corrupting the minds of the people of the United States, we will submit to the candid enquiry of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of America.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Citizens of the United States,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET our government be respected, as the organ through which the sentiments of community are conveyed to each individual. Let the laws be respected, and carried into effect. In this, each individual in society has an equal interest. By the laws of our country the life and property of every citizen are guaranteed to him, and whoever violates them becomes guilty before the public tribunal; and unless the criminal receives the just
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036021_0016_1007FEA3A2F3C4E8"/>
punishment provided by law for his offence, public jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is cutraged, order ceases, and anarchy with all its baneful horrors succeeds!</p>
            <p>To our military friends we will suggest the importance of their station in society. To them is committed, under the direction of our government, the protection of our independence against foreign invasion, and internal insurrections. The experience necessary to render yourselves completely useful to your country, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requires a devotion of some part of your time; for which, may you be completely recompensed, in the grateful acknowledgment of your approving country. Should the period arrive when you may be called into the field, to exert your military talents, may you, under the command of that able and experienced general who has, under the God of Armies, been the military and political saviour of our country, march to victory and success; and teach those nations who dare to invade us, a lesson of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: that although the Americans with to cultivate friendship with all nations, and that the banners of peace may forever encircle them; yet that their sons are sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and that the army which meets with them, meets with their destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My fellow Citizens,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE tokens of prosperity in our agricultural concerns, call upon us all to give an able support to our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the blessings of peace and tranquility may be preserved. May the precious blood which has flowed from our departed friends, and heroes, to purchase the freedom which we enjoy, never upbraid us with sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing those liberties to the demon of faction, or of bartering them for French despotism.</p>
            <p>To that Being who exalteth one nation and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth another, and agreeable to his sovereign pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure distributes his blessings to nations and individuals, may our gratitude and adoration ascend for his liberality to America. And under his guidance and care, may the liberties commited to us by our venerable ancestors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the additions which his bountiful hand has made to us, be handed down from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a perpetual inheritance to his favorite people of the United States.</p>
