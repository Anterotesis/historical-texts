            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The following brief memorial, of the experience of a deeply devoted mind, is deemed worthy of public notice, as an additional teſtimony to "the cloud of witneſſes," we are already favoured with, to the internal efficacy of the power and principle of Truth. The writer was a valuable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Solomon's obſervation, "Honourable age is not that which ſtandeth in length of time; nor that is meaſured by number of years: but wiſdom is grey hairs unto men; and an unſpotted life is old age:" being remarkably diſtinguiſhed by a ſteady, uniform devotion, and dedication of heart to the pure cauſe of Truth and Righteouſneſs on the earth; which he believed himſelf called to maintain, and to endeavour to promote by example and precept. His memory is therefore very precious; in particular to ſome who had an intimate acquaintance with him. To theſe more emphatically, "he being dead yet ſpeaketh," in the remembrance of his ſolid, wiſe deportment, his fewneſs of words, and thoſe ſeaſoned with grace; and his ſteady firmneſs towards oppoſers of principles and teſtimonies, which he had not taken upon truſt, but deeply examined their foundation, nature and tendency; and being baptized under a living concern to ſupport them, as before obſerved, he dared not flinch in the day of battle, but both in that ſociety of which he became a member, and alſo amongst others, he was deeply and awfully engaged to ſtand his ground in the divine ability afforded, and to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit an example of ancient ſimplicity and uprightneſs; as he obſerved to a friend in one of his letters, ſome months before his deceaſe. After pointing out his great concern in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the declenſions amongst a highly profeſſing and eminently favoured people, and making various remarks on the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of preſerving as a wall of defence, the religious diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline eſtabliſhed among them, and not giving way to weakneſs, in order to maintain a ſpecious, merely external unity, and by being indifferent towards thoſe noble teſtimonies which his ſoul loved, and was uncommonly bound to: he firmly,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:036346_0003_10091C5D824B1110"/>
yet humbly, added, "O my friend, excuſe my freedom; the cauſe of truth I have to believe, though with a due proportion of fear I would expreſs it, is ſo deeply impreſſed upon my mind, that neither the fear nor the love of any created being or thing, can be permitted to obſtruct or divert me from what may appear to be required of me." In a great degree in this firmneſs he lived, bearing much oppoſition, and the croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as related in the following memorial; and yet more particularly known to ſome who were acquainted with him; and thus firmly he died in great ſtability and peace, having little to ſay, but that little was truly much in a ſmall compaſs, expreſſed at different times to a few friends who viſited him near his end: ſome of whom were alſo with him juſt at the ſolemn period: and though in the midſt of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were joyful witneſſes and partakers of that ſolemnity and peace, which proved as a ſeal to the deep concern, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and happy cloſe of the dear deceaſed. He was ill about three weeks of a fever; and in the forepart of his illneſs expreſſed to a friend who viſited him, "that there was no cauſe of diſcouragement to the right minded." Being aſked at another time if he had any thing in particular to expreſs to friends, he replied, "No; only my love: all is well: nothing ſtands in my way." And thus he peacefully laid down his life, in the <hi>30</hi>th year of his age, the <hi>30</hi>th of the <hi>1</hi>ſt. Month, <hi>1795.</hi>

            <head>SOME ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I SHALL paſs over the early part of my life, only obſerving I had been educated in a religious way. I mention this, as at times, when I lived in London, where I ſerved an apprenticeſhip, in the midſt of my diſſipation, I frequently felt the reproofs of the Lord in mine heart, but which were ſoon ſmothered in the vortex of pleaſure. After I had ſerved my appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip, I returned into the country to aſſiſt my father in his buſineſs of a farrier, at Reading, in the year 1786. A little time afterwards, as I attended the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh church ſo called, where a celebrated preacher of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated, I found an awakening power, which produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a little alteration in me. I more conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſervices, public and private; joined the more particular profeſſors, and went on for ſeveral years as one of them. I alſo abſtained from vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and converſation which I had before been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to, ſo that I was one of the chief profeſſors; but I found a gradual wearing off of the force of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions I had received; leſs diſlike to worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and the power of ſin gaining the aſcendency; that I at times felt much uneaſineſs; particularly as, on ſerious reflection I felt the ſtrength of my luſts and paſſions, and the evil propenſities of my nature unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; notwithſtanding my knowledge of the truths of the goſpel, and the profeſſion I made: and obſerving and converſing with my fellow profeſſors. I found the ſame great anxiety of mind, and breathings to the Lord, that he would make me indeed what I profeſſed to be; and what I was perſuaded by the ſcriptures of truth, a true Chriſtian might be: that is, free from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well as the guilt of ſin. Thus I went on till about the year 1792, often feeling the dominion of ſin, and,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036346_0005_10091C60E12751E8"/>
deſiring deliverance from it; when I was led to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the people called Quakers, and was ſoon ſatisfied there was a manifeſt difference between them and others, even in outward appearance, which when I conſidered, I was convinced was more conformable to chriſtianity than any others I had known; moſt of whom followed all the faſhions of the world, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in dreſs; an inconſiſtency I frequently obſerved with much concern. I then ſought the converſation of ſome of them, and ſtill found more ſimplicity, more like the precepts and practices of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that I deſired to know the principles from which ſuch ſuperior practices reſulted, and enquired for ſome of their writings. The firſt book I think that I read, was W. Penn's No Croſs No Crown, which much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my ſpirit, and removed ſome unfavourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I had received reſpecting Friends. I then in ſome meaſure ſaw how far what I had known before fell ſhort of what that work directed to; yet I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued attending at the pariſh place of worſhip; having the moſt favourable opinion of the miniſter there, and a particular eſteem for him, as a man who alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently profeſſed a particular affection towards me. Once I remember, when I had ſo far deviated from my profeſſion, as to go to a horſe-race, he ſent for me, and kindly admoniſhed me as a friend and overſeer. I mention this, as afterwards, when it pleaſed the Lord to enlighten my mind more clearly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of the neceſſity of leaving the form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I had been accuſtomed to, it was a ſore trial to me to leave him, in a manner that I apprehended he would feel not a little concerned about. The next book I read I think was Barclay's Apology, which opened many things ſo clearly to me, that I could not but conſent to them; nevertheleſs there were ſome things that at firſt reading I could not aſſent to, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly reſpecting public worſhip. I thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful there ſhould be a time appointed, and ſomebody
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036346_0006_10091C62660E4F40"/>
ready to officiate, that the ignorant might be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and that a man, taught as I apprehended, of the Lord, and properly qualified, might at any time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort or preach to the people. I ſtill attended the old place, going occaſionally to friends meetings on any particular occaſions, when ſome ſtrangers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; whoſe teſtimonies, though I could not but approve of them, yet were not able to draw me from my former ſociety; but I found the work of the Lord going on by degrees.</p>
            <p>At firſt, I think, I conſidered the ordinance of the Lord's ſupper, as it is called, and was ſenſible I had never found any profit in it, from the beginning of my partaking of it; and though I had often heard others ſpeak very highly of it, as finding particular and extraordinary comfort and benefit in it; and I often at the time earneſtly deſired to find the benefit of it as well as others; yet it ſtill remained a dead, unprofitable ſervice: I therefore declined it entirely. The next thing I think I obſerved, was the public ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I began to ſee a great inconſiſtency in that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, particularly after ſermon. I could feel it had in myſelf as well as in others, a manifeſt tendency to lightneſs of ſpirit, and removing any ſerious impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which might have been received from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe; that I ſoon left the place, immediately after ſermon was ended. It was not long however before I ſaw a groſs inconſiſtency in the practice altogether, when I weightily conſidered the matter contained in what was ſung, how impoſſible it was for a congregation of different kinds of people to join in ſinging whatever might be given out, whether ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their conditions or not; much of which, I was perſuaded, could not be ſaid by any, without uttering groſs falſehoods; which I could not believe could be acceptable in the ſight of the Lord. I was in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence conſtrained to give forth ſome obſervations on the ſubject in writing, addreſſed to the profeſſors
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036346_0007_10091C63F5833FD0"/>
of religion, attending the place called St. Gile's Church.</p>
            <p>"A few obſervations concerning the cuſtom of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in public meetings of worſhip; by one, who has long been convinced of the inconſiſtency of it, and now calls upon every one who profeſſes to be a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the meek and lowly Jeſus, to lay aſide pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and ſeriouſly conſider the following remarks, which are offered in the fear of the Lord."</p>
            <p>"Firſt, It ought ever to be conſidered, that God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth In other words, it is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the heart which he regards, not words, however excellent of themſelves. Now I appeal to the witneſs of God in every heart, conſidering the variety of conditions, the different ſubjects, of praiſe, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confeſſion, petitioning, &amp;c. &amp;c. contained in every collection, whether in the fear of the Lord any one, in whatever ſtate or condition he may be at the time, can with propriety be ready to ſing whatever may be given out. It appears to me impoſſible that a whole congregation (even if we except the ignorent) can be in the ſame frame of mind, conſidering the various diſpenſations of the Lord's providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people; conſequently if that is not the caſe, it follows of courſe, that if all ſing, ſome muſt utter words with the mouth contrary to the language of the heart, which ſo far from being acceptable to the Lord, I am perſuaded is hypocriſy and an abomination in his ſight."</p>
            <p>"Again, it appears to me inconſiſtent alſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the other parts of worſhip; for if the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the heart is ſpoken in prayer, which often precedes ſinging, and which implies a ſenſe of our wants, doth it not ſhew an indifference whether our prayers are heard and anſwered or not, to begin ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately, perhaps very different in matter as well as in manner, to what has been prayed for?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:036346_0008_10091C6753630728"/>"Again, after preaching, if the Lord's power is known and felt under the word, is it not more likely to profit, if the mind is occupied in ſerious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than ſinging, which from my own experience, I can ſay, has a tendency to divert the mind from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, ſerious reflection? I am now ſpeaking more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerning thoſe, who have attained to a meaſure of the grace of God. Aſk yourſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. Is outward ſinging intended or calculated to pleaſe the carnal ears of men, or a holy God? Why ſuch anxiety about tunes, voices, and muſic? Is the Lord to be pleaſed with ſuch poor things? Oh, no; you cannot ſuppoſe it. Conſider from what root it ſprings, from the old man or the new; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the axe is laid to the root, to deſtroy all that is of the earth, of our fleſhly nature. I have conſidered thoſe paſſages in the New Teſtament, where the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is mentioned, and am confirmed by them in my opinion, of the inconſiſtency of public ſinging. The apoſtle ſpeaks of ſinging with grace in the heart; of making melody in the heart to the Lord; not making a noiſe with the tongue unleſs that proceeds from the heart; which how ſeldom it does in public ſinging I appeal to every conſiderate mind."</p>
            <p>"I am convinced in my own mind, conſidering our ſituation here, the power and devices of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, our own inbred corruptions, that it is more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to watch and pray, to be ever on our guard, and waiting to feel the light and power of Chriſt, to diſcover and ſubdue the hidden things of darkneſs; that as children of the light we may walk in the light, and find the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, his Spirit and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, cleanſing us from all ſin; than evidencing that trifling, careleſs ſpirit, too commonly, if not always, attending outward ſinging."</p>
            <p>"I could ſay much more againſt it, but would not be tedious, particularly reſpecting thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. How ſeldom can ſuch people, living in open
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036346_0009_10091C6933219D68"/>
and avowed oppoſition to God, join in ſinging without uttering groſs, abominable lies: and are we not acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thereto? Is it not expected when a pſalm or hymn is given out, all preſent who are capable will join? Then let it not be ſaid, how can we help the abuſe of it. Ought we not rather to ſet them an example of truth and righteouſneſs, and not countenance any practice that has a tendency to promote lightneſs and irreverence? Oh! my friends, this cannot be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Lord, who requireth truth in the inward parts. I recommend to your ſerious conſideration, what the Lord ſays in the 1ſt of Iſaiah reſpecting the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of his own appointing, when not done in a proper ſpirit. I perceive every day more and more, an evident departure from the ſimplicity of Chriſt. Where is the daily croſs borne? Obſerve the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of profeſſors. What difference is there from the world? Sure, my friends, theſe things ought not to be. Bear with me, I beſeech you. I am much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the honour of our profeſſion. If the croſs is truly borne, all ſelf-ſeeking and ſelf-pleaſing will be done away, and the fruits of the ſpirit more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced; which I am perſuaded will not be in the preſent practice of public outward ſinging, often of words, as to the matter, ſcarce within the bounds of probability: and I am convinced if people would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider the manner, it would appear very inconſiſtent with the gravity and ſolemnity of the true Chriſtian profeſſion."</p>
            <p>"May the Lord ſet theſe things home upon every heart, that there may be a concern to offer unto him acceptable ſacrifice; which more than once is ſaid to be a broken and contrite ſpirit."</p>
            <p>"Bleſſed are ye that mourn," ſays Chriſt, (not ye that ſing) "for ye ſhall rejoice;" which rejoicing, if it may be applied to the preſent ſtate of the church here, I conceive to be a grateful ſenſe of the Lord's mercies; and ſhowing forth his praiſes not only with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036346_0010_10091C6BF53D9BB0"/>
our lips but in our lives. To conclude, my friends, turn into your own hearts; behold, ſays Chriſt, the kingdom of God is within you; look not without for what I am perſuaded is only to be found within. It is not much hearing or much ſpeaking, that brings true peace to the ſoul; the ear is never ſatisfied with hearing. As a proof of that, do not we ſee profeſſors running hither and thither, as though the more they heard, the better they ſhould be; encompaſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about with ſparks of their own kindling, but what ſaith the Lord? "Ye ſhall lie down in ſorrow." I am fully convinced it is for want of this looking in, and waiting to feel the power of the Lord there, judging and ſubduing ſin, that there is ſo much talk, ſo much outward parade, and ſo little ſpirituality in the lives and converſation of the people." J. S.</p>
            <p>This I ſent to the clerk, at the ſame time I ſent ſome reaſons for the apparent change in me, as abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſacrament, ſo called; and which I deſired him to lay before the miniſter and others, at a prayer meeting; which he ſeemed to object to, ſuppoſing me in an error, and having a very unfavourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Friends principles. I ſoon after had ſome converſation with him on the ſubject; which rather confirmed me in my opinion than otherwiſe, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appeared ſo weak againſt Friends. Thus I went on ſome little time longer, ſtill attending mornings and evenings; but attending Friends meetings in the afternoon. About this time I read Sewel's Hiſtory of the Quakers, which I think removed every objection, and confirmed me in my opinion of the truth of their principles. Their ſevere ſufferings, their patience under them, and honeſt boldneſs before kings and rulers, convinced me, that nothing but a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could have ſupported them. I ſought the company of ſome faithful Friends, as I could diſcover in ſome I had been with, little more than the form. I deſired
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036346_0011_10091C6F5AF04550"/>
to know the power in myſelf, and to be truly taught of the Lord, that I might not do any thing by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or becauſe others did ſo; but retired often alone, to be inſtructed of the Lord, what to do and what to leave; and, glory to his name, he was found of me, and made thoſe retirements precious and profitable to me, revealing his will unto me by degrees, as I was able to bear it. I now became acquainted with ſome ſolid Friends, and was occaſionally in company with them, which excited the attention of my friends and neighbours; ſo that there was much talk about me, and various reports were propagated reſpecting it, moſt people thinking it very ſtrange I ſhould turn Quaker.</p>
            <p>About this time I met with a conſiderable trial, the death of my father whom I dearly loved. I had long been perſuaded in ſome meaſure of the vanity and inconſiſtency of wearing black clothes on ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, knowing it to be only a worldly cuſtom: and had often ſaid to myſelf during my father's illneſs, I would not put it on for any one except him; but there appeared ſo many reaſons why I ſhould conform on his account, that it was not till a little time before his death, that it pleaſed the Lord to remove my ſcruples reſpecting it, and ſtrengthen me to bear ſuch a public teſtimony, as of neceſſity that event occaſioned. And indeed much oppoſition I met with on account of it, but the Lord ſupported me thro' all. I then conſtantly attended Friends meetings.</p>
            <p>About this time alſo I was concerned to write an addreſs to ſome who uſually met on firſt days, from different parts of the neighbouring country, to hear the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, at a private houſe; where I had occaſionally atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with other profeſſors of the town. I alſo wrote to the clerk, and ſent him No Croſs, No Crown; ſoon after Barclay's Apology: and to another intimate friend, who was very zealous, I wrote and ſent, Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van's Primative Chriſtianity reſtored. And though I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036346_0012_10091C70DDC6FC60"/>
deſired in what I wrote to individuals, as well as the ſociety, that it might be put about for the peruſal of any; I found little notice taken by any, I thought they ſeemed rather to avoid me. One ſteady experienced man, in a little converſation, obſerving, he hoped I did not look for that in myſelf, which was only to be found in Chriſt, I was concerned to write to him ſome little time after on the ſubject; and ſent him at the ſame time, No Croſs, No Crown. While I was exerciſed towards the ſociety I had left, I met with ſome more trials from other quarters; my relations complained of my ſilence, putting unfavourable conſtructions upon it. Indeed I had ſo much upon my mind, that I had little deſire to ſpeak much: for being often in my way of buſineſs with people of conſequence in the neighbourhood, moſt of whom had always ſhewn me much attention and favour, now obſerving ſuch a change, though only in dreſs at firſt, they began to look rather ſtrangely upon me. The enemy of ſouls was not unmindful of my ſituation, and raiſed many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in my way; as the loſs of their favours, and, of courſe, my buſineſs; the great offence my conforming to other things not yet done would give them: ſuch as the ceremony of the hat, the language, and their titles ſo highly valued; theſe ſeemed indeed ſo great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that my mind was at times ſorely diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p>I had ſome time felt an uneaſineſs reſpecting the performing ſome part of my buſineſs, ſuch as nicking and cropping horſes, &amp;c. puniſhing them for the ſake of appearance, to pleaſe the fancies of men. When I began to mention my ſcruples, much oppoſition was made, as the conſequence muſt of courſe be the loſs of much buſineſs. I know not whether I was not too haſty in this matter, beginning in mine own ſtrength, and not waiting the due time; for I found when I was required to do it, I gave way, which brought trouble upon me; till at laſt I was enabled to refuſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, among whom was one for whom I did much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036346_0013_10091C7565C83DC0"/>
who on my objecting and telling him my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſeemed very angry and reproached my chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my religion, &amp;c. He aſked me to recommend ſome one to do it, but I told him I could not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend another to do what I thought not right to do myſelf.</p>
            <p>This event occaſioned ſome uneaſineſs; I was blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed highly on the ſuppoſition I ſhould ſoon loſe my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but I anſwered in the words of our Lord, "Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man forſake all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple." I ſaw more and more how people could follow the ways, cuſtoms, and faſhions of the world, and uſe means not always the moſt honeſt to get its riches: ſo true is our Lord's ſaying, "Where your treaſure is there will your hearts be alſo." O! how few really deny themſelves and take up the croſs.</p>
            <p>About this time came the quarterly meeting of a ſociety I helped to eſtabliſh, called The Sick Man's Viſitor, to relieve the wants of thoſe in diſtreſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the chief and moſt ſerious of the profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, a committee of whom met every week to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the buſineſs of it, and to hold a prayer meeting as they called it, at the ſame time ſinging, reading, &amp;c. Being the time I uſed to ſerve on the committee, I took the opportunity to write to them, giving my reaſons why I could not join in the ſervices perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at thoſe times; alſo ſomething more reſpecting the principles, &amp;c. of Friends, with what was upon my mind beſides; obſerving if any were deſirous of more information on the ſubject, or had any objections to propoſe reſpecting Friends principles, I was willing to receive them.</p>
            <p>Hitherto there had not been any material alteration in my dreſs, except what I wore on firſt days; I ſtill wearing a modern hat; but now I found it required of me to make an alteration there; which, as it was more conſpicuous than any I had made, I found very trying; nature being unwilling to bear the croſs;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036346_0014_10091C7752701BA8"/>
but it pleaſed the Lord to ſtrengthen me; and indeed it cauſed much gazing, admiration, and ridicule, as I could perceive and hear, though little was ſaid direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, but the Lord preſerved me, and I thought I found rather a kindneſs of behaviour among the more conſiderable of my neighbours when I attended in the courſe of my buſineſs, particularly from the chief juſtice Eyre, where I had apprehended not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſcouragement, but I found through the mercy of my God, a very favourable intercourſe. And here I may obſerve reſpecting theſe things, I felt a little at a time required of me; and as I was willing to give up, the Lord was pleaſed to afford me ſtrength to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him. Now I am aware theſe things, reſpecting dreſs, &amp;c. are, in the eyes of man's wiſdom deſpiſed, and thought of no conſequence: indeed of themſelves, I am perſuaded they are of no conſequence, or if done from a wrong motive may be rather injurious than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; yet when the Lord commands, it becomes his creatures to obey, and not reaſon about it, whether it is of conſequence or not. When I felt a deſire to reaſon about it, the example of Naaman the Syrian, was brought to my remembrance. When the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ordered him to waſh ſeven times in Jordan, his pride and wiſdom were offended; he wanted ſome great thing done, ſomewhat pompous, and agreeable to the ideas of his worldly mind; and had not his ſervants been wiſer than their maſter, he might have continued in his diſeaſe; but the event proved, how deſpicable ſoever the means appeared, it fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all he could wiſh; therefore it is good for any one who feels occaſionally the judgment of the Lord, againſt any thing however trifling it may appear, not to conſult with fleſh and blood, not to reaſon about it, but give up in ſimplicity of mind; and then I am perſuaded it will be found of more conſequence than was apprehended; for if we are not faithful in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, how can we expect the greater will be committed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036346_0015_10091C7AB6738788"/>
to us. And indeed in this matter I have been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, I found not a little advantage; for before, when my appearance was not very different from the world, my acquaintance would enter into familiar converſe with me; which too often had a tendency to divert my mind from that ſeriouſneſs I wiſhed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and leave unpleaſant reflections afterwards; but when they ſaw (in their eyes) my uncouth appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it operated as a kind of check to lightneſs, and preſerved me from the ſnare of unneceſſary worldly converſation; ſo that I had the advantage of more retirement, which I truſt I can ſay I have found the moſt profitable ſeaſons. The apoſtle ſaith not in vain, "If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." And a follower of Chriſt will not be conformed to the world, nor uphold whatever is of it, either in himſelf or others; not merely becauſe it is witneſſed againſt in the ſcriptures, but being influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the ſame ſpirit, which was in them, he is taught by it to teſtify againſt the ſame the diſciples of old did in their day.</p>
            <p>It was a great grief and concern to me to conſider, that as it was a day of ſo great profeſſion, many walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miles to hear, what they ſuppoſed the goſpel, preached, our ſteeple houſe being generally crowded by people from the other pariſhes; I ſay it grieved me, that my leaving the faſhions of the world which they all profeſſed to deny, ſhould cauſe ſuch amazement as it appeared to do even in profeſſors; which helped to confirm me in my opinion, that how much ſoever they could talk about religion, very little of the power thereof was known: indeed had I not felt a want of the power of godlineſs, I ſhould not have left them, as there were many ties which held me both to the prieſt and people. But it was that divine power I longed for; and nothing ſhort of it could ſatisfy me, and ſure nothing but that could have ſupported me in the different trials I ſoon had to encounter; but the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036346_0016_10091C7E155A3790"/>
battle was the Lord's, and his was the victory over every appearance of mine adverſary, and to him be all the glory.</p>
            <p>For ſeveral months my mind was much exerciſed on various occaſions, the enemy aſſaulting me conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with reproaches from without and fears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. My buſineſs ſeemed to decline, and I was reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for over acting my part, and informed that ſome of the ſociety had ſaid ſo. It was great grief to me to obſerve ſome Friends, for whom I entertained great eſteem, not ſo faithful againſt worldly titles, as <abbr>Eſq</abbr> —; Sir ſuch a one; Mr.—, &amp;c. as I believed was required and practiſed by ancient Friends. It gave the enemies much occaſion againſt me.</p>
            <p>About this time peoples' minds were much agitated on political ſubjects, the French having overturned all orders and diſtinctions, which gave great offence to people in general; they called their days, &amp;c. as do Friends, inſtead of the old names. I mention this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the adverſary aſſailed me with the ſuggeſtion that I ſhould be deemed of their ſpirit. I could expect lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle favour, though politics was a ſubject I thought little about, and ſpoke leſs: believing as our bleſſed Lord ſaid, "My kingdom is not of this world," eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true diſciple being influenced by the ſame ſpirit, the attention as well as the affections will be engaged in things above, not of this world, more than need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and it had been ſome time before a concern to me, to obſerve ſome of the ſociety of Friends med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with ſuch matters, more warmly than I thought conſiſtent with their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>I was at times ſo ſorely preſſed, ſo burdened in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that I ſeemed as though my ſtrength was broken, and was ready to cry out, "The children are come to the birth, and there is not ſtrength to bring forth;" but ſtill my deſires were to the Lord, who had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſupported me, that I might ſtill experience him a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036346_0017_10091C7FA54D2DD8"/>
God near at hand, and not afar off: for I felt how unable I was to move a ſtep without his divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. So low was I reduced, that though I received ſeveral reviling letters, which were clearly againſt the truth, I had not power to anſwer them; being taught to leave the cauſe to the Almighty, and not be anxious to juſtify myſelf before men, but which may be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to any who may experience ſimilar trials, I felt a ſecret upholding, a conſoling aſſurance, that the Lord would plead his own cauſe, and in his own time bring forth judgment unto victory; and I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his hand might not ſpare, neither his eye pity, till his work was accompliſhed to his own glory, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might be with me. Thus I continued ſome time, till it pleaſed the Lord to revive me; when, though I had little buſineſs in compariſon to what I had heretofore, yet I was abundantly ſatisfied with an enlivening ſenſe of the Lord's preſence; which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurpaſſed all worldly goods, ſo that in meaſure I knew the truth of our dear Lord's promiſe, that whoever may be enabled to leave any thing for his name's ſake, ſhall receive an hundred fold even in this life, either in kind or in kindneſs: and ſure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſenſe of the approbation of the moſt High, is of infinitely greater value than any thing this world can afford. O! that the people, particularly the Lord's profeſſing people, may be encouraged to be willing to part with every thing, however near and dear to fleſh and blood, that ſtands in the way, which obſtructs that divine communion with him we are taught to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; for true it is, except a man forſake all that he hath, he cannot be Chriſt's diſciple; and he is not a hard maſter, doth not require any thing to be parted with, but what would really be injurious to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual welfare; though to man's carnal apprehenſion it may ſeem in ſome caſes in a different light. Man naturally loves eaſe. The croſs of Chriſt is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036346_0018_10091C81369ACE38"/>
to fleſh and blood, but, my friends, if ever we know the truth of what Paul declares, that "they who are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh with its affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and luſts;" and the more readily we ſubmit to the yoke, I am perſuaded we ſhall the ſooner experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that ſubdued, which diſlikes the croſs: then we ſhall know what our Lord ſaid, that his yoke is eaſy and his burden light.</p>
            <p>A fear had ariſen in my mind, leſt I ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the mote in my brother's eye, and not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently to that power, which could alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the beam out of my own; and though my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was frequently grieved on hearing vain converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and often ſeemed to feel a deſire to reprove, yet I was afraid to caſt a ſtone, feeling myſelf not without ſin, and I had to remember and to deſire to practiſe what is recorded; to ſtudy to be quiet and mind my own buſineſs; and I think I can truly ſay, that in ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and retiredneſs I experienced a degree of peace, and I truſt a growth in grace: and I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with humble thankfulneſs, the condeſcending kindneſs of my heavenly Father, in favouring me with much opportunity of retirement; having compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively but little worldly buſineſs, for I ſorrowfully found in thoſe lawful engagements, a very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of keeping in that ſtraight line of duty, which I believed was marked out for me. In the courſe of converſation words would occaſionally drop, which, afterwards on reflection, brought diſtreſs on my mind and I deſired to be thankful that I was enabled not to deſire much of this world's goods, but rather the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and to be content with food and raiment. It was a concern to me to obſerve among Friends, on a young man's beginning buſineſs for himſelf a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in ſome things with the world, I thought to gain their favour and cuſtom; it appeared to me paying very dear for their aſſiſtance; and I believed I could
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036346_0019_10089624A4C58B30"/>
prefer working hard as a ſervant, to the moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation on ſuch terms; and fervent deſires would frequently ariſe in my mind, that all who profeſs to be followers of Chriſt, particularly Friends, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs more than moſt, would be concerned to practiſe our bleſſed Lord's advice, to ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs; yea and ſeek nothing elſe till they had found it; then I believed by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, they would be divinely directed in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral concerns, and preferring it above all things, would be preſerved from the too prevailing ſnare of flattering the world for their ſupport. I have thought that people are often led to ſuch practices, by engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in concerns which bring extraordinary expenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; which, requiring more of the things of this world, a greater difficulty is experienced in bearing a faithful teſtimony againſt what they may be convinced is evil. Theſe conſiderations, through divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, induced me to be careful of confining my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes in as narrow a compaſs as I believed conſiſtent with my ſituation; and though for many years I had ſtrong inclinations to enter into the marriage ſtate, I now experienced a check to every deſire of the kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believing it was my duty to keep myſelf as much as poſſible from the cumbers of this world, and as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoldier to be ready for whatever my great Lord and maſter ſhould require of me.</p>
            <p>Near the cloſe of the year, 1793, I wrote to the Friends of the monthly meeting, to be admitted a member of ſociety; which Friends in due ſeaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their unity and compliance with: and here I would obſerve, that from my firſt acquaintance with Friends, I could not but approve their caution, in not haſtily admitting any into memberſhip; differing from moſt ſocieties, who, I have perceived, evince a kind of exulting eagerneſs in adding to their numbers. And I can ſay that I did not feel an anxiety to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036346_0020_10091C88EEBDA708"/>
into memberſhip; but rather to know that power which firſt gathered Friends into a ſociety; to experience an union of ſpirit with the faithful, than any name or outward relationſhip: and though a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before I wrote to the monthly meeting, I had ſome apprehenſion of being drawn for the militia, which would probably have expoſed me to ſome ſevere trial, not being of the ſociety; yet convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of bearing my teſtimony againſt wars and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I was mercifully enabled to be ſtill, and leave the event whatever it might be, to the Lord, who had hitherto ſupported me, and not apply for admiſſion any ſooner on that account.</p>
            <p>The firſt meeting for diſcipline I ſat in, I felt a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful concern to ſpeak on a particular ſubject, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my ſtate of childhood in the ſociety, and a fear leſt I ſhould appear forward, I endeavoured to get rid of it, and avoid ſpeaking; yet it ſeemed rather to increaſe than diminiſh, till juſt at the cloſe, I expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few ſentences, and found in a little time the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den relieved, at leaſt in a degree.</p>
            <p>I was often ſorrowfully concerned to obſerve in the nomination of Friends to quarterly and yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, a diſpoſition to make excuſes; believing thoſe meetings were eſtabliſhed under the influence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of divine wiſdom. I thought if there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per attention to the guidance of the ſame, Friends would be directed in their nomination; that the great Lord of the harveſt would chooſe whom he pleaſed to employ in any particular ſervice; and I thought there might be danger in lightly and haſtily making excuſes, leſt it ſhould be a diſobeying the call of the moſt High. It appeared to me, that worldly concerns had too much influence; that it was conſidered whether it would be convenient or not. Now I knew from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that if an ear was open to liſten to excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, enough would be preſented againſt many ſervices
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036346_0021_10091C8B68218388"/>
or duties, as attending week day meetings, and others, in times of buſineſs. But I ſaw or felt it was ſafeſt and beſt to have a ſingle eye, to have only one object in view, what the Lord required of me; than to look on temporal concerns, whether it was convenient or not, but ſimply give up and leave the conſequence; and I can with humble thankfulneſs and gratitude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the inconveniences or loſſes I might have apprehended would be the conſequence, were changed into a comfortable ſenſe of divine approbation, and an abundant reward of peace.</p>
            <p>The 28th of the 2d month, 1794, being appointed by government to be obſerved as a general faſt and humiliation before Almighty God, and the mayor of Reading ſending out a bill, deſiring all ſects and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to obſerve it as required: I felt a concern to write a few reaſons, &amp;c. why we, the religious ſociety call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Quakers, could not obſerve it as required; which were copied and handed about in manuſcript. One copy I ſent to the clerk of the pariſh, deſiring him to lay it before their miniſters, and as many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as might be.</p>
            <p>"A few reaſons why the religious Society called Quakers, cannot obſerve, as required, the day appointed for a general faſt and humiliation (ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) before Almighty God."</p>
            <p>"That the magiſtrates and people may know it is not from any contempt of authority, nor in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt government, but that they may preſerve a conſcience void of offence towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man;"</p>
            <p>"Firſt, Becauſe we believe that the Lord alone hath a right and authority to enact and require how and when he will be worſhipped. That all worſhip what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever performed in the will of man, and which the ſpirit of Chriſt doth not lead into, is not acceptable unto the Lord, who hath declared, that in vain do

they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men;" and that "the true worſhippers muſt worſhip in ſpirit and in truth." Therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it doth not belong to man to impoſe modes and forms of worſhip, and if, in compliance with the will of men, any ſhould conform to ſuch pretended worſhip, the conſcience not being clear, nor the heart rightly engaged in the ſervice, it would be hypocriſy in the ſight of God, and ſin to the perſon ſo comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:" for "whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin."</p>
            <p>"Secondly, Becauſe we believe, it is not the faſt which the Lord hath choſen, or will approve of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he hath declared by the prophet Iſaiah, and elſewhere, as for a man to afflict his ſoul for a day, and to bow down his head as a bulruſh. And our Lord called thoſe hypocrites, who deſired to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto men to faſt; and commanded his diſciples to anoint their head and waſh their face, that they might not appear unto men to faſt, but unto him who ſeeth in ſecret; who doth not look on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but upon the heart, and who requireth truth in the inward parts. And by the prophet he declared, that the faſt which he had choſen, was to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to feed the poor, clothe the naked, &amp;c. that then he would accept their prayers."</p>
            <p>"Thirdly, Becauſe it is required to implore the bleſſing of Almighty God for the ſucceſs of our arms, which we believe is repugnant to the ſpirit of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as Chriſt is the Prince of Peace, who did not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them; and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſciples not to reſiſt evil, but to love their enemies, and to do good to them that hate them. Therefore in obedience to theſe commands, through the influence and aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of Chriſt, we cannot willingly think or do evil to any, whatever they may intend to do unto us; but are enabled to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036346_0023_10091C8FBB1EB078"/>
commit ourſelves to divine protection, without the uſe of any carnal weapons, aſſuredly believing the Lord will preſerve all thoſe who faithfully confide in, and obey him."</p>
            <p>"For theſe reaſons, and not from obſtinacy, or perverſneſs, or any diſreſpect to thoſe in authority, we cannot keep our ſhops ſhut, or in any manner direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or indirectly, uphold or countenance ſuch a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom."</p>
            <p>It is believed by a remnant, who are ſecretly mourning for the abominations of the land, and travailing in ſpirit, that truth and righteouſneſs may abound, that there is great cauſe for faſting and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation before Almighty God; for the tranſgreſſions of the people are multiplied againſt him, ſo that there is reaſon to expect that the Lord will viſit with his rod even this highly favoured country; and it is their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret deſire that as the judgments of the Lord are in the earth, the inhabitants thereof may learn righteouſneſs. But, friends, your pretended humiliation for a day, with your lips confeſſing your ſins, and again return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your old courſe, is only mocking God, who will not hear, though you make many prayers, and cauſe your voice to be heard on high, while your hands are full of blood, while you are deſiring the deſtruction of your fellow creatures; for that ſpirit is not of God, for God is love, and whoever are led by the ſpirit of God, will love their fellow creatures, and not deſire their harm. Therefore, friends, conſider what ſpirit you are of, before you preſume to draw near to the moſt High, who is not to be honoured with the lips, while the heart is far from him, which it is and ever muſt be, while defiled with the pollution of ſin; but ſeek for that new heart and new ſpirit which God hath promiſed; and remember a language of old, to thoſe who pretend to honour him with their lips, while their hearts are far from him:
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036346_0024_10091C9233F8B3E8"/>
"Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; ceaſe to do evil learn to do well." Then (and not till then, though you make never ſo many prayers, and afflict youſelves never ſo much) the Lord will hear your prayers and regard your petitions."</p>
            <p>A few months after I alſo wrote a few reaſons why we could not illuminate our houſes on any occaſion; as friends, in ſome places, had ſuffered conſiderably on that account.</p>
            <p>"Whereas we the religious ſociety of people called Quakers, are accuſed by ſome of being diſaffected to government, becauſe we do not illuminate our houſes, as our neighbours do, on particular occaſions; this is for the information of any who may be deſirous of knowing why we thus differ: that it is not from any political motives, nor to expreſs any diſapprobation of thoſe who are in authority; but as Chriſtians, profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to walk in the fear of the Lord, in a holy life and converſation, we believe ſuch ſuperficial demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy inconſiſtent with this our profeſſion, on any occaſion whatever; but as it ſometimes happens that ſuch cuſtoms are in conſequence of a ſuppoſed advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage gained in war, we cannot believe as Chriſtians uninfluenced by any political conſiderations, that there can be any real cauſe of rejoicing, but rather of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the deſtruction of our fellow creatures, and to lament the prevalence of thoſe "luſts from whence," as the apoſtle ſays, "come wars and fightings." Profeſſing alſo to be followers of Chriſt, who is the Prince of Peace, of whoſe kingdom it was propheſied <q>that they ſhall beat their ſwords into plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks, that nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more,</q> we believe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this kingdom is eſtabliſhed in the heart of any individual, the warring, ſighting nature will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the peaceable righteous ſceptre of Chriſt;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036346_0025_10091C93DE6B75D8"/>
who enjoined his followers not to reſiſt evil, but to love even their enemies: therefore we cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubjecting ourſelves to the diſpleaſure of the moſt High, conform to any cuſtom, which countenances or upholds ſuch practices."</p>
            <p>"But though we differ from the reſt of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, we are not enemies to our country: but our prayers are to the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, that he <q>may pleaſe to break the bow, and ſnap the ſpear in ſunder, to cauſe wars to ceaſe to the ends of the earth;</q> that the people may turn every one from the evil of their ways, and ſerve him alone from whom every bleſſing is received: then would righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and peace meet together, and abound in the earth to his praiſe, and to our preſent and eternal felicity."</p>
            <p>I had for ſome months, at different times, as I apprehended the concern revive, wrote an addreſs to the profeſſors of religion, particularly thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the place I had left. Feeling a concern to have it printed, I waited from time to time to feel it clearly, as appearing in public in any manner of ſuch a nature, was to me a moſt weighty conſideration; I was fearful of moving in mine own will, but at length I apprehended the time come for its publicly appearing, and ſubmitted it to the inſpection of ſeveral Friends of our meeting, for their approbation of its being laid before the morning meeting in London; being unwilling to move without the full concurrence of Friends. It met with their approbation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and it was going to be ſent to London, when a member of that meeting happened to come to our town. Friends adviſed it to be ſhewn to him, who expreſſed a fear, that as I was ſo lately come among Friends, if it was not quite approved of, it might be a diſcouragement to me, and recommended if I was eaſy to let it reſt a little longer. I ſeemed willing to find an excuſe, and to get rid of the burden without
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036346_0026_10091C9651ACEED0"/>
its publicly appearing; and laid it by, not feeling the concern again revive with ſufficient power: but I had at times to fear whether I had not too haſtily got rid of it, and let the right time paſs by. May the great Maſter not impute rebellion to me, but have in this matter, as I have at other times experienced, a gracious condeſcending regard to my weakneſs; for I have deſired to be made willing to be completely given up to his ſervice, and follow him whereſoever and howſoever he may require; the frequent breathing of my ſpirit is, that the inward ear may be ſo opened that I may be able to diſtinguiſh between the Maſter's voice and every appearance of the adverſary, and all willings and runnings of the creature.</p>
            <p>In the year 1794, I was at the yearly meeting in London, which held, I think, nine days, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the nature of my buſineſs, I was made willing to give up the time, and have with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to acknowledge I found no loſs, but the invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reward of peace. Surely the Lord is not a hard maſter, but whatever is given up under a ſenſe of his requiring, is abundantly reſtored, yea as an hundred fold.</p>
            <p>A little time after being at an appointed meeting where no regular one is held, under an apprehenſion of duty, I ſpoke a few words. And here I would obſerve, I had long a ſenſe as though I ſhould have to appear in this ſervice, and often felt a word ariſe in meetings, but was fearful of moving in my own will, of running before I was ſent; remembering the command of old, <q>He that hath my word let him ſpeak my word faithfully; what is the chaff to the wheat?</q> I deſired that there might be no mixture, nothing of the creature, but that the maſter might prepare the offering wholly; yet I often found a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar teſtimony to what I felt ariſe, delivered by another friend. I would willingly have been excuſed the ſervice, the proſpect being far from pleaſant, at leaſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036346_0027_10091C99AFFDDF98"/>
to that which would prefer eaſe, yet I was deſirous that I might be willing and able to give up to whatever the maſter required; I ſeemed only to wiſh to know quite clearly, beyond the leaſt doubt, when and what to ſpeak. Perhaps I expected a clearer evidence than was meet, or made it an excuſe to refrain, till after one firſt day meeting, not giving up to ſpeak a word, I felt the reproofs of the moſt High ſo ſharply, till next meeting, that though very unwillingly, and after much inward wreſtling againſt it, I found it ſafeſt to give up, and was in a degree ſenſible, that it is better to appear as a fool unto men, than bear the indignation of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Some little time after I felt the concern of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little piece before mentioned revive with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed weight: and after a time I believed it my duty to ſend it up to the morning meeting of Friends in London, for then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

"As ye would that men ſhould do unto you," ſaid our Lord, "do ye even ſo unto them," for this "is the law and the prophets," Now I am much inclined to think, if thou wilt calmly and weightily conſider this matter, a deviation from this important injunction will appear.

            <p>What is a true Chriſtian?</p>
            <p>Is it one who aſſents to and believes certain facts, as recorded in holy writ, and forms certain principles and opinions thereupon; producing perhaps a partial reformation, an abſtaining from the groſſer pollutions of ſin, but denying the poſſibility of a total cleanſing and freedom from ſin in this world? Or is it one who knows not in word only, but in deed and in truth, a death unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036346_0033_10091CA8692D0BD0"/>
a being born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of man, but of God? "For," ſays our bleſſed Lord, "except a man be born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the kingdom of God." A man may know with Nicodemus, and confeſs, that Chriſt is a teacher ſent from God, he may be able to talk much about the doctrines of the goſpel, and fancy himſelf ſecure by imputation, but what has this to do with the new birth ſo eſſentially neceſſary? What can all his wiſdom and underſtanding teach him. Nay, he cannot come into the new birth till all is parted with. The very nature of the thing implies a beginning again, a life as different from his former as light from darkneſs. "Ye were ſometimes darkneſs," ſays Paul, "but now are ye light in the Lord." Now he who knows this new birth, not a change of opinion, not a comprehending the truths of the goſpel in his underſtanding, or joining this or that ſociety, but who knows the thing itſelf; not the name, not the imaginations concerning it, but the nature, the life, the eſſence; will ſuch a man be like what he was before?</p>
            <p>The forerunner of our Lord expresſly told his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when preparing them for the goſpel diſpenſation, "The axe is laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and caſt into the fire." What tree and what root is there meant? Is it outward or inward? Who can anſwer that, but he who hath felt the axe, and the deſtruction, in a meaſure of the corrupt tree? "His fan is in his hand, he adds, and he will thoroughly purge his floor;" (mark "thoroughly,") what will remain then? O! that profeſſors were concerned to know, and willing to part with all that ſtands in the way, that they may know indeed what it is to be thoroughly purged, inſtead of denying the poſſibility of it; for it is a dreadful thing to oppoſe or deny the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:036346_0034_10091CAA0CC50B00"/>Chriſt ſaid, "Bleſſed are the pure in heart;" but modern Chriſtians, as they would be thought, ſay, there is no purity of heart, but it is and muſt remain deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked? Again it is ſaid, "who brings a clean thing out of an unclean?" That the heart is naturally unclean is allowed, but hath not the Lord promiſed to cleanſe his people from all their uncleanneſs, mark all, what uncleanneſs will then remain? Some attempt to excuſe themſelves by what Paul once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced; "The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh; a law in the members warring againſt the law of the mind." That Paul once felt that is allowed, but did he not after ſay, "There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit;" and did he not ſay, "The law of the ſpirit of life had made him free from the law of ſin; and how could they who were dead unto ſin live any longer therein?" Doth he not again ſay, "I am dead with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, (not natural ſinful ſelf,) but Chriſt liveth in me?" "I will dwell in them and walk in them ſaith the Lord;" and will the Lord dwell in an unholy place? As ſoon would light dwell with darkneſs. Satan can indeed transform himſelf into an angel of light, yea, he, as God, ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. The imagining part in man is ſure to be deceived, and worſhip the appearance inſtead of the reality, for the world by wiſdom, man by his natural or humanly acquired abilities, knew not, nor ever can know God. "If any man, ſays Paul, will be wiſe, let him firſt become a fool," that his old eye may be cloſed, and the new eye, which alone can diſcern the things of God, may be opened.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt ſaith, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." But modern
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036346_0035_10091CAD8B5060A8"/>
Chriſtians, as they call themſelves, ſay there is no ſuch thing as perfection. O that they would conſider whom they oppoſe by ſo ſaying.</p>
            <p>Doth not Paul deſire thoſe he was writing to, to cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord; and pray that others may be perfect and complete in all the will of God? What does ſuch plain expreſs language mean? O the ſubtility of that ſerpent, who can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and argue the true meaning away; and O the lamentable eſtate of thoſe that are ſo deceived by him, who are ſitting down at eaſe, with the vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that what Chriſt hath done, as they ſuppoſe for them, will be ſufficient; without experiencing the work in them; who having eyes ſee not, and ears hear not, in the true ſpiritual ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt ſaith, "Swear not at all;" but modern Chriſtians ſay, We may ſwear in ſome caſes. We will reaſon about Chriſt's words, and judge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they mean; how far they are to be obeyed or not. Tho' James ſays, "Above all things, my brethren, ſwear not." Yet ye ſay, We may ſwear ſuch and ſuch oaths, O poor Chriſtendom, how is thy gold become dim!</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt ſaith, "Whoſoever he be of you that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple; but now Chriſtians can keep all; their own wiſdom, their own wills, the favour of the world, its riches and friendſhips, its faſhions and cuſtoms; though our Lord ſaith, "Whoever is the friend of the world, is the enemy of God;" and Paul ſays, "If I yet pleaſe them, I am not the ſervant of Chriſt."</p>

            <p>My mind hath been much exerciſed at times, ſince I ſeparated from your communion, with deſires for your real advancement in the ſpirit and power of that religion you make profeſſion of; and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded there are thoſe among you who do really deſire to know the truth, I feel a renewed concern to ſalute theſe, in a degree I hope, of true goſpel love; and to offer to your ſerious conſideration, the reaſons which induced me to ſeparate from your ſociety. And truly, friends, there were many ties, which nearly united me to you; and very unwilling I was for a conſiderable time, to believe that thoſe things I had been engaged in, and ſo highly eſteemed, were not what they had appeared to be; but, as I earneſtly deſired to know the truth, whatever it might coſt me, I felt the axe laid to the root of the tree, and the fine buildings and plauſible appearances were ſhaken. I became ſenſible, that the tree muſt firſt be made good, before the fruit could be good; a doctrine eſſentially different from what I had heard of men; even of men highly eſteemed; by whom I was taught, that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from ſin is not to be expected in this life; and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036346_0037_10091CB2981AAB68"/>
was hearing day after day, the uniform acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of 'being miſerable ſinners, having no health,' &amp;c. which I found, by the manifeſtations of that ſpirit which "is given to every man to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7, and which diſcovers the ſecret things of darkneſs, to be not agreeable, but contrary, to the ſcriptures of truth; which expreſsly declare, that the great Author of the goſpel diſpenſation "came to ſave his people <hi>from</hi> their ſins," Matt. i. 21, and <hi>not in them:</hi> a very eſſential difference. This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved muſt be experimentally known, feeling ſin to be the great diſeaſe of the ſoul, the alone cauſe of ſeparation from the Moſt High, in whom alone true happineſs is found. I was ſenſible that while ſin remained, the ſeparation muſt continue, there being "no communion between light and darkneſs, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs;" 2 Cor. vi. 14, nor could that gracious promiſe be fulfilled," I will dwell in them, and walk in them, I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people;" 2 Cor. vi. 16, for the apoſtle ſays, "ye are the temple of God, and the temple of God is holy." 1 Cor. iii. 17.</p>
            <p>Further, John the Baptiſt, who was ſent to prepare the way of the Lord, deſcribing the nature and effects of his maſter's kingdom, ſays, "Now (mark now) is the axe laid to the root of the tree; every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the fire." Mat. iii. 10. This is a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſurely implying a complete, effectual cleanſing from all the pollutions of ſin, even now in this life. Our Lord himſelf uniformly, in all his diſcourſes, inculcated this doctrine. In that moſt excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount, Matt. v. 6.7, he inſiſts on the neceſſity of a righteouſneſs ſuperior to that of the law; for ſays he, "except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven."
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036346_0038_10091CB65CDE1748"/>
What language can be plainer? And that he did not mean an imaginary, merely imputed righteouſneſs, as I fear, many vainly ſuppoſe, is evident from the concluſion; where he draws the compariſon between thoſe who hear, and do his ſayings, and them who hear, and do them not; thereby fully eſtabliſhing the poſſibility of doing them. And if due attention is paid to every part of that diſcourſe, I think it muſt be obvious, that they who are of the happy number, who not only hear, but do thoſe ſayings, and who our Lord likens to a building upon a rock, on which they are able to withſtand all oppoſition; will not be miſerable ſinners, doing what they ought not to do, having no health in them; &amp;c. but will know a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs wrought in them far ſuperior to that of the law. For, as the law, the outward law, written on tables of ſtone, took cognizance of outward actions; the law of Chriſt, written as the apoſtle ſays, in the fleſhly tables of the heart, reaches to the root, and ſource of action: for, whereas the law ſaid, "thou ſhalt not kill." Chriſt forbids being angry without cauſe. Again, the law ſaid, "Thou ſhalt not commit adultery; Chriſt forbids luſt, thus ſtriking at the root. The cauſe being removed, the conſequence or effect muſt unavoidably be done away. Once more, the law ſaid, "Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy; an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Chriſt ſays, "Reſiſt not evil, love your enemies, do good to them that hate you;" with much more of like import, which many who profeſs to follow him, ſeem to pay very little attention to; as though it was an indifferent matter, whether they do them or not. But it may be well for ſuch to conſider whether our Lord would have ſaid, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," if he did not mean they ſhould be ſo; and whether they who do as he there exhorts, will not be perfect. I
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036346_0039_10091CB7E0456210"/>
cannot conceive how it is poſſible to deduce any other inference without groſsly wreſting the ſcripture. "Ye are my friends," ſaid he, at another time, "if ye do whatſoever I have commanded you," John xv. 14. "He that loveth me keepeth my commandments," John xiv. 21. "Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, (that call me maſter and honour me with their lips), ſhall enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven," Matt. vii. 21. "If ye know theſe things happy are ye if he do them," John xiii. 17. For if the ſimple belief of Chriſt's ſufferings, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, &amp;c. be ſufficient to ſave; to what purpoſe was all his diſcourſes, wherein he repeatedly inſiſts upon the neceſſity of regeneration, a being born again; which certainly implies ſomething more than a change of opinion, a perſuaſion of the judgment, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reformation. For as he ſaid to Nicodemus, "That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit," John iii. 6. it obviouſly follows, that they who are really born of the ſpirit, will be of the ſame nature as the ſpirit. Old things will be paſſed away, and all things become new, and all of God. "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump," Luke xiii. 21. "New wine muſt be put into new bottles." Mark ii. 22; with many other ſimilitudes, plainly implying the neceſſity of a total, effectual change. Again to confirm this great and neceſſary truth, of freedom from ſin, he ſays to his diſciples, "if ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed, and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free," and, to reprove their carnal ideas of a temporal outward freedom, he adds, "He that committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin," and if the Son ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed," John viii. 31, &amp;c. That this freedom from ſin, even from the power, as well as the guilt, is to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036346_0040_10091CBA58A91088"/>
be known in this life, is certified again, by his ſaying of thoſe who die in their ſins, "Whither I go, ye cannot come," John viii. 21. Now if deliverance from ſin is not known in this life, we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity die in our ſins. Therefore it matters not what knowledge a man hath, what is his faith, or what profeſſion he hath made, if he hath not known deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from ſin. This is a point ſo important, and a miſtake therein liable to ſuch baneful conſequences, that I am induced to dwell upon it, knowing from my own experience, how prevailing is the contrary opinion. Nor is it ſtrange, that people ſhould prefer and indulge the notion of the poſſibility of deliverance from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, without the power thereof being ſubdued. We naturally love eaſe, an eaſe which the croſs of Chriſt is decidedly againſt. So cloſe does it apply, that it is, in our Lord's own words, as cutting off a right hand, and plucking out a right eye. Matt. vi. 29, 30. "Whoſoever," ſays he, again and again, "doth not bear his croſs, and come after me, cannot be my diſciple," Luke xiv. 27: The apoſtle bears teſtimony to this important truth, where he ſays, "They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh with its affections and luſts." Gal. v.xxiv. Surely if luſts and affections, the very root and ſeed of ſin, are ſlain, what can remain thereof? In another place he ſays, "How ſhall we, that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?" Rom. vi. 2. Another apoſtle ſays, Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God." 1 John iii. 9.</p>
            <p>I have produced a few plain paſſages of ſcripture, to ſhew the ground or cauſe of my ſeparation; that deliverance from ſin, a being cleanſed from all defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof in this life, is not only poſſible, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary; and that the contrary doctrine is fundamentally erroneous; as it ſets up the ſhadow
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036346_0041_10091CBBF98E0A10"/>
inſtead of the ſubſtance, an imaginary, inſtead of a real, holineſs. I may probably make ſome more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on this moſt important point, as I proceed. I ſhall now offer a few remarks on ſome of the ſervices uſually performed; comparing them alſo with the ſcriptures of truth, which moſt profeſſors acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be the ſtandard or rule; from which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon they clearly appear to me, not to be what many call them, 'means of grace and ordinances of God; but the mere inventions of man, ſet up in his own fallen wiſdom, as a ſubſtitute for the life and power, which were loſt in a long dark night of apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: not the true worſhip of God, but ſuch bodily exerciſe as the apoſtle ſays, "profiteth little, 1 Tim. iv. 8. For be it remembered, the great Author of the goſpel diſpenſation, expreſsly declared, "that the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth." John iv. 23. And the apoſtle confirms it, by ſaying, 'We know not what we ſhould pray for, as we ought; but the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, and maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Rom. vii. 26. Therefore, as this neceſſary aſſiſtance is not at our command, for people to pretend to worſhip the Moſt High in a preſcribed form, or in the ſtudied or extempore productions of their own natural or acquired abilities, in their own wills, and their own time, without waiting to feel the influences and movings of the Holy Spirit, in and through which alone true worſhip can be performed, appears to me nothing better, whatever it may be called, than <hi>will-worſhip.</hi> The ſcriptures alſo repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly mention a growing in grace, 2 Pet. iii. 18, a going on unto perfection, Heb. vi. 1. How incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence then is the repeated uniform acknowledgement, "We are miſerable ſinners, doing what we ought not to do, having no health in us," &amp;c? Doth it not obviouſly confeſs, if the truth is ſpoken, that no
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036346_0042_10091CBD86E4B988"/>
benefit hath been received, notwithſtanding the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent (as it is pretended) waiting upon the Lord? But if it is true, as the ſcriptures declare, that Chriſt came to 'ſave his people from their ſins;' they who make that confeſſion, acknowledge they are not of that number; for if they are miſerable ſinners, they certainly are not ſaved from their ſins, however they may attempt to reconcile ſo plain a contradiction. This is a language not confined to a particular part of the ſervice; the inconſiſtency of the whole appears equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obvious; as at one time confeſſing their ſins and wickedneſſes; then called upon to addreſs the moſt High, with pure, humble, penitent, and obedient hearts; one while returning thanks for creation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and redemption; again acknowledging having erred and ſtrayed like loſt ſheep, deſiring to ſhew forth his praiſe not only with their lips, but in their lives, by giving themſelves up to his ſervice, and walking before him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all their days; but ſtill miſerable ſinners, doing what they ought not to do, &amp;c. Can this running back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, one time ſaying one thing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time quite the contrary, be acceptable ſervice to that God, who ſearcheth the heart, trieth the reins, and requireth truth in the inward parts? Again, in repeating the experiences of the royal Pſalmiſt, how is it poſſible but many groſs falſehoods muſt be expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? For if the words of the mouth do not expreſs the real experimental language of the heart, however excellent they may be, yet they are to thoſe who utter them, not the language of truth but of falſehood. I ſhould hope a little ſerious conſideration will convince of this.</p>
            <p>Again, reſpecting the cuſtom or practice of ſinging, I have a few obſervations to make. How inconſiſtent it is, that they who have juſt before been confeſſing their miſery and wretchedneſs, ſhould appear ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036346_0043_10091CC1083038D0"/>
and eaſily to forget all, and begin ſinging. Surely it ſeems evidently to declare, they were not ſincere in their acknowledgements, or that they think it of very little conſequence whether their prayers are anſwered or not. Beſides, not only the manner to me appears abſurd and inconſiſtent, but the matter in many quite contrary to truth, and to what has been juſt before openly avowed. I could ſpecify many inſtances in every collection I have ſeen, but I wiſh people to ſearch for themſelves. Surely this is trifling with ſerious things. I am fully perſuaded that the common practice of ſinging is only calculated to amuſe the creature, to pleaſe the outward ear; whatever may be pretended of its warming the heart, and kindling devotion. And if thoſe who practiſe it would be honeſt and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, I am of opinion they would be conſtrained to acknowledge that <hi>amuſement</hi> is the chief object: or why ſo pleaſed with tunes and muſic? Can it for a moment be ſuppoſed, that the Almighty is to be pleaſed with ſuch ſuperficial conduct? Surely not. And with reſpect to its kindling devotion, it may be well to remember what is ſaid of thoſe, "who kindle a fire, and encompaſs themſelves about with ſparks; they may walk in the light thereof, but they ſhall lie down in ſorrow," Iſa. L. 11. I readily admit what is advanced to defend this cuſtom, that our Lord and his diſciples, the night before he ſuffered, ſang a hymn, but what or how we are not informed; no doubt the matter and manner were both proper and ſeaſonable; and that Paul and Silas, in priſon, "ſang praiſes to the Lord," I believe; but I cannot conceive what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can be deduced from thence for the preſent cuſtom of ſinging whatever may be given out, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or not, whether praiſe, profeſſion, acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or petition. I fully believe this outward inconſiderate ſinging is very different from that recommended by the apoſtle, "Singing with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036346_0044_10091CC471E15920"/>
and with the underſtanding. 1 Cor. xiv. 15. "Singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord," Eph. v. 19. And I alſo believe, that the true ſource of praiſe, even a grateful ſenſe of the Lord's mercies can be more conſiſtently expreſſed than in outward jingle and ſound.</p>
            <p>Indeed, my friends, I fear you are, many of you, agreeably to your own confeſſion, in a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Suffer me to prevail upon you to conſider, whether your continuing year after year miſerable ſinners, is not the conſequence of your prayers not being heard: and let a concern ariſe to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have been ſeeking aright or not: for our Lord promiſed plainly and expreſsly, "that they who ſeek ſhall find," Matt. vii. 5. Now, what have they found, who continue as they acknowledge, 'miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners having no health in them,' &amp;c? Do they not rather confeſs that the means they have uſed are inſufficient to cleanſe and heal them; that they have not rightly applied to the great phyſician, to the balm of Gilead, "to that tree, whoſe leaves are for the healing of the nations; but have been ſpending their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which ſatisfieth not; inſtead of hearkening diligently unto the Lord, and eating that which is good;" Iſa. lv. 2. that true bread of life, which our Lord ſaid, "he that eateth of this Bread ſhall live for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?" John vi. 58. It may be well to have recourſe to theſe means before the poſſibility of cure is denied; leſt they thereby deny the power of God, that he is not able to "caſt out the ſtrong man armed, who keepeth his palace and his goods in peace," Luke xi. 21. I think I need not add, who is there meant by the ſtrong man armed, where is his palace, and what are his goods. The apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, "who had a form of godlineſs but denied the power thereof." 2 Tim. iii. 5. Now, it may be well to conſider, in what
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036346_0045_10091CC6ECC476E8"/>
can the power of godlineſs be known, hut in domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over its adverſary, which is ſin. And do not they who deny the poſſibility of ſin's being ſubdued, deny the power of godlineſs? A ſerious conſideration may not be unprofitable. I have often admired, that thoſe who plead for ſin, pretend highly to value the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſay, 'the ſcriptures is the rule;' whereas the ſcriptures uniformly inſiſt upon the neceſſity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; not an imaginary holineſs, but a real purity of heart and of life. "Without holineſs," ſaid the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, "no man ſhall ſee the Lord," Heb, xii. 14. "Be ye holy in all manner of converſation, becauſe it is written, be ye holy for I am holy." 1 Pet. i. 15. "Preſent your bodies, (mark, your bodies) a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice." Rom. xii. 1. They talk much of the blood of Chriſt; it is a ſubject often in the mouth, but what of the nature and effects of it is known, let their own acknowledgements teſtify. The apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it cleanſeth from all ſin." 1 John i. vii. Now how thoſe who continue 'miſerable ſinners, doing what they ought not to do,' &amp;c. can be cleanſed from all ſin, let the conſiderate judge.</p>
            <p>It is with me now, to anſwer ſome objections to this important truth; and to remark on ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſcripture, which thoſe who deny the poſſibility of ſin being ſubdued, endeavour to cover themſelves with. Firſt, that 'The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?' Jer. xvii. 9. That the heart of every man, of every natural unregenerate man, is truly ſo, I firmly believe: but be it remembered that the Lord promiſed to give his people a new heart and a new ſpirit: Ezek. xxxvi. 26. And dare any one ſay, that heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and wicked? O, beware of depreciating the gift of God. "Bleſſed are the pure in heart, ſaith our Lord, for they ſhall ſee God." Matt. v. 8, "A
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036346_0046_10091CC990145158"/>
good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." Mark vii. 18. "The ſeed on the good ground are they who in an honeſt and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience." Luke viii. 15. For now, in the goſpel diſpenſation, the axe is laid to the root of the tree, Matt. iii. 10. What is the root of the tree there alluded to but the heart, from whence words and actions have their birth? "Thou blind Phariſee," ſaid Chriſt, cleanſe firſt that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the cup and the platter, that the outſide may be clean alſo "Matt. xxiii. 26. And do they not in the ſtated form, pray that God 'would cleanſe the thoughts of their hearts, by the inſpiration of his holy ſpirit;' a moſt excellent petition; but what is it in thoſe who uſe it, and yet deny the poſſibility of its being anſwered, but a ſolemn mockery? For if the thoughts of the heart are really cleanſed, there can be no ſin; for ſin defiles and pollutes the heart.</p>
            <p>Another objection, is the language of the apoſtle, where he ſpeaks of 'a law in his members warring againſt the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of ſin, and that in his fleſh dwelt no good thing," Rom. vii. That the apoſtle once was in that ſtate, I think, is beyond a doubt; and that every real Chriſtian experiences a ſimilar, till the ſtrong man armed is caſt out, and the old leaven purged away. But that he was ſo at the time of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to me appears by no means credible, from what he has written juſt before and after; or he muſt groſsly contradict himſelf, which will hardly be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? but rather that he was deſcribing the effects of the law upon the carnal unregenerate mind: for he ſays, "The law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal, ſold under ſin." Now can it be ſuppoſed that the apoſtle was then carnal? &amp;c. Surely not, For juſt after, he ſays, 'The carnal mind is enmity againſt God,' and 'to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036346_0047_10091CCCF1346F80"/>
minded is death,' chap. viii. 6.7. and that "they who are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;" but he adds, "Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if the ſpirit of God dwell in you; and if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his." It conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follows, that if the apoſtle was then in a carnal ſtate, he was none of Chriſt's, but at enmity againſt God. A little before, he ſays, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin: for he that is dead is freed from ſin," chap. vi. 6.7. And in the 2nd verſe "How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in." And in the 22nd verſe, "Being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life."</p>
            <p>Now let this plain language, both before and after, written no doubt at the ſame time, determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the apoſtle was then in a carnal unregenerate ſtate or not. And though he elſewhere ſays, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect;" Phil. iii. 10. I think it in no reſpect favours the conſtruction many put upon it, that the apoſtle was then in a ſinful ſtate; but rather makes againſt them, as it plainly condemns the notion, of being perfectly and for ever juſtified by mere imputation, and evinces the danger of ſitting down at eaſe, reſting ſatisfied with an imaginary juſtification. For in another place, ſpeaking of the Chriſtian progreſs, he ſays, though he did not run as uncertainly, or fight as one that beateth the air, yet he found it neceſſary to keep under his body and bring it into ſubjection, or there was a danger, notwithſtanding he had preached to others, of his being ſtill a caſt away, 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27. Another objection is, the ſame apoſtle ſays, "By grace ye are ſaved, through faith, and that not of yourſelves; it is the gift of God, not
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036346_0048_10091CCE73C24E20"/>
of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.' Eph. ii. 8.9. In anſwer to which, I believe it is very neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between the works of man, which he does in his own will and ſtrength, and thoſe works which are wrought of God. Perhaps it is not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing this diſtinction that people cry out againſt works, as though they were all ſelf-righteouſneſs. The works of man, of the unrenewed carnal mind, yea the beſt of them, are as filthy rags; but I think there ſhould be a great care not to join the works of God (thoſe which he worketh in his people) with man's own works; for in the next verſe the apoſtle ſays, "Ye are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them." That it is by grace, I believe, no real Chriſtian will deny, but will, with humble gratitude in all his progreſs, acknowledge with the apoſtle, "by the grace of God I am what I am," 1 Cor. xv, 10. This grace the ſame apoſtle declared, hath appeared to all men, (mark that, not to any particular part) and teaches, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent world. He does not ſay (it teaches) we muſt continue in ſin, "What," ſays he in another place, "ſhall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound, God forbid," Rom. vi. 1. That it is alſo through faith, who will deny? for "without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſed God," Heb. xi. 6. But the apoſtle ſpeaks of a dead faith, James ii. 17. of a faith the devils have, verſe 19. The true faith, he ſays, worketh by love, Gal. v. 6. purifieth the heart, Acts xv. 9. and overcometh the world, 1 John v. 4. Now what faith have thoſe, who ſay, they are 'tied and bound with the chain of their ſins, that they are miſerable ſinners having no health in them,' &amp;c. The tree is known by it fruit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:036346_0049_10091CD04819AB60"/>Again, the words of our Lord, when upon the earth in the days of his fleſh, to thoſe whom he had healed of their diſeaſes, are pleaded in excuſe for continuing in ſin, as "Thy faith hath ſaved thee, thy faith hath made thee whole, &amp;c. But be it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that thoſe to whom he ſaid ſo were completely cured, received 'perfect ſoundneſs;' and I believe, there is a remnant at this day, who witneſs the ſame works, ſpiritually accompliſhed by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful operation of the ſame word in the heart, even a being made whole, a being healed of the great diſeaſe of ſin, prefigured by the various cures performed on the bodies of the people.</p>
            <p>Once more, another argument adduced is where the apoſtle ſays, "If we ſay we have no ſin we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ourſelves and the truth is not in us," 1 John i. 8. But a due attention to what follows, I think will clearly explain, that the apoſtle does not favour the idea that he was then in that ſtate; for he adds, "if we ſay we have not ſinned," plainly alluding to time paſt, and continues, "if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs;" and as all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs is ſin, chap. v. 17. they who are cleanſed from all, ſurely can have none remaining. It is the ſincere deſire of my mind, that the people would conſider for themſelves, and not take things of ſuch importance upon truſt, but attend to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the apoſtle, "Let every man prove his own work, then ſhall he have rejoicing in himſelf, and not in another, for every man ſhall bear his own burden." Gal. vi. 4, 5. "Be not deceived," he adds juſt after, "God is not mocked; whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reap," whatever be his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, knowledge or faith. And in another place he ſays, though he had all knowledge, could underſtand all myſteries, though he had all faith, even to remove
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036346_0050_10091CD2C835DE20"/>
mountains, yet he might be as nothing, 1 Cor, xiii. 2. Therefore it might be well to have a care of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo highly of the ſcriptures, while the life and converſation is not agreeable thereto; and remember the words of our Lord to ſome of old, "Search the ſcriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which teſtify of me, and ye will not come unto me that ye might have life," John v. 39, 40. From which it appears, and is worthy of the moſt ſerious attention, that thoſe who had the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and valued them, as to think they had eternal life in them, yet they would not come unto Chriſt, of whom they teſtified; and "who was and is alone the life as well as the light of men," John i. 4. Therefore it may be well to take care of putting the letter, the teſtimony, the declaration, concerning an object, for the object itſelf; for our Lord did not ſay the ſcriptures is the way; but "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the Father but by me," John xiv. 6. And learn the difference between the letter, the outward word, and the word that was in the beginning, John i. 1. before the ſcriptures, "the word nigh in the mouth, and in the heart;" Rom. x. 8, "which is quick and powerful, ſharper than a two-edged ſword, dividing aſunder ſoul and ſpirit, joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, before whom all things are naked and open," Heb. iv. 12; and of whom, as I before obſerved, the ſcriptures teſtify; and without whoſe all-powerful aid they remain a dead letter, a ſealed book. The apoſtle declared, the things of God can only be known by the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. ii. 11. They are fooliſhneſs to the natural man. Therefore I think we ſhould be careful how we attempt to comprehend the truths, which are contained in the ſcriptures by our own underſtandings; but rather be willing, as the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036346_0051_10091CD6264A46D0"/>
apoſtle recommends, to become fools, that we may be truly wiſe, 1 Cor. iii. 18.</p>
            <p>I would now offer a few remarks on thoſe two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances or ceremonies, Baptiſm and the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as they are called.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the firſt, as practiſed by thoſe I more particularly addreſs myſelf to, little need be ſaid; as ſprinkling infants is not even an imitation of true baptiſm, has no relation to it whatever, nor do I believe there can be found a ſingle precept or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for it in any of the ſcriptures of truth. I am well perſuaded it is, like many other things of the kind, a mere popiſh invention, in the times of darkneſs and apoſtacy, as a ſubſtitute for the reality; not in any one reſpect calculated to anſwer any good purpoſe whatever. It may be well ſeriouſly to conſider a language uſed at that ceremony, "that this child is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Chriſt's church;" and in the catechiſm reſpecting it, that "he is therein made a member of Chriſt, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven." Now let every conſiderate perſon ſolemnly aſk him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether he really believes ſuch effects are really produced by it. If it is poſſible that any one can think ſo, his ideas of regeneration, and Chriſt's church alſo, differ very widely from mine.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered alſo, what people are taught to promiſe at this ceremony: To renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh; to keep God's holy will and commandments, and to walk in the ſame all the days of their lives." Are they not here required to promiſe what is believed and confeſſed to be impoſſible to perform? for ſurely if it was performed, they would not be "miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners, doing what they ought not to do," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:036346_0052_10091CD89B729898"/>That baptiſm is neceſſary, abſolutely neceſſary, for every member of Chriſt's church, I fully believe; but I believe, no application of water, even when rightly imitated, is the one true baptiſm. It is not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, which is all outward elementary water can do, but "the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and of fire," Mat. iii. 11, even a being baptiſed in the name, that is nature, of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; thereby experiencing the conſuming of the earthly part in themſelves, and a being cleanſed and purified from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord; for the apoſtle ſays, "As many as are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt," Gal, iii. 27. not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarily, but really; and being buried with him, by this ſpiritual baptiſm into death, even a death unto ſin: that "like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, ſo they alſo will walk in the newneſs of life," Rom. vi 4. And again, If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature, old things are paſſed away, all things become new, and all of God." 2 Cor. v. 17. and if all of God, there can be no ſin, for "ſin is of the devil, and not of God." 1 John iii. 8.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to that other ceremony, called the Lord's Supper, notwithſtanding I am ſenſible of the deep rooted prejudice in favour of it, I feel no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; under a belief that a glorious day is dawning, when clouds and ſhadows, ſigns and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, ſhall give place to reality, to the pure eſſential ſubſtance. I am perfectly ſatisfied in mine own mind reſpecting it, and will endeavour to give my reaſons, why I believe it is not of that conſequence or obligation many fix upon it.</p>
            <p>That our Lord, the night before he ſuffered, took bread and brake it, and gave to his diſciples, as alſo the cup, I believe; and that he ſaid, this do in
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036346_0053_10091CDA206507A0"/>
remembrance of me; but that he enjoined it to be an ordinance I cannot find. I preſume it will be allowed to be a part of the feaſt of the Jewiſh paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as our Lord ſaid, "With deſire, I have deſired to eat this paſſover with you, before I ſuffer," Luke xxii. 16. and which was a remarkable type or figure of Chriſt, who was the very Paſchal Lamb, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or antitype itſelf. That the bread and wine, as a part of the paſſover, repreſented the body and blood of Chriſt, to be broken and ſhed for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, I preſume will alſo be allowed. Now as there is certainly a very eſſential difference between the ſign and the thing ſignified, let us conſider a little, which is of moſt conſequence, or whether both are of obligation. I expect none to whom I addreſs myſelf will deny, that Chriſt was and is really the ſubſtance and antitype of every type and figure, under the Moſaic ceremonial diſpenſation. This then being one of thoſe figures repreſenting the death of Chriſt; the ſubſtance being come, the type fulfilled, what need of the ſhadow; why not give place, as others are acknowledged to do? The apoſtle, writing to ſome, remarks, "As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death, till he come." 1 Cor. xi. 26. But this I think, by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that it was an enjoined ordinance, but rather, that thoſe to whom he was writing, continued in the uſe or obſervance of the jewiſh paſſover. This I think, cannot appear improbable, when it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that for a time it was taught by ſome of the diſciples, that "it was needful to be circumciſed, and to keep the law of Moſes," Acts xv. 5. of courſe this among the reſt. Therefore it appears to me, that they, as yet, knew not, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt; that is, his ſpiritual appearance in their hearts; an inference which ſeems to be confirmed by what is recorded of ſome, who had been baptiſed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036346_0054_10091CDCEF2B0ED8"/>
with John's baptiſm, that is of water, yet had not ſo much as heard whether there were an Holy Ghoſt, Acts xix. 2. the promiſed mode of his coming again, John xvi. 7. Again, the apoſtle ſays, ſpeaking unto wiſe men, no doubt ſpiritually wiſe, "The cup of bleſſing we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt: The bread we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?" 1 Cor. x. 15.16. Can it be ſuppoſed that he here alludes to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bread and wine? for if he did, all who partake of that ceremony, let them be who they may, or what they may, have communion with Chriſt. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that would be joining light and darkneſs, Chriſt and Belial, righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs together, in direct oppoſition to the ſame apoſtle's plain decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the ſame people. 2 Cor. vi. xv. He ſays again, "Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils," 1 Cor. x. 20. Now it is very obvious, that any can partake of the outward bread and wine, therefore that cannot be the cup and table of the Lord. Again, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of the diſciples breaking bread from houſe to houſe, Acts ii. 24, I think by no means implies ſuch a ceremony, but rather a ſocial way of living among themſelves; as it is ſaid, they had all things common, verſe 44, and, from what immediately follows, "did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart," verſe 46, plainly alluding to their common meals. It is alſo I think, very obſervable, that when the apoſtles were aſſembled at Jeruſalem, to conſider what was neceſſary to be enjoined to the believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, this ceremony was not even mentioned: which had it been neceſſary, would ſure not have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, conſidering the things which were then enjoined; moſt of which have ſince been laid aſide, Acts xv. 20. But our Lord's own words appear to
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036346_0055_10091CDFCF2964B8"/>
me decidedly to diſcountenance the outward ſign; as where he emphatically calls himſelf the "Bread of Life." "That his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed, and that whoſoever ate and drank it had eternal life." John vi. 46, &amp;c. And to reprove their carnal ideas of outward eating and drinking, verſe 52, and to direct their minds to the ſpiritual alluſion, he adds, "What, and if you ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was before," verſe 62, how will ye eat him then? not in outward bread and wine, "it is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh (or outward food) profiteth nothing."</p>
            <p>I believe there are among thoſe whom I addreſs myſelf to, ſuch as are ſenſible of the neceſſity of this ſpiritual communion, and are truly deſirous to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thereof. Far be it from me to wound any of theſe. I do tenderly ſalute them, and feel a degree of unity with the leaſt appearance of the true ſeed of the kingdom: I would not hurt the leaſt plant of the Lord's own right hand planting. However ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle differences may appear, yet let me ſay to theſe in a ſpirit of love and unity, as this is acknowledged to be but a ſign or token, why is this continued, when others of equal authority and obligation are diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with? For inſtance, that of circumciſion, which our Lord ſubmitted to, Luke ii. 21; and which for a time, even after his aſcenſion, was enjoined by his diſciples, as I before quoted; Why this laid aſide? It may perhaps be anſwered, this ſign according to the apoſtle's definition of it, repreſented the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, Col. ii. 11. I fully believe it did, and as it is equally true, that bread and wine is alſo a ſign, there appears to me not a ſhadow of a reaſon, why the one ſhould be continued in preference to the other: the thing ſignified by both being of equal obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:036346_0056_10091CE364BDEA10"/>Again, it is worthy of obſervation, that the beloved diſciple John, in his relation, makes not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ceremony; but is very particular in giving an account of our Lord's waſhing his diſciples feet. Why is not this ceremony obſerved, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be more particularly enjoined than the other? For ſays Chriſt, "Ye call me Maſter, and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am; if I then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one another's feet, for I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done unto you," John xiii. 13. Now where can there be found ſo ſtrong an injunction for the other, that of bread and wine? If it is anſwered, that was a ſign or figure to teach hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and love to each other, which I readily admit it was, I think it is neceſſary to prove the other to be ſomewhat more than a ſign to ſupport its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in preference, which I expect will hardly be attempted. That it was not practiſed or obſerved as an ordinance by the apoſtles, I think evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from the whole tenor of their writings. Paul reproves ſome for being ſubject to ordinances. "Touch not, taſte not, handle not," ſays he, "which all are to periſh with the uſing." Col. ii. 20, and doth not outward bread and wine periſh with the uſing? The apoſtle well knew the true living bread was not of a periſhable nature. Again, he ſays, "Let no man judge you in meat and in drink, or in reſpect to the holy day, new moon, or the ſabbath, which" he adds, "are a ſhadow of things to come, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (the ſubſtance) is of Chriſt," verſe 16. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he ſays, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt." Rom. xiv. 17. And to ſome others he ſaid "I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you labour in vain;" becauſe after they had known God, had taſted ſomewhat of the ſubſtance,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036346_0057_10091CE535174F00"/>
they turned again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto they deſired again to be in bondage. Gal. iv. 9. "Ye obſerve days, and months, and times, and years," verſe 10, ſaid he, which he had declared to be but ſhadows of good things; and I fear the ſame language is too applicable to many, who make a very high profeſſion in this day.</p>
            <p>From what I have obſerved on this ſubject, I think to an unprejudiced mind, it muſt appear that the true ſupper of the Lord is an inward, ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. "Behold," ſays Chriſt, "I ſtand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me." Rev. iii. 20; and that the outward bread and wine, was nothing more than a part of the Jewiſh ceremonial diſpenſation; neither commanded to, nor practiſed generally by, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in the apoſtle's days. For, I would juſt add, if it is a neceſſary ordinance; if in other words, it is what by many it is aſſerted to be, the effects of it would be evident; for our Lord ſaid, "Whoſoever ate his fleſh and drank his blood, had eternal life." Now I preſume no one to whom I now addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will impute ſuch an effect to outward bread and wine; therefore it cannot be the Lord's ſupper. We no where read of two ſuppers. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſign and thing ſignified, the ſhadow and the ſubſtance, I believe many are in a degree ſenſible of; and as the ſubſtance, the reality is to be partaken of, yea abſolutely neceſſary; (for ſaid our Lord, "Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you;" John vi. 53.) and as I before obſerved, we read of but <hi>one</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord; ſurely it is of conſequence rightly to know which is indeed the true ſupper.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt but there are thoſe who in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and uprightneſs of heart continue in the uſe of the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036346_0058_10091CE7CC5808C0"/>
ſign; far be it from me to judge theſe. I have only a caution to give in love, that where theſe ſigns are regarded, it may be as to the Lord, and not unto men. See Rom. xiv. 6. I fully believe religion doth not conſiſt in obſerving, or not obſerving, outward ceremonies. For as the apoſtle ſays, "In Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; but a new creature;" Gal. vi. 15. It is not a name, a profeſſion, or any outward obſervance; but I am not without a fear that many regard them as to men, and are in bondage unto them, and ſo ſettled down at eaſe in them, that they will hardly hear the leaſt objection to them. Such perhaps muſt be left for a time: however, I have given ſome of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for abſenting myſelf from your communion, and why I believe the worſhip there performed, is <hi>not the worſhip which the Lord requireth;</hi> that it is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but contrary to the Scriptures; that it is not 'the means of grace, and ordinance of God,' but the invention and imagination of man; that it is wrong in principle and in practice; in <hi>principle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are taught you muſt not expect deliverance from ſin in this life, whereas the ſcriptures teſtify the contrary; in <hi>practice,</hi> becauſe you worſhip in your own wills, and teach for doctrines the commandments of men, which our Lord teſtified againſt; Mark vii. 7; yea, in an unregenerate ſtate, according to your own confeſſion, for a ſinner is not regenerate. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what I have heard among you, that your beſt ſervices are polluted, is ſtrictly true; for while you yourſelves are in the polluted ſtate, all your performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are polluted alſo. "For who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one," Job xiv. 4; but it may be well to remember, it ſtands an unchangeable truth, "That the ſacrifices of the wicked are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord," Prov. xxi. 27; and though we may amuſe ourſelves with the vain idea that all is
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036346_0059_10091CEC1785BA80"/>
well, I do aſſuredly believe, that to offer any accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrifice or ſervice, we muſt know, experimentally know, a being waſhed, ſanctified, and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God. 1 Cor. vi. 11. Therefore remember a language of old to ſome who had no health in them, but were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound from head to foot, as many confeſs they now are. "To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices?" Iſa. 1, 11. "Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is abomination to me, the new moons and ſabbaths, the calling of aſſemblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity even the ſolemn meeting. When you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes, yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear." ver. 13, 14. And conſider the exhortation to them, "Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes: ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well," &amp;c. ver. 16. Then it is added, "Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow: though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured with the ſword: for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it." ver. 18. Oh, how awful is this denunciation now fulfilling around us! It is the fervent breathing of my ſpirit, that this highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, much favoured nation, who have been calling abundantly upon the Lord with their mouths, and honouring him with their lips, may avert the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtroke, by truly humbling themſelves before him; and as his judgments are in the earth, may indeed learn righteouſneſs, Iſa. xxvi. 9.</p>
            <p>I know, friends, from a degree of experience, that there are many and various appearances, ſigns, and ſhadows, ſet up among profeſſing Chriſtians; ſome of which I have pointed out. I now wiſh to direct, according to the ability I am at preſent favoured with,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036346_0060_10091CED9B5C16E0"/>
to the reality or ſubſtance itſelf; and this ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſure which I had long in vain ſought for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, among the various appearances, I at laſt found to be within. I can anticipate the ſurpriſe, and perhaps the indignation, the word <hi>within</hi> may excite in ſome minds, who may be ready to exclaim, Can there be any good thing in man? Yes, friends, the ſovereign good, the only good, is to be found there; and I deſire your patient attention while I endeavour to remove that unjuſt, deluſive, yea too deſtructive idea, that nothing good is to be found in man. I believe it is the grand artifice, the moſt ſucceſsful inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the great adverſary of mankind, to divert the attention from <hi>that</hi> which is alone able effectually to deſtroy his kingdom or rule in the heart, and draw it to objects without, to ſimilitudes and appearances. (Myſtery Babylon.) This good then, though in man, is not of man, it is not natural to him; but a free, ſpontaneous, unmerited gift. This good is, with reverence be it ſpoken, even God himſelf; a truth, I believe of the utmoſt importance to be experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally known by every individual; and a truth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtified to in the ſacred writings; as the ground work, the ſubſtance, the foundation of real religion; a language alſo repeatedly expreſſed by the profeſſors of Chriſtianity; though the truth, the reality of it, appears ſo little known, as by many even to be denied. Do not you frequently read, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people," 2 Cor. vi. 16. "If a man love me," ſaid our Lord, "he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him," John xiv. 23. "The Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth," proceeding from the Father, ſaid he, "dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with you, and ſhall be in you," ver. 17. "Know ye not," ſaid the Apoſtle, "that Jeſus Chriſt is in
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036346_0061_10091CF02E4FF500"/>
you except ye be reprobates?" 2 Cor. xiii. 5, and that your bodies are the temples of the living God? 1 Cor. vi. 19. I could multiply quotations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to prove this great important truth, but am ſenſible that thoſe to whom I addreſs myſelf are well acquainted with the words. 'You are frequently reading, of "Chriſt within the hope of glory," Col, i. 27, under various ſimilitudes; but what is the reaſon, he is not known there? It is an important queſtion. What is the reaſon, I again repeat it, that Chriſt ſo often read of in the Scriptures as within, notwithſtanding ſo much talk and imaginations about him, is not known there in reality? I believe, friends, I can tell you the reaſon why he, the one great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is not known, where alone he is truly to be known. Becauſe he is not ſought for there; but in ſomething without, ſome appearance or repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, a knowledge gathered from men or books, from the hiſtory or outward letter, which, however highly it may be valued, I believe is merely notional. The real experimental knowledge is only known by his internal appearance, his ſecond coming, without ſin, unto ſalvation; Heb. ix. 28. and the operation and effects thereby produced. See Mal. iii. 3, "The kingdom of God," ſaid our Lord, "cometh not by obſervation:" man with all his wiſdom, is unable to comprehend it, neither ſhall they ſay, "Lo here is Chriſt, or lo there," not in any outward appearance, "for behold the kingdom of God is within you." Luke xvii. 20, 21. "Say not in thine heart," ſaid the apoſtle, "who ſhall aſcend into heaven that is to bring Chriſt down from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep, that is to bring Chriſt again from the dead:" He is not at a diſtance, but "the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, Rom. x. 6, 7, 8. Our Lord repreſented this great truth by various ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or ſimilitudes, to convey ſpiritual inſtruction to his
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036346_0062_10091CF1DE9F7658"/>
diſciples; as a treaſure hid in a field; Mat. xiii. 44, ſeed ſown in the ground; Mark iv. 26, a grain of muſtard ſeed; Mat. xiii. 31, a little leaven hid in meal; ver. 33. plainly alluding to this ineſtimable treaſure as hid in the heart, the earthly part of man. There were ſome of whom our Lord ſaid, having ears they heard not; they could not underſtand the ſpiritual meaning of his parables; but to ſome he ſaid, "Unto you it is given to know the myſteries of the kingdom of God." Mark iv. 11. Now, friends, it is of conſequence to know of which number we are, whether theſe are ſtill to us as parables, or whether we know <hi>that</hi> which unfolds their true meaning: "I am the light of the world;" ſaid Chriſt, "he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life." John viii. 12.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle ſays there is no communion between light and darkneſs. 2 Cor. vi. 14. If we have not light, we muſt of neceſſity be in darkneſs. There is a ſpiritual light, as well as a natural. This great apoſtle to the gentiles, declaring his commiſſion to preach the goſpel, ſaid it was to turn people from darkneſs to light, from the power of ſatan unto God. Acts xxvi. 18. Of what conſequence then is it to be acquainted with this light, by which alone we can diſcern between good and evil. "All things," ſaid the apoſtle" that are reproved, are made manifeſt by the light; for whatſoever doth make manifeſt is light." Eph. v. 13. That we may know what this light is the ſcriptures abundantly declare, John the Baptiſt was ſent to bear witneſs of this light, which is the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. John 1.8, 9. In him, i. e. Chriſt, was life, and the life was the light of men. ver. 4. This light ſhineth in darkneſs, even the dark heart of man; though the darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it not. ver. 5. This is the light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goſpel; therefore, friends, I caution you to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036346_0063_10091CF57157A338"/>
beware of calling it a natural light, or a new light as many have done. For I believe the ſame light, if attended to and its diſcoveries obeyed, will effect the ſame works ſpiritually in the heart, or inner man, as it formerly did on the bodies of the people. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe there is great danger of ſpeaking evil of the light, for whoever do, confeſs they are ſtrangers to it, and of courſe are walking in darkneſs, for there is but one true ſpiritual light. And "If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him and walk in darkneſs, <hi>we</hi> lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth us from all ſin." 1 John i. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Our Lord himſelf plainly declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that "Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved; but he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God." John. iii. 20, 21. Therefore it is not ſtrange that thoſe who plead for ſin, which is evil, ſhould ſpeak againſt this light, and call it a natural light; or any thing, to excuſe themſelves; becauſe it cannot but condemn them. Thoſe things which the light, if attended to, would manifeſt to be evil, are too dearly loved to be parted with, while they can perſuade themſelves they are ſecure in retaining them. I ſpeak from experience, and do earneſtly recommend a turning to this light within, from all the <hi>'Lo heres,'</hi> and <hi>'Lo theres;'</hi> the various appearances, ſigns, and ſhadows, ſet up by the will and wiſdom of men, in the times of darkneſs and apoſtacy; even to <hi>Chriſt within,</hi> the hope of glory, the true foundation, 1 Cor. iii. 11; the rock againſt which as it is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abode in, even the gates of hell ſhall not prevail, Mat. xvi. 18; nor all the oppoſition of men. This I believe is the ſubſtance of every ſhadow, the reality
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036346_0064_10091CF7E0EA4500"/>
of every appearance, the word nigh in the mouth and in the heart; the true anointing, which is truth and no lie, and which teacheth all things without need of man's teaching. 1 John ii. 27. This is the new covenant, graciouſly promiſed by the Moſt High. "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people; and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord." Jer. xxxi. 33.34.</p>
            <p>Behold ſaid our Lord, the kingdom of God is within you. Luke xvii. 21. The ſeed of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is ſown in the heart, though too ſmall for the eye of man's wiſdom to diſcover, though it is ſtill to the high profeſſing Jew a ſtumbling block, and to the worldly wiſe Greek fooliſhneſs; yet it is to thoſe who hear its call and obey it, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God. 1 Cor. i. 23, 24. This I believe is the new birth, without which our Lord declared no one even could ſee the kingdom of God. John iii. 3. The birth which is not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, John i. 13. For that which is born of the fleſh, however high and ſpecious its appearance, is ſtill fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mean and contemptible in the eye of man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is ſpirit. The goſpel is a ſpiritual diſpenſation. The ſpirit of truth inwardly manifeſted, our Lord promiſed ſhould guide into all truth. John xvi. 13. The apoſtles were not to leave Jeruſalem till they had received it, Acts i. 4, and then we are informed, "They ſpake as the ſpirit gave them utterance." Acts ii. 4. We have no reaſon to ſuppoſe they uſed any form of words, neither that they ſpake when or where they choſe; but we are frequently informed of their going or forbearing, as by the ſpirit they were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036346_0065_10091CF962CFA6D0"/>
Acts viii. 29. xix. 7, &amp;c. neither are we to ſuppoſe that this influence and direction of the ſpirit was conſined to any period of time; for, ſays our Lord, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Mat. xxviii. 20. What a departure from their example and precepts is lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conſpicuous among moſt profeſſing Chriſtians; who have invented various images, forms, and modes of worſhip, which they can perform when they pleaſe; evidently acknowledging that they think the influence and aſſiſtance of the ſpirit unneceſſary; at leaſt that they will begin at a venture, whether it may come or not! Surely it may be well to conſider, whether it is not offering ſtrange ſire before the Lord. Lev. x. 1. The only <hi>true worſhip</hi> under the goſpel diſpenſation, is, agreeably to our Lord's expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, <hi>that which is in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> John iv. 24, and as the influences and movings of the ſpirit, (although ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as that no acceptable worſhip can be performed without them) are not at our command; how proper, yea, how needful then, is an humble, ſilent, dependent waiting upon Him, who alone can adminiſter this aſſiſtance; that thereby the true preparation of the heart may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, to receive whatever He, who ſearcheth the heart, and who alone knoweth what is good for thoſe who wait upon him, may be pleaſed to adminiſter: whether immediately, by his ſtill ſmall voice in the ſecret of the heart; or inſtrumentally, by whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he may pleaſe to appoint!</p>
            <p>"They that wait upon the Lord," ſaid the Prophet, "ſhall renew their ſtrength." Iſa. xl. 31. It is the profeſſed object of moſt aſſemblies for religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>to wait upon the Lord.</hi> Now, whether thoſe who in ſolemn humble ſilence, wait to feel the influences of the ſpirit, to inſtruct and enable, when and what to offer, or what immediately to receive from the fountain of good, are ſuch as that promiſe applies to;
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036346_0066_10091CFC339903D0"/>
or thoſe who are always ready to begin, either in a preſcribed form, or in the exerciſe of their own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or acquired abilities, whether they may have the aſſiſtance ſo neceſſary or not; I think a little ſerious conſideration may determine. Indeed the plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs meaning of the term, <hi>Waiting,</hi> appears to me to be a ſilent, attentive expectation of ſomething; and if it is weightily conſidered, that, at ſuch times, we more particularly profeſs to approach the ſacred preſence of Him "who ſearcheth the heart, trieth the reins, and requireth truth in the inward parts;" who cannot poſſibly be deceived or amuſed by the moſt plauſible expreſſions or the moſt eloquent language; who has decidedly condemned the practice of drawing near to him with the mouth, and honouring him with the lips, whilſt the heart is far from him; Iſa. xxix. 13, ſurely it is needful at ſuch times to wait, ſilently wait, for the reception of ſpiritual power, leſt we ſhould be like thoſe who offer the ſacrifice of fools. Eccleſ. v. 1. "Let not thine heart," ſaid the wiſe man, "be haſty to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven and thou up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; therefore let thy words be few. ver. 2. "Without me," ſaid our bleſſed Lord, "ye can do nothing." John xv. 5. Yet the practice of many who profeſs to follow him, evidently declares that they think they can do without him, for they are, as to words and outward performances, always ready. The apoſtle plainly declared, that "we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but it is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that helpeth our infirmities." Rom. viii. 26. Then what are all the arts of compoſition, and the powers of human eloquence, without this aſſiſtance, but as "ſounding braſs or a tinkling cymbal?" "When ye pray," ſaid our Lord, "uſe not vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pititions as the heathen do; for they think they ſhall be heard, for their much ſpeaking:" Mat. vi. 7, a Language too applicable, I fear, not only to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036346_0067_10091CFF9CC518D8"/>
formal prayers, but to the more private extempore productions, as though prayer conſiſted in outward expreſſion; an idea repeatedly condemned in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle, after ſaying we know not what to pray for, adds, "The ſpirit itſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered," and Chriſt called them hypocrites who prayed to be ſeen of men; Matt. vi. 5, and directed his diſciples to pray in ſecret to the father; who ſeeth in ſecret. ver. 6. The apoſtle alſo recommends a praying always, with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance. Eph. vi 18. He does not recommend to begin ſinging as ſoon as they conclude a prayer. In another place, he exhorts to a "Continuing inſtant in prayer;" Rom. xii. 12. again, "Pray without ceaſing;" 1 Thes. v. 17 from all which I think it muſt appear that <hi>there may be true prayer without words, and that there may alſo be words without prayer.</hi> I believe there are thoſe poſſeſſed of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable abilities, a ready flow of words, and a pleaſing eloquent delivery, who can at any time when they pleaſe, deliver what I have heard called an excellent prayer; without waiting to feel that influence, which can alone enable to "pray with the ſpirit, and with true underſtanding;" but though ſuch exerciſes may produce a temporary warmth, both in ſpeaker and hearer, I believe, it will be found to be only a fire of their own kindling, a mere appearance, and not the effects of the live coal from the true altar. Iſa. vi. 6. The ſame obſervations are equally applicable to every other external performance of worſhip, public or private: for however it may affect the outward ear, yea, and kindle ſparks, as it were producing a temporary warmth; if it does not proceed from the immediate ſenſible movings of the ſpirit of truth, I much fear the appellation of will-worſhip is too applicable to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:036346_0068_10091D02110A3A78"/>I have alſo had a fear, that a language of old, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſome of whom it was ſaid, "They limited the Holy One of Iſrael," Pſa. lxxviii. 41. is applicable to moſt profeſſing religious ſocieties, where any particular man or ſet of men, aſſume to themſelves the excluſive right of teaching or preaching: a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice I believe totally repugnant to the goſpel diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the uniform example and precepts of Chriſt and his apoſtles. For I fully believe that <hi>no human authority, call, qualification, or ordination, can make a miniſter of Chriſt. That is the prerogative of Chriſt himſelf.</hi> It is abſolutely neceſſary that every individual Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhould be born of the ſpirit; John iii. 5. and ſurely it muſt alſo be neceſſary that the miniſters of Chriſt ſhould, in an eſpecial manner, be ſo too. Paul ſaid he was made an apoſtle, "Not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father." Gal. i. 1. And, as I before obſerved, the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the goſpel being a "diſpenſation of the ſpirit," the miniſters thereof are miniſters of the ſpirit, and not of the letter: not miniſters of the word only, though ſcripture words themſelves; but of the "word of eternal life," even of the "word which was in the beginning, which liveth and abideth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever." 1 Pet. i. 23. That word which is quick and powerful, diſcerning the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb. iv. 12. Words may have, and no doubt have, their ſervice, as the ſpirit brings to remembrance, and giveth utterance; but to ſteal the words of Scripture, ſee Jer. xxiii. 30, 31. and put them in a premeditated form, however eloquently they may be delivered, I believe is not preaching the goſpel. But I believe, that they who are particularly called, qualified, and ſent by Chriſt himſelf, as I believe every true miniſter is, will not preſume to preach or pray, when, where, or what they pleaſe; but as they are immediately moved and directed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, inwardly revealed; ſee Gal. i. 16.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036346_0069_10091D0393D73940"/>
who can alone know what is needful to be adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theſe as they freely receive, they will, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to our Lord's command, <hi>Freely give,</hi> Mat. x. 8. &amp;c. "without any view to temporal intereſt whatever. And as they are not their own, they cannot diſpoſe of their time or talents, according to their own wills; but as He who hath called them is pleaſed to direct.</p>
            <p>To conclude: the few obſervations I have now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, may perhaps, to unprejudiced minds, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to evince the inward ſpiritual nature of the goſpel diſpenſation; and that <hi>ſigns and figures, all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ceremonial performances, are totally aboliſhed from that worſhip, which can only be performed in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> John iv. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>They may alſo evince that the only neceſſary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for true worſhip, is the influence and direction of the ſpirit of truth inwardly revealed: that this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary aſſiſtance is not confined to time or place, nor to any particular man or ſet of men. For as the apoſtle declared, "The manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man, to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are no individuals arrived to the years of diſcretion, but who are favoured with a ſufficient por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, if properly attended to, to direct them into the paths of true judgment. The word even the word of eternal life, is nigh to all, nor need any look to men for inſtruction; but this ſame anointing, if the mind is ſimply and unreſervedly directed to it, teacheth all things and is truth. 1 John ii. 27. Who is there, who has not felt its ſecret reproofs for evil, and its approbation for good? To this true teacher, of whoſe all ſufficient aid I have thankfully to acknowledge a degree of experience, I do earneſtly recommend the particular, unwearied, faithful, attention of every individual.</p>
