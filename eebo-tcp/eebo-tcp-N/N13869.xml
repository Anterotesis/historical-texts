            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

among the true friends to their country.</p>
            <p>In further introducing what I intend to perform on this au≈øpicious day, let me hope to offend no one by reciting a part of tho≈øe orders which where addre≈ø≈øed to this army, and ≈øeem to accord well with the ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ju≈øt expre≈ø≈øed. The general orders which only a ≈øhort time preceded our ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations again≈øt the army commanded by earl Cornwallis, ≈øhew a virtuous dependence on heaven and ≈øay, "We have pro≈øpects, which, UNDER THE SMILES OF HEAVEN, promi≈øe to crown our toils with the mo≈øt brilliant ≈øucce≈øs."</p>
            <p>This was an honorable and public decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the influences of Almighty power were nece≈ø≈øary in order to give us a fair pro≈øpect of victory; this was an humble invocation of the divine favor: and heaven has ≈ømiled upon the exertions of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined forces, and "the Lord," in the ≈øtile of the text, "hath helped us."</p>
            <p>The ≈øacred penman of the hi≈øtory of the prophet Samuel informs us, that this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and illu≈øtrious per≈øon was, in a very remarkable manner, rai≈øed up to judge and govern the Jewi≈øh nation. He was the gift of God to reward the prayers of piety, and was by his parents early devoted to the ≈øervice of God and his country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017531_0005_0FA12769EF1D89E8"/>
But before I enter fully into a di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of the ≈øubject, we may take notice, that during a con≈øiderable length of time which preceded the government of Samuel, the Jewi≈øh nation had very much degenerated in their cu≈øtoms and manners. Vice and iniquity ≈øo abounded throughout the nation, that ≈øcarcely could the vi≈øion of truth, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or ju≈øtice be perceived either among prie≈øts or prophets, judges or people. The judgments of Heaven had collected and kindled over the heads of a people who, with very few exceptions, had for≈øak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their God, and united their ≈øins to draw down whole ≈øtores of puni≈øhment from the very hands of mercy and goodne≈øs. Let rulers and nations know their fate when they neglect or de≈øpi≈øe their God.</p>
            <p>In a word, the I≈øraelites were ≈øorely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed by the Phili≈øtines. They had been defeated in repeated battles; their young men, and judges, and armies were ≈ølain; the ark of God was taken, and "the glory had departed from I≈ørael." The hand of God was al≈øo immediately again≈øt them, to puni≈øh them for their ≈øins; and "he ≈ømote of the people fifty thou≈øand and three≈øcore and ten men. And the people lamented ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Who is able to ≈øtand before this Holy Lord God?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017531_0006_0FA1276AACE7CDC8"/>
At this time of univer≈øal calamity, Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ro≈øe up and judged the children of I≈ørael.</p>
            <p>"Prepare your hearts unto the Lord," ≈øaid the prophet, "and ≈øerve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øtines." By the prayers and interce≈ø≈øions of this man of God, and the penitent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the people unto the Lord, the aid of omnipotence was allied to their cau≈øe: "For when the Phili≈øtines drew near to battle again≈øt I≈ørael, the Lord thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great thunder on that day upon the Phili≈øtines, and di≈øcomfited them, and they were ≈ømitten before I≈ørael. And the men of I≈ørael went out of Mizpeh, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued the Phili≈øtines and ≈ømote them."</p>
            <p>"Then Samuel took a ≈øtone, and ≈øet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, ≈øaying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>I now beg your further attention, my dearly beloved hearers, while I attempt to illu≈øtrate the meaning of the words, which I have cho≈øen for the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions on this joyful day.</p>
            <p>"Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. By the≈øe words we are called to a devout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of our dependence on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and to a recollection of the many in≈øtances of help and relief with which he has conde≈øcended to ble≈øs us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017531_0007_0FA1276C6FC03A58"/>
"Then Samuel took a ≈øtone, and ≈øet it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer."</p>
            <p>This was intended to manife≈øt the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ≈øen≈øe they entertained of the merciful deliverance which God had granted them, and their earne≈øt de≈øire of perpetuating their prai≈øe and gratitude to nations then unborn. This part of the ≈øubject ≈øhall ≈øolicit our care and attention in the ≈øecond place.</p>
            <p>What I have in view, as we advance in the bu≈øine≈øs of this day, is, in the fir≈øt place, to illu≈øtrate that part of the text which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>Here, perhaps, it may be a≈øked, does this ≈øubject require any illu≈øtration before men of thought and reflection? Are not all men, it may be ≈øaid, per≈øuaded by the force of rea≈øon that the ≈øupreme being has ≈øupported and pre≈øerved them in every ≈øtage of life? But ≈øhall there be many found notwith≈øtanding this per≈øua≈øion, who have neglected to pay their dutiful homage to the mo≈øt merciful guardian and benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of mankind? If this be ≈øo, I ≈øhall not do wrong, when I endeavour to make my fellow-men ≈øen≈øibly feel their dependence on the creator as well as acknowledge this truth. I will then both wi≈øh and attempt to remind them, that they can be in no ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017531_0008_0FA1276CEE3D0558"/>
where the aid of the creator is not the exi≈øtence of the creature: That we may give weight to this ≈øentiment, let us view man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind when they fir≈øt awake into this world of toil and hazard. All the weakne≈ø≈øes and imperfections of infancy attend them. They are, in them≈øelves con≈øidered, mo≈øt deplorably helple≈øs. The very animals of the field may, with great propriety, laugh at this feeble creature man, and boa≈øt of their ≈øuperior ≈øtrength and independence. Nor is man helple≈øs only in this dawn of life. Even when he has reached the utmo≈øt ≈øtrength and wi≈ødom within the attainment of human nature; yet he mu≈øt ≈øtill confe≈øs that ≈øafety is not derived from him≈øelf. For it will ever be found that, we can neither fore≈øee nor overcome all the toils and dangers which await us in our pa≈ø≈øage through life.</p>
            <p>Every man mu≈øt therefore feel him≈øelf lonely and melancholy in this world, until he has confided in one who≈øe power can protect him, and who≈øe wi≈ødom can guide him into the plea≈øant paths of glory and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. This ≈øentiment ≈øeems to be born with us and not merely the effect of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the voice of nature and not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured acqui≈øition of philo≈øophy. It is a truth authorized and ≈øupported by the te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of much the greater part of mankind
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017531_0009_0FA1276DB015A1A0"/>
in all ages of the world. Were we to call for the opinion of tho≈øe nations, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the knowledge of the true God, and a≈øk the religious pages of their hi≈øtories; there we ≈øhould be informed that their greate≈øt ≈øupport and con≈øolation amid≈øt the common or extraordinary vici≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of life, were founded on the ≈øuppo≈øed goodne≈øs, wi≈ødom and power of tho≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to whom, in their unenlightened zeal, they attributed the government of the world and its numerous inhabitants. Let us a little farther follow the doctrine of our per≈øonal dependence on the ≈øupreme being. We will for a moment reflect on ≈øome of the circum≈øtances of our lives, and what ≈ømiling pro≈øpects of human felicity have pre≈øented them≈øelves before us. Upon recollecting their in≈øtability and painful delu≈øion we are con≈øtrained to ≈øay, that neither what immediately re≈øpects our≈øelves nor the affairs of the world are under our controul or direction. Is not every man able to ≈øay, that a thou≈øand di≈øappointments have attended him in the tran≈øactions of life, and all of them perhaps quite contrary to his mo≈øt lively hopes and expectations. What appeared perfectly ju≈øt and proper at one time, has neverthele≈øs afterwards a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed a very different a≈øpect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017531_0010_0FA1276E6D4E8A90"/>
We have ≈øeen the be≈øt human abilities and the olde≈øt experience fall under the weightie≈øt di≈øappointment. Schemes which were in appearance well calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce favorable events in the concerns of life, have neverthele≈øs proved abortive.</p>
            <p>Nor will it appear, upon examination, that nations or kingdoms have any ≈øtable foundation for their ≈øupport, independent of the Sovereign Governor of the univer≈øe. All their combined wi≈ødom and ≈øtrength are ≈øubject to the direction of that Omni≈øcience which perfectly comprehends every tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the councils of men. None of tho≈øe plans of operation, which are founded upon our imperfect knowledge of future events, and the ≈øcanty experience of pa≈øt ages, can, with any certainty, promi≈øe great ≈øucce≈øs. Of this truth the greater part of mankind have been very ≈øen≈øible; for they ≈øaw ≈øuch national events take place among them as were evidently of a magnitude too great to be accompli≈øhed by any human means. A conviction of this kind induced many nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which can be named, to begin all public bu≈øine≈øs of importance with public acts of wor≈øhip. We are al≈øo a≈ø≈øured, that they never declared war, nor undertook any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous enterpri≈øe, or entered the field of battle, without imploring the aid and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ≈øupernatural power. Influenced by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017531_0011_0FA1276F2DC19F80"/>
the≈øe religious ≈øentiments, their generals, and officers, and ≈øoldiers, have performed many things which were a≈øtoni≈øhing, and much above all that could, with rea≈øon, be expected from human ≈øtrength and ≈øagacity. In the ≈øupport of this declaration, I am rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furni≈øhed with the venerable authority of ancient hi≈øtorians and eminent ≈øtate≈ømen. They teach us, that the hope of divine aid was the noble≈øt incentive to valour and re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the field of war, and gained them the mo≈øt important victories. The courage of the ≈øoldiers was animated by piety, and their fears di≈øpelled by a firm reliance on heaven. And both ≈øacred and prophane authors inform us, that commanders of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have been attended by victory no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they thought an alliance with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was nece≈ø≈øary. Here I think we may, with advantage, recollect the conduct and vanity of a certain Grecian general: when among his companions, and recounting the victories which were gained under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he often a≈øcribed the ≈øucce≈øs of his army to his own good management and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and frequently ≈øaid, "and in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had no ≈øhare." Afterwards he never pro≈øpered in any thing which he undertook. The ≈øame in≈øtruction may be derived from the infamy and ruin of the Pharaohs, the Senacheribs and Herods of all ages. The≈øe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017531_0012_0FA1276FECC43480"/>
are the men who defy the powers of heaven and earth, and ≈øeem to challenge the utmo≈øt exertions of Omnipotence. They carry with them the marks of weakne≈øs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption, and are followed by ruin and confu≈øion. On the contrary, tho≈øe nations and commanders who placed the greate≈øt confidence in Almighty God, have been mo≈øt victorious and mo≈øt flouri≈øhing. This is a truth which cannot be ju≈øtly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this is a truth from which America ought to learn her happine≈øs as a nation. When a lively confidence in God ≈øprings from the ≈øource of a warm and enlightened heart, and this confidence is aided by our mo≈øt ≈økilful and mo≈øt vigorous exertions, then may we entertain a well grounded hope that we ≈øhall be ble≈ø≈øed with help from on high. This rational hope of divine aid will beget fortitude in danger, patience under hard≈øhips, chearfulne≈øs and plea≈øure in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øperity, and mode≈øty and mercy amid≈øt all the triumphs of victory. Hear what the ≈øacred ≈øcriptures ≈øay to tho≈øe who acknowledge the providence of God; who are obedient to his commands; who confide in his goodne≈øs and power; and who humbly a≈øk his aid and direction. "Then ≈øhall no man be able to ≈øtand before you: for he Lord your God ≈øhall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye ≈øhall tread upon."</p>

Therefore, a righteous people may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them≈øelves when they oppo≈øe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt enemies; and, while they adopt the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing language of the ≈øacred volume, may rejoice and ≈øay, "With them is an arm of fle≈øh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles."</p>
            <p>With the≈øe words I clo≈øe what I have thus far de≈øigned. They are able to ≈øupport my hone≈øt exertions in the cau≈øe of ju≈øtice and religion. I a≈øk their aid, and earne≈øtly wi≈øh our minds may be ever impre≈ø≈øed with a weighty ≈øen≈øe of our needed help from Almighty God.</p>
            <p>In the farther di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of my ≈øubject, I will recollect ≈øome of the pa≈øt mercies which have been extended to us by our gracious God. Suffer me to ≈øay, they are ≈øufficient to inforce on our minds both a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonal and national application of the words of the text; "Hitherto hath the Lord help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us."</p>
            <p>Who, that con≈øiders the weakne≈øs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and how much it is expo≈øed; who, that reflects on the journey of man through this world, or marks the various circum≈øtances which vi≈øibly attend his life: I ≈øay, in the mid≈øt of the≈øe ≈øober thoughts, who does not find him≈øelf con≈øtrained to give his grateful a≈ø≈øent to this declaration of one of the holy prophets: "It is of the

Lord's mercies that we are not con≈øumed, becau≈øe his compa≈ø≈øions fail not.?"</p>
            <p>Were it po≈ø≈øible to di≈øclo≈øe the hi≈øtories of our lives; could we rehear≈øe the hazards of infancy and childhood, and recount the toils and dangers which have kept pace with the increa≈øe of our years; or, to go yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were it in our power to enumerate not only the open and profe≈ø≈øed enemies of our lives and happine≈øs, but al≈øo to enter into the ≈øecret ambu≈øhments of our concealed foes, and to point out our narrow e≈øcape from evils again≈øt which we could not guard, methinks there would be very few pages in this hi≈øtory without a "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." It is ≈øaid, "In the mid≈øt of life we are in death;" and indeed death in a thou≈øand di≈ømal forms continually ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds us. His arrows fly thick at all times; and it can be owing only to the guardian≈øhip of heaven that they have not been aimed at us, and fa≈øtened in our vitals. Every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening we can only ≈øay, that we have lived, but are uncertain of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences of the next hour. But the≈øe are not all: how many thou≈øand precious gifts are we ble≈ø≈øed with from the hands of our bountiful benefactor? He gives us life, and all the ble≈ø≈øings of it. "In his hand is our breath, and are all our ways." Let each one of us ≈øay, then, in the inward gratitude of

our hearts, "Ble≈øs the Lord, O my ≈øoul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities: who healeth all thy di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes. Who redeemeth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction: who crowneth thee with loving kindne≈øs and tender mercies."</p>
            <p>But I correct my≈øelf. I check that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral zeal of gratitude which may another day be more indulged. I came not, my friends, to exhau≈øt your whole time by addre≈ø≈øing you on tho≈øe ≈øubjects of gratitude which have a common relation to the particular and per≈øonal ≈øituation of every one pre≈øent. This employment, however plea≈øing and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, mu≈øt ≈øubmit to claim only a future, though a more enlarged attention.</p>
            <p>The voice of authority among men, calls us to diffu≈øe a general joy and gratitude through our hearts, and the hearts of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ≈øons of freedom. Nay, the voice of God, in his providential goodne≈øs, demands our thankful homage for a national and mo≈øt ≈øignal ble≈ø≈øing; yes, and for repeated ble≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Let us then, whether under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ≈øpacious concave, or in the ≈øacred tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let us wor≈øhip the King of heaven and earth, and adore his mercy and power, which have given us the victory over our enemies.</p>
            <p>Could we give a general utterance to the united ≈øtates of America; could the voice of her annals and records be heard on this glad

day: or, were our pious ance≈øtors to appear before us to aid our prai≈øe and increa≈øe our devotions, they would all, with one harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious voice, unite with this a≈ø≈øembly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>Join then, friends and brethren of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica! join in heart and ≈øpirit, ye patriots and friends to po≈øterity, and form one general concert of prai≈øe to HIM who has aided us! Time and hi≈øtory, who point out to the world the ways of God, ye ≈øhall teach men that the Father of the oppre≈ø≈øed became the advocate of the inhabitants of this land! "He found them in a de≈øart land, and in the wa≈øte howling wilderne≈øs; he led them about, he in≈øtructed them, he kept them as the apple of his eye."</p>

            <p>But tyranny, which raged again≈øt this people in their infancy, again prepared ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and oppre≈ø≈øion for them: and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding our enemies enjoyed the fruits of our indu≈øtry and virtue, and grew great by the labour of tho≈øe they had exiled;

yet they became envious of the happine≈øs, and jealous of the flouri≈øhing ≈øtate of tho≈øe who were befriended only by their God. In the ≈øpirit and ≈øtyle of Egyptian tyranny, they call upon one another to unite in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures of cruelty and inju≈øtice. "Come on," ≈øay they, "let us deal wi≈øely with them, le≈øt they multiply. Therefore they did ≈øet over them ta≈økma≈øters, to afflict them with their burdens." Such was the conduct of Britain towards the inhabitants of this continent. But the Lord helped us, and their ≈øecret councils and ≈øchemes, the mo≈øt wi≈øely plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at lea≈øt in the eye of human wi≈ødom, were turned into fooli≈øhne≈øs.</p>
            <p>The Lord rai≈øed up wi≈øe and public ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited men, able to di≈øcern our rights and privileges, and willing to defend them. The Lord rai≈øed up warriors and ≈øtate≈ømen, and united their hearts and ≈øtrengthened their hands in the ≈øervice of their country. Our enemies were di≈øappointed; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpaired of ≈øucce≈øs, unle≈øs by their ≈øuperior ≈øtrength and ≈økill in the field of war.</p>
            <p>Mini≈øterial avarice, arrayed in rigorous acts and unju≈øt laws, ≈øuddenly changed into Briti≈øh vengeance; and then ho≈øtile armies advanced to enforce ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of death and the ≈øhedding of blood.</p>
            <p>Then was war in the gates. Was there a ≈øhield or a ≈øpear ≈øeen among forty thou≈øand

in America? But with joy, with prai≈øe we will ≈øay, "The battle is not to the ≈øtrong, nor the race to the ≈øwift. My heart is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tho≈øe that offered them≈øelves willingly among the people. Prai≈øe ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good.

            <p>Will any one blame me for hone≈øtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to kindle the warmth of this day's gratitude into a generous and perpetual flame; a flame which, like the refiner's fire, ≈øhall purify our hearts and con≈øciences from all evil, and con≈øume the dro≈øs of every ≈øinful practice and impure affection?</p>
            <p>Let, then, our gratitude be increa≈øed, by a recollection of the unexpected and a≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing union of the inhabitants and ≈øtates of America, in oppo≈øition to the u≈øurpation of Britain. We will call to mind ≈øome of tho≈øe gallant actions in which the a≈ø≈øi≈øting hand of heaven has appeared, and the wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and courage of our armies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpicuous.</p>

            <p>Begin we then with the nineteenth of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017531_0019_0FA12775EDBD2EC8"/>
April, memorable for the fir≈øt open and bloody a≈ø≈øault on the liberties of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Oh! Americans, forget not to tell your children, that liberty was on that day marked for the ≈ølaughter, and appointed to bleed on the altars of avarice and tyranny! Oh! ye parents, tell your young offspring, as they ri≈øe under your tender and in≈øtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive care, tell them, they were devoted to ≈ølavery! teach them what a heavy cur≈øe it is! let them know what mi≈øeries they have e≈øcaped! kindle their young minds to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and generous love of freedom; but let a dignified re≈øentment again≈øt every ≈øy≈øtem of ≈ølavery grow with their growth, and ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with their years. Let them hear of the cruelties of Britain; let them li≈øten to tho≈øe narratives of war and battles, till the name of Britain and ≈ølavery ≈øhall make the blood thrill in their veins; let them attend to the≈øe tales of horror, until a martial ≈øpirit ≈øhall mingle with their blood, and glow in their faces, in an a≈øpect daring and re≈øolute as the front of the Libyan lion.</p>
            <p>In the temples of that beneficent Being, who delighteth not in the mi≈øeries of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in his temples let the ≈øound of liberty be lifted up, as well as the ≈øeraphic voice of religion; let them give force, and influence, and happine≈øs to each other. Let the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent preacher teach his people to e≈øteem the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017531_0020_0FA12776AEEDC370"/>
ble≈ø≈øings of liberty, and to be religious and thankful; let him al≈øo require them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their freedom as one of the≈øe ble≈ø≈øings: but to con≈øider voluntary ≈ølavery as the mo≈øt dreadful cur≈øe that can be inflicted on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>But I return to con≈øider what has been done between the ever memorable 19th of April, 1775, and the joyful 19th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1781.</p>
            <p>Following the example of the holy ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and humbly aiming at what the judges, and the prophets, and the divine poets have done, fain would I bring into view every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable interpo≈øition of heaven, and, in the words of the grateful p≈øalmi≈øt, clo≈øe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry period of mercy and deliverance with "Prai≈øe the Lord, who hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever."</p>
            <p>Hear then, citizens and fellow ≈øoldiers, what was done on Bunker's hill: that place ≈øhall claim a ≈øplendid page in hi≈øtory, from that time, when virtuous citizens ≈øo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly oppo≈øed Briti≈øh troops, and humbled their proud contempt of the American arms.</p>
            <p>In Canada, though there the brave have fallen, have ≈øunk to re≈øt, yet in the early ≈øtage of this war, very important ≈øucce≈øs attended our arms: ≈øtrong fortre≈ø≈øes and Briti≈øh troops
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017531_0021_0FA1277770CFAE88"/>
were compelled to acknowledge the prowe≈øs of our forces.</p>
            <p>From thence, in imagination, let us pa≈øs to our army before Bo≈øton: there the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were forced to look for ≈øafety by the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of that place.</p>
            <p>That year the war was carried into the ≈øtate of New York: then did our enemies ha≈øten from the other ≈øide of the ocean to join their brethren, already engaged, to make ≈øo large a portion of mankind mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Number the enemy from Britain! number them from He≈ø≈øe! number their ≈øhips of war! De≈øcribe, if you can, all the awful engines of death and carnage! At this time, Oh, my brethren! who taught you to hope that you could be free and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? who pre≈øerved you from falling at the feet of Britain?</p>
            <p>But ≈øee the waters, though not, "like the Red ≈øea," divided into parts, yet favourable to us in a time of di≈øtre≈øs and danger. The very winds in the hand of God granted their aid to ≈øave our army. That night which bro't our troops from Long i≈øland to New York, ≈øhall be foremo≈øt in giving an example of the mo≈øt intere≈øting and fini≈øhed retreat from the mo≈øt imminent military ruin.</p>
            <p>That year Clinton and Parker felt the weight of American bravery; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and mi≈øerably ≈øhattered, were obliged
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017531_0022_0FA127782F190D78"/>
to relinqui≈øh their ≈øouthern expedition. This campaign wore away, and ≈øaw no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ≈øucce≈øs attend the numerous forces and the powerful fleet of the enemy; unle≈øs to murder a garri≈øon of brave men after they had capitulated, may be called extraordinary ≈øucce≈øs.</p>
            <p>Oh! ye fir≈øt fruits of American fortitude and per≈øeverance, let me, in imagination, drop the tear of love and compa≈ø≈øion over your honourable graves, if your iron hearted enemies gave you any! Ye martyrs for the cau≈øe of freedom, who≈øe ≈øteady ≈øouls could never bend even to a partial and momentary de≈øertion of your principles of virtue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fair promi≈øes of your enemies were able to allure you, nor the unutterable hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the mo≈øt execrable pri≈øons and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; not death in his ≈ølow and gha≈øtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; not the lingering death of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and torture could terrify you from your fixed attachment to your country! Oh! were it con≈øi≈øtent with the will of heaven, I would ≈øay, ari≈øe, and come from the dead, to behold a large army of your enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered! ari≈øe, and animate your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to fini≈øh the glorious work of liberty! ari≈øe, and lead on your brother ≈øoldiers to dreadful deeds of death and ≈ølaughter, until the ruthle≈øs hand of Britain ≈øhall no more di≈øturb the peace of men.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:017531_0023_0FA12778EE45FA50"/>
We will now pa≈øs on to a view of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican army. It was almo≈øt di≈øbanded; it was reduced to a ≈ømall number, and better fitted to draw forth pity and compa≈ø≈øion from the beholders, than to ≈øtrike them with terror; more able to ≈øhow their fortitude in adver≈øity, than to do execution with their arms! Why, O Cornwallis, did≈øt thou not ≈øeize the feeble warriors, and their per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering commander? Then who can ≈øay thy pre≈øent fate would not have been ≈øu≈øpended?</p>
            <p>Next go with me, I be≈øeech you, thro' one of the ≈øtorms and tempe≈øts of nature. Follow the march of a few naked men, or if they were clothed it was only with rags, expo≈øed to the rigors of December's cold. O liberty! by what charm, or what mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic power, did≈øt thou hold the≈øe ≈øuffering men firm in thy intere≈øt? But follow them to the capture of a large body of He≈ø≈øians at Trenton. From thence pa≈øs on with the troops to Princeton; and in your way learn the re≈øources and ≈øtratagems of war, and hear of the di≈øappointment and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the enemy. Princeton, that once peaceful abode of the mu≈øes, and ≈øeat of ≈øcience, then heard unu≈øual thunders, and ≈øaw Britons defeated and ≈ølain. Then the dying lamp of liberty was kindled anew! Thou≈øands of heroes flew to the ≈øtandards
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017531_0024_0FA12779AE93FEF8"/>
of freedom, and thought ≈øhe could be ≈øtill defended.</p>
            <p>An American army again took the field, and the enemy found they had the war to begin anew.</p>
            <p>Near the clo≈øe of this year, the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, "who had not given us as a prey to their teeth," remarkably helped us, and gave Burgoyne and all his army into the hands of the United States.</p>
            <p>Let a recollection of the mercies of the next year begin with a declaration of the alliance of America with the magnanimous Lewis XVI. The illu≈øtrious hero, and friend to the rights of mankind, heard the fame of our cau≈øe, and joined the intere≈øt of his kingdom to the ≈øupport of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and has ≈øpared neither blood nor wealth to e≈øtabli≈øh us in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of our freedom.</p>
            <p>From this ≈øubject, let the operations of our army, numerous and gallant, demand our attention. Con≈øider their formidable movements to the fields of Monmouth. There, my fellow ≈øoldiers, you remember the fortune of the day was torn from the hands of the victorious enemy, and the flower of their army. Methinks I ≈øhall not do ami≈øs, by leaving you to apply the words, of the poet, where they were de≈øerved on that day:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:017531_0025_0FA1277BC4D55DA0"/>
"To fainting ≈øquadrons ≈øent the timely aid, In≈øpir'd repuls'd battalions to engage, And taught the doubtful battle where to rage."</p>
            <p>From the battle of Monmouth, and the various operations of the army within the fourth year of this war, we pa≈øs on to the ≈øucceeding campaign. No ≈ømall ≈øucce≈øs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured our arms that year. Paulus-Hook and Stoney-Point taught our enemies that their ≈øtrong fortre≈ø≈øes were not impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the intrepid re≈øolution and the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a≈ø≈øaults of the American forces. In the ≈øame year an important expedition was directed again≈øt the five nations of ho≈øtile indians. That expedition, though attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with immen≈øe toil and difficulty, and rendered exceedingly precarious by a great number of hazardous circum≈øtances, a few of which, in their operations, could have de≈øtroyed the troops on that ≈øervice: That expedition was not without ≈øucce≈øs; and what men could perform, was done.</p>
            <p>But I ha≈øten to the ≈øixth campaign, and remind you of what happened on the 25th of September in the year pa≈øt. That day ≈øhould have a place in the calendars of all ages, to inform mankind what human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can attempt. Then were di≈øclo≈øed, as it were, the ≈øecret plots of hell; and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017531_0026_0FA1277C10685910"/>
too big to be any longer confined, bur≈øt from its concealment. Let that day be numbered among the days of mercy; let it con≈øtitute an annual fe≈øtival of grateful joy; and let liberty and the glad angels of America, hover round the a≈ø≈øembled ≈øons of freedom, and in≈øpire them with a love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honor, and a la≈øting remembrance of the goodne≈øs of God, who with ≈øcarcely any human means, and by very little human ≈øaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, di≈øcovered trea≈øonable plots when they were upon the very point of execution. Then did the Almighty ≈øave the commander of our armies, and the mo≈øt important fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øs and a part of our troops, from the very jaws of trea≈øon and our enemies. On this ≈øubject, I know you will anticipate me, and think ≈øooner than I can ≈øay, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." How wonderful and my≈øterious the ju≈øt and merciful ways of heaven." We have been ≈øuffered to ≈øtand upon the very precipice of ruin, before we were delivered from our danger. This, we ought to believe, was mercifully intended to teach us our dependence upon him, who alone can make a nation flouri≈øh; this was to make us grateful, that we might be happy. But how many ≈øubjects of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude have I omitted! How many which I cannot bring into view on this day! The grateful heart will recollect more than I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017531_0027_0FA1277CAD9EB218"/>
can utter. How various have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts between us and the enemy, ≈øuperior to us in ≈øtrength or numbers in almo≈øt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in≈øtance? But though in various places ≈øucce≈øs has not attended us; yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øts of the enemy have been few, and of ≈øhort duration. Nay, the very victories they have boa≈øted of, only ha≈øtened their ruin. For the confirmation of this truth, let us bring examples from the ≈øouthern part of the continent. We will admire the enterprizing and per≈øevering ≈øpirit of our ≈øouthern army, who in the mid≈øt of the enemy's victories have de≈øtroyed their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. North and South Carolina ≈øhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the military ≈øagacity and intrepidity of general Green, and his faithful band of worthies. Tho≈øe ≈øtates ≈øhall repeat the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories which have been gained by that army; they ≈øhall remember how many fortre≈ø≈øes have been wre≈øted out of the hands of an in≈øulting enemy, vainly elated with their vi≈øionary ≈øucce≈øs. The late important vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obtained by the troops under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of general Green, ≈øhall aid the joy and prai≈øe of this day, and increa≈øe our gratitude.</p>
            <p>But here let me pau≈øe a moment. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps upon reflection I may find rea≈øon to ≈øay, that I have aimed at more than can be performed in the ≈øhort time that is allotted
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017531_0028_0FA1277D6EBC7270"/>
to the public wor≈øhip of this day. Pardon me then, my dearly beloved brethren, if I have detained you too long from what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the more immediate intention of this a≈ø≈øembly. I imagined my text meant more than to acknowledge only one victory, or one in≈øtance of the goodne≈øs of God, however great the ble≈ø≈øing might be. When our hearts are truly grateful, they are al≈øo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and enlarged. We wi≈øh to know how much heaven has be≈øtowed upon us, and how much the debts of gratitude are accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and even when we find that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation will ri≈øe infinitely above our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to make any equal compen≈øation; and that every new mercy will render us more eternally in≈øolvent; yet ≈øtill the grateful ≈øoul is mo≈øt delighted, when the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the mercy and goodne≈øs of God is mo≈øt exten≈øive; and mu≈øt, after all we can ≈øay or do, end with this pathetic and thankful enquiry, which it will not be ea≈øy to an≈øwer, "What ≈øhall I render unto the Lord, for all his benefits towards me?"</p>
            <p>This ≈øhall prepare our hearts for a new ≈øubject of gratitude. We will now enter upon the plea≈øing employment of impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing our minds with a plea≈øing remembrance of the la≈øt national ble≈ø≈øing, which heaven has vouch≈øafed unto us.</p>

Shall I not venture to ≈øay, that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition which depended, in the fir≈øt plan of it, upon forces ≈øo much disjoined, and events ≈øo precarious, was ever ble≈ø≈øed with a more ≈øea≈øonable and harmonious junction of pro≈øperous circum≈øtances, or ended with more ≈øub≈øtantial glory and complete ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs. The fir≈øt tran≈øient view of that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ≈øeems to impo≈øe upon us the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumptuous notion of having in our hands the command of the winds and the waves, the rains and the tempe≈øts, any of which, under the orders of heaven, would have rendered our plans of operation altogether ineffectual.</p>
            <p>O Clinton! did your tory ≈øpies, tho≈øe evil geniu≈øes of America, who are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in "going to and fro in the earth, ≈øeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom they may devour;" did they fail to announce to you the early de≈øtination of the combined army? Alas! was there no friend to Britain able to inform Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis of his approaching danger? To us this is a happy con≈øideration, it is a mark of military ≈økill. Secre≈øy! thou life and ≈øoul of every warlike enterpri≈øe, ever deign to envelop the de≈øigns of our army in a cloud, which, as of old, ≈øhall be darkne≈øs to the enemy, but, like a pillar of fire, ≈øhall give light to the children of America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:017531_0030_0FA1277EEDFC1070"/>
But I come to ob≈øerve, that from the time our army was ordered on the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Virginia, until the day on which the enemy ≈øurrendered, ≈øcarcely any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances attended the allied forces which could be deemed unfavourable. The cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs and patience of the troops under the fatigue of long and rapid marches; the ≈øpirit of enterpri≈øe; the willingne≈øs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure labours and hard≈øhips of every kind, in order to promote the ≈øervice of this country, and ≈øubdue the enemy; the≈øe were all favourable omens, and are worthy of our attention and regard. The critical and ≈øea≈øonable arrival of the fleet under the command of his excellency the count de Gra≈ø≈øe; and this before the enemy entered the Che≈øapeak, and by their prior po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the bay made the junction of our army and the French fleet very difficult, if not altogether impracticable. But the ≈øituation of the fleet under count de Barras, yet at ≈øea, was very critical and dangerous. The enemy appeared at the entrance of the Che≈øapeak to intercept his arrival. This was the time for the count de Gra≈ø≈øe to di≈øplay his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to prove how much can be done by a ≈øea≈øonable, well directed, and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attack. By a mo≈øt gallant manoeuvre, he defeated the enemy, de≈øtroyed ≈øome of their men of war, and drove the re≈øt in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017531_0031_0FA1277FAE8E80B8"/>
flight far to ≈øea. By this happy victory, a junction of the two French fleets was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed, and under the divine au≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, future ≈øucce≈øs was in≈øured to our united forces.</p>
            <p>I will next ≈øpeak of that harmony, that emulation, and that equal love of danger which ≈øub≈øi≈øted among the allied troops; as if the ≈øame generous fire of true glory glowed in their bo≈øoms, or one patriot ≈øoul animated them to the cheerful performance of every military duty, and to encounter every danger. Witne≈øs the emulation of tho≈øe French and American troops, who at the ≈øame time entered the trenches of the enemy, and with equal intrepidity and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of attack, ≈øtormed ≈øome of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts.</p>
            <p>That only a few of our troops have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in the reduction of the enemy, is a plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing con≈øideration, and ≈øhould contribute to make us thankful. The favourablene≈øs of the ≈øea≈øon ≈øhall be remembered, and‚ÄîBut ≈øhort be my narration of this glorious victory, for ≈øhort were the operations of the ≈øiege. A ≈øtrong and numerous army of our enemy have ≈øurrendered them≈øelves pri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of war: and this ≈øignal in≈øtance of the goodne≈øs of divine providence, demands a repetition of tho≈øe words which you have
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017531_0032_0FA1278179FA29C0"/>
already often heard; "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>O Virginia! highly favoured of the Lord, rejoice and be glad, for the ≈øpoiler is taken captive! Turn your fears and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations into grateful ≈øongs of prai≈øe, and forget not to love and adore that Almighty Being who ≈øays to the rage and cruelty of men, "Hitherto ≈øhalt thou go, and no farther."</p>
            <p>O! all ye inhabitants of the united ≈øtates, let your thankfulne≈øs appear by the piety of your hearts, and the purity of your lives. Every new in≈øtance of the goodne≈øs of the Creator, calls upon us to give new ≈øigns of our love and obedience to him. We ≈øhould endeavour to ≈øhew our≈øelves as worthy of the mercies of God, as human nature is capable, by being more virtuous, more dutiful, and more benevolent.</p>
            <p>What will all the mo≈øt pompous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of gratitude avail, if the manners and cu≈øtoms of our country are not pure; or the vices not reformed? Believe it, my friends, a ≈øinful people cannot be a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people! For be a≈ø≈øured that a people who cannot be moved by the mercy, and goodne≈øs of God to do what is their duty, and to examine by what means they may plea≈øe their Maker and bountiful Benefactor, are truly unworthy of his mercy and protection:
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017531_0033_0FA12781F05DE5A0"/>
Nay, every part of their conduct which is vicious, ≈øeems very loudly to declare, that they are weary of the very goodne≈øs of God, and all the ble≈ø≈øings of heaven.</p>
            <p>Having now fini≈øhed what I propo≈øed in the fir≈øt grand divi≈øion of my di≈øcour≈øe, I proceed to what I ≈øaid ≈øhould ≈øolicit our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the ≈øecond place.</p>
            <p>"Then Samuel took a ≈øtone, and ≈øet it between Mizpeh and Shen." I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, that by this monumental ≈øtone, the children of I≈ørael intended, not only to expre≈øs their pre≈øent gratitude, for favours conferred upon them by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but al≈øo to perpetuate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a very extraordinary mercy, to nations long after to be born. That this was the manner of perpetuating the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ≈øignal ≈øucce≈øs, or extraordinary events, is made evident by the te≈øtimony of every ancient hi≈øtorian, whether ≈øacred or prophane. This cu≈øtom, however, has not been altogether confined to the ancients. Many are the pillars and monuments which ≈øtand, this day, as witne≈ø≈øes of great ≈øucce≈øs or of illu≈øtrious merit: and America is not without her monuments of great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, who have generou≈øly ≈øhed their blood in the defence of their country. I therefore think it not difficult to ≈øhew that public and la≈øting ≈øigns of prai≈øe to God,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017531_0034_0FA12782AFB6D418"/>
as well as marks of re≈øpect for worthy men, have been authori≈øed by the examples of all nations. Let then the enemy to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let the enemy to his country; nay, let the vicious infidel, and the debauched libertine, let them all cea≈øe to ≈øtigmati≈øe public and devout homage to almighty God with the name of unnece≈ø≈øary and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table parade. If they will neither hear the voice of rea≈øon, nor hearken to the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and charming in≈øtructions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired writings; let them, however, be taught ≈øome reverence for the Deity even from the cu≈øtoms of heathens and pagans, where nature ≈øpoke, in part, what nature's God hath ≈øhewed to all his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let them a≈øk what meant tho≈øe co≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øacrifices of whole hecatombs; what meant tho≈øe large and expen≈øive libations; and what meant tho≈øe ≈øolemn proce≈ø≈øions to the temples of devotion? Were not all the≈øe things expre≈ø≈øions of gratitude for the mercies they had received? However, not to ≈øay all that can be offered, on this ≈øubject, from the cu≈øtoms of poli≈øhed nations; I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive examples of this mo≈øt rational duty, from the very original inhabitants of this continent. I can avail my≈øelf of their cu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms to plead for tho≈øe ≈øigns and expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gratitude, which are due to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Di≈øpo≈øer of all events.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:017531_0035_0FA127836E0EE8A8"/>
But we may be more happy than they, we are more enlightened in the knowledge and ≈øervice of the ble≈ø≈øed and good God. Our gratitude ≈øhould be more pure and more ≈øpiritual than theirs. We are in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he delighteth more in the humble and thankful heart, than in the mo≈øt co≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øacrifices. In≈øtead then of erecting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, as of old was done, for offerings to a≈øcend in co≈øtly incen≈øe, to repre≈øent our gratitude and prai≈øe; let pure and virtuous hearts be the altars, and love and obedience be the incen≈øe, which ≈øhall better plea≈øe the Deity. Gratitude ≈øhall be written on our hearts; for this al≈øo will be more plea≈øing to our Divine Benefactor, than all the pomp of prai≈øe which ever was in≈øcribed, in the large≈øt characters, on the towering pyramid, or the ≈øolemn temple.</p>
            <p>O ble≈ø≈øed day this, which calls us to the plea≈øing duty of prai≈øing God for ≈øo many mercies conferred upon us! O happy day, who≈øe ≈øun ri≈øes not to compa≈ø≈øionate us in ≈øome deplorable exilement from our habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or more mi≈øerable flight from our victorious enemies! Happy ≈øun, that ri≈øes not to light us by his ≈øickly beams to ≈øome dire and lonely retreat; but bright ≈øhines this day, to ≈øhew the ble≈ø≈øings of heaven and the triumphs of victory! Let us collect all the generous efforts of our ≈øouls, to form
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017531_0036_0FA127842EF13A28"/>
one humble and grateful offering, and let it be laid on the public altar of our united and open acknowledgement of the goodne≈øs of HIM who hath helped us! In the language of the P≈øalmi≈øt, I will ≈øay, "Ble≈øs the Lord, O my ≈øoul; and all that is within me, ble≈øs his holy name, and forget not all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits." O ju≈øt and ble≈ø≈øed God, has it plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to check the ≈øword of the de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; yes, and in a great mea≈øure to wre≈øt it out of the hands of the oppre≈ø≈øor and the tyrant! Methinks if men uttered no ≈øongs of prai≈øe to their deliverer, this continent it≈øelf would reprove their ingratitude; it would break its long ≈øilence, and become vocal in high ≈øounding ≈øongs of prai≈øe! But our gratitude ≈øhall ri≈øe high! high as the mercy ≈øeat of heaven! O for glowing words! words from warm and glowing hearts! for words from lukewarm hearts can never a≈øcend to heaven! Incen≈øe mu≈øt be inflamed before it can ri≈øe to the ≈økies! On this day, the enthu≈øia≈øm of the grateful heart is pardonable, and a pa≈ø≈øion of prai≈øe may not be di≈øplea≈øing to that all-wi≈øe and merciful Being, who is acquainted with the upright intentions of the heart.</p>
            <p>Great are our ble≈ø≈øings, and many and public ≈øhould be our acknowledgements of them. This I am ju≈øtified in ≈øaying, not only by our own ≈øentiments; but al≈øo by

the voice of that venerable body of men, who have <hi>Recommended to the ≈øeveral ≈øtates to ≈øet apart</hi> this day <hi>to be religiou≈øly ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a day of</hi> THANKSGIVING <hi>and</hi> PRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER.

Samuel ≈øu≈øtaining a public character, and being at the head of the elders and people, called their attention to acts of religious wor≈øhip, and in the ≈øight of all I≈ørael rai≈øed a monument of prai≈øe to almighty God. "And after this, the hand of the Lord was again≈øt the Phili≈øtines all the days of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel."</p>
            <p>How dignified and venerable do great men appear, when they acknowledge the Supreme Being as the author of all their wi≈ødom, greatne≈øs, and ≈øucce≈øs; and lay all their ≈øhining laurels of victory at the feet of the Great Di≈øpo≈øer of all the events of the world: And ≈øuffer me to ≈øay, that men who are endowed with the mo≈øt di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed abilities, are under the greate≈øt obligations of gratitude to that good God, who formed them capable of ≈øerving the intere≈øts of mankind, and being his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters to ≈øupport ju≈øtice and mercy among the inhabitants of the earth.

The≈øe duties we have been engaged in, and the≈øe are delightful employments to every rational and pious mind. With the≈øe ≈øerious and plea≈øing words I end my di≈øcour≈øe after be≈øeeching you to unite with me in ardently praying that it may plea≈øe the Almighty governor of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe to ha≈øten the time when the u≈øe of ho≈øtile weapons ≈øhall cea≈øe, and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the ble≈ø≈øed Redeemer effectually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the minds of all men.
