            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN army and nation ſtanding upon the foundation of a rational and pious hope of divine aid; and united in defence of honor, innocence and juſtice; ſhould never deſpair of obtaining ſucceſs. For they, whoſe principles of warfare are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benevolent and righteous, will in the end find themſelves triumphant over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of tyrants, and all their minions and armed ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Such conſiderations have often, in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, conſoled the minds of thoſe advocates for the intereſts of men, who eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt dignified when they are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017531_0004_0FA127686EF1A788"/>
among the true friends to their country.</p>
            <p>In further introducing what I intend to perform on this auſpicious day, let me hope to offend no one by reciting a part of thoſe orders which where addreſſed to this army, and ſeem to accord well with the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments juſt expreſſed. The general orders which only a ſhort time preceded our ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt the army commanded by earl Cornwallis, ſhew a virtuous dependence on heaven and ſay, "We have proſpects, which, UNDER THE SMILES OF HEAVEN, promiſe to crown our toils with the moſt brilliant ſucceſs."</p>
            <p>This was an honorable and public decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the influences of Almighty power were neceſſary in order to give us a fair proſpect of victory; this was an humble invocation of the divine favor: and heaven has ſmiled upon the exertions of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined forces, and "the Lord," in the ſtile of the text, "hath helped us."</p>
            <p>The ſacred penman of the hiſtory of the prophet Samuel informs us, that this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and illuſtrious perſon was, in a very remarkable manner, raiſed up to judge and govern the Jewiſh nation. He was the gift of God to reward the prayers of piety, and was by his parents early devoted to the ſervice of God and his country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017531_0005_0FA12769EF1D89E8"/>
But before I enter fully into a diſcuſſion of the ſubject, we may take notice, that during a conſiderable length of time which preceded the government of Samuel, the Jewiſh nation had very much degenerated in their cuſtoms and manners. Vice and iniquity ſo abounded throughout the nation, that ſcarcely could the viſion of truth, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or juſtice be perceived either among prieſts or prophets, judges or people. The judgments of Heaven had collected and kindled over the heads of a people who, with very few exceptions, had forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their God, and united their ſins to draw down whole ſtores of puniſhment from the very hands of mercy and goodneſs. Let rulers and nations know their fate when they neglect or deſpiſe their God.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Iſraelites were ſorely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Philiſtines. They had been defeated in repeated battles; their young men, and judges, and armies were ſlain; the ark of God was taken, and "the glory had departed from Iſrael." The hand of God was alſo immediately againſt them, to puniſh them for their ſins; and "he ſmote of the people fifty thouſand and threeſcore and ten men. And the people lamented ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Who is able to ſtand before this Holy Lord God?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017531_0006_0FA1276AACE7CDC8"/>
At this time of univerſal calamity, Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el roſe up and judged the children of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>"Prepare your hearts unto the Lord," ſaid the prophet, "and ſerve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines." By the prayers and interceſſions of this man of God, and the penitent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the people unto the Lord, the aid of omnipotence was allied to their cauſe: "For when the Philiſtines drew near to battle againſt Iſrael, the Lord thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great thunder on that day upon the Philiſtines, and diſcomfited them, and they were ſmitten before Iſrael. And the men of Iſrael went out of Mizpeh, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Philiſtines and ſmote them."</p>
            <p>"Then Samuel took a ſtone, and ſet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, ſaying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>I now beg your further attention, my dearly beloved hearers, while I attempt to illuſtrate the meaning of the words, which I have choſen for the aſſiſtance of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions on this joyful day.</p>
            <p>"Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. By theſe words we are called to a devout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our dependence on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and to a recollection of the many inſtances of help and relief with which he has condeſcended to bleſs us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017531_0007_0FA1276C6FC03A58"/>
"Then Samuel took a ſtone, and ſet it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer."</p>
            <p>This was intended to manifeſt the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe they entertained of the merciful deliverance which God had granted them, and their earneſt deſire of perpetuating their praiſe and gratitude to nations then unborn. This part of the ſubject ſhall ſolicit our care and attention in the ſecond place.</p>
            <p>What I have in view, as we advance in the buſineſs of this day, is, in the firſt place, to illuſtrate that part of the text which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>Here, perhaps, it may be aſked, does this ſubject require any illuſtration before men of thought and reflection? Are not all men, it may be ſaid, perſuaded by the force of reaſon that the ſupreme being has ſupported and preſerved them in every ſtage of life? But ſhall there be many found notwithſtanding this perſuaſion, who have neglected to pay their dutiful homage to the moſt merciful guardian and benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of mankind? If this be ſo, I ſhall not do wrong, when I endeavour to make my fellow-men ſenſibly feel their dependence on the creator as well as acknowledge this truth. I will then both wiſh and attempt to remind them, that they can be in no ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017531_0008_0FA1276CEE3D0558"/>
where the aid of the creator is not the exiſtence of the creature: That we may give weight to this ſentiment, let us view man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind when they firſt awake into this world of toil and hazard. All the weakneſſes and imperfections of infancy attend them. They are, in themſelves conſidered, moſt deplorably helpleſs. The very animals of the field may, with great propriety, laugh at this feeble creature man, and boaſt of their ſuperior ſtrength and independence. Nor is man helpleſs only in this dawn of life. Even when he has reached the utmoſt ſtrength and wiſdom within the attainment of human nature; yet he muſt ſtill confeſs that ſafety is not derived from himſelf. For it will ever be found that, we can neither foreſee nor overcome all the toils and dangers which await us in our paſſage through life.</p>
            <p>Every man muſt therefore feel himſelf lonely and melancholy in this world, until he has confided in one whoſe power can protect him, and whoſe wiſdom can guide him into the pleaſant paths of glory and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. This ſentiment ſeems to be born with us and not merely the effect of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the voice of nature and not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured acquiſition of philoſophy. It is a truth authorized and ſupported by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of much the greater part of mankind
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017531_0009_0FA1276DB015A1A0"/>
in all ages of the world. Were we to call for the opinion of thoſe nations, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the knowledge of the true God, and aſk the religious pages of their hiſtories; there we ſhould be informed that their greateſt ſupport and conſolation amidſt the common or extraordinary viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of life, were founded on the ſuppoſed goodneſs, wiſdom and power of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to whom, in their unenlightened zeal, they attributed the government of the world and its numerous inhabitants. Let us a little farther follow the doctrine of our perſonal dependence on the ſupreme being. We will for a moment reflect on ſome of the circumſtances of our lives, and what ſmiling proſpects of human felicity have preſented themſelves before us. Upon recollecting their inſtability and painful deluſion we are conſtrained to ſay, that neither what immediately reſpects ourſelves nor the affairs of the world are under our controul or direction. Is not every man able to ſay, that a thouſand diſappointments have attended him in the tranſactions of life, and all of them perhaps quite contrary to his moſt lively hopes and expectations. What appeared perfectly juſt and proper at one time, has nevertheleſs afterwards aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a very different aſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017531_0010_0FA1276E6D4E8A90"/>
We have ſeen the beſt human abilities and the oldeſt experience fall under the weightieſt diſappointment. Schemes which were in appearance well calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce favorable events in the concerns of life, have nevertheleſs proved abortive.</p>
            <p>Nor will it appear, upon examination, that nations or kingdoms have any ſtable foundation for their ſupport, independent of the Sovereign Governor of the univerſe. All their combined wiſdom and ſtrength are ſubject to the direction of that Omniſcience which perfectly comprehends every tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the councils of men. None of thoſe plans of operation, which are founded upon our imperfect knowledge of future events, and the ſcanty experience of paſt ages, can, with any certainty, promiſe great ſucceſs. Of this truth the greater part of mankind have been very ſenſible; for they ſaw ſuch national events take place among them as were evidently of a magnitude too great to be accompliſhed by any human means. A conviction of this kind induced many nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which can be named, to begin all public buſineſs of importance with public acts of worſhip. We are alſo aſſured, that they never declared war, nor undertook any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous enterpriſe, or entered the field of battle, without imploring the aid and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſupernatural power. Influenced by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017531_0011_0FA1276F2DC19F80"/>
theſe religious ſentiments, their generals, and officers, and ſoldiers, have performed many things which were aſtoniſhing, and much above all that could, with reaſon, be expected from human ſtrength and ſagacity. In the ſupport of this declaration, I am rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed with the venerable authority of ancient hiſtorians and eminent ſtateſmen. They teach us, that the hope of divine aid was the nobleſt incentive to valour and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the field of war, and gained them the moſt important victories. The courage of the ſoldiers was animated by piety, and their fears diſpelled by a firm reliance on heaven. And both ſacred and prophane authors inform us, that commanders of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have been attended by victory no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they thought an alliance with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was neceſſary. Here I think we may, with advantage, recollect the conduct and vanity of a certain Grecian general: when among his companions, and recounting the victories which were gained under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he often aſcribed the ſucceſs of his army to his own good management and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and frequently ſaid, "and in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had no ſhare." Afterwards he never proſpered in any thing which he undertook. The ſame inſtruction may be derived from the infamy and ruin of the Pharaohs, the Senacheribs and Herods of all ages. Theſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017531_0012_0FA1276FECC43480"/>
are the men who defy the powers of heaven and earth, and ſeem to challenge the utmoſt exertions of Omnipotence. They carry with them the marks of weakneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and are followed by ruin and confuſion. On the contrary, thoſe nations and commanders who placed the greateſt confidence in Almighty God, have been moſt victorious and moſt flouriſhing. This is a truth which cannot be juſtly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this is a truth from which America ought to learn her happineſs as a nation. When a lively confidence in God ſprings from the ſource of a warm and enlightened heart, and this confidence is aided by our moſt ſkilful and moſt vigorous exertions, then may we entertain a well grounded hope that we ſhall be bleſſed with help from on high. This rational hope of divine aid will beget fortitude in danger, patience under hardſhips, chearfulneſs and pleaſure in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and modeſty and mercy amidſt all the triumphs of victory. Hear what the ſacred ſcriptures ſay to thoſe who acknowledge the providence of God; who are obedient to his commands; who confide in his goodneſs and power; and who humbly aſk his aid and direction. "Then ſhall no man be able to ſtand before you: for he Lord your God ſhall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye ſhall tread upon."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017531_0013_0FA12770AD3EA058"/>
Therefore, a righteous people may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themſelves when they oppoſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt enemies; and, while they adopt the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing language of the ſacred volume, may rejoice and ſay, "With them is an arm of fleſh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles."</p>
            <p>With theſe words I cloſe what I have thus far deſigned. They are able to ſupport my honeſt exertions in the cauſe of juſtice and religion. I aſk their aid, and earneſtly wiſh our minds may be ever impreſſed with a weighty ſenſe of our needed help from Almighty God.</p>
            <p>In the farther diſcuſſion of my ſubject, I will recollect ſome of the paſt mercies which have been extended to us by our gracious God. Suffer me to ſay, they are ſufficient to inforce on our minds both a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and national application of the words of the text; "Hitherto hath the Lord help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us."</p>
            <p>Who, that conſiders the weakneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and how much it is expoſed; who, that reflects on the journey of man through this world, or marks the various circumſtances which viſibly attend his life: I ſay, in the midſt of theſe ſober thoughts, who does not find himſelf conſtrained to give his grateful aſſent to this declaration of one of the holy prophets: "It is of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017531_0014_0FA127716F549B90"/>
Lord's mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.?"</p>
            <p>Were it poſſible to diſcloſe the hiſtories of our lives; could we rehearſe the hazards of infancy and childhood, and recount the toils and dangers which have kept pace with the increaſe of our years; or, to go yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were it in our power to enumerate not only the open and profeſſed enemies of our lives and happineſs, but alſo to enter into the ſecret ambuſhments of our concealed foes, and to point out our narrow eſcape from evils againſt which we could not guard, methinks there would be very few pages in this hiſtory without a "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." It is ſaid, "In the midſt of life we are in death;" and indeed death in a thouſand diſmal forms continually ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds us. His arrows fly thick at all times; and it can be owing only to the guardianſhip of heaven that they have not been aimed at us, and faſtened in our vitals. Every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening we can only ſay, that we have lived, but are uncertain of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the next hour. But theſe are not all: how many thouſand precious gifts are we bleſſed with from the hands of our bountiful benefactor? He gives us life, and all the bleſſings of it. "In his hand is our breath, and are all our ways." Let each one of us ſay, then, in the inward gratitude of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017531_0015_0FA12772310EA7A0"/>
our hearts, "Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities: who healeth all thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Who redeemeth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: who crowneth thee with loving kindneſs and tender mercies."</p>
            <p>But I correct myſelf. I check that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral zeal of gratitude which may another day be more indulged. I came not, my friends, to exhauſt your whole time by addreſſing you on thoſe ſubjects of gratitude which have a common relation to the particular and perſonal ſituation of every one preſent. This employment, however pleaſing and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, muſt ſubmit to claim only a future, though a more enlarged attention.</p>
            <p>The voice of authority among men, calls us to diffuſe a general joy and gratitude through our hearts, and the hearts of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſons of freedom. Nay, the voice of God, in his providential goodneſs, demands our thankful homage for a national and moſt ſignal bleſſing; yes, and for repeated bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Let us then, whether under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſpacious concave, or in the ſacred tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let us worſhip the King of heaven and earth, and adore his mercy and power, which have given us the victory over our enemies.</p>
            <p>Could we give a general utterance to the united ſtates of America; could the voice of her annals and records be heard on this glad
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017531_0016_0FA12772EE387948"/>
day: or, were our pious anceſtors to appear before us to aid our praiſe and increaſe our devotions, they would all, with one harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious voice, unite with this aſſembly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>Join then, friends and brethren of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica! join in heart and ſpirit, ye patriots and friends to poſterity, and form one general concert of praiſe to HIM who has aided us! Time and hiſtory, who point out to the world the ways of God, ye ſhall teach men that the Father of the oppreſſed became the advocate of the inhabitants of this land! "He found them in a deſart land, and in the waſte howling wilderneſs; he led them about, he inſtructed them, he kept them as the apple of his eye."</p>
            <p>As a vine is planted, ſo, O God of hoſts, thy hand did eſtabliſh a people in this land. "The hills were covered with the ſhadow of it, and the boughs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were like the goodly cedars. She ſent out her boughs unto the ſea, and her branches unto the river."</p>
            <p>But tyranny, which raged againſt this people in their infancy, again prepared ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and oppreſſion for them: and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our enemies enjoyed the fruits of our induſtry and virtue, and grew great by the labour of thoſe they had exiled;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017531_0017_0FA12774FA58CC50"/>
yet they became envious of the happineſs, and jealous of the flouriſhing ſtate of thoſe who were befriended only by their God. In the ſpirit and ſtyle of Egyptian tyranny, they call upon one another to unite in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of cruelty and injuſtice. "Come on," ſay they, "let us deal wiſely with them, leſt they multiply. Therefore they did ſet over them taſkmaſters, to afflict them with their burdens." Such was the conduct of Britain towards the inhabitants of this continent. But the Lord helped us, and their ſecret councils and ſchemes, the moſt wiſely plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at leaſt in the eye of human wiſdom, were turned into fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p>The Lord raiſed up wiſe and public ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited men, able to diſcern our rights and privileges, and willing to defend them. The Lord raiſed up warriors and ſtateſmen, and united their hearts and ſtrengthened their hands in the ſervice of their country. Our enemies were diſappointed; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of ſucceſs, unleſs by their ſuperior ſtrength and ſkill in the field of war.</p>
            <p>Miniſterial avarice, arrayed in rigorous acts and unjuſt laws, ſuddenly changed into Britiſh vengeance; and then hoſtile armies advanced to enforce ſubmiſſion by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of death and the ſhedding of blood.</p>
            <p>Then was war in the gates. Was there a ſhield or a ſpear ſeen among forty thouſand
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017531_0018_0FA12775313C8DA0"/>
in America? But with joy, with praiſe we will ſay, "The battle is not to the ſtrong, nor the race to the ſwift. My heart is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe that offered themſelves willingly among the people. Praiſe ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good. Who remembered us in our low eſtate: for his mercy endureth for ever."</p>
            <p>Will any one blame me for honeſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to kindle the warmth of this day's gratitude into a generous and perpetual flame; a flame which, like the refiner's fire, ſhall purify our hearts and conſciences from all evil, and conſume the droſs of every ſinful practice and impure affection?</p>
            <p>Let, then, our gratitude be increaſed, by a recollection of the unexpected and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing union of the inhabitants and ſtates of America, in oppoſition to the uſurpation of Britain. We will call to mind ſome of thoſe gallant actions in which the aſſiſting hand of heaven has appeared, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and courage of our armies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Seven dangerous and laborious cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns ſhall aid my feeble voice. Ye well fought fields of battle, and ye joyful victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, from the heights of Boſton to the plains of Georgia, ye ſhall all conſpire to prove, that the Lord hath helped us.</p>
            <p>Begin we then with the nineteenth of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017531_0019_0FA12775EDBD2EC8"/>
April, memorable for the firſt open and bloody aſſault on the liberties of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Oh! Americans, forget not to tell your children, that liberty was on that day marked for the ſlaughter, and appointed to bleed on the altars of avarice and tyranny! Oh! ye parents, tell your young offspring, as they riſe under your tender and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive care, tell them, they were devoted to ſlavery! teach them what a heavy curſe it is! let them know what miſeries they have eſcaped! kindle their young minds to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and generous love of freedom; but let a dignified reſentment againſt every ſyſtem of ſlavery grow with their growth, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with their years. Let them hear of the cruelties of Britain; let them liſten to thoſe narratives of war and battles, till the name of Britain and ſlavery ſhall make the blood thrill in their veins; let them attend to theſe tales of horror, until a martial ſpirit ſhall mingle with their blood, and glow in their faces, in an aſpect daring and reſolute as the front of the Libyan lion.</p>
            <p>In the temples of that beneficent Being, who delighteth not in the miſeries of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in his temples let the ſound of liberty be lifted up, as well as the ſeraphic voice of religion; let them give force, and influence, and happineſs to each other. Let the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent preacher teach his people to eſteem the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017531_0020_0FA12776AEEDC370"/>
bleſſings of liberty, and to be religious and thankful; let him alſo require them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their freedom as one of theſe bleſſings: but to conſider voluntary ſlavery as the moſt dreadful curſe that can be inflicted on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>But I return to conſider what has been done between the ever memorable 19th of April, 1775, and the joyful 19th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1781.</p>
            <p>Following the example of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and humbly aiming at what the judges, and the prophets, and the divine poets have done, fain would I bring into view every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable interpoſition of heaven, and, in the words of the grateful pſalmiſt, cloſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry period of mercy and deliverance with "Praiſe the Lord, who hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever."</p>
            <p>Hear then, citizens and fellow ſoldiers, what was done on Bunker's hill: that place ſhall claim a ſplendid page in hiſtory, from that time, when virtuous citizens ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly oppoſed Britiſh troops, and humbled their proud contempt of the American arms.</p>
            <p>In Canada, though there the brave have fallen, have ſunk to reſt, yet in the early ſtage of this war, very important ſucceſs attended our arms: ſtrong fortreſſes and Britiſh troops
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017531_0021_0FA1277770CFAE88"/>
were compelled to acknowledge the proweſs of our forces.</p>
            <p>From thence, in imagination, let us paſs to our army before Boſton: there the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were forced to look for ſafety by the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of that place.</p>
            <p>That year the war was carried into the ſtate of New York: then did our enemies haſten from the other ſide of the ocean to join their brethren, already engaged, to make ſo large a portion of mankind miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Number the enemy from Britain! number them from Heſſe! number their ſhips of war! Deſcribe, if you can, all the awful engines of death and carnage! At this time, Oh, my brethren! who taught you to hope that you could be free and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? who preſerved you from falling at the feet of Britain?</p>
            <p>But ſee the waters, though not, "like the Red ſea," divided into parts, yet favourable to us in a time of diſtreſs and danger. The very winds in the hand of God granted their aid to ſave our army. That night which bro't our troops from Long iſland to New York, ſhall be foremoſt in giving an example of the moſt intereſting and finiſhed retreat from the moſt imminent military ruin.</p>
            <p>That year Clinton and Parker felt the weight of American bravery; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and miſerably ſhattered, were obliged
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017531_0022_0FA127782F190D78"/>
to relinquiſh their ſouthern expedition. This campaign wore away, and ſaw no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſucceſs attend the numerous forces and the powerful fleet of the enemy; unleſs to murder a garriſon of brave men after they had capitulated, may be called extraordinary ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Oh! ye firſt fruits of American fortitude and perſeverance, let me, in imagination, drop the tear of love and compaſſion over your honourable graves, if your iron hearted enemies gave you any! Ye martyrs for the cauſe of freedom, whoſe ſteady ſouls could never bend even to a partial and momentary deſertion of your principles of virtue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fair promiſes of your enemies were able to allure you, nor the unutterable hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the moſt execrable priſons and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; not death in his ſlow and ghaſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; not the lingering death of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and torture could terrify you from your fixed attachment to your country! Oh! were it conſiſtent with the will of heaven, I would ſay, ariſe, and come from the dead, to behold a large army of your enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered! ariſe, and animate your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to finiſh the glorious work of liberty! ariſe, and lead on your brother ſoldiers to dreadful deeds of death and ſlaughter, until the ruthleſs hand of Britain ſhall no more diſturb the peace of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:017531_0023_0FA12778EE45FA50"/>
We will now paſs on to a view of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican army. It was almoſt diſbanded; it was reduced to a ſmall number, and better fitted to draw forth pity and compaſſion from the beholders, than to ſtrike them with terror; more able to ſhow their fortitude in adverſity, than to do execution with their arms! Why, O Cornwallis, didſt thou not ſeize the feeble warriors, and their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering commander? Then who can ſay thy preſent fate would not have been ſuſpended?</p>
            <p>Next go with me, I beſeech you, thro' one of the ſtorms and tempeſts of nature. Follow the march of a few naked men, or if they were clothed it was only with rags, expoſed to the rigors of December's cold. O liberty! by what charm, or what mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic power, didſt thou hold theſe ſuffering men firm in thy intereſt? But follow them to the capture of a large body of Heſſians at Trenton. From thence paſs on with the troops to Princeton; and in your way learn the reſources and ſtratagems of war, and hear of the diſappointment and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the enemy. Princeton, that once peaceful abode of the muſes, and ſeat of ſcience, then heard unuſual thunders, and ſaw Britons defeated and ſlain. Then the dying lamp of liberty was kindled anew! Thouſands of heroes flew to the ſtandards
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017531_0024_0FA12779AE93FEF8"/>
of freedom, and thought ſhe could be ſtill defended.</p>
            <p>An American army again took the field, and the enemy found they had the war to begin anew.</p>
            <p>Near the cloſe of this year, the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, "who had not given us as a prey to their teeth," remarkably helped us, and gave Burgoyne and all his army into the hands of the United States.</p>
            <p>Let a recollection of the mercies of the next year begin with a declaration of the alliance of America with the magnanimous Lewis XVI. The illuſtrious hero, and friend to the rights of mankind, heard the fame of our cauſe, and joined the intereſt of his kingdom to the ſupport of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and has ſpared neither blood nor wealth to eſtabliſh us in the poſſeſſion of our freedom.</p>
            <p>From this ſubject, let the operations of our army, numerous and gallant, demand our attention. Conſider their formidable movements to the fields of Monmouth. There, my fellow ſoldiers, you remember the fortune of the day was torn from the hands of the victorious enemy, and the flower of their army. Methinks I ſhall not do amiſs, by leaving you to apply the words, of the poet, where they were deſerved on that day:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:017531_0025_0FA1277BC4D55DA0"/>
"To fainting ſquadrons ſent the timely aid, Inſpir'd repuls'd battalions to engage, And taught the doubtful battle where to rage."</p>
            <p>From the battle of Monmouth, and the various operations of the army within the fourth year of this war, we paſs on to the ſucceeding campaign. No ſmall ſucceſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured our arms that year. Paulus-Hook and Stoney-Point taught our enemies that their ſtrong fortreſſes were not impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the intrepid reſolution and the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous aſſaults of the American forces. In the ſame year an important expedition was directed againſt the five nations of hoſtile indians. That expedition, though attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with immenſe toil and difficulty, and rendered exceedingly precarious by a great number of hazardous circumſtances, a few of which, in their operations, could have deſtroyed the troops on that ſervice: That expedition was not without ſucceſs; and what men could perform, was done.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the ſixth campaign, and remind you of what happened on the 25th of September in the year paſt. That day ſhould have a place in the calendars of all ages, to inform mankind what human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can attempt. Then were diſcloſed, as it were, the ſecret plots of hell; and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017531_0026_0FA1277C10685910"/>
too big to be any longer confined, burſt from its concealment. Let that day be numbered among the days of mercy; let it conſtitute an annual feſtival of grateful joy; and let liberty and the glad angels of America, hover round the aſſembled ſons of freedom, and inſpire them with a love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honor, and a laſting remembrance of the goodneſs of God, who with ſcarcely any human means, and by very little human ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, diſcovered treaſonable plots when they were upon the very point of execution. Then did the Almighty ſave the commander of our armies, and the moſt important fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs and a part of our troops, from the very jaws of treaſon and our enemies. On this ſubject, I know you will anticipate me, and think ſooner than I can ſay, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." How wonderful and myſterious the juſt and merciful ways of heaven." We have been ſuffered to ſtand upon the very precipice of ruin, before we were delivered from our danger. This, we ought to believe, was mercifully intended to teach us our dependence upon him, who alone can make a nation flouriſh; this was to make us grateful, that we might be happy. But how many ſubjects of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude have I omitted! How many which I cannot bring into view on this day! The grateful heart will recollect more than I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017531_0027_0FA1277CAD9EB218"/>
can utter. How various have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts between us and the enemy, ſuperior to us in ſtrength or numbers in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtance? But though in various places ſucceſs has not attended us; yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the enemy have been few, and of ſhort duration. Nay, the very victories they have boaſted of, only haſtened their ruin. For the confirmation of this truth, let us bring examples from the ſouthern part of the continent. We will admire the enterprizing and perſevering ſpirit of our ſouthern army, who in the midſt of the enemy's victories have deſtroyed their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. North and South Carolina ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the military ſagacity and intrepidity of general Green, and his faithful band of worthies. Thoſe ſtates ſhall repeat the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories which have been gained by that army; they ſhall remember how many fortreſſes have been wreſted out of the hands of an inſulting enemy, vainly elated with their viſionary ſucceſs. The late important vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obtained by the troops under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of general Green, ſhall aid the joy and praiſe of this day, and increaſe our gratitude.</p>
            <p>But here let me pauſe a moment. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps upon reflection I may find reaſon to ſay, that I have aimed at more than can be performed in the ſhort time that is allotted
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017531_0028_0FA1277D6EBC7270"/>
to the public worſhip of this day. Pardon me then, my dearly beloved brethren, if I have detained you too long from what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the more immediate intention of this aſſembly. I imagined my text meant more than to acknowledge only one victory, or one inſtance of the goodneſs of God, however great the bleſſing might be. When our hearts are truly grateful, they are alſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and enlarged. We wiſh to know how much heaven has beſtowed upon us, and how much the debts of gratitude are accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and even when we find that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation will riſe infinitely above our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to make any equal compenſation; and that every new mercy will render us more eternally inſolvent; yet ſtill the grateful ſoul is moſt delighted, when the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the mercy and goodneſs of God is moſt extenſive; and muſt, after all we can ſay or do, end with this pathetic and thankful enquiry, which it will not be eaſy to anſwer, "What ſhall I render unto the Lord, for all his benefits towards me?"</p>
            <p>This ſhall prepare our hearts for a new ſubject of gratitude. We will now enter upon the pleaſing employment of impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our minds with a pleaſing remembrance of the laſt national bleſſing, which heaven has vouchſafed unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:017531_0029_0FA1277E2F992288"/>
Shall I not venture to ſay, that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition which depended, in the firſt plan of it, upon forces ſo much disjoined, and events ſo precarious, was ever bleſſed with a more ſeaſonable and harmonious junction of proſperous circumſtances, or ended with more ſubſtantial glory and complete ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The firſt tranſient view of that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſeems to impoſe upon us the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous notion of having in our hands the command of the winds and the waves, the rains and the tempeſts, any of which, under the orders of heaven, would have rendered our plans of operation altogether ineffectual.</p>
            <p>O Clinton! did your tory ſpies, thoſe evil geniuſes of America, who are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in "going to and fro in the earth, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom they may devour;" did they fail to announce to you the early deſtination of the combined army? Alas! was there no friend to Britain able to inform Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis of his approaching danger? To us this is a happy conſideration, it is a mark of military ſkill. Secreſy! thou life and ſoul of every warlike enterpriſe, ever deign to envelop the deſigns of our army in a cloud, which, as of old, ſhall be darkneſs to the enemy, but, like a pillar of fire, ſhall give light to the children of America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:017531_0030_0FA1277EEDFC1070"/>
But I come to obſerve, that from the time our army was ordered on the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Virginia, until the day on which the enemy ſurrendered, ſcarcely any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attended the allied forces which could be deemed unfavourable. The cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and patience of the troops under the fatigue of long and rapid marches; the ſpirit of enterpriſe; the willingneſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure labours and hardſhips of every kind, in order to promote the ſervice of this country, and ſubdue the enemy; theſe were all favourable omens, and are worthy of our attention and regard. The critical and ſeaſonable arrival of the fleet under the command of his excellency the count de Graſſe; and this before the enemy entered the Cheſapeak, and by their prior poſſeſſion of the bay made the junction of our army and the French fleet very difficult, if not altogether impracticable. But the ſituation of the fleet under count de Barras, yet at ſea, was very critical and dangerous. The enemy appeared at the entrance of the Cheſapeak to intercept his arrival. This was the time for the count de Graſſe to diſplay his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to prove how much can be done by a ſeaſonable, well directed, and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attack. By a moſt gallant manoeuvre, he defeated the enemy, deſtroyed ſome of their men of war, and drove the reſt in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017531_0031_0FA1277FAE8E80B8"/>
flight far to ſea. By this happy victory, a junction of the two French fleets was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and under the divine auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, future ſucceſs was inſured to our united forces.</p>
            <p>I will next ſpeak of that harmony, that emulation, and that equal love of danger which ſubſiſted among the allied troops; as if the ſame generous fire of true glory glowed in their boſoms, or one patriot ſoul animated them to the cheerful performance of every military duty, and to encounter every danger. Witneſs the emulation of thoſe French and American troops, who at the ſame time entered the trenches of the enemy, and with equal intrepidity and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of attack, ſtormed ſome of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts.</p>
            <p>That only a few of our troops have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in the reduction of the enemy, is a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſideration, and ſhould contribute to make us thankful. The favourableneſs of the ſeaſon ſhall be remembered, and—But ſhort be my narration of this glorious victory, for ſhort were the operations of the ſiege. A ſtrong and numerous army of our enemy have ſurrendered themſelves priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of war: and this ſignal inſtance of the goodneſs of divine providence, demands a repetition of thoſe words which you have
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017531_0032_0FA1278179FA29C0"/>
already often heard; "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
            <p>O Virginia! highly favoured of the Lord, rejoice and be glad, for the ſpoiler is taken captive! Turn your fears and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations into grateful ſongs of praiſe, and forget not to love and adore that Almighty Being who ſays to the rage and cruelty of men, "Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no farther."</p>
            <p>O! all ye inhabitants of the united ſtates, let your thankfulneſs appear by the piety of your hearts, and the purity of your lives. Every new inſtance of the goodneſs of the Creator, calls upon us to give new ſigns of our love and obedience to him. We ſhould endeavour to ſhew ourſelves as worthy of the mercies of God, as human nature is capable, by being more virtuous, more dutiful, and more benevolent.</p>
            <p>What will all the moſt pompous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of gratitude avail, if the manners and cuſtoms of our country are not pure; or the vices not reformed? Believe it, my friends, a ſinful people cannot be a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people! For be aſſured that a people who cannot be moved by the mercy, and goodneſs of God to do what is their duty, and to examine by what means they may pleaſe their Maker and bountiful Benefactor, are truly unworthy of his mercy and protection:
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017531_0033_0FA12781F05DE5A0"/>
Nay, every part of their conduct which is vicious, ſeems very loudly to declare, that they are weary of the very goodneſs of God, and all the bleſſings of heaven.</p>
            <p>Having now finiſhed what I propoſed in the firſt grand diviſion of my diſcourſe, I proceed to what I ſaid ſhould ſolicit our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the ſecond place.</p>
            <p>"Then Samuel took a ſtone, and ſet it between Mizpeh and Shen." I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, that by this monumental ſtone, the children of Iſrael intended, not only to expreſs their preſent gratitude, for favours conferred upon them by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but alſo to perpetuate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a very extraordinary mercy, to nations long after to be born. That this was the manner of perpetuating the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſignal ſucceſs, or extraordinary events, is made evident by the teſtimony of every ancient hiſtorian, whether ſacred or prophane. This cuſtom, however, has not been altogether confined to the ancients. Many are the pillars and monuments which ſtand, this day, as witneſſes of great ſucceſs or of illuſtrious merit: and America is not without her monuments of great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, who have generouſly ſhed their blood in the defence of their country. I therefore think it not difficult to ſhew that public and laſting ſigns of praiſe to God,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017531_0034_0FA12782AFB6D418"/>
as well as marks of reſpect for worthy men, have been authoriſed by the examples of all nations. Let then the enemy to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let the enemy to his country; nay, let the vicious infidel, and the debauched libertine, let them all ceaſe to ſtigmatiſe public and devout homage to almighty God with the name of unneceſſary and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table parade. If they will neither hear the voice of reaſon, nor hearken to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and charming inſtructions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writings; let them, however, be taught ſome reverence for the Deity even from the cuſtoms of heathens and pagans, where nature ſpoke, in part, what nature's God hath ſhewed to all his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let them aſk what meant thoſe coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifices of whole hecatombs; what meant thoſe large and expenſive libations; and what meant thoſe ſolemn proceſſions to the temples of devotion? Were not all theſe things expreſſions of gratitude for the mercies they had received? However, not to ſay all that can be offered, on this ſubject, from the cuſtoms of poliſhed nations; I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive examples of this moſt rational duty, from the very original inhabitants of this continent. I can avail myſelf of their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms to plead for thoſe ſigns and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gratitude, which are due to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Diſpoſer of all events.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:017531_0035_0FA127836E0EE8A8"/>
But we may be more happy than they, we are more enlightened in the knowledge and ſervice of the bleſſed and good God. Our gratitude ſhould be more pure and more ſpiritual than theirs. We are inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he delighteth more in the humble and thankful heart, than in the moſt coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifices. Inſtead then of erecting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, as of old was done, for offerings to aſcend in coſtly incenſe, to repreſent our gratitude and praiſe; let pure and virtuous hearts be the altars, and love and obedience be the incenſe, which ſhall better pleaſe the Deity. Gratitude ſhall be written on our hearts; for this alſo will be more pleaſing to our Divine Benefactor, than all the pomp of praiſe which ever was inſcribed, in the largeſt characters, on the towering pyramid, or the ſolemn temple.</p>
            <p>O bleſſed day this, which calls us to the pleaſing duty of praiſing God for ſo many mercies conferred upon us! O happy day, whoſe ſun riſes not to compaſſionate us in ſome deplorable exilement from our habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or more miſerable flight from our victorious enemies! Happy ſun, that riſes not to light us by his ſickly beams to ſome dire and lonely retreat; but bright ſhines this day, to ſhew the bleſſings of heaven and the triumphs of victory! Let us collect all the generous efforts of our ſouls, to form
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017531_0036_0FA127842EF13A28"/>
one humble and grateful offering, and let it be laid on the public altar of our united and open acknowledgement of the goodneſs of HIM who hath helped us! In the language of the Pſalmiſt, I will ſay, "Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul; and all that is within me, bleſs his holy name, and forget not all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits." O juſt and bleſſed God, has it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to check the ſword of the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; yes, and in a great meaſure to wreſt it out of the hands of the oppreſſor and the tyrant! Methinks if men uttered no ſongs of praiſe to their deliverer, this continent itſelf would reprove their ingratitude; it would break its long ſilence, and become vocal in high ſounding ſongs of praiſe! But our gratitude ſhall riſe high! high as the mercy ſeat of heaven! O for glowing words! words from warm and glowing hearts! for words from lukewarm hearts can never aſcend to heaven! Incenſe muſt be inflamed before it can riſe to the ſkies! On this day, the enthuſiaſm of the grateful heart is pardonable, and a paſſion of praiſe may not be diſpleaſing to that all-wiſe and merciful Being, who is acquainted with the upright intentions of the heart.</p>
            <p>Great are our bleſſings, and many and public ſhould be our acknowledgements of them. This I am juſtified in ſaying, not only by our own ſentiments; but alſo by
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017531_0037_0FA12784EDA44F98"/>
the voice of that venerable body of men, who have <hi>Recommended to the ſeveral ſtates to ſet apart</hi> this day <hi>to be religiouſly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a day of</hi> THANKSGIVING <hi>and</hi> PRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER. This well correſponds with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Samuel and the elders of Iſrael. Samuel ſuſtaining a public character, and being at the head of the elders and people, called their attention to acts of religious worſhip, and in the ſight of all Iſrael raiſed a monument of praiſe to almighty God. "And after this, the hand of the Lord was againſt the Philiſtines all the days of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel."</p>
            <p>How dignified and venerable do great men appear, when they acknowledge the Supreme Being as the author of all their wiſdom, greatneſs, and ſucceſs; and lay all their ſhining laurels of victory at the feet of the Great Diſpoſer of all the events of the world: And ſuffer me to ſay, that men who are endowed with the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed abilities, are under the greateſt obligations of gratitude to that good God, who formed them capable of ſerving the intereſts of mankind, and being his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ſupport juſtice and mercy among the inhabitants of the earth. Happy that nation, where theſe vicegerents of heaven are a pure and living example of their moſt virtuous RECOMMENDATIONS. Who will
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017531_0038_0FA12785AD40E278"/>
give weight and energy to their laws and reſolutions, by their firſt and moſt ſteady perſonal obſervation of them; and ſhew mankind, "that virtue alone is happineſs below."</p>
            <p>Since then, my friends, "it hath pleaſed almighty God to aſſiſt and ſupport the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States of America, in their important ſtruggle for liberty againſt the long and continued efforts of a powerful nation;" it muſt be not only our indiſpenſable duty, but our greateſt intereſt, to perpetuate our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, by learning righteouſneſs. Under the invoked aſſiſtance of the ſame merciful God, let us proſecute this war with more unanimity and unabating reſolutions. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence has pointed out our duty, and calls us by the moſt ſignal inſtance of interpoſition, to perform his work, and to give our enemies no reſt, until they be forced to ſee the injuſtice of their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the cruelty of their warfare. Could my influence reach as far as my wiſhes are extended; could I appear before the inhabitants of the United States in all the irreſiſtable majeſty of ancient elocution; could I wield the thunder of Demoſthenes, and arreſt the lightning of Pericles; how ſhould the nerves of oppoſition to our country be withered, and every American be fired into a patriot or a ſoldier.</p>

Ye American friends to your country, this is a year of glory and public felicity! you can now with the calm and dignified triumph of freemen look back, and ſmile on the toils and dangers you have ſuſtained in this righteous conflict! You can with a pious pleaſure and awe mark the goodneſs and wiſdom of Providence! You can add pleaſure and delight to all theſe affections of the mind by a more animated gratitude and a purer zeal! This day brings you nearer the full poſſeſſion of thoſe earthly bleſſings for which you have ſo ardently panted! Your proſpects are fairer and brighter than they have ever been! and if you are not wanting to yourſelves, all the bleſſings of freedom are yours! The Lord helps you and invites you by every nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bleſſing to renew your exertions; to preſs on and gain a complete conqueſt over the tyranny of your enemies! But ſhould you be diſobedient to the calls and ſmiles of heaven; ſhould you neglect the intereſt of your country; remember, you may have reaſon to curſe your indolence and impiety when it is too late! Conſider the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inhabitants of Europe. Do they not all wiſh you to be free and independent? They will date their days of unmoleſted freedom in trade and commerce from the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra of your independence! The three potent
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017531_0040_0FA12787F074E070"/>
nations of France and Spain and the United Provinces are all on our ſide; they have commenced hoſtilities againſt Britain and are preparing to humble the pride of that nation. Theſe conſiderations ſhould be motives of encouragement and new zeal; but not the grounds of ſloth and inaction. Honor, juſtice and our national character demands our utmoſt exertions to prove that we are worthy to be allied to a nation who have bravely fought and generouſly bled in this war.</p>
            <p>Oh Louis the XVI live forever! Oh that my words were like the words of an angel! I would wing them to thy ears! Or could I borrow from ſome guardian angel of America his ſwift pinions! I would hover round thy perſon and guard thee from all danger! I would ſtand before thy majeſty, and in the name of America of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee the ſincereſt thanks of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, for thy fleets and thy armies, for the wiſdom, and the zeal, and the bravery of thy officers and ſoldiers in the ſervice of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica! There ſhall be men who, like the bards and poets of old, in heroic ſtile, ſhall rehearſe the immortal deeds of the allied nations and of THE DEFENDER OF THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND, LOUIS THE GRAND MONARQUE. There ſhall be Miriams and Deborahs; there ſhall be virgins and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

Some Moeonides ſhall enrich his verſe with the honorable names of thoſe who commanded the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined army: Or after the example of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid the renowned king of Iſrael, it ſhall be ſaid "Theſe be the names of the mighty men" who led forth the allied troops to ſubdue our enemies. Their names ſhall be familiar to us; they ſhall be ſounded with pleaſure. Old men ſhall remember them; they ſhall report them to their children. The grey headed ſoldier ſhall beguile the heavy hours of night with his animating hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of thoſe battles in which he fought: He ſhall warm his cold blood with the names of Waſhington, and Rochambeau, De Graſſe, Barras, and St. Clair; B. Viomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil, and Lincoln, Chattelux, and La Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette, C.

and ſoldier of that army; they ſhould ſtand ſide by ſide and hand in hand emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic of our friendſhip and union! I would have them written in capitals of gold! Aid me, all Ye, who with a compoſed joy ſtood on the plains of York and ſaw the Britiſh hoſt lay down their arms; ſtamp on your faithful minds the characters of every brave officer and ſoldier, and hand their names down to poſterity. Thus far have I endeavoured to aſſiſt you in celebrating that divine Providence which has given ſucceſs to our arms; and in thanking God, who has raiſed up great and worthy men to aid us in this war. What you have heard has flowed I hope from an honeſt and lively gratitude both to God, and every friend to my country. However if, upon reflection, any one is piouſly fearful that I have arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated too much, to the ſkill and valour of men; if any one thinks I have forgotten the more expreſs buſineſs of this day which is to give thanks to God and to glorify his name; to theſe intimations ſuffer me to ſay; all men of merit are entitled to the approbation of their fellow men; and while we pay them the debt which is juſtly due to their uſefulneſs and abilities, with a conſtant dependence on the influence and government of God I hope we ſhall not do wrong. We came hither with a view to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017531_0043_0FA1278A2DF73E10"/>
reverence the king of heaven and earth; to adore his wiſdom, his juſtice, and his unmerited goodneſs; but more eſpecially we have been called to acknowledge the paſt mercies of Providence; and I hope we moſt humbly and moſt earneſtly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his future protection and goodneſs. Theſe duties we have been engaged in, and theſe are delightful employments to every rational and pious mind. With theſe ſerious and pleaſing words I end my diſcourſe after beſeeching you to unite with me in ardently praying that it may pleaſe the Almighty governor of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to haſten the time when the uſe of hoſtile weapons ſhall ceaſe, and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the bleſſed Redeemer effectually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the minds of all men.
