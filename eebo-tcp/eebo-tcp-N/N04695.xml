            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Existence of an <hi>absolutely perfect Being,</hi> which we call the DEITY, unavoidably infers his <hi>absolutely perfect Providence,</hi> exactly answerable to the absolute Perfection of his Nature. For as his <hi>Understanding</hi> is absolutely perfect, it must needs eternally have seen all Things possible to be and come to pass, both by his Influence and Permission: And as out of all these Possibilities, his absolutely perfect <hi>Wisdom</hi> must needs select Those to come into Existence which are fittest (all Things perfectly considered) to be effected and permitted; 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005856_0004_10270174E2FAC5E0"/>
the same Wisdom will eternally direct him, both in creating, supporting, over-ruling and permitting, in a perfect Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with his absolutely perfect Foresight.</p>
            <p>If any object, That this infers <hi>Fatality;</hi> I think 'tis plain that this can be no other Kind of Fatality than there is and must be, if you will give it such a Name, in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD himself: Or that 'tis absolutely necessary that GOD be absolutely wise; and therefore absolutely necessary that he ever <hi>wills, permits</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> most wisely, wherever there is any Room for Wisdom to be exercised.</p>
            <p>Not that this absolutely perfect Wisdom must confine him to <hi>one Way</hi> of acting or permitting: For it may, perhaps, direct him to <hi>all possible Varieties,</hi> at some Time or other, not improper, or not inconsistent with his moral Excellencies. And as the Varieties seem to be infinite, they may go on to Eternity.</p>
            <p>Answerable therefore to his absolute Wisdom, almighty Power and universal Presence, must be his universal, wise and perfect <hi>Providence.</hi> He must ever will and act, order and permit agreable to his wisest Prospects.</p>
            <p>There is not an <hi>Atom</hi> in the <hi>Universe,</hi> but his absolute Wisdom directed him to make it, and his Almighty Power produced it with the wisest Views and Purposes; and for all its Trains of Scituations, Influence and Uses, throughout the Period of it's Existence, or so long as he sees fit to give it Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As a clear and undoubted <hi>Instance</hi> of this universal DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ITY's taking constant Care even of every <hi>Atom;</hi> the sagacious Enquirers into his Works of Nature, find <hi>Attraction</hi> is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally annex'd to <hi>Matter;</hi> and there is not an <hi>Atom</hi> in this <hi>Earth, Sea</hi> or <hi>Air,</hi> but has a constant Influence even on <hi>every Atom</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Sun;</hi> tho' the <hi>Sun</hi> is found to be near a Million. Times bigger than our <hi>Earth;</hi> nor an <hi>Atom</hi> in the <hi>Sun,</hi> but has a constant Influence on <hi>every Atom</hi> of our <hi>Earth, Sea</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> and even of all the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Satellits</hi> wheeling round that great and illustrious Body: And by these mutual Influences continually derived from their universal Cause and Agent, he continually rules these lower Worlds, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005856_0005_1027017AA8FA0938"/>
producing innumerable Varieties and Alterations in them. Yea, should we perfectly pursue their <hi>Trains</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the Creation; we should doubtless see, there is not a <hi>single Atom</hi> in the Universe, in these lower Worlds at least, but has had its Influence more or less according to it's Distance, even on <hi>every Event</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>But I must now forbear to penetrate any deeper in these endless Contemplations. Thus much I tho't convenient,—to lead you into some clear &amp; enlarged Views of the <hi>universal Providence</hi> of GOD, and excite some suitable Adorations of him.—</p>
            <p>I now go on to observe, That as this wise and almighty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent must forever fill the whole Creation; so by his absolute Power and Wisdom in eternal Harmony, he must forever over-rule even every Iota in it in the wisest Manner. In his over-ruling them, he is always exercising his Perfections: And no doubt is either constantly displaying them to some of his attentive Creatures, either visible or invisible, whom he has made <hi>intelligent</hi> for this among other Ends, that they might be happy in seeing them; or at least, (as in the deeper Scenes) he acts with a perpetual View to open and show his Excellencies in his Operations, to the greater Surprize, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Joy and Happiness both of Men and Angels, at the most proper Periods, or when they are prepared for the clear Discovery. And thus he will doubtless do to Eternity.</p>
            <p>For as GOD is ever working; <hi>new Mysteries</hi> will be ever forming and opening. Yea, it seems as if a great Part of the Happiness of the Saints and Angels in <hi>the Heavenly World</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in viewing successive and continual Scenes of providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mysteries and Revelations:—a most agreable Mixture of mysterious Scenes before them, to show them the amazing Reach of GOD beyond them, and raise their Adorations; and then their surprizing Openings, to raise their delightful Wonders and excite their Praises. Thus all the Hosts of Heaven ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear perpetually entertained, as described in the Apocalyps: The <hi>Seals</hi> are continually opening to the Living Creatures, Angels, Elders and Saints encircling the Throne of the SON of GOD in that upper World of Revelations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005856_0006_1027017C51238708"/>
Yea, in this <hi>lower World,</hi> in it's present State, among myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Clouds and Darkness, we have often partial Glympses of the Sovereign Wisdom and Power of GOD in his Works of Providence. And scarce in any thing more are those Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions seen, than in the wonderful Salvations he gives his People. <hi>Their Salvation</hi> is every where by the inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ascribed to him. As <hi>Isaiah</hi> observes, Chap. xxviii. 29. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>of Hosts is wonderful in Counsel, and excellent in working;</hi> so <hi>Asaph</hi> in behalf of <hi>Israel,</hi> describes him in Psal. lxxiv. 12. GOD <hi>is my King of old, working Salvation in the midst of the Earth. Jonah</hi> on his great Deliverance, or in the Prospect of it, sings, Chap. ii. 9. <hi>Salvation is of the</hi> LORD. <hi>David,</hi> in Psal. iii. 8. <hi>Salvation belongeth unto the</hi> LORD; and in Psal. lxviii. 20. <hi>He that is our</hi> GOD, <hi>is the</hi> GOD <hi>of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Jeremiah</hi> says, in Chap. iii. 23. <hi>Truly, in vain is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hoped for from the Hills and from the Multitudes of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; Truly in the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>is the Salvation of Israel.</hi> And in divers other Places of the inspired Scripture, is He expresly styled by his People, <hi>The</hi> GOD <hi>of their Salvation.</hi> To him, in Times of Trouble and Danger, they look and cry; and upon their Deliverance, ascribe the Praise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salvation</hi> is sometimes in Scripture used in the <hi>largest Sense:</hi> As comprehending both Preservation and Deliverance from all Kinds of Evil, both of Sin, Disorder and Trouble, both felt and threatening, in the <hi>Present</hi> State, and Preservation from every Evil in the Future—; together with the Bestowment of all Kinds of Good contrary to those Evils; and all This forever. But the <hi>Salvation</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> is meant of <hi>Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from a <hi>threatening Host</hi> of humane, powerful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Sovereign GOD, in Times of his People's Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from them, is to be eyed as having all the Parts and Powers of Nature in his Hands, both angelical, humane and elementary, and using each according to his perfect Wisdom and Sovereign Pleasure; he has these <hi>Two Ways</hi> in general, of working out Salvation for them—</p>
            <p n="1">1. By exciting, guiding and strengthening them <hi>in their Use of proper Means</hi> for their Deliverance, and crowning their 
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005856_0007_10270183C2E10B98"/>
               <hi>Endeavours</hi> with Success. And then their Business is to exert themselves both in turning and praying to him, contriving, fortifying, fighting, and trusting in him, all together: And when delivered, to ascribe to him the Glory, for strengthening, guiding and succeeding them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When <hi>proper Means cannot be bad,</hi> or are <hi>utterly insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> either thro' the vastly superiour Power and Skill of the Enemies, or thro' their quick or unexpected Onsets; then he sometimes works Salvation for them by <hi>other Means,</hi> either <hi>Angels, Men</hi> or <hi>Elements;</hi> and this in so remarkable a Way, as clearly to show his providential Care, Power and Wisdom: So that while it was out of their Skill and Power to defend themselves, they cou'd only <hi>stand still and see the saving Hand and Work of</hi> GOD. And then it is their Duty, both to turn and cry to him, hope in him, attentively observe the Traces of his Power and Wisdom in working their Deliverance; and then to rise in respectful Wonder, Gratitude, and gratefull Acknowledgments and Praises.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>this latter</hi> was the Way of his working out Salvation for <hi>his ancient People</hi> intended in the <hi>Text;</hi> in such a Way he has also wrought both for <hi>them</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> in <hi>after Ages,</hi> and even gives Instances thereof in the <hi>present Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed the Salvation there accomplished was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>miraculous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> had march'd from <hi>Goshen</hi> in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the southwestern Shoar of the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> and this lay between them and the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> as the Wilderness lay between that Sea and the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And when they came to the Sea, they lift up their Eyes and saw the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Army marching after them: at which they were sore afraid, cried out to the LORD, and complained to <hi>Moses</hi> for leading them into so extream a Danger. But <hi>Moses</hi> said to the People—<q>Fear ye not! <hi>Stand still and see the Salvation of the</hi> LORD, which he will shew you to Day!—The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your Peace!</q>
            </p>
            <p>

Upon this, the supernatural Power of GOD, tho' working partly by a <hi>strong East Wind,</hi> opens a Way thro' the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and makes the Bottom entirely dry: The Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> go into the midst of the Sea: And tho' it is Night and a Pillar of Fire moving onwards over them, yet the Host of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ventures after them. But as soon as the <hi>Israelites</hi> are all advanced to the opposite 'hoar, the LORD withdraws his supernatural Influence and works again in his natural Way, returns the Sea to it's usual Strength: And the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> fly, but all in vain: the Sea returns and drowns them. And thus 'tis said—<hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>overthrew them in the midst of the Sea:</hi> And, <hi>Thus the</hi> LORD <hi>saved</hi> Israel <hi>that Day out of the Hand of the</hi> Egyptians; <hi>and</hi> Israel <hi>saw that great Work which the</hi> LORD <hi>did upon the</hi> Egyptians; <hi>and the People feared the</hi> LORD, <hi>and believed the</hi> LORD <hi>and his Servant</hi> Moses.</p>
            <p>But tho' <hi>that</hi> Salvation of GOD was properly <hi>miraculous,</hi> and so were divers others wrought for <hi>that peculiar People</hi> in ancient Times, in order to confirm the Scripture Revelation, then a forming: Yet as <hi>in all Ages since</hi> their national Rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, GOD has had, in some Countrey or other, a peculiar People owning his Revelation and their covenant Engagement to him; so he has sometimes brought them into the most threatning Dangers, to humble them for their Sins, awaken them to Repentance, make them sensible of their Dependance on him, excite their Cries to him and Hope and Trust in him; and so preparing them to see the necessary and clear Displays of his Mercy, Power and Wisdom in working their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;—Then he has made them <hi>stand still</hi> and <hi>see it</hi> with Wonder: He has in such a Way wrought it by his wise and sovereign Influence both on the Minds of Men and elementary Substances, as clearly to show to due Observers, that their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was of his contriving, ordering and effecting, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wholly above, and sometimes wholly without their Power and Policy.</p>
            <p>And this brings us to <hi>apply</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> in our considering the wonderful Salvations GOD has wrought for the whole <hi>British Empire</hi> with her <hi>Allies</hi> in general, and for these her <hi>Northern Colonies</hi> in special, in the <hi>Year past;</hi> i. e. I mean since our <hi>Anniversary Thanksgiving</hi> on the 5<hi>th</hi> of last <hi>December,</hi> and the

Intelligence then and since received. But as I have published <hi>Remarks</hi> on the great, the comprehensive and the happy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation GOD was pleased to give us in the <hi>Victory</hi> of <hi>Culloden;</hi> on which all our civil and religious Liberties, our Privileges, Properties and the Lives of Multitudes seemed under GOD to be depending; I may but just mention it, and refer you to them.</p>
            <p>And that we may sing his Praises with <hi>Under standing,</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to rank our Observations under these <hi>three</hi> general Heads—</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>dangerous Enemies</hi> we have been concerned with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>dangerous Circumstances</hi> we were in a <hi>Year ago</hi> and <hi>since.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>dangerous Enemies</hi> we have been concerned with.</p>
            <p>For they have such a Connection with our <hi>dangerous Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> that without a due Consideration of those our <hi>Enemies,</hi> we cannot duely see the Greatness of our Salvation from them.</p>
            <p>Now our Dangers chiefly rose from the vast Increase of Empire, Power and Influence in the popish, cruel, ambitious, restless <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This House first came to the Throne of <hi>France</hi> by the Help of the <hi>Protestants</hi> in 1589, in the Person of <hi>Henry</hi> IV: Who being stab'd to Death by a popish Priest in 1610; <hi>his</hi> Son <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, who lived to 1643; <hi>his</hi> Son <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, who lived to 1715; and <hi>his</hi> immediate Successor tho' great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Son <hi>Lewis</hi> XV, the present King, have been the main Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire, and the Scourge of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> yea of their own Subjects, for above these <hi>Hundred and Thirty Years.</hi> From their wicked Thirst of arbitrary Power, they have Wars, Blood and Treachery, abolished the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient 
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005856_0010_1027018B91C020E0"/>
Liberties of <hi>France,</hi> and made their Subjects, both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People and Nobles Slaves. From their cruel Hatred of the reform'd Religion, they have destroy'd above <hi>Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> Protestant Churches in that Kingdom; banished their Ministers; imprisoned, tortured, butchered and ruined above a <hi>Million</hi> of their People. And from their restless Eagerness to gain the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> they have, by unprovoked Wars, Battles, Seiges and mortal Sicknesses occasioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, sacrificed <hi>Millions</hi> of their own Subjects and of their Neighbours round about them. They never made a <hi>Treaty</hi> without perfidious Violation in the fittest Time for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: They never made a <hi>War</hi> without fallacious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Pretences: and they never made a <hi>Peace,</hi> without Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to their Power and Empire.</p>
            <p>About 1633, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, began a War on <hi>Lorrain, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Spain</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and took divers Places from them all.</p>
            <p>In 1648, by the Treaty of <hi>Munster,</hi> and the <hi>fourteen Years</hi> War before, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, added three Bishopricks in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and all <hi>Alsace</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> to his Dominions. In 1659, by the <hi>Pyrenian</hi> Treaty, and the <hi>twenty five Years</hi> War preceeding, he added, both from <hi>Spain,</hi> the Counties of <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillon</hi> and <hi>Gonflans;</hi> and from the <hi>Netherlands, twenty six</hi> fortified Places. In 1662, he purchased of our King <hi>Charles</hi> II, <hi>Mardyke</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> with the Forts round them; and in 1667, <hi>Nova Scotia;</hi> to the infinite Injury of the <hi>British Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The <hi>same Year,</hi> he invades the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> And the <hi>next Year,</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Aix le Chapelle,</hi> adds <hi>twelve</hi> strong Places more. In 1672, he breaks into the <hi>Netherlands</hi> again, and then into <hi>Germany:</hi> and in 1678, by the Treaty of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miguen,</hi> he adds the County of <hi>Burgundy</hi> towards <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>sixteen</hi> Places more in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> In 1689, he falls on <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> again: And in 1697, by the Treaty of <hi>Reswick,</hi> he farther adds out of <hi>Germany, Strasburg,</hi> a great, free, protestant and wealthy City, with <hi>another City</hi> and <hi>three</hi> more fortified Places; and out of the <hi>Netherlands, Eighty two</hi> Towns more.</p>

Yet not contented with all these Encroachments, he in 1700, contrary to the most solemn Oaths and Renunciations, seized the <hi>whole Spanish Monarchy,</hi> setting his <hi>second Grandson,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> on the Throne thereof. And tho' King <hi>William</hi> wisely formed a grand Alliance against this growing Power, and Queen <hi>Ann</hi> proceeding with it in a glorious Train of Victories for a Course of <hi>ten</hi> Years, seemed just to be on the Point of recovering <hi>Spain</hi> from the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to our Ally the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> yet the Friends of <hi>France</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in the Court of <hi>Britain</hi> at the End of 1710, turned out a most wise, faithful and successful Ministry, deserted our own Allies, sacrific'd them to the <hi>French;</hi> and by the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> in 1713, confirmed <hi>Spain,</hi> with her Dominions in <hi>America,</hi> to that <hi>second Grandson</hi> of the House of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About <hi>twenty Years</hi> from this, during her present King's Minority, <hi>France</hi> enjoyed a perfect Peace, except her taking St. <hi>Sebastians:</hi> And exceedingly extending her Trade, cut off divers Branches of ours, and grew more rich and powerful than ever. And in the mean Time, by the <hi>Missisippi</hi> Scheme, the <hi>French Crown</hi> clear'd itself of above <hi>fifty Millions</hi> of Debts: While by Reason of the many Disaffected to the protestant Succession in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the constant Bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erings of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> so many Forces were obliged to be maintained both by Land and Sea; that the Debt of <hi>forty Millions</hi> contracted by the Wars preceeding, unhappily continued on the <hi>British Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>French</hi> drove us from St. <hi>Lucee</hi> in the <hi>West Indies;</hi> exceedingly fortified <hi>Cape Breton;</hi> almost worm'd us out of our <hi>Fishery;</hi> set the <hi>Indians</hi> on our <hi>North American</hi> Frontiers, and built a <hi>strong Fort</hi> on <hi>Crown Point,</hi> of most mischievous Consequence, on our End of the <hi>Lake</hi> near our Borders, and even within our own Territories. Yea, spreading round all our <hi>British Colonies,</hi> from <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> St. <hi>John's</hi> and <hi>Anticoste Islands</hi> in the Bay of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> up to the Heads of that River in the Lakes above, and thence to <hi>Missisippi</hi> River down to the Mouth in the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> two of the greatest Rivers in Earth: Bringing over the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations to their Religion and Interest, and extending their Trade among them.</p>

In 1733, the <hi>three</hi> Kings of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> having a Mind to divide some of the Dominions of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Charles</hi> VI, Father to the present Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> united in a War against him. And the <hi>French King</hi> finding Ways to lull the neighbouring Powers asleep; declaring in his Proclamation of War, that he was fully contented with his large Dominions and desir'd no more, only acted out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment against the <hi>Emperor</hi> for contriving to hinder his Father in Law King <hi>Stanislaus</hi> from the Throne of <hi>Poland:</hi> By this Pretence and other Means, the <hi>Emperor</hi> had none to help him, lay at the cruel Mercy of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Bourbon:</hi> And in <hi>two Years</hi> War, was obliged to yield to the King of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> some Places in <hi>Italy;</hi> to <hi>Don Carlos</hi> the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> second Son, the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> yea the <hi>Emperor</hi> was forced to perswade his Son in Law the young Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to yield to <hi>France</hi> his ancient patrimonial Dutchies of <hi>Barr</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> on her eastern Borders, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for <hi>Tuscany</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> tho' <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was the Heir thereto, and <hi>France</hi> had no Pretence either to <hi>Lorrain, Barr</hi> or <hi>Tuscany:</hi> And all these Concessions the <hi>Emperor</hi> made, on the solemn Engagement of the <hi>French King</hi> to guarantee the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction;</hi> which was a special Establishment, whereby the <hi>Emperor</hi> settled all his remaining patrimonial Dominions on his <hi>eldest Daughter</hi> married in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1735, 6 to the said Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Almost ever since King GEORGE I. came to the Crown in 1714, that Branch of the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Spain,</hi> no doubt secretly encouraged by the other on the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> has been continually molesting the <hi>British Nations.</hi> Sometimes by open War, laying Siege to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and forming Expeditions in favour of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> in <hi>Great Britain:</hi> Almost constantly at other Times, by seizing our Trade of Logwood at the Bays of <hi>Campeachy</hi> and <hi>Honduras,</hi> our Trade of Salt at <hi>Saltertudas,</hi> of such great Importance to our <hi>American</hi> Meat and Fishery: Breaking in upon our <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ento</hi> and <hi>South Sea</hi> Trade, in Opposition to most solemn Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; delaying our Ships, exacting arbitrary Premiums, and seizing our Stocks, Books and Factors: While they have been at the same Time, favouring underhand the <hi>French,</hi> in trading to the <hi>South Seas,</hi> and even making Settlements there to their 
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005856_0013_102701962A8200F8"/>
vast Enrichment; as also in settling with them the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Part of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> of most threatning Consequence in Time to our Trade and Island of <hi>Jamaica:</hi> Yea we cou'd hardly send a Vessel to or from <hi>our own Islands</hi> in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> but the <hi>Spanish Guarde la Coasts</hi> wou'd seize and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzel them, and even abuse our Sailors in a barbarous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Which after near <hi>twenty Years</hi> unexampled Patience, obliged us in 1739 to enter into a War with them to recover our Rights and Safety.</p>
            <p>Upon the Death of the aforesaid Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> VI in <hi>October</hi> 1740, his said <hi>eldest Daughter</hi> was rightfully declared Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Archdutchess of <hi>Austria,</hi> sovereign of the <hi>Austrian Netherlands,</hi> and of all the other <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Domains</hi> of her Father. The Kings of <hi>Great Britain, France, Poland, Prussia</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were Guarrantees to her said Succession. Among the rest the <hi>French King</hi> sent to condole her Loss, congratulate her Succession, and assure her, he wou'd according to his Engagements stand by and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her in it: And yet in <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four Months</hi> it appeared, he had treacherously engaged the Kings of <hi>Spain, Poland, Prussia</hi> and Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to divide a great Part at least of her Dominions between them; the <hi>French King</hi> pretending he engaged against her, not to get any of her Dominions for himself, but only as an <hi>Auxiliary</hi> to the <hi>Elector</hi> who laid Claim to them, and whom by his Influence he got to be chosen <hi>Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus all these Powers most barbarously fell on the Estates of that young <hi>Lady</hi> in 1741, but then about <hi>twenty four Years</hi> of Age: In a few Months seized her Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the chief Part of her Province of <hi>Silesia,</hi> with other <hi>Places,</hi> and threatened the <hi>Rest,</hi> while she had none to help her—</p>
            <p>—'Till King GEORGE with the <hi>British Nations,</hi> touch'd with her Distresses, resenting the Treachery and Baseness of her Enemies, viewing the great Danger of <hi>Europe,</hi> Knowing the <hi>French King</hi> was only making all others Tools to his own Ambition; and considering the wise and just Engagement of the <hi>British Crown</hi> to maintain her Possession of the Dominions 
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005856_0014_10270198105A0518"/>
of the <hi>House of Austria,</hi> of absolute Necessity to keep all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> from being enslaved to the insatiable <hi>House of Bourbon;</hi>—arose for her Deliverance; and resolved, that tho' all other States and Princes should prove perfidious, they would give a glorious Instance of their Fidelity to sacred Treaties, as well as of their wise Care for the Safety of <hi>Europe,</hi> and generous Tenderness for <hi>that young Princess</hi> (one of her Principal Friends) in her great Distresses.</p>
            <p>In Pursuance of this—they both sent her Troops and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and bro't the King of <hi>Poland</hi> as Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to help her in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> as also engaged the King of <hi>Sardinia</hi> to help her in <hi>Italy,</hi> sent Monies to him, and employ'd their Fleets to assist him.</p>
            <p>Enrag'd at This, because <hi>our King</hi> is faithful to the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement they had treacherously broken, the <hi>French King,</hi> in the Winter of 1743, 4, sends out his Fleet in Concert with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to fall upon our's near <hi>Toulon;</hi> another power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Armament to invade the Kingdom, and place a <hi>popish Pretender</hi> on the <hi>British Throne;</hi> declares War against us; and sends forth Multitudes of Privateers to destroy our Trade and take our Treasures: On his <hi>South Eastern Border</hi> seizes the Dutchy of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the hereditary Country of the King of <hi>Sardinia:</hi> And in <hi>America</hi> employs both his Privateers and barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> against us.</p>
            <p>Yea, to confirm the League and Unity with <hi>Spain;</hi>—as he had in 1739, married <hi>his eldest Daughter</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> third Son <hi>Don Philip;</hi> so in 1744, he takes a <hi>Daughter</hi> of that King as Consort to his eldest Son the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> agrees to erect a Kingdom for <hi>Don Philip</hi> out of the Queen of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary's</hi> Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and draws both the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> and the rich Republick of <hi>Genoa</hi> into their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless Alliance.</p>
            <p>But the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> dying in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1744, 5, to whom the <hi>French King</hi> pretended to be only an <hi>Auxiliary</hi> in the War; and the Elector's <hi>Son</hi> soon coming to Peace with the Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and quitting all Pretentions to her Dominions; the <hi>French King's</hi> Alliance ceases, and the War with her should

therefore End. But now he is forced to take off the Mask and show the encroaching Views he had in his Heart before. He pretends he must be paid for the infinite Expence she put him to, in defending herself; and he must make it out of her own Dominions, especially her <hi>Austrian Netherlands</hi> which lie handiest to him: i. e. He must have her <hi>Netherlands</hi> for his perfidious Breach of his solemn Engagements to keep her in the Possession of them, for his vast Expence in perfidiously fighting for another against her, and for horridly ravaging a great Part of her other Countries: And so without the least Provocation of her's, only provok'd that she defended herself; he with <hi>a hundred and fifty thousand</hi> Men cruelly falls on her Towns and Cities in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> on his <hi>northeastern Border,</hi> and carries all before him. At the same Time, he also sends the <hi>Young Pretender</hi> and raises a Rebellion in <hi>North Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, the <hi>French Nation</hi> is exceeding numerous and fruitful: The Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> is the largest Kingdom in <hi>Europe,</hi> and full of People: They are industrious, active, subtil, restless: Tho' they are naturally kind and civil; yet they are by a vast Majority <hi>Papists,</hi> and the popish Spirit makes them in Affairs of Religion <hi>cruel:</hi> Witness their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid <hi>Massacres</hi> of the Reformed in 1572; and their number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Barbarities both before and since 1685, when <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV most perfidiously revoked the <hi>Edict of Nantz</hi> which contained their Liberties. All the People and Nobles (except the <hi>popish Clergy</hi>) are absolute Slaves to the <hi>King,</hi> who obliges them to pay him what Monies he wants, makes all their Laws, and orders them as he pleases: And so he does when he is but a <hi>Child,</hi> by a <hi>Regent</hi> or <hi>chief Minister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On such Accounts as these, <hi>France</hi> is the most powerful and dangerous Kingdom in <hi>Europe.</hi> And her <hi>Scituation</hi> is such near the <hi>midst</hi>—having <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> on the E, the <hi>Netherlands</hi> on the N E, the <hi>British Sea</hi> with <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> on the N, the <hi>Atlantick Ocean</hi> on the W, <hi>Spain</hi> on the S W, the <hi>Mediterranean Sea</hi> on the S, and <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> on the S E; that the Countries round her cannot unite their Forces against her, but she can easily pour out all her Force on each as she pleases. Besides, by placing <hi>one</hi> of her <hi>Sons</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Spain,</hi> she makes the Treasures of 
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005856_0016_102701A10FF0A870"/>
               <hi>Mexico, Peru,</hi> and the <hi>South Seas,</hi> and the Power of all that Monarchy subservient to her: Especially since the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will be sure take Care not to prejudice the <hi>French</hi> against him, there being but <hi>two young Persons</hi> between the <hi>Kings of France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in the hereditary Order of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>France</hi> having also placed <hi>one</hi> of her <hi>Grandsons</hi> and <hi>next Brother</hi> of the present childless King of <hi>Spain,</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> has added further to her Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: And for the Reasons above, the Interest of all these <hi>three Kings</hi> must for this Generation at least, be inviolably united.</p>
            <p>By all this we see, the turning out of the wise, prosperous, steady and faithful <hi>British Ministry,</hi> so bent to reduce the Power of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and who were just on the Point of accomplishing their glorious Schemes in 1710—was the unhappy Source of the Debts and Troubles in which the <hi>British Nations,</hi> as well as <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have been involved since, and of the End of which there yet appears no Prospect.</p>
            <p>In Sum, our <hi>dangerous Enemies</hi> were These—The <hi>three</hi> Kings of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> the 1<hi>st</hi> setting on the Throne of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Spain,</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> of the Kingdoms of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> most firmly united in one Design and Interest, to aggrandize their House and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Countries of their Neighbours; having drawn the King of <hi>Prussia</hi> and State of <hi>Genoa</hi> to their Alliance, with the <hi>popish Highlanders</hi> and <hi>Jacobites</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> forming an Army of <hi>Ten Thousand;</hi> on one Side—against King GEORGE, the Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the King of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> on the other.</p>

            <p n="1">1. On the <hi>southeastern</hi> Border of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> were in full Possession of the Dutchy of <hi>Savoy</hi> belonging to our Ally the King of <hi>Sardinia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. With respect to <hi>Italy</hi>—the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Army ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving also taken from the King of <hi>Sardinia</hi> the strong City and Fortress of <hi>Nice,</hi> the very Gate or Passage between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> the Rest of the Barrier being the <hi>Alpine</hi> Range of Mountains, exceeding high, rocky, steep and unpassable by Armies, Baggage and Artillery; they join'd the Troops of <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Naples:</hi> And then those <hi>four</hi> Powers obliged the King of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and Queen of <hi>Hungary's</hi> Forces to retreat before them, took their Cities, and over-run almost all their Territories in that Country; raised heavy Contributions, subsisting on them, and were near besieging the King of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia's</hi> Capital <hi>Turin</hi> itself.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho' the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> had recover'd <hi>Bohemia,</hi> yet the King of <hi>Prussia</hi> had not only taken and kept the chief Part of <hi>Silesia,</hi> but had also beaten the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> and Elector of <hi>Saxony's</hi> united Army; and thereupon had broken into <hi>Saxony,</hi> drove the Elector from <hi>Dresden</hi> his Capital, yea had taken the City, the Queen's and Electors Army retreating from him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the <hi>Netherlands</hi>—The <hi>French</hi> Army of <hi>a hundred Thousand</hi> at <hi>Fontenoy</hi> being intrenched and defended with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Batteries; our allied Army of little more than <hi>Half</hi> their Number attacking them, were obliged to retreat with the Loss of a great many Men: And being so small and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakened, the <hi>French</hi> had carried all before them, taking the Cities of <hi>Tournay, Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Neiuport, Aeth,</hi>  the last Winter, <hi>Brussels;</hi> and since that, <hi>Antwery, Charleroy,</hi> 
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005856_0018_102701A46CAA3440"/>
               <hi>Mons, Namure, &amp;c,</hi> from the Queen of <hi>Hungary;</hi> having so sufficient Power to stop their rapacious Conquests.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In <hi>Great Britain,</hi> a dangerous <hi>Rebellion</hi> under the young Pretender rose and surprizingly prevailed: The Rebels had carried the <hi>North of Scotland,</hi> passed the <hi>Forth,</hi> seized <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Scotland,</hi> beat the King's Army at <hi>Tranent</hi> mightily grew, marched into <hi>England</hi> taken <hi>Carlisle;</hi> on <hi>Dec.</hi> 4, the very Day before our last annual Thanksgiving, had entered <hi>Derby</hi> the chief Town of the Shire, in the very Heart of <hi>England,</hi> but about <hi>a hundred Miles</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> in their March for that City: And the Ports of <hi>France</hi> were full of Vessels, Soldiers and warlike Stores, to supply the Rebels and invade the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the <hi>Winter Season,</hi> while our Ships were fully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to guard the Coasts of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers intirely reigned before the Mouth of the <hi>English Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> took almost all the Vessels of our Nation bound into it, and carried the People into Captivity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And lastly, A rich Fleet of Galleons got also safe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> to recruit their Funds: Whereby both the <hi>Spanish, French, Genoese</hi> and <hi>Neapolitans</hi> were more enabled and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited to carry on the War with fresh Vigour against us.</p>
            <p>And these were some of the dangerous Circumstances we were in, in <hi>Europe.</hi> We come to consider</p>
            <p n="2">2] Our more near and especial Dangers in <hi>North America,</hi>—in these Particulars—</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>last Winter</hi> and <hi>early Spring,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> with the utmost Application fitted out at <hi>Brest</hi> and <hi>Rochfort,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most powerful Armament against these <hi>Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,</hi> that was ever sent into <hi>North America:</hi> Having <hi>twenty</hi> Men of War, a <hi>hundred</hi> Transports, about <hi>Eight Thousand</hi> disciplined Troops with veteran Officers, and vast Quantities of Provision, Powder, Shot, Arms, Cannon, Bombs and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, sufficient to take the strongest Places.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005856_0019_102701A9B9C33370"/>
2. They were all under one Commander of Figure, Duke <hi>D'Anville;</hi> a Nobleman of Ability, Skill and Courage; who came with Resolution to exert himself to his own Honour, and to the Glory of his King and Nation, or die in the Cause: And the whole Armament and all their Officers, both naval and terrene being united under him, had a natural Tendency to prevent Contention, and promote the Execution of every Order.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They own'd they had the best Plans and many skilful Pilots with them, well acquainted with all the Coasts and Harbours of <hi>Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia</hi> and <hi>New England;</hi> in particular of <hi>Louisbourg, Canso, Jebucta, Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, Casco Bay, Boston,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They came with the very exciting Motives, both of <hi>Resentment, Policy</hi> and <hi>Necessity.—Of Resentment;</hi> for our saving <hi>Annapolis,</hi> and disappointing the <hi>French</hi> Invasion there in 1744; and for our taking <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> destroying their Fishery, blocking up the <hi>Bay</hi> of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and taking their great Man of War, and their <hi>East India</hi> and <hi>South Sea</hi> Ships, in 1745:—Of <hi>Policy;</hi> to recover their lost fortified City and Harbour of <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> their lost Opportunity by their Privateers thence to seize our Vessels, their lost Fishery with the infinite Profits thence arising, their lost Fort and Harbour of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> their lost Territory of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and their lost Reputation both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> especially among the <hi>Indian</hi> Salvages: And lastly, of <hi>Necessity;</hi> to save their <hi>Canada,</hi> with all their Settlements and Trade, in <hi>North America;</hi> and either by taking <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> oblige us to come to a Peace and save their Encroachments in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> or by taking <hi>Annapolis,</hi> oblige us to return them <hi>Cape Breton;</hi> and to save themselves from ignominious Death or Ruin, in case they returned without taking the one or the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That which rendred our Case more dangerous, was, that we were a long while wholly ignorant of their Designs against us: And when we had them hinted, we were easy with hearing that Admiral <hi>Martin</hi> was blocking them up, first at <hi>Brest</hi> and then at <hi>Rochfort,</hi> and that we had a powerful 
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005856_0020_102701AB5F4C96A8"/>
Fleet of Men of War and Transports preparing at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to come on the Expedition to <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. At Length they got out of <hi>Brest</hi> and sailed to <hi>Rochfort:</hi> On <hi>June</hi> 11, they sailed from this last Port, passed by Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Martin's</hi> Squadron unobserved, and he cou'd not find what Way they were gone: Yea, while they were coming toward us, Admiral <hi>Lestock</hi> with his Fleet at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> sailed <hi>seven</hi> Times from <hi>England;</hi> and was as oft drove back by contrary Winds, 'till <hi>Mid-September,</hi> when our Enemies Fleet was come to <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and the <hi>British Ministry</hi> judging it too late in the Year, diverted their Enterprize.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the mean Time; while Duke <hi>D'Anville's</hi> Fleet is coming, a fatal Illness sweeps away many of our <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Soldiers at <hi>Cape Breton:</hi> And being now without any Help from <hi>England</hi> or any where else; if GOD had given our Foes a speedy Passage, and had brought them on in Health to <hi>Louisburg;</hi> they had come there with Surprize: And with their Showers of Bombs from <hi>twenty five</hi> Mortars, and Cannon Shot from <hi>fifty</hi> Brass Field Pieces, it seems highly probable, they wou'd soon have taken the Place. And then <hi>Placentia</hi> and St. <hi>John's</hi> in <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> with all their Fish and Vessels wou'd have been as nothing to them. All the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> and the neighbouring Places wou'd have join'd them at once, and made them <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twelve Thousand</hi> strong, besides their Seamen. <hi>Annapolis</hi> wou'd have been soon reduced. And then their mighty and triumphing Forces, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> both by Land and Sea, wou'd have doubtless come quick all along our <hi>Eastern</hi> Shoars, carried all before them like a sweeping Deluge: And where they cou'd be stop'd, and whether <hi>this Town</hi> cou'd have baffled them, GOD only knows.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the mean Time we are <hi>this Summer</hi> exceedingly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested with our <hi>Indian</hi> Enemies round about, both in this and the neighbouring Provinces: Murthering our Men, Women, Children; carrying many into a barbarous Captivity; breaking up many Houses and divers Villages and new Towns, destroying Cattle and Fields of Corn; yea <hi>seven hundred French</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> destroying a Fort <hi>an hundred</hi> Foot square on our <hi>western</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005856_0021_102701AE5A6DCCA8"/>
Borders on <hi>Aug.</hi> 19: Reducing us to such Distresses as have not been known in the present Generation: And <hi>Sep.</hi> 2 we are informed, that about <hi>two thousand French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> were assembled at <hi>Menis</hi> in <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> in order to besiege <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Our Trouble is yet increased by our surprizing Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the <hi>six</hi> valiant Nations of <hi>Mohawk Indians</hi> above our <hi>western</hi> Borders, who had been our constant Friends from the Beginning of these Colonies:—That the <hi>French</hi> had made them believe, they had taken an <hi>English Letter,</hi> wherein they pretend we wrote, <q>We intended first to subdue <hi>Canada,</hi> and then destroy the <hi>Indian Nations,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Canada</hi> being the only Obstacles that hinder us:</q>—Which made most dangerous Impressions on them, raised their Jealousies, began an Alienation, disposed them to join our Enemies, and was like to lead to fatal Consequences.</p>
            <p n="10">10. All this while we were wholly ignorant of the <hi>French Fleet</hi> coming towards us—'till at the same Time, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 2, we had a Hint in a Letter from <hi>Hull</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 24, by a Ship from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> that they were sailed about <hi>ten Days</hi> before, but none knew whither: <hi>Sept.</hi> 9, by a Ship from <hi>Liverpool,</hi> was the Hint above confirmed, and that many in <hi>England</hi> tho't them bound for <hi>North America.</hi> About a Week after, we begin to hear a Rumour of a large Number of Ships seen near <hi>Cape Sable Shoar;</hi> but whether <hi>French</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> we are at a Loss to guess. About a <hi>Week</hi> after, the Rumour is confirmed; but who they are, remains uncertain, 'till <hi>Sept.</hi> 28: And then by Express from Governor <hi>Knowles</hi> and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Townsend</hi> at <hi>Louisburg,</hi> we are inform'd they are the <hi>French Armada,</hi> were <hi>seventy</hi> Sail when they came from <hi>France; fourteen</hi> being Ships of the Line from <hi>fifty</hi> to <hi>seventy four</hi> Guns, <hi>two</hi> Fire Ships, with <hi>eight thousand</hi> Troops on board; standing for <hi>Jebucta</hi> or <hi>le Have:</hi> And by a Vessel from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> that the <hi>four French</hi> Men of War which had escaped Commodore <hi>Mitchel</hi> near <hi>Domingo,</hi> were design'd to join them.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And lastly, About <hi>Mid-September, Eight</hi> Ships of the Line and about <hi>forty</hi> others arrive at <hi>Jebucta,</hi> the Port of their Rendezvous, on the <hi>south eastern</hi> Shoar of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> one of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005856_0022_102701B424E98238"/>
the finest Harbours of the Globe; in which the <hi>British Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> had utterly neglected for a Course of <hi>thirty Years</hi> from the Peace of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> to settle one Inhabitant; and in the very Way to interrupt all our Fishery, and even all the Trade from <hi>Great Britain, Ireland, Newfoundland</hi> and <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> to the Colonies on the <hi>Main,</hi> and from These to them: There they water, wood, refresh, careen, refit; thence take our Ships, strike Surprize and Terror thro' the Countries round about them. And thence deserting their Design of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Louisburg,</hi> they set sail with all their Power towards us.</p>
            <p>And thus, in the Room of our long look'd for Friends from <hi>England</hi> to go against <hi>Canada,</hi> there are now coming on a powerful Armament of resolute Enemies; and none to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them or defend us against them. We look for our powerful Friends, but our Eyes fail us, and we look in vain. Our Case seems like that of <hi>David, Psalm</hi> 142 and 3, <q>We look on our right Hand and behold; but there is no Man that knows us, Refuge fails us, no Man seems to care for our Souls: We cry unto Thee, O LORD! Thou art our Refuge and Portion in the Land of the Living! O attend to our Cry, for we are brought very low—we stretch forth our Hands to Thee!—hear us speedily, O LORD:—Cause us to hear thy Loving Kindness in the Morning, for in Thee do we trust—Deliver us O LORD from our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:—We flee to Thee to hide us!</q> And we further cried as <hi>Asaph</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 83; <q>Keep not thou Silence O GOD! hold not thy Peace and be not still, O GOD! For lo thine Enemies make a Tumult, and they that hate Thee lift up the Head: They have taken crafty Council against thy People: They have said, <q>Come and let us cut them off from being a People, that the Name of <hi>New-England</hi> may be no more in Remembrance.</q> O our GOD, make them as Stubble before the Wind: As the Fire burneth the Woods, and as the Flame setteth the Mountains on Fire; [as we often see in <hi>America</hi>] so persecute them with thy Tempest, and make them afraid with thy Storm: Fill their Faces with Shame; that they may seek thy Name, O LORD! [or if they will not seek it] let them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and troubled for ever:—That Men may know, 
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005856_0023_102701B6F8F2F2F0"/>
that Thou, whose Name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most High over all the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is Part of our <hi>late dangerous Circumstances:</hi> And now, <hi>stand still and see the Salvation of the</hi> LORD!</p>
            <p>This therefore brings us</p>
            <p n="3">III. To view the <hi>wonderful Salvations</hi> GOD has wrought for us, while we, in <hi>America</hi> especially, have stood still and seen them.</p>
            <p>And</p>
            <p n="1">1] For the Salvations wrought the Year past in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Blessing of GOD on the Mediation of King GEORGE, the King of <hi>Prussia</hi> in <hi>December last,</hi> came to a Peace with the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and Queen of <hi>Hungary:</hi> wherein he acknowledged as <hi>Emperor,</hi> her Imperial Consort the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> lately chosen to that high Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Whereby all Contests about the Election were ended, and the <hi>Queen</hi> became relieved of a bloody, weakening and expensive War on that Side of her Dominions, and cou'd spare <hi>fifty Thousand</hi> or more of her Troops in 1746, both for the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>Italy,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> and King of <hi>Sardinia's</hi> Army being thus increased, thro' the Help of GOD, have twice defeated the <hi>French, Spanish, Genoese</hi> and <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Army; obtained such Victories as have wholly broken the Power of our Enemies There; killed and taken near <hi>thirty Thousand</hi> Soldiers, made the rest to fly, recovered all the Places ravished from them; driven the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Italy;</hi> taken the City and Republick of <hi>Genoa,</hi> obliged them to relinquish the Queen of <hi>Hungary's</hi> Debts, pay a great Sum of Money, and come to an Agreement with her and her Allies. So that the War seems to be ended likewise in <hi>that Part</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi> and the King of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and Queen of <hi>Hungary's</hi> Forces there, ready to fall on the <hi>Southeastern</hi> Part of <hi>France,</hi> for the rest of the War.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:005856_0024_102701B8032688A8"/>
3. GOD was also pleased to break the Power of the <hi>Rebels</hi> in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> especially by employing Prince WILLIAM, to drive them out of <hi>England,</hi> reduce <hi>Carlisle,</hi> fright them from the Siege of <hi>Stirling,</hi> and wholly defeat them in the glorious and happy Battle of CULLODEN, on <hi>April</hi> 16: And then and since, to take many of their Chiefs and Soldiers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of whom have received capital Punishment; and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Remainder. Whereby we can also spare a greater Number of Forces in the <hi>Austrian Netherlands,</hi> to drive our <hi>French</hi> Enemies back, and also engage in Expeditions by Sea.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Tho' the <hi>French</hi> have taken <hi>five</hi> strong Cities from the Queen of Hungary in the <hi>Austrian Netherlands;</hi> yet they have lost a great many Soldiers There by Seiges, Fatigues and Sickness: And our allied Army there is now grown so great, and the <hi>next Year</hi> like to be greater; that there's a hopeful Prospect, thro' the Help of GOD, of beating them back in one Year more: Or, while the King of Sardinia pours his Forces into the <hi>Southeastern</hi> Side of <hi>France,</hi> obliging her soon to resign her late Incroachments and yield to righteous Terms of Peace. Yea, if the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> wou'd join us; it looks as if, thro' the divine Assistance, <hi>France</hi> wou'd in one Year more be forced to return both to <hi>Lorrain, Germany</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> all the Incroachments she has made upon them these <hi>two hundred Years;</hi> and be disabled for a great while to come from disturbing <hi>Europe,</hi> or hurting us or others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. GOD has been also pleased to remove by Death, the late King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Whereby he has put a present happy Period to the mischievous Reign of his ambitious <hi>Queen,</hi> who has been a principal Spring of all the Troubles of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> from that Court and Nation these <hi>thirty Years;</hi> and set on the Throne the late King's <hi>eldest Son,</hi> who was not born of <hi>Her,</hi> but of the King of <hi>Sardinia's Sister:</hi> And this new King, in Part has broken the League with <hi>France</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by deserting the Project of forming a Kingdom for her second Son <hi>Don Philip,</hi> out of the Queen of <hi>Hungary's</hi> Countries in <hi>Italy;</hi> and seems disposed to Peace with us and our Allies.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:005856_0025_102701C02FD12A48"/>
6. By the Death of the <hi>Dauphiness</hi> without Male Offspring, who was a Sister of his by the Father's Side; the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Courts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> seems to be further weakened. And by the Ascent of King GEORGE'S Son in Law the <hi>Prince Royal</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> to that Throne, who had married his youngest Daughter Princess <hi>Louisa;</hi> the Union between the Courts of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> seems to be further strengthened.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And lastly, The <hi>French East India</hi> Trade and Company, by the Flames consuming their large and costly Houses, Warehouses and Stores at Port <hi>l' Orient</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and by Commodore <hi>Barnet's</hi> taking their Ships and Forts in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> seems to be almost ruined: While the seizing their Wealth adds to our's; and our <hi>East India</hi> Ships are come safe to <hi>England;</hi> as well as our Treasures took from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> near <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But</p>
            <p n="2">2] Let us now stand still and see the Salvations of GOD in <hi>North America</hi>—</p>
            <p>On <hi>two</hi> Accounts in general, tho' widely different, both the <hi>last Year</hi> and <hi>This</hi> have been as remarkable as any we have seen, since the happy <hi>Accession</hi> of the Protestant House of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> to the <hi>British Crown:</hi>—The <hi>last Year</hi> 1745,—for GOD'S succeeding our Enterprize in a wondrous Manner, and giving us <hi>Cape Breton;</hi>—and <hi>This,</hi>—for his working wonderful <hi>Salvations</hi> for us, while we cou'd only stand still and see them with Admiration: Let this be ever the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of 1746.</p>
            <p>While we knew nothing of Danger, GOD beheld it, and was working Salvation for us. And when we had none to help in <hi>America,</hi> He even prevented our Friends in <hi>Europe</hi> from coming to succour us; that we might see our Salvation was <hi>his</hi> Work alone, and that the Glory belongs intirely to <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here are the following Things observable—</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005856_0026_102701C66F8B5748"/>
1. That our Enemies Fleet were detained so long in the Harbours of <hi>France,</hi> even to the 11th of <hi>June,</hi> tho' ready long before: Whereby a greater <hi>Fomes</hi> was prepared for scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical Weaknesses and Ails, before they arrived at <hi>America;</hi> whereby they also lost the cooler Weather and more easterly Winds of the <hi>Spring,</hi> were kept for the Calms and Heat of the <hi>Summer,</hi> their Voyage must be lengthened, and they cou'd not come with quite so much Surprize upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That after their getting clear from the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> they shou'd be led to bear so far to the <hi>Southward:</hi> Whereby they not only went from the Straiter Course, but likewise into a more rarified Air and calmer Latitudes, which yet further served to lengthen their Voyage: And whereby they also went into more sultry Climates, even in the hottest Months of the <hi>Summer;</hi> the Air between-decks among so great a Number so closely stowed, must be more suffocating, putrid and nauseous, and both further weaken, and breed Diseases.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That partly by these Means, partly by Calms, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by contrary Winds; their Voyage was so lengthened out, even to <hi>ninety Days</hi> from <hi>Rochfort,</hi> that it was the 9th of <hi>September</hi> before the forwardest of them arrived at <hi>Jebucta.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. That by the Means above, and it may be others, GOD was pleased to visit them with such a mortal Sickness; that they owned, <hi>Thirteen Hundred</hi> died at Sea; and most of the rest were extreamly weakened, wasted and dispirited.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That by terrible <hi>Storms</hi> they were likewise so dispersed in the midst of the Ocean; that by <hi>Aug.</hi> 26, they had left but <hi>twelve</hi> Ships of the <hi>Line</hi> and <hi>forty one</hi> others, besides <hi>five</hi> Prizes they happened to meet with.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That on <hi>Sept.</hi> 2, at <hi>One</hi> at Noon, when they came near the Shoals of the Isle of <hi>Sables,</hi> the most dangerous Place in all their Passage, and had but <hi>three Days</hi> Sail to <hi>Jebucta;</hi> GOD was pleased to raise against them such a violent Storm of Wind, which held all that Day and Night: Wherein <hi>one</hi> of their Transports was lost on the Shoals; <hi>four</hi> Ships of the Line and a Transport were seen in great Distress, and never 
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005856_0027_102701CCC987A2E0"/>
heard of after, and the rest of the Fleet had like to have run on the Shoals in that terrible Night, and were wholly disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Or if they had been but <hi>three Days</hi> earlier, they had got to <hi>Jebucta</hi> before the Storm.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Weather after the Storm, was so very <hi>foggy</hi> for several Days, that Duke <hi>D'Anville</hi> their Admiral and General was obliged to lie off and on, not venturing to approach the <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> Shoar; that it was <hi>Sept.</hi> 12, before he got, with but <hi>one more</hi> Ship of the Line, <abbr>viz.</abbr> his Vice Admiral, <hi>three</hi> more Men of War and <hi>five</hi> Transports, into <hi>Jebucta:</hi> There being but <hi>one</hi> of the Fleet got in <hi>three</hi> Days before him, and but <hi>three</hi> more in <hi>three</hi> Days after him; his Rear Admiral with <hi>ten</hi> of the Line and all the rest yet missing. And finding his few Ships so shattered, so many Men dead, so many sickly, and no more of his Fleet come in; he sunk into Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Sept.</hi> 15 died; but in such a Condition, and so much swelled, it was generally tho't he poysoned himself, and was buried without any Ceremony. Upon which their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment sell upon the <hi>Council of War,</hi> their Union was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely broken, and their Counsels grew divided.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That tho' after the Storm, the <hi>Rear Admiral</hi> with <hi>five</hi> more of the <hi>Line</hi> and <hi>twenty seven</hi> more of the Fleet besides the Prizes, discovered each other and gathered together; yet the Weather being foggy and thick, they did not arrive at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucta</hi> 'till the Day after Duke <hi>D' Anville</hi> died—Or their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival <hi>two</hi> Days sooner might have revived his Spirits and saved his Life: Tho' they were so exceedingly shattered and sickly, they were forced to stay and loose their fittest Time for doing us Mischief 'till near the <hi>midst</hi> of <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. That upon the Death of the <hi>Duke,</hi> the Vice Admiral <hi>Estournell</hi> being the chief Commander, in Consideration of the deplorable Case they were in, proposed to return to <hi>France</hi> to save the rest of the Men: But the Council of War oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and voting against him, he was on <hi>Sept.</hi> 19 in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, found in his Apartment fallen on his Sword, and the next Morning died also: Whereby the chief Command de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd on the Rear Admiral <hi>Jonquire;</hi> who with the Council of War resolved to attack some <hi>English</hi> Place in these northern 
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005856_0028_1026DF4F1DCB3280"/>
Parts before they wou'd think of returning. In the mean while, they landed their Men to refresh them: And yet their Sickness so prevailed, that they owned there died <hi>Eleven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Thirty more</hi> at <hi>Jebucta</hi> before they left it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It was also very remarkable, that while the <hi>French</hi> were so generally very sickly, and so many constantly dying, both aboard and ashoar; our <hi>English</hi> Captives, tho' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionately tending upon and helping them continually, were so universally healthy and strong, that the poor sickly <hi>French</hi> cou'd not forbear to express their Wonder: <hi>Our People</hi> taken captive by them being more merciful to them than those of their own Nation. And yet the Sickness spread among our enemy <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and 'tis said carried off near half their Number.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In the mean Time our careful <hi>Governour</hi> sends out Spies and gets Intelligence—By the Help of GOD removes the Jealousies of the <hi>Mohawk Indians,</hi> renews our ancient League of Friendship with them, engages them on our Side against the <hi>French Canadians</hi>—sends Companies of Soldiers, who had lifted Volunteers for <hi>Canada,</hi> to help defend <hi>Annapolis;</hi> Admiral <hi>Warren</hi> sending his 50 Gun Ship thither also: And then our <hi>Governour</hi> calls in most of the Regiments of this Province to defend <hi>our Capital,</hi> who come in with wondrous Chearfulness: Sends Express to Governour <hi>Knowles</hi> and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Townsand</hi> at <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> with the <hi>London</hi> Prints inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Admiral <hi>Lestock's</hi> waiting for a fair Wind in <hi>England,</hi> with <hi>eighteen</hi> Ships of the Line, to sail <hi>thither:</hi> And <hi>Octo.</hi> 6, with Advice of his Majesty's Council, and at the Desire of the House of Representatives, orders <hi>Thursday</hi> the 16th, a Day of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi> thro' the <hi>Province</hi> on this great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p n="12">12. About <hi>October</hi> 10, the <hi>French</hi> Council of War at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucta</hi> being sensible that by dispersing Storms and wasting Sickness, they are utterly disabled for attempting <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> resolve to sail and take <hi>Annapolis.</hi> And if they had staid but <hi>one Week</hi> longer, they wou'd have bad a Season of suitable Weather for it. But a Cruizer of their's having happily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Express above for <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> with the <hi>London</hi> Prints 
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005856_0029_102701D5E779E948"/>
informing of Admiral <hi>Lestock's</hi> expected coming, and the Master of the Vessel happily forgetting to observe his Order and throw his Packets overboard; they were carried into <hi>Jebucta</hi> and opened on the 11<hi>th</hi> early in the Morning in a Council of War. Upon which, surprized, in the utmost Hurry, they pull down all their Tents, burn a Line of Battle Ship, with a Snow from <hi>Carolina,</hi> a Vessel from <hi>Antigua,</hi> and some Fishing Schooners, embark their Soldiers; order two thousand <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> to march from <hi>Menis</hi> to <hi>Annapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi> And <hi>October</hi> 13, with about <hi>forty</hi> Sail, <hi>twenty</hi> Engineers, and <hi>thirty</hi> Pilots from near <hi>Annapolis,</hi> they came out to go round <hi>Cape Sables,</hi> and meet them there; having wrote to the Court, that they determin'd to keep the Seas 'till <hi>Nov.</hi> 15, N S, if they cou'd not get in sooner.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The <hi>next Day,</hi> they sent <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> of their Fleet with their Sick to <hi>France:</hi> The Distemper still increasing; our Captives saw them throwing their Dead out of most of their Ships into the Sea, every Day after they left <hi>Jebucta,</hi> for the <hi>three Days</hi> they continued with them. <hi>October</hi> 15, near the <hi>Isle of Sables</hi> a second Time came on a great and Cold Storm, which scattered them again: Yet the <hi>next Day,</hi> getting once more together; and persevering in their Purpose, they dismiss'd our Captives, who that Night left them lying by, and saw them no more.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But the <hi>same Day,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Thursday Octo.</hi> 16, is kept the Day of <hi>General Fasting and Prayer</hi> throughout the Churches in <hi>this Province,</hi> on this great Emergency. And <hi>that very Night</hi> ensuing, the glorious GOD entirely baffled all their Purposes, and put a total End to their mischievous Enterprize. He mightily arose, and wrought a full Salvation for us. He sent a more furious Storm of Wind and Rain and Hail, than ever—which held to the next Day Noon—which they cou'd not stand before—Which so dispersed and broke them, they cou'd never get together again: And several Ships were so crazy, and weakly handed, that 'tis apprehended by our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed Captives, who were in the same Storm; that some were overset, some others foundered and sunk in the mighty Waters: And the remaining Men of War in View, so shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and discouraged, that they determined for the <hi>West India 
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005856_0030_102701D9E65FA390"/>
Islands;</hi> and sent their <hi>Nova Scotia Pilots</hi> home, with Orders to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indian Army</hi> who had march'd to <hi>Annapolis,</hi> to leave their Enterprize and get away. The scattered Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, it seems most likely, are gone back to <hi>France,</hi> abased and confounded.</p>
            <p>In fine, It is also remarkable, that <hi>two French Frigates</hi> who privately came to <hi>Jebucta</hi> in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> to gather the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in all the neighbouring Countries, and rais'd their mighty Expectations; shou'd sail from thence a little before the Fleet's arrival:—That the <hi>four large Men of War</hi> who escap'd Commodore <hi>Mitchel</hi> near <hi>Domingo,</hi> and sail'd to the <hi>Cape Sable</hi> Shoar, in full Expectation of finding them; but surpriz'd to hear nothing of them, and it growing late in the Year, shou'd sail away but a few Days before the <hi>Duke's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and entirely miss them:—And that a few Days after the Fleet sail'd from <hi>Jebucta,</hi> arrived there <hi>two more Men of War</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> with absolute Orders to take <hi>Annapolis,</hi> and not presume to return without it: And being told they were gone for the Purpose, made haste after them: But arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thither, and instead of the triumphing Fleet and Army, the <hi>Menis Pilots</hi> returning with the dreadful Tydings, and our Man of War there going to attack them; confounded also, they hastened away.</p>
            <p>Thus, when on our solemn <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>General Prayer,</hi> we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly cried to the LORD, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> lxviii. 1, 2 <q>Let GOD arise, let his Enemies be scattered, let them that hate him flee before him: As Smoak is driven away, so drive thou them away: As Wax melteth before the Fire, so let the [inveterate] Wicked perish at the Presence of GOD!</q>—When notwithstanding all the Displays of his Anger against them, he see them set upon Mischief:—<q>And when he looked, and there was none to help us, and he wondered there was none to uphold us:—Then his own Arm bro't Salvation to us, and his Fury upheld him: He trode down our Enemies in his Anger, he made them drunk in his Fury, and he brought down their Strength to the Earth. Terrors took hold on them as Waters: A Tempest bore them away in the Night: The East Wind carried 
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005856_0031_102701DB86107D80"/>
them away, and they departed: And with a Storm he hurled them out of their Place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Sorrows of Death encompassed us, and the Floods of ungodly Men made us afraid: In our Distress we called upon the LORD, and cried to our GOD: He heard our Voice out of his Temple, and our Cry came before him, even into his Ears. Then, he bowed the Heavens and came down, and Darkness was under his Feet: He rode on a Cherub, and did fly; yea, he did fly on the Wings of the Wind: He made Darkness his secret Place; his Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion round about him were dark Waters and thick Clouds of the Skies: Yea, he sent out his Arrows and scattered them: Then the Channels of Waters were seen, and the Foundations of the World were discovered; at thy Rebuke O LORD, at the Blast of the Breath of thy Nostrils!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Before him went the Pestilence, and burning Coals of Diseases went forth at his Feet: He stood and measured the Earth; he beheld and drove asunder the Nations. I saw the Tents of <hi>Cushan</hi> in Affliction, and the Curtains of the Land of <hi>Midian</hi> did tremble. Was thy Wrath against the Sea, that thou didst ride upon thy Horses? But thy Chariots were <hi>Salvation!</hi> The Mountains saw thee and they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: The overflowing of the Water passed by: The Deep uttered his Voice, and lift up his Hands on high! Thou wentest forth for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of thy People: Thou woundedst the Head out of the House of the Wicked: They came out as a Whirlwind to scatter us: Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing was to devour the Poor: Thou didst walk through the Sea with thine Horses, thro' the Heap of great Waters! When we heard, our Belly trembled, our Lips quivered at the Noise, Rottenness entred into our Bones; and we trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ourselves, that we might rest in the Day of Trouble, when they were coming to the People, to invade us with their Troops.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French Officers</hi> told <hi>one of our Masters</hi>—that when they came from <hi>Rochfort,</hi> they were <hi>ninety seven</hi> Sail, <hi>thirty</hi> of which were Men of War: That they had <hi>forty thousand</hi> Arms, with Proportionable Ammunition and Blankets for the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:005856_0032_102701DEC4AC0B80"/>
and the Master saw above a <hi>hundred</hi> Chests of Arms with a great Quantity of Lead landed out of <hi>one</hi> Ship of thirty Guns which took him: That there were <hi>seven thousand North American French &amp; Indians</hi> to join them: That upon their taking <hi>Annapolis,</hi> they expected <hi>eighteen French</hi> Ships of the Line &amp; <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Spanish</hi> Men of War wou'd be sent early in the Spring to join the Fleet on these Coasts; which was a Matter generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd &amp; depended upon among them: that they were resolved to destroy the Frontier Settlements of the <hi>English Colonies,</hi> and had a great Dependance on getting a strong Footing on this Part of the <hi>North American</hi> Continent.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But how do the Heathen rage, and the People imagine a vain Thing! The Kings of the Earth set themselves, and the Rulers take Counsel together. He that sits in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens has them in Derision. He disappoints the Devices of the Crafty, so that their Hands cannot perform their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize: He taketh the Wise in their own Craftiness, and the Counsel of the Froward is carried headlong. Yea, he speaketh to them in his Wrath, and vexeth them in his sore Displeasure: He breaks them in Pieces as with a Rod of Iron: He dashes them in Places like a Potter's Vessel. But he saveth the Poor from the Sword, from their Mouth, and from the Hand of the Mighty. Be wise therefore, O ye Kings: Be instructed ye Judges of the Earth: Serve the LORD with Fear, and rejoice with trembling: Submit to the SON of GOD; least he be angry, and ye perish: When his Wrath is Kindled but a little, blessed are all they that put their Trust in him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But we will sing to the LORD; for he hath triumphed gloriously: He hath thrown our Enemies into the Sea. The LORD is our Strength and Song, and he is become our Salvation: He is our GOD, and we will prepare him an Habitation in the highest Room of our Souls; our Fathers GOD, and we will exalt him: The LORD is a Man of War, JEHOVAH is his Name. Our Enemies Hosts he has broke in the Sea: With the Blast of thy Nostrils, the Waters were gathered together; the Floods stood upright as an Heap: Thou didst blow with thy Wind; the Sea covered them, they sank as Lead in the mighty Waters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:005856_0033_102701E09F1D8BB0"/>
               <q>But the LORD is our Light and Strength, our Shield and our Salvation. We will extol thee O GOD! For thou hast lifted us up, and not made our Foes to rejoice over us. In our Time of Trouble, we cried to thee; and thou hast sent from Heaven and saved us from those who would have swallowed us up; thou hast put them to Shame that hated us. Thou hast turned our Mourning into Dancing: Thou hast put off our Sackcloth, and girded us with Gladness; that our Glory may sing Praise to thee, and not be silent: O LORD our GOD! We will give Thanks to Thee, and praise thy Name for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yea, we will Praise thee O LORD, among the People: We will sing to thee among the Nations. Be thou exalted O GOD above the Heavens: Let thy Glory be above all the Earth! Sing unto GOD ye Kingdoms of the Earth: O sing Praises unto the LORD;—to him that rideth upon the Heavens of Heavens; ascribe ye Strength unto him; His Excellency is over <hi>Israel,</hi> his Strength is in the Clouds. Let the Heavens and Earth praise him, the Seas, and every Thing that moves therein: Let the Sea roar, and the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof: Let the Floods clap their Hands: Let the Hills be joyful together before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the Earth; with Righteousness shall he judge the World, and the People with Equity.</q>
