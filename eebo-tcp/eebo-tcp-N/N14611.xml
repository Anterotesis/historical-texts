            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>DEUTERONOMY, xxxii. 8.</bibl>
               <q>When the Moſt High divided to the nations their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when he ſeparated the ſons of Adam, he ſet the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Iſrael.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>JUST thoughts of Deity are ſublime and exalted thoughts; ſuch are the ſentiments of the great legiſlator and judge of Iſrael, in my text, while he has in full view the attributes and character of that being who is over all.</p>
            <p>Moſes had ſeen much of the glory of his Maker in Egypt, at the red ſea, in the Arabian deſerts, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on Mount Sinai, where his infinite majeſty, his awful and endearing glories, beamed forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in giving the law. More was then ſeen of God than ever had been ſeen before.</p>
            <p>This great man having ſuſtained the toils and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of an eminent public ſtation forty years; and having conducted the choſen tribes to the borders of the promiſed land; the divine poem out of which my text is taken, was put into his mouth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the benefit of the people of God, in every age of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018530_0005_0FA7B4D1EA0DA3E8"/>
The burden of the ſong is the infinite rectitude, greatneſs and glory of God; the exceeding depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perverſeneſs of ſinful man, the wiſdom and bleſſedneſs of obedience, and the folly and miſery of rebellion againſt heaven.</p>
            <p>In the fourth verſe the prophet ſpeaks of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being in moſt becoming language. "He is a rock, his work is perfect, all his ways are judgment, a God of truth, without iniquity, juſt and right is he."</p>
            <p>And in my text three points of doctrine meet our view, and demand our ſerious attention.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. All nations of the earth are at the abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Moſt High, to be divided and ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his pleaſure.</item>
               <item>II. His expreſs will that mankind ſhould live on equal terms, as brethren.</item>
               <item>III. That all the nations of the earth ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his own peculiar nation and kingdom.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe thoughts, with their application, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the preſent hour.</p>
            <p>I. All nations of the earth are at the abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Moſt High.</p>
            <p>"When the Moſt High divided to the nations their inheritance." Here God appears inhabiting eternity, and having in his own infinite mind a moſt glorious and perfect plan, relating to all the future inhabitants of the world; the ſituation, numbers,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018530_0006_0FA7B4D2A8F06478"/>
riſe and fall, of the various ſtates and empires that were to overſpread the earth.</p>
            <p>God determined all theſe things, in his boundleſs wiſdom and goodneſs, before he began to operate in his providence; that point in the vaſt round of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be conceived of, when he had not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</p>
            <p>He ſaw all his works, and all the works and ways of men, the whole buſineſs and reſult of the world, as clearly before he began to create, as he will at the conſummation of all things.</p>
            <p>What God has determined <hi>ſhall be done,</hi> is often in ſacred ſcripture, ſpoken of in a paſt tenſe, <hi>as already done;</hi> inſtances in the prophets are many; and the manner of expreſſion is deſigned to impreſs our minds with a ſenſe of the divine immutability.—"My coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſhall ſtand and I will do all my pleaſure." "He ruleth in the armies of heaven, and among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the world, and none can ſtay his hand."</p>
            <p>What is paſt we all know to be certain, and what God has determined and foreknown is equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. So when future ſcenes of glory and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to mankind, were opened to ſaint John, ſcenes that require many ages for their accompliſhment, he that ſat on the throne ſaid, "<hi>It is done:</hi> I am alpha and omega, the begining and the end."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſtumble at this part of the divine charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let them remember <hi>God is incomprehenſible:</hi> if any would thence infer that there is no freedom of will, or moral agency in men; no deſert of praiſe or blame;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018530_0007_0FA7B4D36BF24A38"/>
let them look into their own boſoms, and conſult the certain feelings of their own hearts.</p>
            <p>The divine decrees and certain foreknowledge, are neceſſary to the perfection of Deity, and perfectly conſiſtent with the entire freedom and moral agency of intelligent creatures; and if men or angels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not explain all that is connected with theſe doctrines, it only verifies that we cannot "by ſearching find out God, or the Almighty unto perfection." We know not what it is to be God, to think as God thinks and decree as he decrees.</p>
            <p>The divine Being in his wiſe fixed purpoſe, "di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to the nations their inheritance, and ſeparated the ſons of Adam," long "before he had formed the earth or the ſea or the higheſt part of the duſt of the world."</p>
            <p>But before the days of Moſes he had in part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded his infinitely wiſe and good purpoſes, in the movements of his Providence. The world was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and the human kind to repleniſh it: The garden of Eden was given to them as their inheritance in the days of innocence but for rebellion againſt heaven they were ſoon turned out of it.</p>
            <p>Nothing but ſacred hiſtory looks back to this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly period, there we find mankind multiplied and ſpread abroad on the earth, in how many tribes or nations we are not informed; but may argue from the long period of time before the flood, about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years: And the longevity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that a great part of the world might be inhabited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:018530_0008_0FA7B4D44F28DFE8"/>
No doubt the numerous children of Adam were before the flood ſeparated in many diviſions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated far and wide on the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>After the deluge we find the ſmall remains of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind on the mountains of Ararat, which divide the preſent empire of Perſia from Circaſſian Tartary, on the north: whence they firſt moved ſouth-eaſt and lived together in one growing family or tribe about an hundred years.—From whence they journeyed weſtward as far as the river Euphrates; near the place where the garden of Eden was ſituate, in queſt, it is ſuppoſed, of the ancient paradiſe, but found it was wholly demoliſhed by the flood. Yet vainly fond to build ſomething in imitation of it. They had alſo the ſame diſpoſition natural to the nations ever ſince, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to hold together as long as poſſible and extend one general empire: But he who ſaw fit to ſeparate the ſons of Adam, laid the grand founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in his Providence, at this time.</p>
            <p>For while, on the plains of Babel, they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to "build a city and a tower whoſe top might reach to heaven" the Almighty confounded their language.</p>
            <p>The language of paradiſe, and that ſpoken by God's covenant people to this day, was in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the Hebrew tongue: But now the Almighty wholly obliterated from the minds and memories of moſt of them, that ancient language, leaving only one diviſion of the people to retain it, and impreſſed on the minds of all the other diviſions reſpectively, a different dialect, which each immediately ſpoke with the ſame freedom, with which they before ſpoke their native tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:018530_0009_0FA7B4D5AF1730E8"/>
How many different languages were now given we are not told, nor how many diſtinct nations or tribes were made in conſequence; God meant it to "ſeparate the ſons of Adam<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xi.</note>" and they were ſcattered abroad on all the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>All the languages now in the world were radically contained in the various dialects which God then gave on the plains of Shinar; though with much compoſition and variation; as no man ever invented a language entirely new, this ſeems the prerogative of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>And the Moſt High in rolling on his purpoſes, has, in every age, made uſe of this as one great medium, even diverſity of language, to make or keep the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſtinct and ſeparate.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, infinite Wiſdom has many other means, which all co-operate for the ſame end.</p>
            <p>The enormous growth and extent of nations, and empires, has often brought them to diviſion.</p>
            <p>So the vaſt extended empires of Greece and Rome, after covering a great part of the world, broke to pieces under their own weight.</p>
            <p>Again God has often made this the event of war foreign or inteſtine, and many new nations have roſe out of blood.</p>
            <p>Alſo, a tyrannical and oppreſſive ſpirit in poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and rulers has often had the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:018530_0010_0FA7B4D6CE1168F0"/>
Theſe have made many people ſo uneaſy as to throw off the yoke of ſubjection, and ſet up diſtinct by themſelves. Witneſs Egypt, in ancient days; the cruel tyranny of the Monarch loſt him the beſt part of his ſubjects, the people of God, the many thouſands of Iſrael. God's purpoſe was fulfilled, as in all things; but the tyranny of Pharaoh was the means.</p>
            <p>Witneſs alſo the deſpotic language of that unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced young Prince in Iſrael: No ſooner had be anſwered the ſupplicating tribes "my little finger ſhall be thicker than my father's loins" than a grand diviſion in the nation took place.</p>
            <p>Many examples might be adduced; but we have a recent one almoſt without a parrallel. How well connected and quiet was the great Britiſh empire, from the acceſſion of the Prince of Orange, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of George the ſecond? and how did every branch of the empire dread the thought of diſunion? But, when a Britiſh King became a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the Parliament a band of deſpots, and would be content with nothing leſs than to bind a great part of the empire in chains of perpetual ſlavery, yea, in all caſes whatſoever; when they cauſed the ſea and the waves along our coaſt to roar with their hoſtile thunder, and our defenceleſs towns to flame to the midſt of heaven. When they plunged their daggers in the breaſts of an innocent people, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon us the ſavages of the wilderneſs, with all their infernal maſſacres, our feelings were greatly changed. We once loved Britain moſt dearly; but <hi>Britain the Tyrant,</hi> we could not love; our ſouls ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred

her meaſures; when matters were puſhed thus far, we deſiſted from all our humble prayers to deaf ears and unrelenting ſouls. We roſe from the duſt where we had been long proſtrate—our breaſts glowed with noble ardor—we invoked the God of our fathers, and we took the field; and we have found that "there is none like the God of Jeſurun who hath rode on the heavens in our help and in his excellency on the ſky."</p>
            <p>And yet further; God has often made the lawleſs ambition, and proud aſpiring ſpirit of men inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of making new kingdoms, or dividing anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ones. As in the caſe of Nimrod, a proud and lawleſs man; a man of blood <hi>in contempt of heaven, "a mighty hunter before the Lord</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. x.</note>," he ſoon began a kingdom diſtinct for himſelf.</p>
            <p>The proud ſpirit of Jeroboam contributed to the ſame end, in conjunction with the raſhneſs of the young king and his raw counſellors.</p>
            <p>Moreover, proſpects of gain and worldly advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, have often laid the foundation of future empire. With theſe views many times a few adventrous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have emigrated from their native land, and when ſucceſs has crowned their exertions, and they have ſo increaſed in numbers and wealth, and become ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with learning, as to be fit for a diſtinct em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the event has ſeldom long delayed.</p>
            <p>And, indeed, there is the ſame reaſon, and it is equally the deſign of divine providence, that when any people become adult—are bleſſed with numbers,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018530_0012_0FA7B4D7E88E5300"/>
wealth, knowledge, and in all regards equal to the management of national affairs, they ſhould then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſtinct and independent, as that the branches of a family ſhould be ſo, when adult and capable to manage for themſelves. Succeſsful emigrations are the ſeeds of future empire.</p>
            <p>Add to all theſe religious perſecution, which God has made inſtrumental of new ſtates and empires. Thoſe who have true religion, prize it far above all ſublunary enjoyments; the rights of conſcience they hold as their deareſt rights; and when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and may not enjoy the worſhip and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, as they judge agreeable to his will, they will combine and defend themſelves, if in their power, and have a commonwealth of their own, and rulers of their own ſpirit and principles. Witneſs the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Netherlands. What floods of trouble and blood did they wade through, much actuated by a ſacred regard to the rights of conſcience. The great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Spain was divided in conſequence, and the United Provinces aſſumed ſovereign power, with the moſt happy conſtitution, perhaps, then in the world.</p>
            <p>This hateful perſecution led the way to all the growing greatneſs of the United States of America. The ſufferings of our progenitors, many and great, for their religion and ſtrict piety, impelled them to forſake their native land, and all the affluence they enjoyed there; they preferred a waſte, howling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, with their God, and his ordinances unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, to all the wealth and ſplendor of their native Albion. The God whom they ſerved forſook them not; he commanded the deep in their favour, and guarded them from the power of the numerous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

            <p>Conſidered as a people, theſe were the days of our early youth; and in all the great things God has done for us of late, he has remembered us "the kindneſs of our youth, and the love of our eſpouſals, when we went after him in the wilderneſs, in a land not ſown."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Jer. ii.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe, and the like means, the Moſt High has thus far effected his purpoſe, and thus all the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nations of the earth have been formed:—the temper and the exertions of men concerned, have been, in many inſtances, very wicked; but God is holy and pure; and when we behold Jehovah tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion from the wickedneſs of men, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his own moſt glorious purpoſes, and diſplay his own character, in the moſt amiable and aſtoniſhing view, who ſhall not adore him!</p>
            <p>II. We next take notice of the manifeſt will of heaven, that mankind ſhould live on equal terms as brethren.</p>
            <p>This is fully intimated in two expreſſions in the text, the firſt is, <hi>"their inheritance."</hi> Here we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Deity as univerſal parent giving portions to his children: He is abſolute proprietor, has whatever he pleaſes to give, and imparts to his great family ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſovereign good will: What he gives to each nation in the courſe of his providence is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018530_0014_0FA7B4D99432E9E8"/>
theirs reſpectively, and each individual has his property alike confirmed by the father of all.</p>
            <p>An empire, or commonwealth newly formed, hath its own inheritance, all its rights and privileges, as firmly eſtabliſhed as the moſt ancient empire in the world. The inheritance of a ſmall nation is as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theirs as that of a great one.</p>
            <p>The power there is in great and war-like nations to plunder and deſtroy thoſe that are weak and ſmall, gives them no more right ſo to do, than the wealth of the rich gives them right to oppreſs and ſwallow up the poor that are about them.</p>
            <p>Potentates who have, in their ambition, pride, and other luſts, robbed many millions of their ſubſtance, in former and later ages, and ſlaughtered millions more, becauſe it was in their power, have been the moſt atrocious murderers, the moſt execrable rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the moſt horrid wretches that ever diſgrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed human nature.</p>
            <p>The other expreſſion in the text which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to is this, <hi>"the ſons of Adam,"</hi> all near kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, of one common nature, children of one father. The Apoſtle ſeems to comment on this when he ſays, God "hath made of one blood, all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xvii.</note>."</p>
            <p>Human nature has one common feeling of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and pain, wants and neceſſities, ſorrows and troubles are common, all have a quick ſenſe of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and abuſe, all rejoice in kindneſs received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018530_0015_0FA7B4DC4FE2F4A0"/>
Tyrants bent on ſlaughter and the miſery of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ought to realize that the multitudes they rob and murder, feel plunder and death juſt as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would were it their woful lot to fall into ſuch mercileſs hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Separated the ſons of Adam."</hi> Here the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of nations, is repreſented under the idea of the branching out of families; and as an aged pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent who is bleſſed with a number of families, formed out of his own houſe, calls them all his children, and looks on the whole only as his own family ſtill, tho' diſperſed in ſeveral branches. So, in very deed the whole world is but one complicated family.</p>
            <p>No parents are ſo unnatural as to be willing that one of their houſhold ſhould be tyrant and deſpot over the whole, to vex, oppreſs, and ſlaughter the reſt at his pleaſure; or that the ſtronger children ſhould be cruel to the weaker.</p>
            <p>Had Adam ſeen all of this kind that has ſince fallen out in his family, he would have wept more bitterly than the poet feigns, when he ſaw the Lazar houſe, with all its dreadful ſtores of complicated miſery,

All are under that divine precept "whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the law and the prophets."</p>
            <p>It is the law of reaſon, the law of nature, and in-forced by the whole of divine revelation.</p>
            <p>However mankind have loſt a ſpirit of love, and whatever hatred they often have to one another; yet they are all very near kindred; and the great pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There has never been any intermarriage from without the family of Adam, to divide the blood, and make the kindred more diſtant; the family is now very great, it has many branches, but it is ſtill one, it remains the ſame; and if we do not feel our connection with all the human kind to be very near, very tender, we are paſt feeling, and our ſpirit is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to nature, to reaſon, and to our common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the fountain of love.</p>

church out of all nations. And here we fall in with the third general head propoſed, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>III. The divine determination, which ſhall not be fruſtrated, to make all nations ſubſervient to God's own peculiar nation and kingdom.</p>
            <p>"He ſet the bounds of the people, according to the number of the children of Iſrael."</p>
            <p>Whatever more immediate, or ſpecial reference this may have to the ſituation of the ſeven nations of Canaan, and adjacent kingdoms, yet no doubt the words have that extenſive ſenſe I have intimated; the phraſes are wholly indefinite, <hi>the nations—the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—the ſons of Adam</hi>—and the whole analogy of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture warrants the idea.</p>
            <p>God, from eternity, in his moſt glorious plan, his infinitely kind decree; ſet the bounds of all nations, with a moſt tender regard to his own covenant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in every age, wherever they might dwell, or whatever their number might be; and in his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Providence carries the whole into effect.</p>
            <p>There are many phraſes in ſacred ſcripture which denote the covenant people of God, in one age of the world, as well as in another: In theſe, and in future days as well as in ages paſt. <hi>Zion, Jeruſalem, the ſeed of Abraham, the ſeed of Jacob, the children of Iſrael,</hi> and the like, are expreſſions well known of this import. <hi>The children of Iſrael</hi> are the church, the people of God in every age.</p>
            <p>Were it not for the concerns of religion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal happineſs, there would be nothing worthy of God, as the author and diſpoſer, in the creation of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018530_0018_0FA7B4DF6E8CEA78"/>
the world, or in the kingdom of providence. Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from any connection with eternal glory, all the mighty movements, and all the glory of the kingdoms of this world are but ſolemn trifles: But in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of great importance.</p>
            <p>Immortal happineſs is for immortal ſouls, and not creatures but God himſelf is their portion Among the covenant people of God, the way of happineſs is diſplayed, and God exalted in the glory of his grace,</p>
            <p>So we find that king that God has ſet on his holy hill of Zion reigning for his church, "Far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but alſo in that which is to come: And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him that filleth all in all<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. i.</note>."</p>
            <p>In the context we find "the Lord's portion is his people, Jacob is the lot of his inheritance." So God ſays "I gave Egypt for thy ranſom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee," and ſpeaking of Zion "all my ſprings are in thee."</p>
            <p>The affairs of the world, in every empire, every place, will finally reſult in this, "be ſtill and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in all the earth."</p>
            <p>Much of the divine conduct in the kingdom of providence is not to be inveſtigated by man: Yet we can eaſily ſee enough to illuſtrate the point now
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018530_0019_0FA7B4E047A50418"/>
in view; want of time forbids my giving many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; let a few ſuffice as a ſpecimen of the whole.</p>
            <p>Look back into Egypt in the days of Jacob, and ſucceeding ages. God had ſet their bounds not far from Canaan where Jacob dwelt: He had made Egypt in thoſe days ſuperior to any other empire in the world, for power, wealth, arts and ſciences. And this with deſign that they ſhould be an aſſylum for his covenant people: That there they might be fed in days of famine, and might greatly increaſe. The great learning of Egypt was for the education of Moſes, that he might well ſuſtain the important character afterwards devolved on him. Aaron and other leaders, yea the whole people of God, no doubt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> much the better for the many ſchools and the learning of Egypt, to ſuſtain their reſpective charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the great ſcenes that were before them. Even the gold of the nation was laid on the tabernacle of the Moſt High. Their great kindneſs to Iſrael, for a time, and their hard dealing afterwards, conſpired to advance the intereſt of the people of God. Again,</p>
            <p>The nations ſituate between Egypt and Canaan, in the way that Iſrael took, had their bounds for the ſame end. "He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation." When the hoſts of Iſrael came out of Egypt they were not acquainted with war; nor had they inſtruments of war, ſufficient to encounter the mighty nations of Canaan; but by fighting their way through ſmaller oppoſition, conquering the Amorites and the people of Baſhan with their kings, and breaking through other hoſtile reſiſtance, they became expert in war,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018530_0020_0FA7B4E0EEF777D0"/>
and well equipped with ſwords and bows, helmets, ſpears and ſhields taken from their enemies.</p>
            <p>Theſe manoeuvres made Joſhua a great general, and taught the whole army of Iſrael all military at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, and ſo prepared them to face all the mighty warriors of Canaan in due time, with all the gigantic ſons of Anak in their front.</p>
            <p>There were many and great miracles we know, in conducting the people of God to the land of promiſe and their ſettlement there; but all that might be done for them in the common courſe of Providence was done in that way: Thus God has ever dealt and ever will.</p>
            <p>We may look next into the land of Canaan, and we ſhall find the Moſt High planted and ſupported ſeven nations there, to cultivate the land and prepare it for his own people, that they might find it a land flowing with milk and honey, and very commodious for their reſidence. The pious governor of Judea ſpeaking of this, ſays, "They took ſtrong cities and a fat land, and poſſeſſed houſes full of all goods, wells dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, vineyards and oliveyards, and all fruit-trees in abundance, ſo they did eat, and were filled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fat, and delighted themſelves in thy great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Neh. ix. 25.</note>."</p>
            <p>In the days of David, what vaſt territory round about had the nations cultivated and made fertile, which that great warrior, at the command of God, brought into the poſſeſſion of Iſrael?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018530_0021_0FA7B4E1F6792120"/>
In the days of Solomon, how did the nations of the eaſt ſubmit and miniſter to the people of God?</p>
            <p>They have alſo had protection whence it was not expected. "Let mine out-caſts dwell with thee, Moab, be thou a covert to them, from the face of the ſpoile<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah xvi. 4.</note>"</p>
            <p>The vaſt Perſian empire, with Cyrus their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned prince and general were for the ſame end. Perſia was then miſtreſs of the world, and Cyrus the greateſt general in it; all for the people of God, "to ſay to the priſoners go forth, and to them that ſit in darkneſs ſhew yourſelves." In this way the church of God was delivered from her Babylonian captivity. And ſome of his ſucceſſors did much for their reſettlement in the holy land.</p>
            <p>The growing greatneſs of the Grecian empire, in the days of Philip, and more eſpecially in the time of his ſon Alexander, was ordered in Providence with the ſame view to favour the cauſe of religion, and prepare the way for a wide ſpread of divine knowledge. A great part of the world then received law from the Greeks and alſo their language; a ſolemn, elegant and copious tongue, moſt fit for the promulgation of the New Teſtament. This language was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive among the nations when the evangeliſts and apoſtles wrote. And had it not been for a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence of this kind, it had been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without mere miracles, that the New Teſtament ſhould have been, in any meaſure, ſo extenſively read as it was, at the time of its firſt promulgation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:018530_0022_0FA7B4E269255EF8"/>
The greatneſs of the Roman empire when the Moſt High placed Conſtantine at the head of it, is another proof of his regard to his own people; great, very great, were the privileges they enjoyed in the days of that monarch. Though alas in their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant favours they ſoon after waxed wanton and apoſtatized from the way of holineſs.</p>
            <p>Paſſing over many examples, I ſhall add but one more ſo conſpicuous, indeed, that we muſt not be inattentive to it. I mean the great monarchy of France, great in wealth, power, numbers, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Great and much honoured in the prince that now ſits on the throne: All this indeed to protect the rights of mankind, to patronize liberty, and ſerve the cauſe of religion in ſuch a day as this. Not only to divide to us our inheritance and ſeparate us from the reſt of the ſons of Adam, but to promote the glorious cauſe of liberty and religion among the nations.</p>
            <p>In theſe inſtances and many more that I would name, would the time admit, we can clearly ſee the ways of divine Providence, and inveſtigate the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the Moſt High; and we may reſt fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that all other nations from the beginning to the end of the world ſhall finally appear to have been ſubſervient to the ſame glorious purpoſe. And when they have anſwered this great end they fall and riſe no more; but the kingdom of God ſtands firm on an everlaſting baſis. As it is written, "The moth ſhall eat them up like a garment, and the worm ſhall eat them like wool; but my righteouſneſs ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and my ſalvation from generation to generation<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſaiah li.</note>."</p>

               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>From what has been ſaid we learn our duty and intereſt as a people. We have lately received our inheritance, as a diſtinct ſovereign empire, from the great diſpoſer of all things, and a better God never gave to the ſons of Adam; a land as fertile as the land of Canaan, and of much larger extent. He hath given us the beſt civil conſtitution now in the world, the ſame in the general nature of it, with that he gave to Iſrael in the days of Moſes. And it is remarkable that our number of people is about the ſame with their's in the days of Moſes—i. e. about three millions. Iſrael had thirteen free inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſtates, or tribes, one of them, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that of Joſeph being ſubdivided: out of theſe ſtates their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Council or general Congreſs was choſen, by delegates from each, often called their Sanhedrim. Each ſtate managed its own internal police, each had a General Aſſembly, compoſed of their beſt men, at the free election of the people, often called the elders of the tribe: their government was theocratical; ſo for ſubſtance is our free elective government, acording to that old maxim, <hi>vox populi vox dei.</hi> And they had their executive courts and officers in various ſtations, for ſubſtance anſwering to ours. No matter for the difference of names, titles and phraſes, where the ſubſtance of things is the ſame.</p>
               <p>We may well argue from the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that this general plan of government is the moſt perfect, and beſt for men, as God himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed it and gave it in the greatneſs of his love, to his own peculiar people. Had any other been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the nature of things, God would have given
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018530_0024_0FA7B4E689835D20"/>
them a different one. So when they rejected it for monarchy, they rejected the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, and were great looſers. They had the light of divine revelation; we in a far more glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Canaan was their inheritance, Columbia is ours; and our ſouthern dominions cover the ſame climate in which they dwelt.</p>
               <p>Now our great duty and intereſt is to ſecure and improve our bleſſed inheritance, and hand it down to poſterity. There is but one way to do this, and that is to keep the commandments of our God. This will ſecure to us every bleſſing, and make us "high above all nations,"—"great in name, in praiſe and in honor;" but if we rebel againſt God we ſhall be miſerable. We muſt, above all things, attend to true religion, and practiſe every moral virtue, even that righteouſneſs that exalteth a nation, and fly from every vice and abhor the ways of immorality.</p>
               <p>Our danger at this day lies in that ſhameful irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious temper that is too obvious in many—a man that contemns true religion is a diſgrace to human nature and a great curſe to his country. We are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by many vices—injuſtice and extortion, idleneſs and luxury, prophane ſwearing, the ſure mark of a thoughtleſs ſinner; prophanation of the holy ſabbath, intemperance, laſciviouſneſs and wantonneſs, pride and extravagance, the Lord in his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy deliver us from all theſe.</p>
               <p>But there is one abominable vice that is ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us every day, and ſo immediately threatens us with diſſolution and anarchy, that I muſt bear my teſtimony more largely againſt it.</p>

It is that unreaſonable, raging ſpirit of jealouſy pointed againſt all in power, eſpecially againſt thoſe in the moſt burdenſome and important truſts. Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy is the rage and diſtraction of men, as well in civil as domeſtic life. We elect all our rulers, and often enough in all reaſon: we chooſe ſuch as we eſteem men of the greateſt wiſdom and probity: we have no jealouſy of them until we exalt them into of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and burden them with a great weight; then we turn jealous; for no reaſon but becauſe they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting all their wiſdom and goodneſs to pour out bleſſings upon us, and ſacrificing their lives to make us happy. They are as good men after they are in office as before, but we have a very different ſpirit towards them. Nay, ſome are not aſhamed openly to ſay, we ought to, we muſt keep a jealous eye over our rulers in every ſtation in order to ſecure our privileges; which, by the way, is juſt as good ſenſe as to ſay that a woman ought to be very jealous of her huſband, that ſo ſhe may live happily with him, and all domeſtic concerns may go on in peace.</p>
               <p>Our rulers in every ſtation, are open and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their conſtituents in all they do; and if cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, are ſubject to law and puniſhment, even as any private man, and we may turn them out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice when we pleaſe. But ſtill the people will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them <hi>with a jealous mind,</hi> and the certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, they judge very falſely and abuſively of them.</p>
               <p>A man under the force of jealouſy, never yet judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right in any caſe, and never can. Jealouſy will ſoon find enough in the moſt perfect character in the world to make it a very bad one. That old poet who ſo greatly excelled in his diſcernment of human nature, has told us the very truth.</p>

               <bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl>
               <p>Jealouſy makes men uneaſy with the beſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and with the beſt men at the head of it; uneaſy with all their rulers do, and they will ſtone for a good deed as ſoon as for a bad one. It makes men rebellious, obſtinate and heady, and obſtructs a multitude of bleſſings which good rulers are pouring down on the people they love.</p>
               <p>We expend much to maintain authority, as indeed they ought to have an honorable ſupport; and would we only let them do us all the good in their hearts, and in their power under God, they would repay us a thouſand fold. But what can the good patriots do? firſt we muſt be jealous of them, next we certainly think them wicked, and then we deſtroy their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and their good names together. Thus we looſe our benefit and our coſt of ſupporting them. We bind them hand and foot, and are like a man who ſhould hire a number of the beſt workmen at a great expence, to build him an houſe, and as ſoon as they began to operate with all their ſkill and fidelity, ſhould load them with chains,—pay might continue, but the work muſt miſerably proceed.</p>
               <p>Let our rulers as well as others, be weighed in an even balance: jealouſy makes the balance very uneven: let us judge of thoſe in power as well as of other men, with all that charity which the Apoſtle deſcribes, and which, without ſolid reaſon, <hi>"thinketh no evil."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am as much engaged for liberty, in the utmoſt

extent of it, as any man on earth; I would have all in power elective by, and accountable to the people; and if in any caſe criminal, <hi>on fair trial,</hi> let them not be ſpared. But this hydra of jealouſy and evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is not liberty, it is tyranny, it is confuſion, it is death. Proud, ſelfiſh, wicked men take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it; they luſt for offices, for which they are utterly unfit; but they muſt firſt remove thoſe worthy men that hold them: they make or propagate a thouſand lies, to ſtir up the jealouſy of the people, inrage the multitude, and clear the ſeats of honour for themſelves. And when ſuch brambles get in power, "a fire ſoon comes out of the bramble and devours the cedars of Lebanon."</p>
               <p>If this vile ſpirit may have its full growth and univerſal ſway, we ſhall ſoon have few men of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and probity, in ſeats of honour and truſt; and the good will adopt the words of the prophet, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over our land, ſaying "A fire is gone out of the rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, ſo that ſhe hath no ſtrong rod to be a ſceptre to rule: this is a lamentation and ſhall be for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. xix.</note>." God grant we may be delivered from this iniquity, and all other land defiling crimes, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe every virtue, and ſerve the God of our fathers with a perfect heart. And ſhall not all the goodneſs of God, to our fathers and to us, eſpecially, recent, wonderful favours lead us to repentance, and engage us to univerſal holineſs?</p>
               <p>God had determined from eternity to divide us our inheritance, as he hath lately done; his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018530_0028_0FA7B4EA47568658"/>
began to operate in the days of our fathers though they had no thought of the reſult of it.</p>
               <p>Thus all thoſe cruel perſecutions that were under the kings of the Stuart family, ſerved, in the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, to bring into this land people of the beſt principles and morals; it is eſpecially true of this part of it.</p>
               <p>God eſtabliſhed a glorious church in a dreary wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: and thoſe words in the context are as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to them as to Iſrael of old, "He found him in a deſert land, in a waſte howling wilderneſs; he led him about, he inſtructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye."</p>
               <p>Our fathers were men of ſolid wiſdom, piety and virtue, and therefore it was their early concern to promote learning, to eſtabliſh ſeminaries, which have been wonderfully bleſſed for that end; to provide for the ſupport of a learned orthodox goſpel miniſtry, to guard the churches: then Moſes and Aaron were brethren indeed, and they went hand in hand, "Thou leddeſt thy people like a flock by the hand of Moſes and Aaron," our civil conſtitution was excellent while inviolate. The people amazingly grew, in numbers, and the Moſt High was their defence in all their perils: he was then laying the foundation for what we now ſee; and in all the movements of the great and complicated wheels of Providence, as in the high and dreadful viſion of Ezekiel the prophet, "a man, that man who is God, ſat above upon them," rolling us into future empire.</p>
               <p>With the ſame view, God has raiſed up ſo many ſtateſmen, and military commanders, and ſo many
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018530_0029_0FA7B4EAD056D4B0"/>
renowned pillars in ſacred characters. And as the time of ſeparation drew near, a ſpirit of learning, liberty, and a martial ſpirit greatly increaſed. The alwiſe Being knew what inſtruments would be moſt proper in every department. For this end our late General was born with all his greatneſs of ſoul; call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into military ſervice in the days of youth, and trained up with every noble accompliſhment. And the hearts of the whole nation wonderfully united in him. Divine Providence ordering all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the late war, calls aloud upon us to love and ſerve the great Ruler of all.</p>
               <p>When our tyrannical enemies firſt attacked us, it was with a force juſt enough to rouſe and invig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orate us; but by no means equal to a conqueſt. Had they fallen upon us, with all their might, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, unprovided as we then were, what would have become of us? They preſſed upon us, with increaſing force, juſt faſt enough to confirm our union and martial ſpirit, and prepare us to give them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception they deſerved. "Howbeit they meant not ſo, neither did their hearts think ſo," all this was of God.</p>
               <p>The forming of the great council of our nation was indeed wonderful; our aſſociation, bill of rights, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of confederation, and alliance, diſplay divine wiſdom and goodneſs; our naval atchievements, eſpecially when we were weakeſt, have ſhewn that God is mighty.</p>
               <p>We have been favoured with ſuch uncommon health through the States in general, for ſeven or eight years paſt, that not more of our people have
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018530_0030_0FA7B4EDA1CBAC20"/>
died in proportion to their number, than has been uſual in time of peace, notwithſtanding the reeking ſword, and the horrible priſon-ſhips of our enemies. The more than ordinary fruitfulneſs of the ſeaſons, has, perhaps, been a counterbalance to our extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary conſumption, during the war. And ſurely God has brought great good to us, out of one very great evil, faithleſs depreciating paper currency, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one of the worſt things that ever a people are ſcourged with: yet Providence has ſo ordered, that it has anſwered the end of a mighty tax upon us, and has made even filthy rags a cord for the necks of our enemies.</p>
               <p>The goodneſs of God is to be noticed in many battles, from the firſt effuſion of blood at Lexington, to the grand deciſive ſcene at Glouceſter and York-Town. Even all the delays and retreatings of our General, ſhew us that he was guided from on high; like another Fabius, cunctando reſtituit rem.</p>
               <p>The kind ſpirit towards us infuſed into ſeveral princes and nations of Europe, was from on high, and when proud, haughty Britain bows at laſt, we ſee God is mightier than Britain.</p>
               <p>I only hint at theſe things as ſo many motives to induce us to love and ſerve the God of our fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He has giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>We doubt not but thoughts of the greatneſs and glory of God, and his overruling hand in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Providence, like thoſe now offered, but much better ſuggeſted in your own mind, have been your ſupport and conſolation from the days of youth. More eſpecially when your burdens and cares have been the greateſt.</p>
                     <p>Very few men, ſince the world was made ever liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much for the public, as you have done. After a liberal education, in early youth, your Excellency was immediately called into public office, and the burden of complicated public offices has been your lot ever ſince. And though it has ever been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt, that your Excellency never ſought promotion, or popular applauſe; but always made truth and righteouſneſs your guide, as well when you knew it to be unpopular, as at other times: Yet he who gave all your rich endowments (and to his name alone be the praiſe) knew what to do with you, in his great love to his people.</p>
                     <p>When our late troubles began, your Excellency's lot was very ſingular; when to avoid perpetual

ſlavery, it became neceſſary to oppoſe the tyranny of Britain; your brethren in office, the other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors all forſook you, but you did not forſake your God and the people you loved. Your Excellency ſtood alone, but you ſtood firm, "The archers ſhot at you and you was ſorely grieved by the enemies of our peace; but your bow abode in ſtrength, and your hands were made ſtrong by the hand of the mighty God of Jacob."</p>

               <p>In leading us out of a provincial, into an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtate, your Excellency had the path to beat: You walked before us in a rough and rugged way; but God remembered his promiſe, "Thy ſhoes ſhall be iron and braſs, and as the day is ſo ſhall thy ſtrength be."</p>
               <p>When the wrath of a tyrant king roared againſt you as a lion, and your Excellency, above all, was marked out for a victim, you endured not fearing

the wrath of the king, chuſing rather to ſuffer afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the people of God, ſo dear to you, than to enjoy any emoluments how great ſoever they might have been, had you, like many others ſought the royal favour. So long as the ſtorms beat, the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders roared, the lightnings glared around your head; all the while the tempeſt was ſo black and dreadful, you ſet ſtedfaſt at helm without a covert. Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency then, deſired no man to take that ſeat of peril: But now you have rode out the ſtorm and conducted us into the deſired haven of peace, your Excellency has requeſted that you may retire and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother take the now more peaceful ſeat. On this I have no remark to make, it is wholly needleſs at preſent: The whole nation will ſpeak; poſterity will not be ſilent.</p>

               <p>Venerable Fathers,</p>
               <p>I ſhall meddle with no policy, but what lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my own profeſſion, as a preacher of righteouſneſs: As ſuch, I may ſtir up your pure minds, to attend moſt zealouſly, to the ſuppreſſion of all vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, for this end let us always have, not only the beſt laws, but the beſt men to execute them, men of ability, men that pay a ſacred regard to religion and virtue, in their own example. Your Honours will continue to be nurſing fathers to the church of God, and will promote the intereſt of that kingdom which ſhall finally triumph over all.</p>
               <p>The intereſt of learning will engroſs your great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and patronage, as it is the ſtrength and glory of a nation—what could we have done in our late conteſt with Britain, had we been deſtitute of learned men? We have fought to as good purpoſe with the pen as with the ſword.</p>

How happy if that ſeminary might always be embraced and nouriſhed by this Honourable Aſſembly, as a darling child, by a kind indulgent parent? Whatever can be done to add to the ſtrength and glory of the college, will be well done: And ſhould a liberal ſtream of bounty flow to it, annually, out of this fountain, we ſhould find our account in the bleſſing of heaven on the whole State, and on our land. All inferior ſchools in this State claim your kind notice and favour, your Honours will think upon them for good: But our great and growing unive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This is an happy aera, to do every thing noble and important for ſuch a ſeminary.</p>
               <p>Moreover, your Honours know what demands on this ſtate, and on the nation, are juſtly made, by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You know likewiſe what juſt obligations we are under to nations beyond the water, who have lent us their aid. Moſt certainly it is high time that this ſtate, and every ſtate, and all in conjunction, ſo far as demands are national, make full proviſion to pay every honeſt debt, and till this is done public guilt lies upon us. The cries of ſuffering, individuals from whom we with hold their bread, enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth; and when foreign nations make juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018530_0036_0FA7B4F18D630C38"/>
we ſhall find God will vindicate their claim. We are not poor; we are far from a ſtate of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy; in a large and good land, flowing with rich treaſures. Pray point out the beſt way and oblige us to do what is right to all men.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that have lent us their money and are now ſuffering for want of it, are ſons of Adam as well as ourſelves, and ought to live on equal terms with us, and not be wronged and oppreſſed becauſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic are many, and mighty, and can do as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have fought our battles for us are our own brethren: And even foreign nations to whom we are under juſt obligations, with the other ſtates, the whole in union, are children of our own parents. To be juſt, righteous, and faithful is humanity. Righteouſneſs is religion pure and undefiled.</p>
               <p>A ſtate or a nation ought ever to be as upright and faithful, in dealing with an individual, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as one neighbour with another: It lies with your Honours to concert effectual meaſures, that this ſtate, and, as far as to us appertains, the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſo.</p>
               <p>The great fountain of light, grant your Honours all wiſdom in this dark and trying day, ſupport you under all your burdens and cares, make your days many, and fill them with growing uſefulneſs, in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his people. And may we at laſt ſee you all in exalted ſeats of glory!</p>

The kingdom of Jeſus on earth is often not in apparent ſplendor, or in much favour with the world; but all the concerns of it are ever moving forward, with a divine dignity, and rolling on to a moſt glorious and univerſal triumph. Our lot in this kingdom is the happieſt lot. We are not indeed in the way to attain the wealth and ſplendor and other dying allurements of this world as we might in other employments: But the very buſineſs of our lives is heaven upon earth; it is to converſe with Deity, in all his beauty and glory, through Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, beaming forth in his word and in all his works, and to preach Deity diſplayed, God manifeſt in the fleſh, to a loſt world. As we love true pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure we ſhall be great ſtudents, and very active for the good of immortal ſouls; ſhall preach nothing but ſound, practical divinity, unite in goſpel charity, cement in love, <hi>"for God is love."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In days like theſe, we are willing to bear our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of expence and burden with our brethren; and truly moſt of us have done that, and many of us much more: But yet we are well provided for, and

ever ſhall be; no part of the world was ever kinder to miniſters of the goſpel than this has been from the firſt. Our rulers are benevolent fathers to us; our people loving brethren and dutiful children.</p>
               <p>And only to except him that is now ſpeaking, and, perhaps, a very few beſide, this land has been bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt learned, orthodox, and pious cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, from its firſt ſettlement to this day, of any part of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And we ſee the fruit of our labour, in reſiſting the torrent of wickedneſs, which flows dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from the human heart; we ſee good fruit when we are inſtrumental to enlighten and regulate our people, and form them for moral and ſocial duties; and in all the ſtrength and ſupport we give to the commonwealth. But above all, when God is pleaſed, by his holy ſpirit, to make our labours effectual for the ſaving good of ſouls; this no doubt he does in ſome meaſure, more or leſs, with the labours of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true miniſter of Chriſt. And oh! how glorious and joyful, when the divine ſpirit is poured out in copious effuſions, "as rivers in the wilderneſs, and as floods on the dry and thirſty ground," and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to righteouſneſs become as the drops of morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dew! This hath God done in days paſt, nor has he forſaken us in the preſent day. We hear glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings from ſeveral parts, yea, we do in ſome meaſure "ſee the good of his choſen, and rejoice in the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his nation, and glory with his inheritance."</p>
               <p>And do you not learn, my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, from all the movements of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and from the prophetic words, "That the time, the ſet time to favour Zion is near at hand?"
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018530_0039_0FA7B4F5F1B06DB0"/>
Light and true religion have beamed forth from eaſt to weſt, from the beginning: Theſe goings down of the ſun, are the laſt regions to be thus viſited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter day glory. By the <hi>iſles</hi> and <hi>the ſhips of Tarſhiſh</hi> in ſcripture prophecy, is plainly imported all the weſtern iſlands, and all communications from the weſtern part of the world: And ſhall not <hi>"the iſles ſoon wait on God and the ſhips of Tarſhiſh firſt?"</hi> "So ſhall they fear thy name from the weſt, and thy glory from the riſing of the ſun,"—God ſhall return the captivity of Jacob's tents, and the fulneſs of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall come in. Shall not Ethiopia ſoon ſtretch out her hands to God? Is not the accompliſhment of thoſe words now in the pleaſing dawn? "Then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent. From beyond the river of Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia my ſuppliants, the daughter of my diſperſed ſhall bring mine offering<note n="*" place="bottom">Zeph. iii</note>."</p>
               <p>Your faith and prayer, oh ye ſacred ones, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways concur with the good-will of him that dwelt in the buſh: And when Meſſiah reigns in viſible glory over all the earth, how will your ſouls rejoice.</p>
               <p>God has now given us a bleſſed inheritance, and ſpoke peace to this nation, in its growing greatneſs; he has ſpoke peace to ſome of the nations of Europe, and can ſoon ſpeak peace to all the world; "Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, good will towards men."</p>

I would now cloſe with a word to this great and reſpectable Audience at large.</p>
               <p>My Fathers, Brethren, and dear Friends,</p>
               <p>It is of the laſt importance that we bear in mind the deſign of the Moſt High in creating all worlds, and diſpoſing of all beings; this world with all the nations that dwell in it. It is that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> reign; immortal ſouls concur with him, in Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>vidence and grace, and be happy.</p>
               <p>Whatever part we act in this world; whatever we attain on this ſide the grave; if we have not made religion our great buſineſs, Jeſus our hope, and God our portion, we ſhall, in a few days, know we have been but deluded trifles, and ſorely regret that ever we ſaw the light, or had a portion among the living.</p>
               <p>A life of religion is the only proper life of rational, immortal man; to know God in his dear ſon is our beſt knowledge, and to ſerve him our beſt work. Thoſe only who have this temper of mind, and thus live, are the true children of Iſrael, to whoſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory, as you have heard, all the nations of the earth ſhall bow, "To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute upon them the judgment written; this honour has all his ſaints; praiſe ye the Lord<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cxlix.</note>."</p>
               <p>We ſhall all meet no more until the day of the complete triumph of the redeemed of the Lord, "When they ſhall return and come with ſongs, to the heavenly Zion, and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads, they ſhall obtain gladneſs and joy, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

ſorrow, and mourning ſhall flee away." Oh may you, beloved, all be found among them, in that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when princes and potentates, and all the great ones of the earth, ſhall mingle with common people, yea with ſlaves and vaſſals, in one great, and undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed throng, unleſs true religion ſhall gird them with glory: When all the mighty movements of Providence in this world ſhall ceaſe; and kingdoms, ſtates, and empires be no more, then ſhall we all know what is the true wiſdom and happineſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal man; "Then ſhall ye return and diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the righteous and the wicked; between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not."</p>
