            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THE following Sermon was compoſed in haſte for a common congregation in the country, without any expectation of its being deſired to be publiſhed. But many of my hearers were very earneſt in their requeſts that it might be printed, to which I have yielded. I have not had leiſure to tranſcribe and poliſh it, and if I had, perhaps ſhould not take the pains, ſince the drudgery of tranſcribing would put me to more trouble, than it would afford pleaſure or advantage to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The ſentiments and reaſonings are expreſſed in a plain manner, and if they are juſt, this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not be diſagreeable; but if they are wrong, the Author has no deſire that the embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments of ſtile ſhould recommend them.—The candid reader will make the favourable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which are uſually requeſted for haſty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JUDGES V. 15. 16.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>For the diviſions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart. Why abodeſt thou among the ſheep-folds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? for the diviſions of Reuben, there were great ſearchings of heart.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>DIVISIONS in families, or neighbourhoods, in church, or in ſtate, are very diſagreeable at all times, as they mar the peace of men's minds, alienate their affections from one another, and involve them in jars and quarrels.—Strife and contention naturally proceed from diviſions, ſince every one endeavours to maintain his own party, and pull down thoſe who oppoſe him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diviſions are productive of much ſin, as well as miſery in the world. For, as the Apoſtle James obſerves. <q>Where envying and ſtrife <hi>is,</hi> there <hi>is</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and every evil work.</q> And hence we are often exhorted in the ſcriptures, to union; and, in order to our loving one another, and to guard againſt all diviſion and party ſpirit, to <q>mark them which cauſe diviſions, and avoid them.</q> Thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious is diviſion in general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:015070_0004_0F95A82C551A7B28"/>
But there are particular inſtances, in which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are more immediately deſtructive, as when a country is involved in a neceſſary war, for the defence of their juſt rights and liberties. Diviſions in ſuch a caſe, have a natural tendency to weaken their ſtrength, to render all the meaſures which are planned for their defence abortive, and thus make them an eaſy prey to their invaders. Our bleſſed Saviour, long ſince obſerved, with the greateſt propriety, <q>Every kingdom divided againſt itſelf, is brought to deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and every city or houſe divided againſt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhall not ſtand.</q> Many powerful nations, have brought immediate and terrible deſtruction upon themſelves, by their diviſions. And hence <hi>Deborah</hi> in this ſong, in which ſhe celebrates the great victory which the Lord gave his people Iſrael, under <hi>Barak</hi> their general, over <hi>Jabin,</hi> the powerful king of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, who had "mightily oppreſſed them," while ſhe mentions the general union of the tribes, with the higheſt praiſe, marks the diviſions of <hi>Reuben,</hi> with the greateſt diſapprobation. <q>Why abodeſt thou among the ſheep folds to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the diviſions of Reuben, <hi>there were</hi> great ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of heart?</q>
            </p>
            <p>As we are called this day by his <hi>Honour</hi> the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of this Colony, to give thanks to God, and <q>Offer up ſincere and hearty praiſes to the Lord, for the many mercies he has beſtowed upon us, the paſt year;</q> and particularly for his <q>cauſing ſo great harmony and union in America,</q> I ſhall endeavour to proſecute the deſign of the proclamation, by briefly conſidering <hi>this union—the righteouſneſs of it, the great importance of maintaining it, and the bad conſequences of breaking it by diviſions among ourſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To give you ſome juſt views of <hi>this union,</hi> I ſhall briefly mention a few things, ſhewing the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability there was, that it would have taken place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The plan of oppreſſion, which the Britiſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015070_0005_0F95A82D0BBE2A20"/>
had concerted, was immediately aimed at the government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi> There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed good reaſon to believe, that all the Colonies were in the end, to ſhare the ſame fate. But the Britiſh Miniſtry kept this out of ſight as much as poſſible, as they probably meant to ſubdue the Colonies one after another, expecting but little trouble with the reſt, when they had once brought the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> to ſubmit. And as they ſuffered the other governments in general to enjoy their rights and privileges, it did not ſeem probable to the miniſtry, that they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle, ſince if they did, they muſt expect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve themſelves immediately, in like difficulties; and it is natural for people to ward off calamities, as long as they can, to put far away the evil day.</p>
            <p>It is to be remembered that the ſouthern Colonies were vaſtly remote from the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> by their ſituation; and different in their produce, and trade, from theſe northern Colonies. And ſundry of them had a different form of religion eſtabliſhed among them, more conformed to that which is eſtabliſhed in <hi>South Britain,</hi> than what is generally profeſſed in <hi>New England.</hi> The connection by trade was great, and the ſimiliarity in religion, in the ſouthern go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, was much nearer to the Mother-Country, than to theſe northern Colonies.</p>
            <p>Now, when we conſider theſe things, it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very remarkable thing, in the courſe of divine providence, that all the Colonies ſhould, as it were, make the caſe of ſuffering and oppreſſed BOSTON, their own; unite for the common defence of the country, and expoſe themſelves to the frowns of the mother country; when, by aiding and aſſiſting the Britiſh miniſtry, or barely not joining with the reſt, the appearance was, that any particular Colony might be entitled, at preſent, to great privileges and emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Some of the Colonies were ſo diſtant from others, that they had but little intercourſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015070_0006_0F95A82DC97C7398"/>
with one another; they never had any general interview, before the aera of the <hi>Stamp-act,</hi> nor any place, nor Aſſembly appointed, in which to meet, nor method of electing Delegates to repreſent them. And the King's Governors, in the ſeveral Colonies where they preſide, uſed every precaution in their power, to obſtruct, and prevent their coming to ſuch a choice. Yet, notwithſtanding, the ſeveral Colonies choſe their Delegates, who aſſembled in Congreſs, at the city of Philadelphia, September 5, 1775.</p>
            <p>It was doubtleſs expected, if they ſhould thus meet in <hi>Congreſs,</hi> from Colonies ſo different in climate, trade, and religion, that they would never agree, but contend and jar, and ſo break to pieces among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is rare to find ſuch a large Aſſembly, all of the ſame mind, in the moſt trifling affairs, much leſs in ſuch weighty and dangerous matters. It is then very remarkable, that when they were thus met, and had full liberty and leiſure, to conſider the whole ſtate of affairs; they ſhould all agree as one man: Surely the common danger appeared very great and alarming, and oppoſition very juſt; but ſtill they had no power to enforce their reſolves and determinations, ſo that after all, the people in the ſeveral Colonies might have refuſed to comply with the directions of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and there were ſundry attempts made by the King's Governours, who, from their high ſtations, had much influence in their reſpective governments, and by the emiſſaries, whom they employed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent people's acceding to the rules of the Congreſs. Sundry, have laboured with all their might, and that with all the arts of deceit and falſehood, to inſtil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices into the inhabitants, againſt the Congreſs. And yet notwithſtanding all theſe endeavours of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial tools, the people in general have complied with their reſolves. There are but very few towns on the whole continent, and thoſe very ſmall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, but have openly concurred, and appointed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015070_0007_0F95A82F93603480"/>
               <hi>Committees of Inſpection,</hi> to keep a conſtant look out, and to uſe the greateſt care and diligence, to ſee the Reſolves of the Congreſs carried into execution.—And thus, take the continent throughout, the union is remarkably great; greater than our enemies could ever believe would poſſibly take place, and greater than we ourſelves had any reaſon to expect; and the oppoſite party ſmall and inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>For let it be conſidered, that thoſe, who have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed the cauſe of their country, have all the power at preſent in their hands. The Offices, civil and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, are at their diſpoſal, and the whole <hi>Militia,</hi> the arms and ammunition in the country, under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; ſo that ſuch as are otherwiſe minded, have no power at all at preſent, to do any thing of conſequence. Whereas the Congreſs having the power of the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> in their hands, have raiſed a ſtrong army, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>able experienced Generals</hi> to command, and made <hi>money</hi> to pay and ſupport the troops. And God in his providence has ſo greatly ſucceeded their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and arms, that they have reduced thoſe ſeveral ſtrong fortreſſes of <hi>Ticonderoga, Crown-Point, Chamblee,</hi> and <hi>St. John's,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Montreal has ſubmitted ſince.</hi>
               </note> in one campaign, which employed the united power of Great-Britain and the Colonies, for ſundry years the laſt war, beſides preventing their army at <hi>Boſton</hi> from ravaging the country.</p>
            <p>Should it be objected, that there are ſundry, in every government, who are far from approving the proceedings and determinations of the Congreſs, and and therefore that the union is not ſo great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as has been repreſented; it were eaſy to anſwer, that when we conſider the union of a country in any plan or meaſure, it is not expected, that we ſhould go into every obſcure pariſh and by corner, who live out of the way of the knowledge of public tranſactions, and who therefore "abide among their ſheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks," who are wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015070_0008_0F95A830428AE8D0"/>
about their private affairs; and much leſs; that we ſhould enquire of every family that live in the woods, who neither know nor care any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the country; we need only examine the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and conduct of thoſe <hi>bodies</hi> of men, whom they chooſe to repreſent them, and in whom they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their truſt and confidence, to manage the great and important concerns of government. Now theſe have been very unanimous in their determination, to oppoſe the meaſures of the Britiſh miniſtry; and hence we may fairly infer, that ſince the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives choſen by the people, by fair election, without any bribery or undue influence, to conſult and act for them in Aſſemblies and Congreſſes, have agreed to make oppoſition to the meaſures the parliament have adopted, that the union is complete, notwithſtanding that there are a few male-contents ſcattered up and down in the ſeveral Colonies.</p>
            <p>But beſides this full agreement of the public repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative bodies, we have their opinion, as it were, in their private capacity, agreeing in the ſame thing. Almoſt every town on the continent have voluntarily and publicly acceded to this Union, by their expreſs votes. The ſeveral Colonies agreed according to the Reſolves of the Congreſs, to raiſe their quota of ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when required, to take the field for the common defence. What ſhall I ſay, the greater part of the <hi>Indian tribes</hi> have joined the common cauſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the artifices and induſtry of the enemy.—And even many of the <hi>Canadians,</hi> who, from the firſt ſettlement of the country, were trained up in hatred and enmity to us, and were our enemies, have openly joined us, and taken up arms in our cauſe, and have fought with the greateſt bravery againſt the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial forces.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And we have great reaſon to think, that this is a juſt and righteous, as well as a general union. This ſubject is ſo large, that I cannot pretend to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015070_0009_0F95A830E3669388"/>
give you a full view of it, but muſt content myſelf with ſuggeſting only a few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It does not appear with any ſatisfactory evidence, that there is any real need of theſe taxes, the incomes of Britain being more than ſufficient for the ſupport of government, and the defence of the nation, if they were properly applied. Now the ſubject ſhould never be further burthened with taxes than is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe rulers are deſigned for the happineſs of their people, and not to impoveriſh and oppreſs them. It is a moſt abſurd notion, that ſubjects are made merely for the pleaſure and grandeur of their rulers. But it is a great truth, that rulers ought to be <q>the miniſters of God <hi>to their ſubjects,</hi> for their good</q> and happineſs. Needleſs taxes are not for the good, but the miſery, of the ſubject, tending to reduce them to poverty and diſtreſs; and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be juſtly conſidered as wanton undiſguiſed oppreſſion, to ſupport the pride, ambition, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of a few grandees. Why ſhould the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious farmer and his family ſuffer by heavy taxes, which are not needful for the real expence and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of government? Why ſhould the honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, who earns his bread by the ſweat of his brow, have the incomes of his labour taken away, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Why ſhould the induſtrious poor, be ſqueezed, to ſupport the corruption and luxury of the great, who know no bounds to their pride and grandeur?—Now, we are well aſſured, that there is no occaſion of theſe new impoſitions, unleſs to ſupport <hi>placemen,</hi> and <hi>penſioners,</hi> and to increaſe <hi>bribery, profligacy</hi> and <hi>diſſipation;</hi> that the Britiſh government uſed to be ſupported with dignity in former times, particularly in Queen Elizabeth's reign, at a far leſs expence. There is much more expended by the preſent court, than was even in the extravagant reign of Charles II. Were there any neceſſity for contributing to the real ſupport and dignity of the crown, the Colonies
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015070_0010_0F95A8319683CB40"/>
would cheerfully do their part. They were never backward, but raiſed both men and money, when deſired, beyond what we were well able; ſo that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> repaid us large ſums to reimburſe us in ſome meaſure for our liberal aſſiſtance in their diſtreſs. Thus they acknowledged themſelves indebted to us, when wiſe and good councils prevailed—But ſhall we contribute to ſupport corruption, bribery, and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, to their and our deſtruction!</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Colonies had no new claims in view. They were well affected to the <hi>Hanover-Family.</hi> His Majeſty had not a body of more loyal and dutiful ſubjects in all his dominions than in theſe Colonies. We gloried in our connection with Great-Britain, and hoped, and earneſtly deſired, that it might remain undiſturbed for many generations yet to come. There was no man, that had any thoughts of ſetting up for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. We were ſo far from this, that if Great-Britain had offered to detach us from her empire, and allowed us to be an independent ſtate, we ſhould not have accepted it without the greateſt reluctance. The known enemies of the country, by their falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations; and the Britiſh Miniſtry, who were credulous enough to believe them without any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; appear to have been the firſt, who thought of the independence of the Colonies. And they ſeem to have done every thing in their power, to provoke to it, by their groundleſs fears of it, and their unjuſtly charging us with it; their obſtinate perſeverence in the falſe accuſation—contrary to the cleareſt evidence, and the oppreſſive and cruel meaſures they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted under pretence of preventing it. If this event ſhould take place, to the diſmembering and weakening the Britiſh empire, it ought in truth and juſtice to be aſcribed to the miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The Colonies had no ſuch thing in view. They only meant to defend thoſe rights and liberties, which they peaceably enjoyed, and that according to the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015070_0011_0F95A833CF875398"/>
moſt ſolemn charters, from the firſt ſettlement of the country. If therefore the public faith of Great-Britain, pledged by ſacred charters: If the length of time, which any thing is peaceably poſſeſt, can give a right to it, which is commonly looked upon to confer as good a title as any; then ſurely we have a juſt right of exemption from theſe new invented impoſitions.</p>
            <p>If the Britiſh Parliament had any right to tax us, why did they never ſet up the claim before?—It is an unheard of thing for any ſtate to relinquiſh the tribute due to them from any people, for ſuch a great length of time.—Would they have ever pretended they had any right, had not the prodigious extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, corruption, and bribery, that have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, forced them to ſeek new reſources? And to give out ſome plauſible pretence, it was invented, that we were aiming at independence, which had never once come into our heads.</p>
            <p>For proſecution of the ſame plan, they have alſo amuſed the people with harangues upon the great national debt. But if Great-Britain be reduced to ſuch poverty and diſtreſs by the enormous debt ſhe has contracted, why does ſhe appoint ſo many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Colonies, and gentlemen to fill them, with ſuch vaſt ſalaries, where they are not needed? Why is the treaſure of the nation thus laviſhly ſquandered away to worſe than no purpoſe, inſtead of ſupporting government, to abuſe and provoke the people to break out into riots and tumults, to the ſubverſion of good order and government?</p>
            <p>When the ſhips are paid which are employed in ſupporting the acts that lay theſe taxes, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners receive their ſalaries, and all who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on theſe impoſitions, receive their demands, how much will be left to leſſen the national debt? And when, and how will the millions expended by
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015070_0012_0F95A835765CEA78"/>
Great-Britain, in proſecuting the war ſhe has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced for the ſake of theſe taxes, be recovered?</p>
            <p n="3">3. We meant to unite on the known and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged principles of the Britiſh conſtitution, which the Parliament always obſerved, and to which they always conformed in former times, as appears from many examples, which might be quoted. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament has not an <hi>abſolute,</hi> but a <hi>limitted</hi> ſupremacy, according to the known principles and uſages of the nation; otherwiſe they might vote to themſelves all the eſtates of the kingdom, and ſell the people, that choſe them, to foreign nations for ſlaves. Now there is not any one principle of the Britiſh conſtitution more fundamental and ſacred, than this; that no man ſhall be taxed but by his own conſent, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his repreſentatives in Parliament. And hence no money can be granted to the crown without the conſent of the Houſe of Commons. They juſtly keep the power of the purſe, that when they labour under any grievances, they may ſtop the Money-Bill, until they obtain redreſs from the Crown. They ſay, they <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>grant,</hi> which neceſſarily refers to what is their own, and thoſe they repreſent; but cannot refer to any thing, which belongs to thoſe who don't ſtand in this connection. It would be an abſurd piece of liberality in any man, or body of men, to give away what is not their own, which can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Now we never choſe the Britiſh Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us, and therefore they can have no manner of right to give away our money to the crown. And from the immenſe diſtance of our ſituation, all <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in Parliament is utterly impracticable,</hi> and could never anſwer any end, but to put us to vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and ſubſerve the deſigns of the Miniſtry. But we are repreſented by our own Aſſembles, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes, and therefore to theſe alone it belongs to tax us. They know our circumſtances, and pay their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015070_0013_0F95A8372652E1F0"/>
ſhare in the public taxes, ſo that we may confide ſafely in them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is not merely the opinion of the <hi>Americans,</hi> but alſo of many the greateſt and beſt members of the Britiſh Parliament, who have publickly aſſerted it, and ſupported their opinion by many unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments; both from reaſon, the principles of the Britiſh conſtitution, and the known practice upon it. Perhaps we might be a little diffident of our own judgment, as we are ſo deeply intereſted in the cauſe: But when gentlemen of the firſt character, for their underſtanding, acquaintance with the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental laws and uſages of the land, and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in public affairs, aſſert our cauſe to be juſt, and ſupport their opinion with ſuch powerful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as are ſufficient to convince all, but placemen and penſioners; this leaves no room at all to doubt, but we have juſtice and the Britiſh conſtitution on our ſide, and are contending for the true liberties, to which we are entitled as freemen, and good ſubjects, according to the laws of our native land. If this be not ſo, we muſt deſpair of underſtanding the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Britiſh conſtitution, and may renounce all pretenſions to common ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To corroborate this, let it be further obſerved, that we have choſen men to repreſent us in general Aſſemblies and Congreſſes, who before theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles aroſe, were looked upon as wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all affairs, and as honeſt and upright, as any in the land; and, as has been already obſerved, they have met and conſidered this grand affair at their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when they had all neceſſary books at hand to conſult, and all the papers before them that could throw any light upon the ſubject; and they, after the matureſt deliberations, are unanimouſly of opinion, that the meaſures of the Britiſh parliament are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, unjuſt, and oppreſſive. Now certainly we ought to pay great deference to theſe <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015070_0014_0F95A837874A0720"/>
gentlemen</hi> in this matter, ſince they are much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified to enquire and judge concerning it, are equally diſintereſted with ourſelves, are more expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the reſentment of parliament, than the bulk of the people, and under incomparably greater advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than we in general can pretend, to form a right judgment in the caſe. And if we cannot truſt to their underſtanding and integrity, to form a judgment, when we choſe them ourſelves, whom can we truſt?—It would be very abſurd for us to condemn them, when we have been far from having their advantages to look into the matter. For how can thoſe form a right judgment, who never had the caſe fully laid before them, who have not a ſufficient ſhare of learning and reading, to form an opinion on the conſtitution, the proceedings of parliament, and the liberties and privileges of the Colonies?</p>
            <p>If any ſhould object, that there is equal reaſon to confide in the Britiſh parliament, it were eaſy to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that when they vote the money of the Colonies to themſelves, they are judges in their own caſe, which prevents their being impartial judges in our caſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſelf-intereſt perverts the underſtanding, and gives a wrong bias to the mind, and therefore is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allowed in any impartial court. And then, as has been obſerved, there are great numbers, of the firſt reputation for underſtanding, who are members of parliament, who have declared theſe meaſures to be unconſtitutional, unjuſt, cruel and oppreſſive, and have warmly oppoſed them.</p>
            <p>And it is well known, that there are many methods uſed to corrupt and bias the parliament. Where <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>penſions</hi> and <hi>bribery,</hi> are ſo greatly in faſhion, there is no room for any confidence in the equity of their acts and deciſions; whereas our Congreſs are free from all ſuch methods of managing buſineſs. It cannot be pretended, even by impudence itſelf, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Congreſs have been under any undue bias,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015070_0015_0F95A83841A75700"/>
and therefore the greateſt regard is to be paid to their Reſolves, as proceeding from uncorrupted integrity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That this union is of the greateſt importance in this unhappy controverſy will appear, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly conſider the following things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Britiſh Parliament have ſet up the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant claim, <hi>to make laws to bind us in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;</hi> and to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>grant</hi> our money by taxes, at their pleaſure without our conſent; contrary to all reaſon, the known principles of the Britiſh conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the conſtant practice upon them from time immemorial; which is juſtly looked upon as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grievance, as depriving us of the moſt valuable part of our civil liberty, and as laying a foundation to increaſe and ſupport the enormous corruption which threatens the ruin of the nation. Many are the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful petitions which have been preſented, to have this grievance removed, but they have been wholly diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Preſuming on their own power, and on our weakneſs to reſiſt, from the diviſions, which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined muſt ariſe among us, they have ſteadily proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted their plan of oppreſſion, even at laſt by force and arms. Now Great-Britain is a great and powerful nation both by ſea and land. What oppoſition could one Colony have made to this mighty kingdom, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if aſſiſted by the reſt of her Colonies? It would be very diſcouraging, if only one half of the Colonies ſhould deſert the common cauſe, join the Mother country, and turn their arms againſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who ſhould ſtand firm in oppoſition to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary meaſures. Such Colonies would certainly be in very eminent danger of being overpowered, by their neighbouring provinces, furniſhed with arms from Great-Britain. The hopes of ſucceſs in our oppoſition to theſe unconſtitutional and oppreſſive meaſures, you ſee greatly depend on our union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:015070_0016_0F95A83A008C6D38"/>
Our numbers<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>It is computed that in caſe of neceſſity, the Colonies can bring half a million of fighting men into the field.</hi>
               </note> are great, and our inhabitants in general, are not enervated with luxury and debauchery, but inured to hardſhip. Many ſerved in the late war, and we have experienced Generals and Commanders. Our troops have fought as bravely as any in the world. They have all the ſpirit and reſolution of freemen, and the diſtance from the Mother country is ſo great, that they cannot without a prodigious expence, tranſport their troops to carry on the war. There is no reaſon in the world, why any nation ſhould tyrannize over and oppreſs another. And the hiſtory of mankind, does not afford any inſtance, wherein any kingdom or empire could keep ſuch diſtant provinces, inhabited by ſuch vaſt numbers of men of ſpirit, in ſlavery, unleſs they divide among themſelves. Diviſions tend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and enſlave us, but let us remain united and firm; this will procure deliverance and freedom, through the bleſſing of heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The importance of this union and firmneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes every day. For we have made oppoſition. The ſword has been drawn, battles have been fought, and ſundry fortreſſes have been reduced, by the forces raiſed by the common conſent of the Colonies. Well, think now, what the conſequences would probably be, if we ſhould be overcome. Why, we ſhould doubtleſs be obliged to pay all the expences, that the crown is put to in ſubduing us; which would take the greateſt part of our eſtates, were we to ſubmit, even now. But beſides this, we have reaſon to fear, that all our lands would be declared forfeit to the crown, according to the common ſentence againſt Rebels, as they are pleaſed to call us.—And thus, there is no hope at all of any thing, in our being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but abject beggary. And ſince all the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any ſucceſs, depends upon our union, and firmneſs; it muſt be of the greateſt importance for us
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015070_0017_0F95A83A8350EC38"/>
to lay aſide all diviſions, and be united among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As ſuch a vigorous oppoſition has been made, we have certainly reaſon to think, that if we were now to ſubmit, it would be infinitely worſe for us than if we had ſubmitted at firſt; that we muſt not only be taxed at pleaſure, as the Parliament propoſed, but alſo make good, the great damages the nation have been put to in this controverſy. Whereas by union, proper reſolution, and good conduct, through the bleſſing of God, we may convince the Britiſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of their miſtake, and diſpoſe them to reſtore peace, and allow us not only to enjoy our eſtates, but alſo the rights and privileges, for which we have been contending. Their own intereſt will probably, at length open their eyes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A very ſmall ſhare of attention to the ſtate of our country, and the unmanly artifices and induſtry, which our adverſaries have uſed to ſtir up the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Canadians,</hi> to invade our frontiers, muſt ſhew us, that we have already received very important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from this union of the Colonies, and the endeavours of the Congreſs to ſecure the natives to our intereſt. For had it not been for theſe, our frontiers had been ravaged for many a hundred miles, and thouſands of the back inhabitants would, in all probabilty, have been murdered, and ſcalped, and the women and children burned in the flames that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummed their houſes, or inhumanly butchered by that ſavage and barbarous enemy. For the King's Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and their agents, have uſed their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prejudice the <hi>Indians</hi> againſt us, and urged them to fall upon our wide extended frontiers. And if they had ſucceeded in theſe cruel attempts, what a dreadful ſcene, would this have opened! It is eaſier imagined than deſcribed. It is ſhocking indeed, but alas too true, that the barbarous ſavages of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs have been earneſtly ſolicited to fall upon the frontiers!—Where is the boaſted humanity of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015070_0018_0F95A83B734FF0C8"/>
Britiſh nation!—What will not arbitrary power at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to maintain and ſpread its baleful influence?—Let <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> and <hi>Falmouth</hi> declare! Let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of the agents among the ſavages teſtify! Let the baſe ſeizure of BOSTON, and the confinement of thouſands of the inhabitants to miſery and want, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the public faith, ſolemnly pledged, bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all generations!</p>
            <p n="4">4. This union will appear important in another view, <abbr>viz.</abbr> on ſuppoſition that we ſhould not think it beſt to continue the war, but upon the whole judge it prudent to ſubmit; yet ſtill we would ſubmit on the beſt terms we could.—Thus CANADA, in the laſt war, when they thought prudent to ſubmit, yet obtained very favourable terms. For our Generals knew, that it would be attended with immenſe coſt of treaſure and blood, to make an entire conqueſt, even though they had gotten poſſeſſion of their principal fortreſſes, as the inhabitants of the country would be conſtantly haraſſing them, cutting off their convoys, and beating up their quarters. They were united, and they obtained ſuch good terms of ſubmiſſion, that they ſuffered but little by the conqueſt, Whereas, if they had been divided, and ſubmitted without any terms, they would have been in very deplorable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. And thus, if we remain firm and united, there is no reaſonable doubt, but we may in proper time have tolerable terms. For cannot we haraſs them more than <hi>Canada</hi> could? But if we divide and break to pieces among ourſelves, we need expect no terms at all, but to be ſtripped of all, and made ſlaves to the conquerors, as has been already obſerved. Let ſuch as think it would be beſt to ſubmit, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that no terms have been offered to us, ſince the commencement of hoſtilities, only reſigning up our arms, and giving ſufficient ſecurity for the tame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the inhabitants, (as <hi>Mowat</hi> offered to <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth)</hi> which certainly no man in his ſenſes would be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015070_0019_0F95A83C62E2CD28"/>
willing to accept. Who would be ſo mean ſpirited, as to reſign his arms, till he was conquered? Would ſuch, as are moſt zealous for the crown, be willing to be given up as hoſtages, and to be put to death in caſe the Colonies refuſed to ſubmit to the ſchemes of the Miniſtry? No. They would immediately ſhrink at the propoſal. So that there is no way at preſent to accommodate the breach, as no terms have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Union then muſt be of great importance, until they are offered, unleſs that people would propoſe to bring utter ruin on this flouriſhing country, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed upon themſelves and their poſterity.</p>
            <p>As we live in the ſame country, in the ſame go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and have a thouſand connections, we ſhould in all prudence determine to ſtand or fall together. We ſhall doubtleſs be conſidered in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the ſentence, which will be iſſued againſt us in this caſe, will be general, againſt whole Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and will not make exceptions for this, that, and the other perſon. For if the pretenſions of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons in ſuch a caſe were to be regarded, there would be no end, every one could have ſome plea or other to make for themſelves. But, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in all ſuch caſes, the ſentence againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in any Colony, muſt proceed upon the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Aſſemblies, the part they took in the conteſt. Now, as it is well known, that our General Aſſembly have eſpouſed the cauſe of the country, in oppoſition to the Britiſh Miniſtry, it is too late for our inhabitants to think of availing themſelves by their private jangling and clamours, when the evidence of the part we have taken is ſo clear and undeniable. Since all the Colonies have ſolemnly confederated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it would be mean indeed to deſert the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom cauſe, inconſiſtent with the public faith already pledged; and would therefore draw upon ſuch perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious wretches, the vengeance of the reſt, not to mention the curſe of God, for their breach of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015070_0020_0F95A83FF8DEA7A0"/>
So that if only a part here, and a part there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould ſubmit, it would kindle civil war among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which would be more dreadful than with Great-Britain, as by living among one another, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants would have an opportunity, every man to kill his neighbour, and turn the country into a field of blood and deſolation; whereas, by a ſubmiſſion upon terms, wherein all are included, theſe dreadful cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities might be prevented; and when the worſt comes to the worſt, we might at laſt obtain good conditions of peace.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We are now in the laſt place more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to point out ſome of the bad conſequences of breaking this general union.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, that every one will readily underſtand, that thoſe break it, who don't comply with it, and carefully obſerve it. This may be done by words or actions, and more groſsly in ſome inſtances than in others; ſome may break it through ignorance, others with premeditated deſign and obſtinacy; ſo that there may be a very great difference among ſuch, and very different degrees of guilt contracted. This being premiſed; I would obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this non-compliance occaſions, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in my text, of the diviſions of Reuben, great thoughts and ſearchings of heart. Such are ready to pretend to be good friends to their country: But why then do they refuſe to join with their brethren?—Let their views and intentions be what they will, they expoſe themſelves to great ſuſpicions and reproaches, and employ ſome part of that attention how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their doing miſchief, which ſhould be devoted to plan and provide for the common ſafety. And, as all men have their particular friends and connections, this diviſion occaſions much alienation of heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among brethren, and various diſturbances in the country; all which are very uncomfortable, and mar the public peace, and which might be happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015070_0021_0F95A841CB1470E8"/>
by all heartily uniting with the vaſtly great majority of the country.</p>
            <p>And theſe things are alſo attended with much ſin and wickedneſs. Can perſons maintain an unfriendly temper to their country, and neighbours, and ſeek to ſubject them to heavy taxes and ſlavery; and be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent?—Can they miſrepreſent the country, and ſolicit for troops to dragoon us into ſubmiſſion to theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional acts of Parliament, without contracting guilt of the blackeſt die?—They often complain of the hard treatment they have met with. It is likely they have been hardly uſed in ſome inſtances; but they ſhould make ſome allowance for the zeal, which is common at ſuch times, when people are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſtruggling for their LIBERTIES, and THEIR ALL. They would alſo do well to conſider, whether they are not the blameable cauſe, by giving juſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the treatment, of which they complain.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould plead conſcience for their conduct, it might be queried, whether they have ever taken ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient pains to inform themſelves? or examined the matter with due candour?—Where is the divine law, that binds their conſcience to make diviſions to ſupport oppreſſion, and ruin their country?—The wiſeſt and beſt men in the Parliament, and among ourſelves, who have been choſen on purpoſe to conſider this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and who have had leiſure, and all poſſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, are unanimous for oppoſition. Now, ſuch as have never had opportunity to examine fully, nor take pains to inform themſelves, might, conſiſtent with modeſty and prudence, very juſtly ſcruple their own judgment. It ſeems to favour more of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, impudence, and obſtinacy, than of conſcience, to act contrary to the united wiſdom of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>Any unprejudiced perſon would rather think, from the many exhortations, we have in the ſcriptures, to peace and unanimity, that their conſcience ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015070_0022_0F95A8460FE61950"/>
dictate to them, to be of one mind with their brethren; and ſtudy the things that make for peace, <q>and the things whereby we may edify one another,</q> and ſupport the common cauſe of our country.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This muſt receive ſome weight from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that ſuch as appear in oppoſition to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral union, cannot poſſibly be of any ſervice or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the miniſterial cauſe, ſince the power and arms of the country are all in a manner againſt them. Such as have ſhewed hoſtile intentions, or have riſen in arms have been ſo few, and their councils ſo diſtracted, that they have been diſperſed and diſarmed almoſt as ſoon as they have been diſcovered; ſo that they have not been able to make the leaſt diverſion in favour of the miniſterial army, or contribute any aſſiſtance. All they have done is, to diſturb the public peace a little, to bring laſting reproach and diſgrace upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and perplexity, with diſtreſs of mind, upon their families; all which they might have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by joining with their brethren. And why ſhould any man, without good reaſon, bring immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate trouble on himſelf and family? Does not this look like a very ſilly piece of conduct? If they have no love nor regard for their country, why ſhould they have none for their wives and children?</p>
            <p>The damage they do the common cauſe by ſuch conduct, is the holding it up to the public view of the nation at home, that there is a diviſion among us. For when it is repreſented, that <hi>Ridgefield</hi> and <hi>Newtown,</hi> and a few more ſuch places, are in oppoſition, we, who live here, know, that theſe towns are ſmall, and the oppoſition ſo contemptible, as ſcarcely to be worth the public notice; but the nation at home, the greater part of them, don't know, but theſe are ſome great and populous cities, like <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Liverpool,</hi> and thus it carries in it the nature of falſe intelligence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the parliament, and thus hardens them to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their pernicious meaſures, to their own diſhonour
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015070_0023_0F95A847C538A798"/>
and deſtruction. If the Miniſtry had obtained a true account of the ſtate of the country, before they had proceeded ſo far, they would never have attempted theſe things. But the enemies of the country made it their buſineſs to miſrepreſent the ſtate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and thus impoſe upon and deceive the miniſtry; ſo that they have been, in this reſpect, the wicked inſtruments of all the calamities that have come, the ruin of all the towns that have been burned, and of all the lives that have been loſt in this unnatural war.—When enquiry ſhall be made for blood, they will doubtleſs be found to be deeply ſtained with the blood of the many innocents, that have been already ſlain, or that may yet be ſlain in the proſecution of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy conteſt.</p>
            <p>Should they therefore obtain the heighth of their wiſhes, even that the country ſhould be ſubdued by the miniſterial forces, this would make them but ſmall compenſation for the guilt, they have contracted; and the puniſhment that is hanging over them, for the great deceit they have uſed with the miniſtry, and the many miſrepreſentations they have made, and lies they have told, and induſtriouſly propagated and ſpread, to carry on their ſchemes, and accompliſh the ruin of this land.</p>
            <p>As to their being diſtinguiſhed and rewarded by the crown, after the deſtruction and conqueſt of theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, they may conſider, that it is far from being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this event will take place. For it is poſſible, that the unhappy breach may yet be healed. The great God governs the world. He can reſtrain the pride and the wrath of man, He can eaſily diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ſchemes and deſigns of deceitful and cruel men, as he did wicked <hi>Haman's,</hi> and reſtore peace to his people. He has ſaid that <q>he will ſpeak peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people, and to his ſaints; but let them not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to folly. The rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous; leſt the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015070_0024_0F95A84805C2BB40"/>
But if the things of the nation's peace, ſhould in judgment be hid from the eyes of the rulers, for the correction of their ſins, and ours; and the miniſtry ſhould proſecute the war with the greateſt vigour; yet it is far from being certain, that they would be able to ſubdue us. For they muſt carry on the war at prodigious diſadvantage, by reaſon of our diſtance from them. Whereas our troops are here upon the ſpot, ready to take the field upon the ſhorteſt warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Their troops will be ſickly, when they arrive, from the length of their voyage, and their not being uſed to the climate; whereas this being our native country, our ſoldiers are likely to be as much favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with health, as any troops in the world. And ſince the <hi>Americans</hi> are all freemen, and fight for their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>their all,</hi> and are known to be endowed with the greateſt bravery, it is not to be doubted but they will fight with greater courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the mercenary troops of the miniſtry, who contrary to their inclinations, or through groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, fight to enforce ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch as have their minds fearfully poſſeſſed with the power of Britain, her formidable fleet, and gallant armies, remember, that <q>the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong.</q> The God of armies gives the victory to whom it pleaſes him. And ſurely the righteous and merciful God, does not approve of oppreſſion and tyranny; and therefore we have no reaſon to think, that he will ſucceed the deſigns of the miniſtry, any further than is neceſſary for our correction, to bring us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for our many ſins and backſlidings. Now on either of theſe ſuppoſitions, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that reconciliation ſhould yet take place, between us and the mother-country; or that Great-Britain ſhould not be able finally to ſubdue this land, but we ſhould, like the <hi>Dutch Provinces,</hi> maintain our liberties and privileges; What muſt become of the known enemies of the country,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015070_0025_0F95A84B4C4F9898"/>
that ſeek to break our union, to divide and deſtroy us?</p>
            <p>But if the country ſhould be deſtroyed by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial army, which is all ſuch enemies can wiſh for, what benefit would this be to them? A ruined coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can afford but ſmall revenues, to the moſt ſevere publican, and mercileſs commiſſioner of cuſtoms. And though there are but few ſuch, compared with the whole body of this people, yet theſe are vaſtly too many to be all taken notice of and rewarded. One or two hundred would be ſufficient for all the poſts of honour and profit, the crown would have to beſtow, even then. Whereas there are more than two or three thouſand, who are unfriendly to the common cauſe in the ſeveral governments, ſo that ſcarcely one in ten, perhaps not one in a hundred, who would ever obtain any promotion or reward; but all muſt pay their quota of the heavy taxes that would be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And ſuch offices are not entailed upon families, even thoſe who ſhould obtain them, as ſoon as they were dead, their children would be as much oppreſſed as any. And thus, upon the whole, ſuch as break the union of the Colonies, though in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little diviſion they do much damage by deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſtry, and encouraging them to proſecute their pernicious meaſures, can have no rational proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of any advantage to themſelves; but if the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try be ruined, muſt periſh unnoticed in the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, they have been the unhappy inſtruments of bringing on the country.</p>
            <p>For if there were a great many more offices of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and honour, in the gift of the crown, than there could be, muſt not the officers and troops, that were employed in conquering the country, be provided for in the firſt place?—Such of the <hi>Americans</hi> then, as merely wiſh ſucceſs to the parliament, muſt wait till all theſe were rewarded; ſo that upon the whole, if they promiſe themſelves any great things, from the ruin of the country, they are moſt likely to be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015070_0026_0F95A84D0445D388"/>
as is juſt and righteous, in divine providence. What pretenſions can ſuch as prove treacherous to their country, have to recommend them to any office, of honour and profit? Don't they rather forfeit all credit and truſt, and juſtly deſerve to be neglected, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and abhorred by all mankind? Such then as diſſent from the great majority of their country, and promote diviſions and contentions, muſt do it thro' igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or obſtinacy, or hopes of private advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the moſt mean and ſordid of all views; which hopes they may reſt fully aſſured, will be diſappointed. And thus they will find in the end, that they will reap no advantage from their conduct; only the reflection that they have endeavoured to do miſchief, and ruin their country, and themſelves, for the ſake of miſchief, and the groundleſs hatred they bore to their native land, will remain to conſole them.</p>
            <p>How much wiſer are they to diveſt themſelves of all their groundleſs prejudices againſt their country, and heartily join with their brethern, that no head may be wanting in the hour of conſultation, nor hand ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the hour of action. When ſuch a numerous and brave people are united as one man, in the righteous cauſe of their much oppreſſed and injured country; What can be imagined too difficult for them to attempt and accompliſh? What can reſiſt their united ardour, or ſtop the torrent of their ſucceſſes?—</p>
            <p n="3">3. And now ſince we have raiſed forces, and our friends, our neighbours, our brothers and children, are gone forth, and are expoſing their lives in the high places of the field for our defence, and we all muſt contribute our ſhare in the common expence for their ſupport; ſurely it muſt be abſurd with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for us, who live at our eaſe at home, to weaken their hands, and diſcourage their hearts, and ſpirit up the enemy againſt them, by our diviſions and quarrels. For theſe diviſions have this tendency, They may well reaſon with themſelves, "why ſhould we expoſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015070_0027_0F95A84D472890B8"/>
to hunger and cold, and all the malice and fury of the enemy, when our friends and brethren at home are joining againſt us?" Do perſons really deſire to prolong the war, that they may ſupport it at a vaſt expence, that their children, and brothers, and friends and neighbours, ſhould be overthrown by the enemy, lie unburied in the field, or to periſh in a loathſome priſon? Do they deſire that the enemy ſhould lay waſte our country by fire and ſword, raviſh our wives and daughters, and butcher our children? If they do not, let them not encourage the Miniſtry by diviſions, but maintain the general union to the utmoſt of their power. Otherwiſe, if theſe inteſtine diviſions ſhould prove the means of diſcouraging our armies, and of hardening and ſpiriting up our foes; and this land ſhould be ruined and enſlaved, poſterity to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations will curſe the promoters of theſe diviſions, and the names and memory of the wretches, will be held in everlaſting abhorrence, as the baſe betrayers of their once happy country.—If perſons don't think of ſuch dreadful conſquences, it is ſurely high time they did.</p>
            <p>To conclude this diſcourſe, let us be thankful to the Lord, who, in the courſe of his providence, has cauſed ſuch a <hi>general union</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> to prevail throughout the Colonies. This unexpected union in the common danger and diſtreſs, for our common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is ſurely to be aſcribed to the Lord, in whoſe hands are the hearts of the children of men; who has eſtabliſhed his throne in the Heavens, and whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom rules over all. And while we are thankful for this union, and for the various ſucceſſes with which the Lord of hoſts has crowned our arms; let us carefully avoid every thing that tends to break this happy uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon which the ſafety of the country evidently depends. Let us avoid as much as poſſible, all malice and bitterneſs; and while we unite as brethren, let us alſo love as brethren, and as much as poſſible, ſtudy the things that make for peace and harmony; that if
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015070_0028_0F95A850A01C8CF0"/>
it be poſſible, we may preſerve peace among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>And ſince theſe troubles and calamities, are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for our ſins, and backſlidings, let us all be earneſtly called upon, to hear the voice of God's rod, as well as of his word, "and repent and turn from all our tranſgreſſions, that ſo iniquiry may not prove our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in." This will be the beſt means to promote our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to enſure ſucceſs, by engaging the Lord to be on our ſide. This will be the beſt evidence of our complying with the great deſign of this day of public thankſgiving, ſince the goodneſs of God, with which ſincere gratitude complies, leads ſinners to repentance: To which may God Almighty diſpoſe us, by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his ſpirit, through Jeſus Chriſt, AMEN.</p>
