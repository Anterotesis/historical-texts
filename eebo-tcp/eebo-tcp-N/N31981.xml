            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<list>
                  <item>I. Deſcribe the Sleepers to whom they are ſpoken.</item>
                  <item>II. Inforce the Exhortation <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead.</hi> And,</item>
                  <item>III. Explain the Promiſe made to ſuch as do awake and ariſe, CHRIST <hi>ſhall give thee Light.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. 1. And firſt, as to the Sleepers here ſpoken to. By Sleep is ſignified the natural State of Man; that deep Sleep of the Soul into which the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> hath caſt all who ſpring from his Loins; that Supineneſs, Indolence and Stupidity, that Inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his real Condition, wherein every Man comes into the World, and continues 'till the Voice of GOD awakes him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now <hi>they that ſleeps ſleep in the Night.</hi> The State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a State of utter Darkneſs; a State wherein <hi>Darkneſs covers the Earth, and groſs Darkneſs the People.</hi> The poor unawakened Sinner, how much Knowledge ſoever he may have, as to other Things, has no Knowledge of himſelf: In this Reſpect <hi>he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Nothing yet as he ought to know.</hi> He knows not that he is a fallen Spirit, whoſe only Buſineſs in this preſent World is to recover from his Fall, to regain that Image of GOD wherein he was created. He ſees no <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for <hi>the one Thing needful,</hi> even that inward univerſal Change, that <hi>Birth from above,</hi> (figured out by Baptiſm,) which is the Beginning of that total Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Sanctification of Spirit, Soul and Body, <hi>without which no Man ſhall ſee the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Full of all Diſeaſes as he is, he fancies himſelf in perfect Health: Faſt bound in Miſery and Iron, he dreams that he is happy, and at Liberty. He ſays, Peace, Peace, while the Devil, <hi>as a ſtrong Man armed,</hi> is in full poſſeſſion of his Soul. He ſleeps on ſtill, and takes his Reſt, tho' Hell is moved from beneath to meet him; tho' the Pit, from whence there is no Return, hath opened its Mouth to ſwallow him up: A Fire is kindled around
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:042191_0003_101BA5F99F6F4590"/>
him, yet he knoweth it not; yea, it burns him, yet he lays it not to Heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By one who ſleeps, we are therefore to underſtand (and would to GOD we might all underſtand it!) a Sinner ſatisfied in his Sins, contented to remain in his fallen State, to live and die without the Image of GOD: One who is ignorant both of his Diſeaſe, and of the only Remedy for it: One who never was warned, or never regarded the warning Voice of GOD <hi>to flee from the Wrath to come:</hi> One that never yet ſaw he was in Danger of Hell-fire, or cried in the Earneſtneſs of his Soul, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If this Sleeper be not outwardly vicious, his Sleep is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the deepeſt of all: Whether he be of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Spirit, <hi>neither cold nor hot;</hi> but a quiet, rational, inoffenſive, good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Profeſſor of the Religion of his Fathers; or whether he be zealous and orthodox, and <hi>after the ſtraiteſt Sect of our Religion, lives a Phariſee,</hi> that is, according to the ſcriptural Account, one that <hi>juſtifies himſelf;</hi> one that labours <hi>to eſtabliſh his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> as the Ground of his Acceptance with GOD.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This is he, who, <hi>having the Form of Godlineſs, denies the Power thereof;</hi> yea, and probably reviles it whereſoever it is found, as mere Extravagance and Deluſion. Mean-while, the wretched Self-deceiver thanks GOD that <hi>he is not as other Men are; Adulterers, Unjuſt, Extortioners:</hi> No, he doth no Wrong to any Man. He <hi>faſts twice in the Week,</hi> uſes all the Means of Grace, is conſtant at Church and Sacrament; yea, and <hi>gives Tythes of all that he has,</hi> does all the Good that he can: <hi>Touching the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law,</hi> he is <hi>blameleſs:</hi> He wants Nothing of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but the Power; Nothing of Religion, but the Spirit; Nothing of Chriſtianity, but the Truth and the Life.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But know ye not, that however highly eſteemed among Men, <hi>ſuch a Chriſtian</hi> as this may be, he is an Abomination in the Sight of GOD, and an Heir of every Woe, which the Son of GOD, Yeſterday, To-day and for ever, denounces againſt <hi>Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites?</hi> He hath <hi>made clean the Outſide of the Cup and Platter,</hi> but within is full of all Filthineſs. <hi>An evil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe cleaveth</hi> ſtill <hi>unto him;</hi> ſo that <hi>his inward Parts are very Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</hi> Our LORD fitly compares him to a <hi>painted Sepulchre,</hi> which <hi>appears beautiful without;</hi> But nevertheleſs is <hi>full of dead Mens Bones, and of all Uncleanneſs.</hi> The Bones indeed are no longer dry; <hi>the Sinews and the Fleſh are come upon them, and the Skin covers them above:</hi> But <hi>there is no Breath</hi> in them, no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Living God. And <hi>if any Man have not the Spirit</hi> of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:042191_0004_101BA5FC61907010"/>
CHRIST, <hi>he is none of His. Ye are</hi> CHRIST<hi>'s if ſo be that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of</hi> GOD <hi>dwell in you.</hi> But if not, GOD knoweth that ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in Death, even until now.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This is another Character of the Sleeper here ſpoken to. He abides in Death, tho' he knows it not. He is dead unto GOD, <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> For, <hi>to be carnally mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is Death.</hi> Even as it is written, <hi>by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin: And ſo Death paſſed upon all Men,</hi> not only temporal Death, but likewiſe ſpiritual and eternal. <hi>In the Day thou eateſt</hi> (ſaid GOD to <hi>Adam) thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> Not bodily (unleſs as he then became mortal) but ſpiritually: Thou ſhalt loſe the Life of thy Soul: Thou ſhalt die to GOD; ſhall be ſeparated from Him thy eſſential Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Thus firſt was diſſolved the vital Union of our Soul with GOD; inſomuch that in <hi>the Midſt of</hi> natural <hi>Life we are</hi> now <hi>in</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Death.</hi> And herein we remain, 'till the Second <hi>Adam</hi> becomes a quickning Spirit to us, 'till He raiſes the Dead, the Dead in Sin, in Pleaſure, Riches, or Honours. But before any dead Soul can live, he hears, (hearkens to) <hi>the Voice of the Son of</hi> GOD: He is made ſenſible of his loſt Eſtate, and receives the Sentence of Death in himſelf. He knows himſelf to be <hi>dead while he liveth,</hi> dead to GOD; and all the Things of GOD: Having no more Power to perform the Actions of a living Chriſtian, than a dead Body to perform the Functions of a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And moſt certain it is, that one dead in Sin, has not his <hi>Senſes exerciſed to diſcern</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Good and Evil: Having Eyes he ſees not; he hath Ears, and hears not.</hi> He doth not <hi>taſte and ſee the</hi> LORD <hi>is gracious.</hi> He <hi>hath not ſeen</hi> GOD <hi>at any Time, nor heard his Voice,</hi> nor <hi>handled the Word of Life.</hi> In vain is the Name of JESUS <hi>like Ointment poured fourth,</hi> and <hi>all his Garments ſmell of Myrrh, Aloes, and Caſſia.</hi> The Soul that ſleepeth in Death, hath no Perception of any Objects of this Kind. His Heart is <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> and underſtands none of theſe Things.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And hence, having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Senſes, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ets of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Knowledge, the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of GOD: Nay, he is ſo far from receiving them, that whatſover is ſpiritually diſcerned, is mere Fooliſhneſs unto him. He is not content with being utterly ignorant of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Things, but he denies the very Exiſtence of them. And ſpiritual Senſation itſelf is to him, the Fooliſhneſs of Folly. <hi>How,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can theſe Things be?</hi> How can any Man <hi>know</hi> that he is alive to GOD? Even as you know, that your Body is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:042191_0005_101BA5FDEC510438"/>
now alive? Faith is the Life of the Soul; And if ye have this Life abiding in you, ye want no Mark to evidence it to <hi>your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> but that divine Conſciouſneſs, that <hi>Witneſs of</hi> GOD, which is more and greater than ten thouſand human Witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="12">12. If He doth not now bear Witneſs with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of GOD; O that He might convince thee, thou poor unawakened Sinner, by his Demonſtration and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that thou art a Child of the Devil! O that, as I propheſy, there might now be <hi>a Noiſe and a Shaking,</hi> and may <hi>the Bones come together, Bone to his Bone.</hi> Then <hi>come from the four Winds, O Breath, and breathe on theſe Slain, that they may live!</hi> And do not ye harden your Hearts, and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, who even now is come to <hi>convince</hi> you <hi>of Sin, becauſe you believe not on the Name of the only begotten Son of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">II. 1. Wherefore <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead.</hi> GOD calleth thee now by my Mouth; and bids thee know thyſelf, thou fallen Spirit; thy true State, and only Concern below. <hi>What meaneſt thou O Sleeper? Ariſe! Call upon thy</hi> GOD <hi>if ſo be thy</hi> GOD <hi>will think upon thee, that thou periſh not.</hi> A migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Tempeſt is ſtirred up round about thee, and thou art ſinking into the Depths of Perdition, the Gulph of GOD'S Judgments. If thou would eſcape them, caſt thyſelf into them. <hi>Judge thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thou ſhalt not be judged of the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Awake, awake! Stand up this Moment, leſt thou <hi>drink at the</hi> LORD<hi>'s Hand the Cup of his Fury.</hi> Stir up thyſelf <hi>to lay hold on the</hi> LORD, <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>thy Righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave! Shake thyſelf from the Duſt.</hi> At leaſt, let the Earthquake of GOD'S Threatnings ſhake thee. Awake and cry out with the trembling Goaler, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> And never reſt, 'till thou believeſt on the LORD JESUS, with a Faith which is his Gift, by the Operation of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If I ſpeak to any one of you more than to another, it is to thee, who thinkeſt thyſelf unconcerned in this Exhortation. <hi>I have a Meſſage from</hi> GOD <hi>unto thee.</hi> In his Name I <hi>warn</hi> thee <hi>to flee form the Wrath to come.</hi> Thou unholy Soul, ſee thy Picture in condemned <hi>Peter,</hi> lying in the dark Dungeon, between the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, bound with two Chains, the Keepers before the Door keeping the Priſon. The Night is far ſpent, the Morning is at Hand when thou art to be brought forth to Execution. And in theſe dreadful Circumſtances thou art faſt aſleep in the Devil's Arms, on the Brink of the Pit, in the Jaws of everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. O may <hi>the Angel of the</hi> LORD <hi>come upon thee, and the Light
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:042191_0006_101BA60087EFF798"/>
ſhine into thy Priſon!</hi> And mayeſt thou feel the Stroke of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Hand, raiſing thee with, <hi>Ariſe up, quickly gird thyſelf, and bind on thy Sandals, caſt thy Garment about thee, and follow me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Awake thou everlaſting Spirit, out of thy Dream of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Happineſs. Did not GOD create thee for Himſelf? Then thou canſt not reſt, 'till thou reſteſt on Him. Return thou Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. Fly back to thy Ark. <hi>This is not thy home.</hi> Think not of building Tabernacles here. Thou art but <hi>a Stranger, a Sojourner upon Earth:</hi> A Creature of a Day, but, juſt launching out into an unchangeable State. Make Haſte, Eternity is at Hand. Eternity depends on this Moment. An Eternity of Happineſs, or an Eternity of Miſery.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In what State is thy Soul? Was GOD, while I am yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to require it of thee, Art thou ready to meet Death and Judgment? Canſt thou ſtand in his Sight, <hi>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity?</hi> Art thou <hi>meet to be Partaker of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in Light?</hi> Haſt thou <hi>fought a good Fight, and kept the Faith?</hi> Haſt thou ſecured <hi>the one Thing needful?</hi> Haſt thou recovered the Image of GOD, even <hi>Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs?</hi> Haſt thou <hi>put off the Old Man, and put on the New?</hi> Art thou <hi>cloathed upon with</hi> CHRIST?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Haſt thou Oil in thy Lamp? Grace in thy Heart?

Art thou a Chriſtian indeed? That is, a new Creature? <hi>Are old Things paſt away, and all Things become new?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Art thou <hi>Partaker of the Divine Nature?

            <p n="9">9. If it offends thee, be thou aſſured, that thou neither art a Chriſtian, nor deſireſt to be one. Nay, thy <hi>very Prayer is turned into Sin;</hi> and thou haſt ſolemnly mocked GOD this very Day, by praying for the Inſpiration of his holy Spirit, when thou didſt not believe there was any ſuch Thing to be received.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Yet on the Authority of God's Word, and our own
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:042191_0007_101BA605EE6B6C40"/>
Church, I muſt repeat the Queſtion, <hi>Haſt thou received the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> If thou haſt not, thou art not yet a Chriſtian: For a Chriſtian is a Man that is <hi>anointed with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Power.</hi> Thou art not yet made a Partaker of the pure Religion, and undefiled. Doſt thou know what Religion is? That it is a Participation of Divine Nature: The Life of GOD in the Soul of Man: CHRIST <hi>in thee, the Hope of Glory:</hi> Happineſs and Holineſs: Heaven begun upon Earth: <hi>A Kingdom of</hi> GOD <hi>within thee; not Meat and Drink;</hi> no outward Thing; <hi>but Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> An everlaſting Kingdom brought into thy Soul, a <hi>Peace of</hi> GOD, <hi>that paſſeth all Underſtanding; a Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Knoweſt thou, that in JESUS CHRIST, <hi>neither Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on availeth any Thing, or Uncircumciſion; but Faith that worketh by Love;</hi> but a new Creation: Seeſt thou the Neceſſity of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Change, that ſpiritual Birth, that Life from the Dead, that Holineſs? And art thou throughly convinced, that <hi>without it, no Man ſhall ſee the</hi> LORD? Art thou labouring after it? <hi>Giving all Diligence to make thy Calling and Election ſure? Working out thy Salvation with Fear and Trembling? Agonizing to enter in at the ſtrait Gate?</hi> Art thou <hi>in earneſt</hi> about thy Soul? And canſt thou tell the Searcher of Hearts, <hi>Thou, O</hi> GOD <hi>art the Thing that I long for!</hi> LORD, Thou knoweſt all Things, Thou knoweſt that I <hi>would</hi> love thee!</p>
            <p n="12">12. Thou hopeſt to be ſaved—but what Reaſon haſt thou to give of the Hope that is in thee? Is it becauſe thou haſt done no Harm? Or becauſe thou haſt done much Good? Or becauſe thou art not like other Men; but wiſe, or learned, or honeſt and morally good? Eſteemed of Men, or of a fair Reputation? Alas, all this will never bring thee to GOD. It is in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count lighter than Vanity. Doſt thou <hi>know</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>whom he hath ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Hath he taught thee, that <hi>by Grace we are ſaved, thro' Faith; and that, not of ourſelves; it is the Gift of</hi> GOD; <hi>Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt?</hi> Haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the faithful Saying, as the whole Foundation of thy Hope, <hi>that</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>came into the World to ſave Sinners!</hi> Haſt thou learnt what that meaneth, <hi>I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners, to Repentance? I am not ſent but to the loſt Sheep? Art</hi> thou (he that heareth, let him underſtand) loſt, dead? <hi>Damned already?</hi>—Doſt thou know thy Deſerts? Doſt thou feel thy Wants?

feeding upon the Huſks which he had left? Art thou willing to <hi>live godly in</hi> CHRIST JESUS? And doſt thou therefore <hi>ſuffer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution?</hi> Do <hi>Men ſay all Manner of Evil againſt thee falſly, for the Son of Man's Sake?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. O that in all theſe Queſtions ye may hear the Voice that wakes the Dead, and feel that Hammer of the Word, Which <hi>breaketh the Rock in Pieces!—If ye will hear his Voice To-day, while it is called To-day, harden not your Hearts.</hi> Now <hi>awake thou that ſleepeſt</hi> in ſpiritual Death, that thou ſleep not in Death eternal! Feel thy loſt Eſtate, and <hi>ariſe from the Dead.</hi> Leave thine own Companions in Sin and Death. Follow thou JESUS, and <hi>let the Dead bury the Dead. Save thyſelf from this untoward Generation. Come out from among them, and be thou ſeparate, and touch not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Thing, and the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall receive thee.</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall give thee Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. 1. This Promiſe I come, laſtly, to explain. And how encouraging a Conſideration is this, That whoſoever thou art who obeyeſt his Call, thou canſt not ſeek his Face in vain. If thou even now <hi>awakeſt, and ariſeſt from the Dead.</hi> He hath bound himſelf to <hi>give thee Light. The</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall give</hi> thee <hi>Grace and Glory;</hi> the Light of his Grace here, and the Light of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when thou receiveſt the <hi>Crown that fadeth not away.</hi> Thy Light <hi>ſhall break forth as the Morning, and thy Darkneſs be as the Noon-Day.</hi> GOD, <hi>who commandeth the Light to ſhine out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſhall <hi>ſhine in thy Heart, to give the Knowledge of the Glory of</hi> GOD <hi>in the Face of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. <hi>On them that fear the</hi> LORD, <hi>ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe, with healing in his Wings.</hi> And <hi>in that Day it ſhall be ſaid unto thee, Ariſe, ſhine; for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</hi> LORD <hi>is ariſen upon thee.</hi> For CHRIST <hi>ſhall</hi> reveal himſelf in thee. And he is the <hi>true Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD is the Light, and will give himſelf to every awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Sinner that waiteth for Him: And thou ſhalt then be a Temple of the living GOD, and CHRIST ſhall <hi>dwell in the Heart of Faith:</hi> And <hi>being rooted and grounded in Love, thou ſhalt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length and Heighth of that Love of</hi> CHRIST <hi>which paſſeth Knowledge, that thou mayſt be filled with all the Fullneſs of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ye ſee your Calling, Brethren. We are called to be <hi>an Habitation of</hi> GOD <hi>through his Spirit: And thro' his Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us, to be Saints</hi> here, <hi>and Partakers of the Saints in Light.</hi> So <hi>exceeding great</hi> are the <hi>Promiſes which are given unto us,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually given unto us who believe. For by Faith <hi>we receieve not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of</hi> GOD, the Sum
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:042191_0009_101BA60CD390B678"/>
of all the Promiſes, <hi>that we may know the Things that are freely given to us of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirit of CHRIST is that great Gift of GOD, which at ſundry Times, and in divers Manners He hath promiſed to Man, and hath fully beſtowed ſince the Time that CHRIST was glorified. Thoſe Promiſes before made by the Father, he hath thus fulfilled; <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes</hi>

            <p n="5">5. Ye may be all living Witneſſes of theſe Things: Of Remiſſion of Sins, and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>If thou canſt believe, all Things are poſſible to him that believeth. Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you is there that feareth the</hi> LORD, and yet <hi>walketh in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hath no Light?</hi> I aſk thee in the Name of JESUS, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt thou that <hi>his Arm is not ſhortened at all?</hi> That He is ſtill <hi>mighty to ſave?</hi> That He is <hi>the ſame Yeſterday, To-day, and for ever?</hi> That He hath <hi>now</hi> Power <hi>on Earth</hi> to forgive Sins? <hi>Son, be of good Chear, thy Sins are forgiven.</hi> GOD for CHRIST'S Sake hath forgiven thee.

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Men and Brethren, let me freely ſpeak unto you: And <hi>ſuffer ye the Word of Exhortation,</hi> even from one the leaſt eſteemed in the Church. Your Conſcience beareth you Witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, that theſe Things are ſo, <hi>if ſo be ye have taſted that the</hi> LORD <hi>is gracious. This is eternal Life, to know the only true</hi> GOD, <hi>and</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>whom He hath ſent.</hi> This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledge, and this alone is true Chriſtianity. He is a Chriſtian, who hath received the Spirit of CHRIST. He is not a Chriſtian, who hath not received Him. Neither is it poſſible to have received Him, and not know it. For <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> xiv. 20.</note> 
               <hi>at that Day</hi> (when He cometh, ſaith the LORD) <hi>ye ſhall know, that I am in my Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</hi> This is <hi>that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: But ye know Him: for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The World cannot receive Him, but utterly rejecteth the Promiſe of the Father, contradicting and blaſpheming. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Spirit which confeſſeth not this, is not of GOD. Yea,

               <hi>this is that Spirit of Antichriſt, whereof ye have heard, that it ſhould come into the World, and even now it is in the World.</hi> He is Antichriſt, whoſoever denies the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, or that the indwelling Spirit of GOD is the common Privilege of all Believers, the Bleſſings of the Goſpel, the unſpeakable Gift, the univerſal Promiſe, the Criterion of a real Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It nothing helps them to ſay, <q>We do not deny the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of GOD'S Spirit; but only this <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and being <hi>ſenſible</hi> of it.

            <p n="9">9. Our own excellent Church knows nothing of this deviliſh Diſtinction: But ſpeaks plainly of <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p n="10">10. But the <hi>Wiſdom of</hi> GOD was always <hi>Fooliſhneſs with Men.</hi> No marvel then, that the great Myſtery of the Goſpel ſhould be now alſo <hi>hid from the Wiſe and Prudent,</hi> as well as in the Days of Old; that it ſhould be almoſt univerſally denied, ridiculed and exploded as mere Frenzy: And all who dare avow it ſtill, branded with the Names of Madmen and Enthuſiaſts. This is <hi>that falling away</hi> which was to come: The general Apoſtacy, of all Orders and Degrees of Men, which we even now find to have overſpread the Earth. <hi>Run to and fro in the ſtreets of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>and ſee if you can find a Man;</hi> a Man that loveth the LORD his GOD with all his Heart, and ſerveth him with all his Strength; How does our own Land mourn (that we look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) under the Overflowings of Ungodlineſs? What Villanies of every Kind are committed Day by Day? Yea, too often with Impunity, by thoſe who ſin with a high Hand, and glory in their Same? Who can reckon up the Oaths, Curſes, Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Blaſphemies, the Lying, Slandering, Evil-ſpeaking, the Sabbath-breaking, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Revenge, the

Whoredoms, Adulteries, and various Uncleanneſs, the Frauds, Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, Extortion which overſpread our Land as a Flood?</p>
            <p n="11">11. And even among thoſe who have kept themſelves pure from thoſe groſſer Abominations, how much Anger and Pride, how much Sloth and Idleneſs, how much Softneſs and Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, how much Luxury and Self-indulgence, how much Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Ambition, how much Thirſt of Praiſe, how much Love of the World, how much Fear of Man is to be found? Mean while, how little of true Religion? For where is he that loveth either GOD or his Neighbour; as He hath given us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? On the one Hand are thoſe, who have not ſo much as the Form of Godlineſs: On the other, thoſe who have the Form only: There ſtands the <hi>open,</hi> there the <hi>painted</hi> Sepulchre. So that in very Deed, whoſoever were earneſtly to behold any publick gathering togethether of the People, (I fear thoſe in our Churches, are not to be excepted) might eaſily perceive, <hi>that the one Part were Sadduces, and the other Phariſees:</hi> The one having almoſt as little Concern about Religion, as if there were no <hi>Reſurrection, neither Angel, nor Spirit:</hi> and the other making it a mere lifeleſs Form, a dull round of external Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, without either true Faith, or the Love of GOD, or Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Would to GOD I could except us of this Place, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, my Heart's Deſire, and Prayer to GOD for you is, that ye may be ſaved from this Overflowing of Ungodlineſs, and that here may its proud Waves be ſtay'd! But is it ſo indeed? GOD knoweth, yea, and our own Conſcience, it is not. We have not kept ourſelves pure. Corrupt are we alſo, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and few are there that underſtand any more, few that worſhip GOD in Spirit and in Truth. We too are <hi>a Generation that ſet not our Hearts aright, and whoſe Spirit cleaveth not ſtedfaſtly unto</hi> GOD. He hath appointed us indeed, to be <hi>the Salt of the Earth: But if the Salt hath loſt its Savour, it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt out, and to be trodden under Foot of Men.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="14">14. <hi>O God, in the midſt of Wrath remember Mercy!</hi> Be glorified in our Reformation, not in our Deſtruction!
