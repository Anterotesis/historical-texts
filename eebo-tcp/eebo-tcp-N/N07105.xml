         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW that we may more comfortably carry on theſe Family Duties, obſerve we, 1. Our Entrance into them, and 2. Our Proceedings in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Entrance, we muſt lay a good Foundation for Tractableneſs unto Religion in thoſe that belong to the Family.</p>
               <p>As, 1. In the Governour. 2. In the Governed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Governour; whoſe Duty it is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To endeavour in a ſpecial Manner for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in God's Word; and for Holineſs of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Chriſtian Walking. This would tend much to the Preſervation of his Authority; who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will be ſlighted and diſregarded, through an apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Inferiours to take Occaſion therefrom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To marry in the Lord;</hi> and then to live chaſtely in Wedlock, that there may be a holy Seed: Now that he may <hi>marry in the Lord,</hi> 1. Let Piety be the mover of his Affection; and Perſonage, Parentage, &amp; Portion, be only as a comfortable acceſſary, conſiderable in a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009051_0003_10306F68BA6BB428"/>
ſecond Place: Chriſtianity and Grace, is the chief golden Link and noble Tie, which hath the Power and Priviledge to make Marriage a lovely and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Bond. 2. Let him ply the Throne of Grace with fervency of Prayer: A good Wife is a more immediate Gift of God. Whence <hi>Solomon</hi> could ſay, <hi>Houſes and Riches are the Inheritance of Fathers; but a prudent Wife is from the Lord:</hi> Such a rare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel is to be ſued and ſought for at God's Mercy Seat, with extraordinary Importunity &amp; Zeal; and it ſhe be procured at God's Hand by Prayer, he ſhall find a thouſand Times more Sweetneſs and Comfort, then if ſhe be caſt on him by an ordinary Providence. 3. Let him obſerve and mark theſe ſix Points in his Choice: As, 1. The Report: 2. The Looks: 3. The Speech: 4. The Apparel: 5. The Companions: 6. The Education: Theſe are like the Pulſes; that ſhew the fitneſs and goodlineſs of any Party with whom he ought to marry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To beware whom he admits to dwell with him; that they be tractable unto religious Courſes. See <hi>David's</hi> Reſolution herein: <hi>Mine Eye ſhall be upon the faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way ſhall ſerve me: He that worketh Deceit ſhall not dwell within my Houſe: He that telleth Lies, ſhall not tarry in my Sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Governed; whoſe Duty it is both to join together in the Performance of <hi>Family Duties</hi> with their Governour, and to ſubmit to his Government: <hi>My Son, here the Inſtruction of thy Father, and forſake not the Law of thy Mother; for they ſhall be an Ornament of Grace unto thy Head, and Chains about thy Neck.</hi>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Of the Duties of Governours in general.</head>
               <p>IN the Proceedings of theſe <hi>Family Duties,</hi> we are to conſider the Duties, 1. Of the Governours. 2. Of the Governed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Governours; if (as it is in Marriage) there be more than one; as firſt, the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, viz. the Huſband: ſecondly, the Helper, viz. the Wife; both theſe owe Duties to their Families, and Duties to one another.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Duties they owe to their Families, are either, In general to the whole; or, in particular, according to their ſeveral Relations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which in general they owe to the whole Family, is either, to their Bodies, or to their Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To their Bodies: Concerning which, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that provideth not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.8. Now as the Spirit of God chargeth us with this Duty, ſo he ſetteth us about ſuch Things whereby this may be compaſſed; as, 1. That every one ſhould have ſome honeſt and good Calling, and walk diligently in it: <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, Eph. 4.28.) <hi>but rather let him labour, working with his Hands the Thing which is good.</hi> 2. That he bear a low Sail, and keep within Compaſs; remembring that of <hi>Solomon; He that is deſpiſed, and hath a Servant, is better than he that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth himſelf, and lacketh Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To their Souls: Concerning which, ſome <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> they are to perform to the Family; and others, to require of the Family.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Duties</hi> they muſt perform to them, are—</p>
               <p n="1">1. To provide that they may live under the publick Miniſtry; for otherwiſe how ſhould they be brought
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009051_0005_10306F6EE092C2A8"/>
into the Sheepfold of Chriſt, if they hear not the Voice of the chief Shepherd ſpeaking unto them by thoſe whom he hath ſent?</p>
               <p n="2">2. To overſee the Ways of their Families; that they ſerve God: and as in all other Duties, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſanctifying the Sabbath: To this the very Words in the fourth Commandment do bind all Maſters of Families: <hi>Remember, thou and thy Son, and thy Daughter, thy Man-Servant, and thy Maid;</hi> — Where the Lord ſpeaks by Name to the Governours, as if he would make them Overſeers of this Work of ſanctifying his Sabbaths.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſet their Houſe in order for the Service of God, to offer Prayers &amp; Praiſes to the Lord Morning and Evening. To this Purpoſe, <hi>Pray continually</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. which we muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of uninterrupted and inceſſant pouring out of Prayers, as the <hi>Muſſalians</hi> or <hi>Euchitae</hi> did; but of Morning and Evening Prayers; the Apoſtle here ſpeaking in Reference and in Analogy to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, or daily Sacrifices. This was <hi>David</hi>'s Practice, <hi>Evening and Morning, and at Noon will I pray and cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my Voice,</hi> Pſal. 55.17. And this was <hi>Job</hi>'s Practice, who ſent for, and ſanctified his Sons and Daughters; <hi>and roſe up early in the Morning, and offered Burnt-offerings according to the Number of them all:—Thus did</hi> Job <hi>continually,</hi> Job 1.5. And this was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Practice wherever he came, <hi>to build an Altar to God,</hi> where God ſhould be worſhipped jointly by turn and his Family: <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.7. &amp; 13.4. &amp; 21.33. And this was Chriſt's Practice for <hi>himſelf and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> Mat. 14.19. <hi>Joh</hi> 17.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To inſtruct their Families privately in Matters of Religion, that they may not only profeſs, but feel the Power of Religion in their Lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This <hi>Duty</hi> hath theſe Specials belonging to it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009051_0006_10306F709B5BB920"/>1. A familiar Catechizing of them in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion. Thus were Parents commanded of old; <hi>Thou ſhalt teach theſe Words diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſetteſt in thine Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the Way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> Deut. 6.7. Prov. 22.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A daily reading of the Scriptures in their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, directing them to mark and to make Uſe of them: So <hi>Timothy</hi> was trained up by his Parents, and that <hi>from his Childhood,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A careful endeavouring that they may profit by the publick Miniſtry: To this end: 1 They muſt prepare them to hear the Word, by conſidering God's Ordinances, Promiſes, and their own Neceſſities. 2. They muſt remember them to look in the Word for a Chriſt, and for Communion with him. 3. They muſt examine them after the Ordinances, what they have learned, and what Uſe they make of it: Thus Chriſt, after he had preached a Parable to his Diſciples, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Know you not this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and how then will you know all Parables?</hi> and then he expounds the Parable to them. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Duties</hi> they are to require of the Family, are both carefully to frequent the public Miniſtry, and diligenly to be converſant in the private Worſhip of God, and conſtantly to practice all holy and Chriſtian <hi>Duties</hi> compriſed briefly in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; and they are to require theſe Things, not only by telling them, calling on them, catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them, admoniſhing them; but if they be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, by correcting them.</p>
               <p>Now this Correction muſt be miniſtred both in <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and in <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Wiſdom;</hi> whoſe Property it is to find out the right Party that committed the Fault, to conſider of what Sort and Nature, the Fault is, to weigh Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Age, Diſcretion and Occaſions; and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009051_0007_10306F73C1E2BE08"/>
to look to the Mind of the Doer, whether Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or meer Simplicity brought him to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In Patience;</hi> whoſe Property it is to make the Fault manifeſt to the Offender, that his Conſcience may be touched therewith; to hear what the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can ſay in his own Defence, and accordingly to allow or diſallow; to avoid Bitterneſs, which ſooner will harden the Heart, then reform the Manners of the Offender: Theſe Rules being obſerved, and the Heart lifted up in Prayer to God for Direction and bleſſing, this <hi>Correction</hi> is neceſſary; as is evident in <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24. and 19.18.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Duties</hi> that <hi>Governours</hi> owe to their <hi>Families</hi> in reſpect of their Souls; to <hi>correct them, catechize them, admoniſh them, call on them, read to them, pray for them, &amp;c.</hi> only with theſe Limitations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they preſume not above their Callings: This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exhortation, <hi>That no Man take this Honour to himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron:</hi> The <hi>Honour</hi> here, is the <hi>Honour</hi> of the publick Miniſtry; except that, and I know not but that every Governour of a Family, who hath ſpecial Abilities, Utterance, Memory, may read Scriptures, repeat Sermons, pray, teach and inſtruct out of the the Scriptures. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his Houſhold, <hi>Put away the ſtrange Gods that are among you.</hi> Gen. 35.2. <hi>And without all Contradiction</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the leſs is bleſſed of the better,</hi> Heb. 7.7. <hi>And if the Woman would learn any Thing, let them aſk their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at Home,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.35. Thus <hi>Origen</hi> would have the Word expounded in Chriſtian Families: and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which the Preacher is in the Pulpit, the ſame is the Houſholder in the Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That they preſume not above their Gifts: This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exhortation to every Man, <hi>Not to think of himſelf more highly then he ought to think; but to think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, as God hath dealt to every Man the Meaſure of

Faith;</hi> yet I deny not but in ſome Caſes they may lawfully depute or ſubſtitute ſome one in the Family, whom they judge fitteſt unto the Service and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which they themſelves ſhould ordinarily perform: as in Caſe of old Age and weakneſs of Body: <hi>Thus Samuel being old, made his Sons Judges:</hi> Or in want of good Utterance or Expreſſion of what is to be ſaid: Thus <hi>Aaron</hi> was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Spokeſman, and in ſtead of a Mouth: or in want of Boldneſs and Audacity, ariſing from a conſciouſneſs of Weakneſs: Thus the good Centurion ſent the Elders of the Jews to Chriſt to intercede for him: or in Caſe that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel do ſojourn in ones Family, as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus</hi> did in <hi>Philemon</hi> his Houſe: or in Caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Abſence: Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> made <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> his Deputy to the Chriſtian <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> Or in Caſe the Lord hath beſtowed more of his Gifts and Graces to one than another: I know not in this Caſe, but that we may <hi>covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts in others, as well as in our own ſelves.</hi>

                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> Of the Duties of Parents to their Children.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Duties</hi> in particular which <hi>Governours</hi> owe to the <hi>Family,</hi> according to their <hi>Relations,</hi> are either</p>
               <p>As Parents to their Children: Or, as Maſters to their Servants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Parents</hi> to their Children, are either to their Bodies, or to their Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Duties</hi> of Parents to the <hi>Bodies</hi> of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are in many Particulars, but may be all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized under this one Head, <hi>A provident Care for their temporal Good;</hi> and this extendeth it ſelf to all Times, as 1. To their Infancy. 2. To their Youth. 3. To the Time of Parents Departure out of this World.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009051_0009_10306F7BA4139C68"/>1. The firſt Age of a Child is his Infancy, and the firſt Part of its Infancy, is while it remaineth in the Mother's Womb. Here the <hi>Duty</hi> lies principally upon the Mother, to have a ſpecial Care of it, that it may be ſafely brought forth. Why was the Charge of <hi>abſtaining from Wine, ſtrong Drink, and unclean Things,</hi> given to <hi>Manoah's</hi> Wife, but becauſe <hi>of the Child which ſhe had conceived?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Degree of a Child's Infancy, is while it is in the Swadling-band, and remains a ſucking Child; in this alſo the Care more eſpecially lies on the Mother, whoſe <hi>Duty</hi> it is to take all the pains ſhe poſſibly may, for the Education of her Child; and eſpecially to give her Child ſuck, if ſhe be able thereto: This not only Nature, but Scripture ſets forth;</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Conſequence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.7. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By Grant, the Word giving it as a ruled Caſe not to be denied, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.7. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Age of a Child is its Youth, from the Time it begins to be of any Diſcretion, till it be fit to be placed forth: Now the <hi>Duty</hi> of Parents at this Time is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To nouriſh. 2. To nurture their Children.</p>
               <p>Under <hi>Nouriſhment,</hi> are comprized Food, Apparel, Recreation, Means for Recovery of Health when they are ſick: In which, if Parents provide not for their Children, <hi>they are worſe than Infidels.</hi> And under <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> are comprized, good Manners, a good Calling, frequent Admonition, Reprehenſion, Correction, the laſt Remedy, which may do good when nothing elſe can. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.18. — 23.13, 14.—29.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt Time to which Parents provident Care extendeth it ſelf, is the Time of their Departure out of the World; and then they are to ſet their Houſe in Order, and to leave their Eſtates to their Children.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:009051_0010_10306F7D63188AF8"/>2. The <hi>Duty</hi> of Parents to the <hi>Souls</hi> of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren extends it ſelf alſo to all Times: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. To their Infancy. 2. To their Youth. 3. To the Time of Parents Departure out of this World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Age of a Child, is his Infancy; and the firſt Part of it's Infancy, is while it remaineth in the Mother's Womb. Now the Duty of Parents at that Time are theſe: 1. That they pray for their Children: Thus did <hi>Rebeckah,</hi> while the Children were quick in her Womb. Thoſe Parents that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this <hi>Duty</hi> to their Children, conſider not rightly that they are conceived in Sin: 2. That they make ſure (ſo much as in them lies) that their Children be born under the Promiſe, or under the Covenant, in reſpect of the ſpiritual Part of it: How? <hi>by making ſure that they be under the Promiſe or Covenant themſelves:</hi> If God in Chriſt be their God, they may have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Hope, that God will be the God of their Seed, according to the Promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed,</hi> Gen. 17.7.</p>
               <p>The next Degree of a Child's Infancy, is when it is born: and the <hi>Duty</hi> of Parents then is, to give up their Children unto God, caſting them into the Hands of his Providence, into the Arms of his Mercy, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for them a gracious Acceptation with God; and to tender them to the Ordinance, <hi>The Sacrament of Baptiſm,</hi> to get the Seal of the Covenant ſet upon them, to get them mark'd out for Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Age of a Child, is it's Youth: Now the <hi>Duty</hi> of Parents to their Children at this Time, is to train them up in true Piety: <hi>To bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi> To this end,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When Children begin to read, let them <hi>read the holy Scriptures:</hi> ſo was <hi>Timothy trained up from a Child;</hi> and thus will Children ſuck in Religion with learning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let Children be Catechized conſtantly from Day to Day; only with this Caveat, that Parents deal with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009051_0011_10306F7F21EB5D68"/>
their Children, as ſkilful Nurſes and Mothers do in feeding their Children, not to give them too much at once: over much dulls a Child's Underſtanding, and breeds Weariſomeneſs to it; it is moſt ſuitable to give them <hi>Precept upon Precept, Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line, Line upon Line, here a little, &amp; there a little,</hi> Iſai. 28.10. Thus ſhall they learn with Eaſe &amp; Delight, and in Time a great Meaſure of Knowledge will be gained thereby.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let Parents declare to their Children, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Works that God in former Times hath done for his Church, eſpecially ſuch Works as he hath done in their Time: outward ſenſible Things do beſt work upon Children, and therefore this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was given under the Law, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.6.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let Parents be to their Children a good Pattern in Piety, leading them to Chriſt by their Examples: This will take Place with Children, more than all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or parental Inſtructions: <hi>But as for me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Joſhua) and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord:</hi> Joſh. 14.13. He ſets himſelf firſt, as a Guide to the reſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let Parents reprove and correct their Children for Sin; and that the Lord may ſanctify this <hi>Correction</hi> unto them; <hi>Conſider this, O ye Parents,</hi> Do you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch and ſuch Sins in your Children? Enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your own Hearts, examine your ſelves, whether they come not from you: Conſider, how juſtly the Hand of God may be upon you: and when you are angry with your Children, have an holy Anger with your ſelves, and uſe this or the like Meditation with your own Souls, <hi>Lord, ſhall I thus puniſh my own Sin in mine own Child? Shall I thus perſecute the Corruptions of mine own Anceſtors? How then mayſt thou be diſpleaſed with me for the too carnal Conception of my own Child: It may be, I then lay in ſome Sin, or I aſked it not of thee by Prayer: Be merciful to me, O Lord; and in thy good Time, ſhew thou pity on me and my Child!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:009051_0012_10302D6540252BA0"/>6. As Children grow in Years, and in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, and of Juſtification by Chriſt, let Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents train them up in the Exerciſe of all <hi>Duties,</hi> as <hi>Prayer, Meditation, Self-Examination, Watchfulneſs, and all Means publick and private:</hi> If this be done, the World to come may reap the Benefit of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſuch Children as you bring up, ſuch Parents will they be (when you are gone) to their Children; and ſuch Children ſhall they have, who are Parents in the next Generation, &amp;c. You then are the very making or marring of the World: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if this be neglected, the rich Man will riſe up againſt you in the Day of Judgment, and condemn you; for he being in Hell, had a Care of his Father's Houſe, that they might be forewarned; he deſired <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>ſend Lazarus to his Brethren, to teſtify unto them that they came not to that Place of Torment;</hi> but you will not admoniſh your Children, you will not teach them <hi>Moſes and the Prophets;</hi> you will not ſhew them the Danger of God's heavy Diſpleaſure hanging over their Heads; you will not, whileſt you live, lead a good Example before them: O you may fear that your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be Furies of Hell to torment you. <hi>Now the Lord open your Eyes to foreſee, &amp; to fly theſe Judgments to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt Time to which the <hi>Duty</hi> of Parents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf, is the Time of their Departure out of the World; and then they owe to their Children:</p>
               <p>Good Direction. Faithful Prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Direction:</hi> When Parents obſerve their Time to draw near, it is their <hi>Duty</hi> then eſpecially, to commend ſome wiſe and wholſom Precepts unto their Children, the better to direct them in their Chriſtian Courſe; ſo did <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> The Words of a dying Parent are eſpecially regarded, and make a deeper Impreſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Prayer:</hi> then is the moſt proper Time for Parents to pray and to bleſs all their Children. As they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009051_0013_10306F87B39300C0"/>
commend their own Souls unto God's Grace: God's <hi>Providence and Promiſes are the beſt Inheritance in the World;</hi> and if Parents (in their Prayers) leave theſe to their Children, they can never want any Thing that is good. O the faithful Prayers of Parents for their Children (eſpecially when they are leaving their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and going to God) muſt needs, <hi>in, for, and through Chriſt,</hi> prevail mightily with God.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

                  <hi>SECTION V.</hi> Of the Duties of the Huſband and Wife.</head>
               <p>THE Duties which the chief Governour and his Helper owe to one another, are either</p>
               <p>Common and mutual; or proper and peculiar to each ſeverally:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The common mutual <hi>Duties</hi> betwixt Man and Wife, are either</p>
               <p>Of Neceſſity to the being of Marriage; as <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Unity;</hi> or <hi>Matrimonial Chaſtity:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of Honeſty to the well-being of Marriage; as a loving Affection of one another; Provident Care for one another. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>The former Duties preſuppoſed: there ought to be—</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſweet, loving, and tender-hearted pouring out of their Hearts, with much affectionate Dearneſs into one another's Boſoms. This mutual-melting-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, being preſerved freſh and fruitful, will infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweeten and beautify the Marriage State. Now for the Preſervation of this Love, let them conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. The compaſſionate and melting Compellations which Chriſt and his Spouſe exchange in the <hi>Canticles, My fair one, my Love, my Dove, my undefiled, my well-beloved, the chief of ten Thouſand:</hi> Such a fervent and chaſte Love as this, all married Couples ſhould reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and imitate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Command of God to this Purpoſe, <hi>Huſbands love your Wives,</hi> Eph. 5.25. and <hi>Wives</hi> (or young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) <hi>love your Huſbands,</hi> Tit. 2.4. Methinks this Charge often remembred, ſhould ever beat back all Heart-riſing and Bitterneſs, all wicked Wiſhes, that they had never met together, that they had never ſeen one another's Faces. When the Knot is tied, every Man ſhould think his Wife the fitteſt for him, and every Wife ſhould think her Huſband the fitteſt for her of any other in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009051_0015_10306F8B513935D0"/>2. A provident Care of one for another; which extends to the Body: <hi>No Man hateth his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it:</hi> and to the good Name: <hi>Joſeph</hi> was <hi>not willing to make</hi> Mary <hi>a publick Example:</hi> and to the Goods of this World; in which if there fall out any croſs Providence, they are both to join with <hi>Job's</hi> Spirit, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken &amp;c.</hi> But eſpecially to the Soul; in praying together, for, and with one another: in taking No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Beginning and leaſt Meaſure of Grace, and approving the ſame; in conferring about ſuch Things as concern the ſame, mutually propounding Queſtions, and giving Anſwers one to another; in maintaining holy and religious Exerciſes in the Family, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their own ſelves, in ſtirring up one another to hear the Word, to receive the Sacraments, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to perform all the Parts of God's publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: In caſe the one prove unconverted, let the other wait, and pray, and expect God's good Time: or in Caſe the one be a Babe in Chriſt, or weak in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, let the other deal fairly, lovingly, meekly, and let our Lord Jeſus his tender-heartedneſs to ſpiritual Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, teach us Mercy this Way, who is ſaid to <hi>gather the Lambs with his Arms, and to carry them in his Boſom, and gently to lead thoſe that are with young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The proper and peculiar Duties to each ſeverally, are—</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Huſband, whoſe <hi>Duty</hi> it is, 1. That he dearly love his Wife. 2. That he wiſely maintain and manage his Authority over her.</p>
               <p>For the former, 1. <hi>The Matter of it</hi> is a dear Love, a ſpecial Love, and a more ſpecial then that common mutual Love to one another: No queſtion the Wife is to love her Huſband, and a Brother to love his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Friend to love his Friend; but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, or with a more <hi>ſpecial Love,</hi> is the Huſband to love his Wife. To this Purpoſe ſhe is called, <hi>The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009051_0016_10306F8E0FB6ACB0"/>
Wife of his Boſom;</hi> to ſhew, that ſhe ought to be as his <hi>Heart</hi> in his Boſom. He muſt love her at all Times, he muſt love her in all Things: Love muſt ſeaſon and ſweeten his Speech, Carriage, and Actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her: Love muſt ſhew it ſelf in his Commands, Reproofs, Admonitions, Inſtructions, Authority, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with her, the Riſe of which Love muſt not be from her Beauty, Nobility, or becauſe ſhe contents and pleaſeth her Huſband; but eſpecially becauſe ſhe is his Siſter in the Profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, and an Inheritor with him of the Kingdom of Heaven: becauſe of her Graces, and Vertues, as Modeſty, Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Diligence, Patience, Temperance, Faithfulneſs, Secrecy, Obedience, &amp;c. becauſe ſhe bears and brings him forth Children, the Heirs of his Name and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the Upholder of his Family; and becauſe of the Union and Conjunction of Marriage. Love growing on Beauty, Riches, Luſt, or any other ſlight Grounds, is but a Blaze, and ſoon vaniſheth, but if grounded on theſe Conſiderations, and eſpecially on this Union of Marriage, it is laſting and true: The want hereof is the Fountain of Strife, Quarelling, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; which converts the Paradiſe of Marriage, into an Hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>manner of this Love;</hi> the Apoſtle gives it thus, <hi>Huſbands love your own Wives even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church.</hi> Now the Love of Chriſt to his Church, is commended to us in theſe Particulars: —</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>the Caſe of his Love,</hi> which is his <hi>Love: He ſet his Love on you, becauſe he loved you:</hi> his Love aroſe wholly and ſolely from himſelf, and was every Way free: ſo ſhould Huſbands love their Wives, tho' there be nothing in Wives to move them, but meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Wives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>the Order of his Love:</hi> Chriſt began it to the Church, before the Church could love him: And as a Wall is firſt ſmitten on by the Sun-beams, before it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009051_0017_10306F9359388330"/>
give a Reflection of her Heat back again: ſo the Church is firſt heated and warmed at Heart by the Senſe of Chriſt's Love, before ſhe love him again: <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt: — Becauſe of the Savour of thy Ointments, therefore do the Virgins love thee:</hi> So ſhould Huſbands begin to love their own Wives. I know ſome Wives prevent their Huſbands herein, and there may be Reaſon for it; but the greater is their Glory. This Pattern of Chriſt ſhould rather ſtir up the Huſbands to go before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In <hi>the Truth of Chriſt's Love:</hi> This was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the Fruits thereof to his Church: <hi>He gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify it. &amp; cleanſe it, &amp; preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle:</hi> So muſt Huſbands <hi>love</hi> their Wives in Truth and indeed, by guiding them in the Way of Life, and Path that is <hi>holy;</hi> for this is the trueſt Character of a ſincere Love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>the Quality of his Love:</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Love</hi> is an holy, pure, and chaſte <hi>Love;</hi> as he himſelf is, ſo is his <hi>Love;</hi> ſuch muſt be the <hi>love</hi> of Huſbands, an holy, pure, and chaſte <hi>Love.</hi> Away with all intemperate, exceſſive, or any Ways exorbitant Pollutions of the Marriage-Bed! from which, if the fear of God, imitation of Chriſt, love of Purity, awfulneſs of God's all-ſeeing Eye cannot draw, yet that flaviſh Horror, leſt God ſhould puniſh ſuch a Couple with no Children, or with miſhapen Children, or with Idiots, or with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious wicked Children, or with ſome other heavy Croſs; one would think ſhould be able to affright them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In <hi>the Continuance of Chriſt's Love? Having loved his own, he loved them to the End.</hi> His <hi>Love</hi> is a conſtant <hi>Love,</hi> an everlaſting <hi>Love.</hi> No Provocation or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions could ever make him forget his <hi>Love. Thou haſt played the Harlot with many Lovers, yet return unto me.</hi> Jer. 3.1. Such muſt be the Love of Huſbands, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009051_0018_10306F95217C9DD8"/>
                  <hi>Love,</hi> an inviolable <hi>Love:</hi> The Ground of it muſt be God's Ordinance, and the Support of it muſt be an inviolable Reſolution, that no Provocation ſhall ever change or alter it. Huſbands muſt paſs by all Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, endeavouring in Love to redreſs them, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they can; or if not, to bear with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Duty of an Huſband, is, <hi>wiſely to maintain and manage his Authority.</hi> Now the managing of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in two Things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he tenderly reſpect her.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he carefully provide for her.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He muſt <hi>tenderly reſpect her,</hi> as his Wife, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Yoke-fellow, as his very Delight; and the <hi>Deſire of his Eyes,</hi> and <hi>never be bitter againſt her.</hi> This Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs ordinarily turneth the Edge of his Authority. If therefore any Matter of Unkindneſs ariſe (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times certainly will) then muſt he carefully with all Lenity, Gentleneſs and Patience quiet all, and never ſuffer himſelf nor his Wife to ſleep in Diſpleaſure: <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath;</hi> or if he ſhall have Occaſion to reprove her, he muſt keep his Words until a convenient time, and not do it in Preſence of others; and then utter them in the Spirit of Meekneſs and Love. Surely if ſhe be not corrected by a Word of Wiſdom and Diſcretion, ſhe will never amend by Threats, or any haſty, rigorous Carriage: and if ſhe once begin to loſe her Shamefac'dneſs in the Preſence of her Huſband, it is likely there will be often Braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Quarellings betwixt them, and the Houſe will be full of Diſquietneſs: It is beſt therefore to deal wiſely with her, to admoniſh her often, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend her ſeldom, never to lay violent Hands on her; and if ſhe be dutiful, to cheriſh her, that ſhe may ſo continue; if wayward, mildly to ſuffer her, that ſhe wax not worſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt <hi>carefully provide for her:</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he is called her Head, and Saviour, as <hi>Chriſt is
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009051_0019_10306F96E15518A8"/>
the Head of his Church,</hi> and the Saviour of the Body: The <hi>Head</hi> (you know) is the Fountain of Motion, Quick'ning, Life, Senſe, and Lightſomeneſs to the body; ſo ſhould the Huſband be as the Well-ſpring of Livelineſs, Lightſomeneſs, Light heartedneſs to his Wife; ſhe hath forſook all for him, and therefore ſhe ſhould receive from him a continual Influence of chearful Walking, and comfortable enjoying of herſelf. And a <hi>Saviour</hi> (you know) both provides for, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the ſaved: Chriſt thus ſaved his Church; he is every Way a ſufficient Saviour, <hi>able perfectly to ſave, even to the very uttermoſt;</hi> he ſaves Soul and Body, he ſaves from all Manner of Miſery, from the Wrath of God, the Curſe of the Law, the Venom of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Croſſes, the Tyranny of Satan, the Sting of Death, the Power of the Grave, the Torments of Hell; or, if Sin be the greateſt Evil, (as indeed it is) <hi>he will ſave his People from their Sins;</hi> Mat. 1.21. I cannot ſay thus of the Huſband; yet an Huſband carrieth a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Chriſt, and is after a Manner a <hi>Saviour</hi> to his Wife, to protect her and to provide for her. <hi>David</hi> compares her to a <hi>Vine,</hi> intimating that as a <hi>Vine</hi> is underpropped and raiſed by ſome Tree or Frame near to which it is planted; ſo is the Wife raiſed to the Height of Honour by Vertue of her Relation to her Huſband; by his Wealth ſhe is enriched; by his Honour ſhe is dignified: he is under God and Chriſt, <hi>all in all to her.</hi> In the Family, he is a King, to govern and aid her; a Prieſt, to pray with her and for her; a Prophet, to teach and inſtruct her; a <hi>Saviour</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, and protect her to <hi>his utmoſt,</hi> if not to <hi>the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;</hi> which indeed is proper and peculiar to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Duties proper to the Wife, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:009051_0020_10306F99D841F600"/>1. <hi>Wives muſt he in ſubjection to their own Huſbands: Sarah obeyed Abraham, and called him Lord:</hi> Gen. 3.16. Eph. 5.22. 1 Pet. 3.16. But here is a Caſe of Conſcience,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. What if her Huſband be a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy to Chriſt? Muſt ſhe then yield Subjection?— Yes: becauſe in his Office her Huſband is as in Chriſt Stead: The Church is compared to <hi>a Lilly among Thorns,</hi> ſhe remains <hi>Lilly-like;</hi> white, ſoft, pleaſant, and amiable, tho' ſhe be join'd with <hi>Thorns,</hi> which are prickly and ſharp: So a Wife muſt be meek, mild, gentle, obedient, tho' ſhe be matched with a crooked, perverſe, prophane and wicked Huſband: She muſt in this Cale remove her Eyes from the Diſpoſition of her Huſband's Perſon, to the Condition of his Place; and by Vertue thereof (ſeeing he beareth Chriſt's Image) be ſubject unto him as unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if her Huſband command Things contrary to Chriſt? Muſt ſhe therein be ſubject? — No: <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, &amp;c.</hi> How? <hi>as unto the Lord:</hi> if ſhe ſubmits to Things contrary to Chriſt, ſhe ſubmits not <hi>as to the Lord.</hi> Conſciencious Wives muſt remember, they have an Huſband in Heaven, as well as on Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom there is a greater difference, than betwixt Heaven and Earth; and therefore in Caſe they bid contrary Things, they muſt prefer God before Man, Chriſt before all Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wives muſt be helpers to their Huſbands.</hi> Now this Helpfulneſs conſiſts in theſe Things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſhe be careful to preſerve his Perſon, in Sickneſs or in Health, in Adverſity, or Proſperity, in Youth or old Age.</p>
               <p>A moſt memorable and famous Pattern for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is recorded by <note n="‡" place="bottom">Lib. 2. de Chriſtiana faem. p. 360.</note> 
                  <hi>Uves: A young, tender, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Maid; was matched to a Man ſtricken in Years, whom after Marriage ſhe found to have a very diſeaſed Body, full
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009051_0021_10306F9F7035FEC8"/>
of loathful Diſeaſes: yet notwithſtanding, out of Senſe and Conſcience, that by God's Providence ſhe was become his Wife, ſhe moſt worthily digeſted all with incredible Patience: Friends and Phyſicians adviſed her by no Means to come near him; and for their Parts, they utterly forſook him; but ſhe (paſſing by with a loving Diſdain thoſe unkind Diſſwaſions) becomes to him in their Stead, Friend, Phyſician, Nurſe, Mother, Siſter, Daughter, Servant, every Thing, any Thing to do him Good any manner of way. At laſt by extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and exceſſive Charges about him, ſhe came to ſome want of ſome Neceſſaries; whereupon ſhe ſold her Rings, Chains, richeſt Attire, Plate, and choiceſt Jewels: and when he was dead, and Friends came about her, rather to congratulate her happy Riddance, than to bewail her Widowhood; ſhe not only abhorred all Speeches tending that Way, but proteſted, if it were poſſible, ſhe would willingly redeem her Huſband's Life with the loſs of her five deareſt Children.</hi> Whence it appears that this worthy Woman was wedded to her Huſband's Soul, not to his Body; ſeeing no Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or Deformity thereof, could cool or weaken the fervency of her Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſhe learn and labour to forecaſt, contrive and manage Houſhold Affairs, and <hi>Buſineſs within Doors,</hi> as they ſay: for which ſee a right noble glorious Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.</p>

That ſhe help her Huſband, in ſetting forward the rich and royal Trade of Grace, in erecting and eſtabliſhing Chriſt's glorious Kingdom in their Houſe, and eſpecially in their own Hearts.

                  <hi>SECTION VI.</hi> Of the Duties of Children to Parents.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>DUties</hi> of Children to Parents, are either inward, as <hi>Love and Fear;</hi> or outward, as <hi>Reverence, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>Recompence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The inward <hi>Duties</hi> which Children owe to their Parents, are <hi>Love and Fear: Love</hi> like Sugar, ſweetens <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> like Salt, ſeaſons <hi>Love;</hi> there muſt be a loving Fear, and a fearing Love. Hence the <hi>Fear</hi> of a Child is oppoſed to the <hi>Fear</hi> of a Slave; for a Child's <hi>Fear</hi> being mixt with <hi>Love,</hi> hath reſpect to the Offence which a Parent may take: But a Slaves <hi>Fear,</hi> which is ordinarily mixed with Hatred, hath reſpect to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Puniſhment which his Maſter may inflict upon him. This <hi>love-like Fear</hi> is ſo proper to Children, as that the awful Reſpect which the Saints bear to God, is called <hi>a filial Fear;</hi> Children have received their Subſtance, from the very Subſtance of their Parents, and therefore they are to perform this <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The outward <hi>Duties,</hi> or the Manifeſtation of this <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> in Children, appears;</p>
               <p n="1">1. In their Reverence, <hi>in Speech and Carriage:</hi> They muſt give to their Parents reverent and honourable Titles, meek and humble Speeches, Obedience, as becomes their Age and Sex: Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> bowed, the one to his Father, the other to his Mother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.12. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.19. Contrary hereto is mocking and deſpiſing Father and Mother: of which, ſaid <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, The Eye that mocketh at his Father, and deſpiſeth to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley ſhall pick it out;</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:009051_0023_10306FA295099AD8"/>
Prov. 13.17. A Phraſe that ſets forth the End of a notorious Malefactor, that is hang'd in the Air till the Ravens pick out his Eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their Obedience to their Commands, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Reproofs and Corections of their Parents, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8, 9. The Reaſon is, becauſe of God, whom the Father repreſents: Children muſt remember, that whatever they do to their Parents, they do it to God; when they pleaſe them, they pleaſe God; when their Parents are juſtly angry with them, God is angry with them: nor can they recover God's Favour (tho' all the Saints of Heaven ſhould intreat for them) till they have ſubmitted themſelves to their own Parents; only with this Limitation, that they ſubmit or obey them <hi>in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In their Recompence: This is a <hi>Duty</hi> whereby Children endeavour (as much as in them lies) to repay what they can for the Parents Kindneſs, Care and Coſt towards them, in way of Thankfulneſs: <hi>If any Widow have Children, or Nephews, let them firſt learn to ſhew Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at Home, and to requite their Parents,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.4. In Sickneſs, they muſt viſit them, in the time of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they muſt comfort them; in Want, they muſt provide for them: As the Children of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who viſited, comforted, and went to buy Food for their Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.1. &amp; 37.35. &amp; 42.3. In time of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they muſt endeavour their Protection; as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 Sam. 22.3, 4. <hi>Let my Father and Mother</hi> (ſaid he to the King of <hi>Moab) I pray thee, come forth and be with you, till I know what God will do for me: And he brought them before the King of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If God pleaſe to take Children out of this World before their Parents, and their Parents be ſuccourleſs, they muſt (as they can) provide for their well-being after their Deaths: Thus Chriſt commended his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> a little before he gave up the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009051_0024_10306FA4634E6808"/>
Ghoſt. It is recorded of the Stork, that when the Dams are old, the young Ones feed them; and when thro' Age they are ready to faint in their flying, the young Ones help them; and when they are paſt fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the young Ones carry them on their weak Backs. Thus Nature teaches Children their Duty, how much more ſhould Grace.?</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECTION VII.</hi> Of the Duties of Servants to their Maſters.</head>
               <p>DUties of Servants to their Maſters, are either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as <hi>Fear,</hi> outward, as <hi>Reverence, Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The inward <hi>Duty</hi> is <hi>Fear: Servants be ſubject to your Maſters with all Fear, and account them worthy of all Honour:</hi> So proper is this Fear to a Servant, as where it is wanting, there is a plain denial of his Maſter's Place and Power: <hi>If I be a Maſter, where is my Fear?</hi> ſaid God. Obſerve, I mean not an exceſſive ſlaviſh Fear; as when a Servant fears nothing but the revenging Power of his Maſter (ſuch was the Fear of that unprofitable Servant, who could ſay to his Maſter, <hi>I knew that thou wert an hard Man, and I was afraid</hi>) but I mean an awful Fear of Provoking his Maſter's Wrath, ſo as it makes him caſt every Way, how he may pleaſe his Maſter, and ſuch a Fear draws him on chearfully to perform his <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Outward Duties which iſſue from this Fear, are <hi>Reverence, Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reverence,</hi> which is manifeſted in Speech &amp; Carriage. Thus Servants muſt give reverend Titles to their Maſters, as <hi>Father, Lord,</hi> and <hi>Maſter, &amp;c.</hi> They muſt yield O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beiſance to them; as <hi>The Children of the Prophets, when they ſaw that the Spirit of</hi> Elijah <hi>reſted on</hi> Eliſha, <hi>they came to meet him, and bowed themſelves to the Ground before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obedience;</hi> which hath Reſpect to the Commands, Inſtructions, Reproofs &amp; Corrections of their Maſters, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20. But here's a Caſe or two of Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:009051_0025_10306FA616A21910"/>1. How far they muſt obey; or what is the extent of Servants Obedience to Maſters? — The Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>Servants obey in all Things your Maſters according to the Fleſh,</hi> Col. 3.22. It is not ſufficient that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants perform well their <hi>Duties</hi> in ſome Things; they muſt do it in <hi>all Things;</hi> yea in Things that may be againſt their own Mind and Liking, if their Maſters will have it ſo: This is clear in the Example of <hi>Joab, the King commands him to number the People: Joab</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf, that he thinks it a very unmeet Thing. <hi>Why doth my Lord the King delight</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this Thing?</hi> 2 Sam. 24.2, &amp;c. Yet againſt his Judgment he yields unto the King's peremptory Command, <hi>The King's Word prevailed againſt Joab.</hi> Look as <hi>Peter,</hi> when Chriſt bid him launch out into the Deep, and let down his Net for a Draught, <hi>He anſwered and ſaid, Maſter, We have toiled all the Night, and have taken nothing: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at thy Word, I will let down the Net.</hi> So muſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſay, when they have a peremptory Command, tho' contrary to their own Judgments, this or that in all Humility, I ſuppoſe, or I propound to you; <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, at your Word I will let down the Net;</hi> I will do as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what if God and Maſter ſhould command contrary Things? In ſuch a Caſe the Apoſtle ſets down an excellent Limitation in theſe four Phraſes, [1. <hi>As unto Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>As the Servants of Chriſt.</hi> 3. <hi>Doing the Will of God.</hi> 4. <hi>As to the Lord.</hi>] All theſe imply, That if Maſters command their Servants any Thing contrary to Chriſt, they may not yield to it: Upon this Ground the Midwives of the Hebrew Women, would not kill the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Children, <hi>They feared God</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and did not as the King commanded them,</hi> Exod. 1.17. In this Caſe, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is commended, in not hearkening to his Miſtreſs; and the Servants of <hi>Saul</hi> are commended, for refuſing to ſlay the Lord's Prieſts, at their Maſters Command. When Maſters Command or
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009051_0026_10307528FA278708"/>
forbid any Thing againſt God &amp; Chriſt, they go therein beyond their Commiſſion, and their Authority ceaſeth; ſo that Servants may ſay, <hi>We ought to obey God rather than Men,</hi> Act. 5.29.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Objct.</hi> But ſome may object, <hi>That all Men are alike, and that there is no Difference as betwixt Maſters and Servants; nay, it is expreſly forbidden to be Servants of Men.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, To <hi>be a Servant,</hi> in that Place, is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be in Subjection under another, but to be ſo obſequious to Man, as to prefer him before <hi>God:</hi> Hence the Apoſtle elſewhere in the <hi>Duties</hi> of Servants, lays down this Antitheſis, <hi>Not as Men-pleaſers, but as the Servants of Chriſt;</hi> again, <hi>doing Service as to the Lord, and not to Men:</hi> The meaning is, That we muſt do <hi>Duty</hi> to a <hi>Maſter,</hi> not as meerly to a <hi>Man,</hi> but as to one <hi>in Chriſt's Stead.</hi> Maſters, by vertue of their Office and Place, bear the Image of Chriſt; Chriſt communicates his Authority unto them, and ſo in performing <hi>Duty</hi> to Maſters, we perform <hi>Duty</hi> to Chriſt, and in denying <hi>Duty</hi> to Maſters, we deny <hi>Duty</hi> to Chriſt: Thus the Lord ſaid to <hi>Samuel,</hi> when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rejected his Government, <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them.</hi> Conſider this, all ye that are <hi>Servants,</hi> though <hi>Maſters</hi> ſhould neither reward your good Service, nor revenge your ill Service, yet Chriſt will do both: This is your Prerogative that fear God, above all other Servants; others may ſerve their Maſters with <hi>Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> in Singleneſs of Heart, and with good Will, but only Chriſtians and Saints do <hi>Service as to Chriſt;</hi> and this makes them not content themſelves with doing the Thing, but to endeavour to do it after the beſt Manner they can, ſo as God and Chriſt may accept of it.</p>
