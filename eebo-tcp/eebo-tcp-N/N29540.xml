            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot but think the extraordinary kind Reception I have had among you, is a ſure preſage of a perfect good Agreement, and Correſpondence between you and me; to which no Care of mine or Study ſhall be wanting. And that I may acquit my ſelf towards you as I ought, I ſhall as well as my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will permit me, Copy after the Example of Our Great Maſter the King, who through the whole Courſe of His Adminiſtration, has ſhew<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a tenderneſs of His people not to be equall'd, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular moderation even towards His moſt Inveterate Enemies; the firſt an effect of His Goodneſs, the latter of His Magnanimity and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: which admirable qualities have gain'd Him the juſt Veneration of all mankind; and ought to poſſeſs our hearts that are here with the same Loyalty, Affection and Duty towards His Sacred Perſon, that our Fellow Subjects in <hi>England</hi> have manifeſted ever ſince His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties moſt Happy Acceſſion to the Throne.</p>
            <p>I cannot more truly Imitate the King in a Fatherly Care and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of you, than by looking into the publick Adminiſtration of Juſtice, to ſee that it be done quickly and impartially. And for moderation, which I take to be in a peculiar manner the Kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute; I come among you with a Settled Reſolution not to diſturb any of you in the Exerciſe of your Conſciences, or in the free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of your Liberties and Eſtates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:039343_0002_10141E4CD6BB2720"/>In a word, I will do you all the good I poſſibly can in my Station; and that in Duty to God, to the King, and to my own Conſcience and Honour.</p>
            <p>I Underſtand the Courts of Juſtice are fallen, I therefore Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your Reviving them by Act of Aſſembly, ſuch an one I mean, as you can be ſure will meet with His Majeſties Approbation when 'tis <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> before Him.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be glad you would think of ways to Ingage the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Indians in a Trade with you, which I am apt to believe may be managed with that advantage to them, by a good regulation and underſelling the <hi>French,</hi> that their friendſhip and fidelity may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to the Crown, and then they will be no longer Thorns in your ſides.</p>
            <p>The Country I am told is deſtitute of Stores of War, which is ſo neceſſary a proviſion, that I cannot think I need do more than put you in mind of it.</p>
            <p>The Fortifications on the Iſland at the mouth of your Harbour, ought in my mind to be looked into, I intend to viſit them in a few days with <hi>His Majeſties Engineer,</hi> and will afterwards report to you, whether the preſent Works be ſufficient, or new ones requiſite.</p>
            <p>I would very gladly promote a Charter of Incorporation for your Colledge at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and will heartily joyn with you in addreſſing His Majeſty for His Royal Grant of ſuch Priviledges and Franchiſes as His Majeſty in His Goodneſs ſhall Think fit. 'Tis a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage you have above the other Provinces, that your Youth are not put to Travel far for Learning, but have the Muſes at their doors. Beſides that Colledge will always be a Nurſery to afford you a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Able Miniſters for the Cure of Souls. Therefore 'twere pitty the Kings Royal Charter ſhould not be ſollicited out of hand.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives;</p>
            <p>AS it is your undoubted right, that the Granting or Continuing a Revenue ſhould have its firſt riſe with you: I therefore apply to you, that Care may be taken for the neceſſary ſupport of the Government, in ſuch a manner as will beſt ſuit with the eaſe and circumſtances of the People. The Revenue of Exciſe I underſtand will Expire the Twenty Ninth of this Month, and you will do well to conſider, whether it will not be proper to revive it. Mr. Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer has ſhew'd me an Abſtract of the publick Accounts, by which I perceive the Government is out of Debt, which is a happy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance for you, and as ſuch, is very pleaſing to me, for I ſhall always delight in your happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:039343_0003_10141E4FB1874A70"/>Some <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> I am Commanded from <hi>England</hi> to offer you for your paſſing; which are of a publick nature, and will be for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and ſuch other Laws as you ſtand in need of, for promoting your Trade, and the general Intereſt of the Province, I will Joyn with you in; provided they be made to ſquare with the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould be wanting to you and my ſelf too, if I did not put you in mind of the indiſpenſable duty and reſpect we owe the King, for being the Glorious Inſtrument of our Deliverance from the odious Fetters and Chains of Popery and Tyranny which had almoſt overwhelm'd our Conſciences, and Subverted all our Civil Rights. There is ſomething that's God-like in what the King has done for us. The work of Redemption and Preſervation comes next to that of Creation. I would not be miſunderſtood ſo as to be thought to Rob God of the Glory of that Stupendous Act of His Providence, in bringing to paſs the late happy and wonderful Revolution in <hi>England.</hi> His Bleſſed Work it was without doubt, and He was pleas'd to make King <hi>William</hi> mediately the Author and Inſtrument of it. Ever ſince the Year 1602. <hi>England</hi> has had a Succeſſion of Kings that have been Aliens; in this reſpect I mean, That they have not fought our Battles, nor been in our Intereſts, but have been in an unnatural manner plotting and contriving to undermine and ſubvert our Religion, Laws and Liberties, till God was pleaſed by His Almighty Power, and Infinite Mercy and Goodneſs to give us a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> King in the Perſon of His Preſent Majeſty, who has upon all occaſions hazzarded His Royal Perſon in the Front of our Battles, and where there was moſt danger. He has reſtor'd to our Nation the almoſt loſt Character of Bravery and Valour; and what is moſt valuable of all, His Majeſty is entirely in the Intereſts of His people 'Tis therefore our Duty and Intereſt to Pray to God in a moſt fervent manner, That He would Bleſs our Great KING <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> with a long and proſperous Reign over us, to which I am perſwaded, you that are here preſent, and all Good Men will heartily ſay. <hi>Amen.</hi>
