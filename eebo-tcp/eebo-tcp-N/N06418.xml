         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>MAY it be remembered that when <hi>Moſes,</hi> that eminent and faithful Servant of the Lord, even the Mediator of the firſt Covenant, having been, by divine Commiſſion and Aſſiſtance, ſignally and ſucceſsfully inſtrumental in delivering poor ſighing and groaning <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, and was now bringing them on their Way towards the Land of Promiſe, flowing with Milk and Honey, being right ſenſible how liable People are (if not truly watchful) who have been very humble while in Adverſity and Affliction, to become careleſs and forgetful of the Lord and his Succour in their foregoing Trials, when Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity ſmiles upon them, gave them the following timely Precautions and ſeaſonable Charges, worthy of their and our due Obſervation and Notice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Hear,</hi> O Iſrael, <hi>the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might. And theſe Words which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee this Day ſhall be in thine Heart.
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:008146_0003_102E3BA88DA49590"/>
And thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in thine Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the Way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up. And thou ſhalt bind them for a Sign upon thine Hand, and they ſhall be as Frontlets between thine Eyes. And thou ſhalt write them upon the Poſts of thy Houſe, and on thy Gates. And it ſhall be when the Lord thy God ſhall have brought thee into the Land which he ſware unto thy Fathers, to</hi> Abraham, <hi>to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob, <hi>to give thee great and goodly Cities which thou buildedſt not, and Houſes full of all good Things which thou filledſt not, and Wells digged which thou dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedſt not, Vineyards and Olive-Trees which thou plantedſt not; when thou ſhalt have eaten and be full, then beware leſt thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from the Houſe of Bondage.</hi> Deut. <hi>vi. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas; though <hi>Iſrael,</hi> during the Life of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and of the Elders that overlived <hi>Joſhua,</hi> were preſerved in ſome good Degree within the Bounds of good Order and Moderation, yet too many of the ſucceeding Generation took undue Liberties, and <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> waxed fat, and kicked. Have not we juſt Cauſe to fear, that this is too much the Caſe with many of the Profeſſors of the bleſſed Truth in theſe Days, wherein ſo great a Calm and Quiet, I ſay, in ſo gracious a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as is now mercifully enjoyed by us?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:008146_0004_102E3BAA2A0B0408"/>We have now a large ſucceeding Generation coming up in our Society, but too few of them growing up in the real Work of Regeneration, and Obedience to the holy Spirit, their profeſſed Principle, whence divers undue Liberties in <hi>Speech, Habit,</hi> and <hi>Deportment,</hi> quite inconſiſtent with our ſaid Principle, are run into. Some are ſeemingly ſoaring aloft as into the <hi>Air,</hi> as though they were above the Reproofs and Teachings of the meek Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of humble <hi>Jeſus;</hi> others are grovelling as in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and they are hiding their Talents, tho' perhaps wrapped up in a Napkin of ſeeming or moral Righteouſneſs: Others ſeem neither to be on the Wing in the <hi>airy Regions,</hi> nor yet choaked with gaping and graſping after the <hi>Earth,</hi> but wrapped up, and, as it were, lulled in that careleſs State of Indolence and baſe Neutrality, ſomewhat like the Inhabitants of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> and the ſecure <hi>Zido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as if they were not accountable Creatures for any Stewardſhips, either in Temporals or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals: Others, again, are in the other Extream, purſuing the World as if it were their <hi>ſummum Bonum,</hi> or chiefeſt Good, launching out into Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Buſineſs, as a Horſe into the Battle; mean while neglecting their reſpective ſpiritual Talents, and conſequently the greateſt and far moſt important Buſineſs of their Day and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and for want of minding the Directions of the great <hi>PILOT,</hi> even the Spirit of Truth they profeſs, they are often driven into, and (as I may ſay) miſerably ſhipwrecked upon, that ſcandalous Rock of <hi>Inſolvency;</hi> and although ſome of our great, buſtling, extenſive Tradeſmen may not,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:008146_0005_102E3BADBAB59250"/>
perhaps, as to their outward Affairs, miſcarry, yes, alas! they are often ſo much involved and taken up with the Hurries, Projects and Cares about Things of this Life, that they prove lamentably deficient in thoſe moſt material and weighty Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, viz. <hi>In working out their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, and in glorifying God in their reſpective Services in the Church, and in their own Families.</hi> Notwithſtanding theſe laſt Obſervations, there are, I hope, ſome, though too few, extenſive Tradeſmen, who are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that their Hearts may have Room in them for the <hi>pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father,</hi> and that the Temple may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitably crowded with <hi>Money-Changers</hi> and their <hi>Tables;</hi> but that their Hearts (though ſometimes neceſſarily buſy in Commerce) may be preſerved really a <hi>Houſe of Prayer.</hi> Theſe religious Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are truly worthy of double Honour, remarkable for their prudent and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Conduct and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, not ſuffering <hi>Mammon</hi> to be their Maſter, but keeping him in his Place, at a proper Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as their Servant; ſo they are in a Capacity to ſerve God, their Lord and Maſter, and chiefeſt Sovereign, and alſo his Church and People in their reſpective Places. This Kind of honourable Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being above all other Things concerned to improve their Talents of Grace, dare not eaſily omit attending their religious Meetings, either on the Firſt-days, or other Days of the Week; yea, ſome have even <hi>ſhut up their Shops</hi> during the Meeting-time on the Week-days, leſt their Shops <hi>ſhould have ſhut them up,</hi> and debarred them
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:008146_0006_102E3BB0A34E6420"/>
from the Enjoyment of Chriſt's Company with the two or three met in his Name: May not we account theſe like faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſaid to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, upon a weighty Occaſion, <hi>Abide ye here, and I and the Lad will go yonder and worſhip, and come again to you.</hi> When this Sort of highly valuable Tradeſmen are occaſionally called Abroad, and are riding their Circuits among their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they endeavour, I believe, to get to as many Meetings, even on the Week-days, as they well can: Theſe have good Ground to hope for and expect the Bleſſing of kind Providence to attend their honeſt Endeavours.</p>
            <p>We have alſo Ground to fear, that too many under our Name keep and frequent <hi>unſuitable Company,</hi> taking more Pleaſure in the Society of <hi>Wine-bibbers,</hi> at the Tavern or Alehouſe, than with the two or three at the Meeting, waiting for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of bleſſed <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, another afflicting ſorrowful Diſorder, and, I fear, a growing Evil, in theſe Times of Liberty and Eaſe from Perſecution, is <hi>Mixt-Marriages,</hi> which generally uſher confuſion, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Perplexity into Families and the Society, much grieving, and almoſt (if not quite) breaking the Hearts of good Parents, ſo that many anxious Fathers and Mothers, obſerving with Sorrow the wide Courſes which many are taking, do, in Effect, frequently revolve in their penſive Hearts that mournful Query of ſolicitous <hi>Rebekah</hi> of old, —
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:008146_0007_102E3BB2358DDE90"/>
               <hi>If my Child or Children do as ſuch and ſuch have done, what good ſhall my Life do me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, 'tis much to be feared there are ſome (I wiſh I had Ground to ſay there are none) guilty of that abſolute and abſurd Contradiction of profeſſing the peaceable Spirit of meek <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and the Prince of Peace, and at the ſame time are <hi>litigious</hi> and <hi>contentious Perſons,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to delight in <hi>Strife,</hi> and ſtriving for <hi>Maſtery,</hi> either in the Church, or among Neighbours, or, it may be, ſometimes both. — The Eyes of the People have long been, and ſtill are, upon us, and conſidering the Extent of our high Profeſſion, have, and do make, their Remarks upon us, and can quickly obſerve when our Conduct is conſiſtent with our profeſſed Principles, and when repugnant thereto, either in <hi>Habit, Speech</hi> or <hi>Deportment.</hi> Have not ſome been ready to make the following Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Such an one is an <hi>honeſt primitive Quaker,</hi> his or her Dreſs, Addreſs, and whole Conduct, agree to what he or ſhe profeſſeth. But ſuch and ſuch are <hi>modern, faſhionable Quakers,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet it is plain they live after the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> ſo they are but <hi>Nominal Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now inaſmuch as the Continuance of the above mentioned Errors (and all others) are owing to, and cauſed by, Mens ſlighting and diſregarding the ſpiritual Appearance and refining Work of Chriſt in their Hearts, who is now come in Spirit to put an End to Sin, and to finiſh Tranſgreſſion, to make Reconciliation, to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs;
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:008146_0008_102E3BB4C59DAAF8"/>
and inaſmuch as he hath promiſed his bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to thoſe who, though very few in Number, meet in his Name, I have in much good Will wrote the following Lines for the Encouragement of the Faithful and Diligent, and for the rouſing, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Remiſs and Negligent, to that highly neceſſary and profitable Duty of rightly attending religious Meetings, where he hath promiſed to <hi>be in the Midſt of ſuch Meeters:</hi> So that Mens <hi>neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> being the Cauſe of theſe their continued Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders (as Chriſt ſaid, — <hi>While Men ſlept, an Enemy did Miſchief in the Field</hi>) this being diſcontinued, and a vigilant Diligence being uſed in the Room thereof, that evil Cauſe being thus taken away, the evil Effects thereof might conſequently ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But in caſe, after theſe my honeſt Endeavours and Labours of Love, I ſhould be blamed for making the following Remarks, or producing particular Inſtances of the bad Effects commonly attending the forſaking of religious Meetings, as though I expoſed the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſubſiſting in our Society; I aſſure thee, <hi>friendly Reader,</hi> I am far from upbraiding any of my Friends with their Failures, but in good Will to the Cauſe, and the Souls of all, I found myſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to write ſomething on theſe <hi>Neglects</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,</hi> and the pernicious Conſequences thereof, which long before I penned theſe Lines, were too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, being plainly expoſed by the very Perſons themſelves, found in the Errors ſpoken of here, and in the ſubſequent Lines; ſo that the Remarks made, and the Inſtances produced of the Deficiencies

            <p>IN the univerſal Love of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, which ever breathes out <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, on Earth Peace and good Will towards Men,</hi> I cordially ſalute you, and therein take Freedom humbly to offer the following Obſervations to your ſolid Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, with much Comfort, I firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope we have a large Number in our Society, in a good Degree, faithful to the Principle of Truth we profeſs, giving Diligence <hi>to make their Calling and Election ſure,</hi> walking <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly and honeſtly as in the Day,</hi> both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their moral and religious Converſation, though not without their reſpective Exerciſes on divers Accounts, not daring to forſake the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi>

of themſelves together whilſt capable; for the Encouragement of all ſuch beloved Brethren and Siſters, whereſoever their Lots are caſt (to whom my Heart is nearly knit in the Unity of the Spirit, and the Bond of Peace) it ſprings up in my Mind to remind them of the Apoſtle's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Advice, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 9. <hi>Let us not be weary in Well-doing, for in due Seaſon we ſhall reap if we faint not.</hi> James v. 7.8. <hi>Be patient therefore, Brethren, unto the Coming of the Lord. Behold the Huſbandman waiteth for the precious Fruit of the Earth, and hath long Patience for it, until he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the early and latter Rain. Be ye alſo patient; ſtabliſh your Hearts; for the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 13. <hi>Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Mind; be ſober, and hope to the End for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revelation of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 13.14. <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith, quit you like Men; be ſtrong.

            <p>Yet nevertheleſs, for the Sake of ſome, yea, alas! (with Regret be it ſpoken) many of the Profeſſors of the bleſſed Truth, who through Coldneſs, Lukewarmneſs, Inconſiderateneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, and the Want of a true Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs (occaſioned by their <hi>neglecting</hi> the Work and Guidance of the Spirit of Truth they profeſs) are become very remiſs and negligent in this highly and neceſſary and reaſonable Duty of <hi>attending</hi> religious Meetings on Week-days, as well as Firſt-days, I find it to riſe in my Heart, in much Good-will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008146_0012_102E3BBCE6CB32B8"/>
recommend the following Obſervations to their ſerious Notice and Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Inſomuch as Almighty God, our faithful and righteous Creator, hath placed us in a Station abſolutely dependent on him, <hi>in whom we live, and move, and have our Being,</hi> in whoſe Hand and Diſpoſal we, our Lives, Health, Abilities both of Body and Mind, our Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Protection, Support, Favours, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Enjoyments, both Temporal and Spiritual, are, we being, as it were, Tenants at Will, having no known Leaſe of our Time, or Command of any Thing, we are under moſt reaſonable and cloſe Obligations to behave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as wholly dependent Creatures, humbly and honeſtly to pay due Homage and Obedience to him our gracious and bountiful Sovereign, Lord and Benefactor, for all his unmerited Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours we enjoy under him, in faithfully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Requirings, in <hi>doing juſtly, loving Mercy,</hi> and <hi>walking humbly with him;</hi> which three Articles briefly contain all our moral and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties, which none rightly perform who are negligent in attending Meetings for divine Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> May it be remembered, that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Diſpenſations the Lord God required of his People, and commanded them ſtrictly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve divers Convocations, and Feaſt-days; as the Feaſt of <hi>Paſſover;</hi> ſolemn Feaſts and Faſts, as the Feaſt of the <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> of <hi>unleavened Bread,</hi> of <hi>Weeks,</hi> of <hi>Solemn-days</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies;</hi> in the ſincere and devout Obſervation whereof the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008146_0013_102E3BC12629FD30"/>
People of God were accepted of him; <hi>Joel</hi> ii. 15.16. <hi>Blow the Trumpet in</hi> Zion (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>ſanctify a Faſt, call a ſolemn Aſſembly. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the People; ſanctify the Congregation; aſſemble the Elders; gather the Children, and thoſe that ſuck the Breaſts: Let the Bridegroom go forth of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet.</hi> Zech. viii. 19. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the Faſt of the fourth Month, and the Faſt of the Fifth, and the Faſt of the Seventh, and the Faſt of the Tenth, ſhall be to the Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>Joy and Gladneſs, and chearful Feaſts; therefore love the Truth and Peace.</hi> But the Neglect and Slighting thereof diſpleaſed God, and turned much to their own Diſadvantage, as being the ſorrowful Effect of their <hi>Declenſion, Captivity</hi> and <hi>Servitude,</hi> through their Diſobedience to the Lord. <hi>Judah,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>is gone into Captivity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Ways of</hi> Zion <hi>do mourn, becauſe none come to the ſolemn Feaſts: All her Gates are deſolate, her Prieſts ſigh, her Virgins are afflicted, and ſhe is in Bitterneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> 'Tis worthy our ſerious Notice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how acceptable and pleaſing to the Lord the Meetings, Communications, and the very Thoughts of thoſe that ſcared him, and what peculiar Regard and tender Reſpect he had, what precious Promiſes he made unto them in thoſe depraved Times, wherein Irreligion ſo much prevailed, that the <hi>Proud</hi> were called <hi>happy;</hi> yea, they that wrought Wickedneſs were <hi>ſet up;</hi> yea, they that tempted God were even <hi>delivered:</hi> Mal. iii. 16.17. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Malachi) they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:008146_0014_102E3BC405954E58"/>
(whence we may conclude they were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) <hi>and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a Book of Remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name. And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that Day when I make up my Jewels; and I will ſpare them as a Man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him.</hi> The <hi>Paſſover</hi> was ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoined, that it was commanded on this wiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Numb. ix. 13.14. <hi>The Man that is clean, and is not in a Journey, and forbeareth to keep the</hi> Paſſover, <hi>even the ſame Soul ſhall be cut off from his People; becauſe he brought not the Offering of the Lord in his appointed Seaſon: That Man ſhall bear his Sin. And if a Stranger ſhall ſojourn among you, and will keep the</hi> Paſſover <hi>unto the Lord, according to the Ordinance of the</hi> Paſſover, <hi>and according to the Manner thereof, ſo he ſhall do: Ye ſhall have one Ordinance, both for the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and for him that was born in the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſuch was, and now is, the Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, that he neither ever did, nor now doth, require any Thing unreaſonable or imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, for he condeſcended to allow a <hi>ſecond Paſſover</hi> to ſuch as were neceſſarily deprived of appearing at the Firſt, by Reaſon of Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through Uncleanneſs, or Abſence in a Journey afar off.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Let us now come to the glorious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel that we live in, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt, the Author thereof, our glorious High-prieſt and bleſſed Mediator, himſelf ſpeaks unto the Churches, who is the compleat Antitype,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008146_0015_102E3BC590AB41F8"/>
in whom all the Types, Shadows and Figures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center; and let it be with ſolemn Reverence, and all due Regard, humbly obſerved, that he hath graciouſly promiſed on this wiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the Midſt of them.</hi> Rom. xii. 1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, Brethren, by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, that ye preſent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable Service.</hi> Heb. x. 25. <hi>Not forſaking the Aſſembling of ourſelves together, as the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome is; but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more, as ye ſee the Day approaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>dear Friends,</hi> have we not ſome Ground to fear, that ſo many as under the Profeſſion of the bleſſed Truth, who do, whilſt in Health and Strength, ſadly neglect the Attending of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meetings, ſo much encouraged by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe above, are not truly obedient, but neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Mercies, by ſo ſlighting our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious High-prieſt, and his bleſſed Company, with his two or three gathered in his Name. Oh! that all the Profeſſors of Truth were rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned duly to regard the ſaid gracious Promiſe, with the full Extent and Conditions thereof; and alſo to reduce to Practice the Advice of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 7.8. <hi>Purge out therefore the old Leaven, that ye may be a new Lump; as ye are unleavened. For even Chriſt our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover is ſacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the Feaſt, not with old Leaven, neither with the Leaven of Malice and Wickedneſs, but with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008146_0016_102E3BC8152B47F0"/>May it therefore, I ſay, be humbly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, how this our gracious High Prieſt hath not only promiſed his Attendance, and moſt worthy Company, where two or three are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Name (as above) but has alſo merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and tenderly invited needy Souls unto him, on this wiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 28.29.30. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye ſhall find Reſt unto your Souls: For my Yoke is eaſy, and my Burden is light.</hi> And again, his Call is repeated. <hi>John</hi> vii. 37.38.39. <hi>In the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood, and cried, ſaying. If any Man thirſt, let him come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living Water. But this ſpake he of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> May it be added to the Premiſes, how that ſoon after the breaking forth of the bleſſed Truth, after the long and dark Night of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, our ancient Friends in the Morning of the Day, finding a conſcientious Concern upon them to decline the Formalities then run into, retired and met together to wait upon the Lord, to know and witneſs the fulfilling of that bleſſed Promiſe of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 26. <hi>But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, He ſhall teach you all Things, and bring all Things to your Remembrance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi>—As they were (we have good Ground certainly to believe) led into
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008146_0017_102E3BCB9B99CFA8"/>
this Practice, and by the ſame alſo mercifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and protected therein, through many and great Sufferings, occaſioned by the penal Laws then in Force againſt thoſe that diſſented from the national Church, eſtabliſhed by Law; ſo that our dear Fore-fathers and ancient faithful Friends, conſcientiouſly then attended religious Meetings, both on Firſt-days and other Days of the Week, under the Hazard of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates; yea, I ſay, they flocked to Meetings as Doves to the Windows, though ſometimes a good many Miles diſtant, and found great Peace in ſo doing, and the enriching Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God to attend them, and often their Offspring too: So in Time, as they increaſed, by the Direction and ſweet Influence of the bleſſed Spirit, they were engaged to appoint and ſettle Mettings here and there, as in the Wiſdom of Truth they ſaw convenient, both on Firſt-days and other Days of the Weeek; and when they were hauled from their Meetings to Priſons, they had often precious Meetings there, and found thoſe Places, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Bethel,</hi> on his Pillow of Stone, to be to them as the <hi>Houſe of God, and Gate of Heaven,</hi> being made to ſing in the Priſon as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did when their Legs were in the Stocks, by the then ſecular Powers.</p>
            <p>Now, therefore, I beſeech all that profeſs the ever bleſſed Truth, and eſpecially thoſe that are remiſs in this important and ſo material a Duty now before us, duly to remember, and truly conſider, how wonderfully the Lord hath
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008146_0018_102E3BCD2C27E0F8"/>
wrought for his Church and People, how he hath turned the Hearts of Kings, and, in Effect, hath ſaid to them,—<hi>Touch not mine Anointed, do my Prophets no Harm.</hi> What peaceable calm Times have we long enjoyed, with reſpect to thoſe violent Storms and rugged Billows of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution aforeſaid! Are not we now both tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and protected in keeping our religious Meetings! What then will become of thoſe poor Profeſſors of the unchangeable Truth, who, in this Time of Tranquility, and, as I may ſay, Sabbath-day of Reſt from the aforementioned Probations, are taking their Flight from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Work and Baptiſm of the holy Spirit they are making a Profeſſion of, into the inordinate Cares or Pleaſures of this World, or into Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Indifferency and Lukewarmneſs, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vital Part of Religion, ſo as miſerably to forſake (or at leaſt too much neglect) the aſſembling of themſelves together, in order to worſhip and pay due Homage to the bountiful Author of all our unmerited Mercies, temporal and ſpiritual!</p>
            <p>Inſomuch, therefore, as the divine Miniſter of the Sanctuary and true Tabernacle, which God hath pitched, and not Man, hath ſo reaſonably afforded us ſuch great Encouragement to attend religious Meetings, though conſiſting of very few in Number, and hath ſhewn ſo undeniably and indiſputably his peculiar Approbation thereof, by that gracious and ſpecial Promiſe of his vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing to be preſent with the two or three that ſo meet: The ſame Duty being alſo urged, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008146_0019_102E3BD2642E4888"/>
earneſtly recommended by the Apoſtle to the Believers of his Day, that they ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the <hi>Aſſembling</hi> of themſelves together, as the Manner of ſome in thoſe Times was, and, alas! of too many in theſe Days, though ſo highly favoured: <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 24, 25. <hi>And let us conſider,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>one another, to provoke unto Love, and to good Works: Not forſaking the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of ourſelves together, as the Manner of ſome is, but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more, as ye ſee the Day approaching.</hi>—And likewiſe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering how the ſame Apoſtle fervently and pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically addreſſed the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, exciting them to pious and devout Performance of this their reaſonable Service, reminding them of the ſignal <hi>Mercies of God,</hi> as a preſſing and cogent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, moving grateful and truly conſiderate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the faithful Performance of their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Duties to their merciful Benefactor, and the glorious Donor of all their Enjoyments, expreſſed his Addreſs on this wiſe,—<hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1. <hi>I beſeech you, therefore,</hi> (as above hinted) <hi>Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that ye preſent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable Service.</hi> May we not ſafely conclude, that the right attending of Aſſemblies for divine Worſhip, is both a Duty acceptable unto God, and ſignally advantageous unto our Souls; and that, as this is an indiſpenſable Duty (whilſt we are in Health and Strength, and at Liberty) therefore the Omiſſion of this weighty Service is of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequence.—<hi>Ezra</hi> ix. 4. <hi>Then were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled unto me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ezra,</hi> that deeply concerned
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008146_0020_102E3BD5E02998C8"/>
Servant of the Lord) <hi>every one that trembled at the Words of the God of</hi> Iſrael. The true hearted <hi>Quakers</hi> then did, and now do (whilſt Strength and Liberty do permit) aſſemble, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Help and Relief from the Lord, to worſhip him in Spirit and Truth, to enjoy the ſweet and edifying Communion one with another, as Members of one Body, by feeling the one quickening Spirit from the holy Head, the living Circulation of the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now, my Friends, may I take Freedom to make the following Remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> It hath been objected by ſome on this wiſe, <hi>That as the Sabbath was but one Day in the Week commanded and ſet apart for divine Service, in the Time of the</hi> Moſaick <hi>Law, what need ſo much ado about Week-days Meetings now?</hi> To which very weak and poor Objection, I ſhall in the firſt Place anſwer thus: Suppoſe there had been in that Diſpenſation no other Day but the Seventh in each Week, appointed by the Lord, wherein his People ſhould ceaſe from ſervile Work, and devoutly and ſolemnly perform Worſhip to him; yet in this Goſpel Diſpenſation we are, or ought to be, brought much nearer to God, and be much more devout and ſpiritually minded, according to the Apoſtle's Teſtimony, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 19. <hi>For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better Hope did, by the which we draw nigh unto God.</hi> Beſides, the Solemnitie and holy Convocations, above mentioned, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refute the aforeſaid very weak Plea and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which Solemnities were to be obſerved
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008146_0021_102E3BDA817E4360"/>
by the Lord's People in that Diſpenſation; the Neglectors whereof were to be taken Notice of, and called to an Account. What Apology then, I ſay, ſhall thoſe make, or how ſhall they anſwer it, who are remiſs and negligent in obſerving and attending the ſolemn Meetings and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in this glorious Goſpel Day?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Some may perhaps object, and ſeem to endeavour to excuſe themſelves in this Kind of Negligence, and Omiſſion of ſo neceſſary and profitable a Duty, as we are, in much good Will to the Cauſe of Truth, and the Souls of its Profeſſors, treating of, by alledging, <hi>That their Meeting is ſo ſmall, or, that they have no publick Miniſter ſettled therein, they may perhaps ſcarce think it worth their while conſtantly to attend the ſame. Anſw.</hi> Are not there two or three? If ſo many, Chriſt hath promiſed them his bleſſed Company, if met in a right Mind, who being the moſt excellent Miniſter of the Sanctuary and true Tabernacle, which God hath pitched, and not Man, without whom, the greateſt of inſtrumental Miniſters can do nothing, are of no Service: But this moſt powerful, moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and moſt glorious High Prieſt, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſter, appears with his People and Flock, according to his gracious Promiſe; he can when he pleaſes, whoſe Time is the beſt Time, effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually and ſuitabiy ſupply all the Wants of his true Followers, without inſtrumental Miniſters, (although we own, and humbly confeſs, that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, by and thro' Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments influenced and actuated by the aboveſaid
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008146_0022_102E3BDF67E63008"/>
all-powerful Miniſter, hath been, is, and ever will be of ſingular Service to the Huſbandry, Heritage and Plantation of God, as it is rightly applied) and therefore ought to be valued in its Place.—But oh, alas! how do thoſe ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creatures undervalue and put a Slight upon our bleſſed Mediator of this new Covenant, our Phyſician of the greateſt Value, the Biſhop of our Souls, and our Saviour, who hath ſhed his precious Blood, and given his Life a Ranſom for us, that in any wiſe can find in their Heart to omit the attending even ſmall Meetings, though without any inſtrumental Miniſter, when he hath upon moſt reaſonable Conditions promiſed his Life-giving Preſence there.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> As the true-hearted and faithful Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of humble Jeſus find it their indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Duty, and peculiar Intereſt, to attend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Meetings, whether they be great or ſmall, whether they have in them inſtrumental Miniſters, or they have none, both on Firſt-days and other Days of the Week, they grow and proſper in the Truth, even in the Root of true Religion, and are very often ſignally bleſſed and favour'd by kind Providence, even in the Things of this Life, and come up in the real Improvement of their Talents, and conſequently in their reſpective Services in the Church, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying their Peace whilſt in Health, and the Aboundings thereof when on ſick and dying Beds; whilſt, on the other hand, thoſe poor unthinking Profeſſors of Truth, who by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the Work thereof in their own Hearts,

            <p>A certain worthy ancient Miniſter gave, in my Audience, the following Relation;
<q>That in his young Years (having been from his Childhood educated in the Way of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church) being favour'd with the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Viſitation of the Lord, he became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy with the traditional Singings and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial formalities uſed in the ſaid Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whereupon ſeeking and enquiring for the right Way of Worſhip acceptable unto God, he dropp'd into a ſmall Meeting of Friends, wherein no inſtrumental Miniſtry (as I remember) was heard that Day; yet nevertheleſs the ſeeking Youth was made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, melted, and throughly convinc'd of the Truth in that ſilent Meeting.</q>
(The like
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008146_0024_102E3BE28392FE48"/>
Account I have alſo heard concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement of ſome others)
<q>And thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, perſevering under an awful Regard to that gracious Hand that had ſo viſited him, he grew in Grace and the ſaving Knowledge of God; who being of poor and low Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as to Things of this Life, was oblig'd to labour hard for his Bread, and, being a Taylor by Trade, was often obliged to work at other Peoples Houſes, yet could not be eaſy to omit Week-day Meetings, but laying aſide his Work, was engag'd to walk often a pretty Way to Week-day Meetings; yet ſuch was his Diligence and Induſtry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the ſaid Meetings, that thoſe he work'd for deſir'd no Allowance or Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Time ſpent on Account of the ſaid Meetings. Some Time after this he married a young Woman convinc'd of the Truth a little while before. Now the Storms of Perſecution roſe high, and having now and then a Meeting in his Houſe (being himſelf in the miniſterial Capacity) they cheerfully ſuffer'd the Spoiling of their Goods for Truth's Sake, and were ſtripp'd very bare as to Temporals, having two ſmall Children, and his Wife with Child of the third; yet keeping faithful, according to the beſt of their Knowledge and Ability, and conſequently not daring to be remiſs or indifferent in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Duty of attending religious Meetings, they were bleſſed every Way, and their little Oil and Meal were thereby render'd capable
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008146_0025_102E3BE751660290"/>
to anſwer all juſt Demands, and moreover to make many little Cakes for the Prophets of the Lord, having all along a Place and Houſe of Reception and Hoſpitality for his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Day of their Death, which was in Peace inexpreſſible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the other Hand many, by the wretched Indifferency about ſpiritual and religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (though it may be at the ſame time pretty ſtanch Moraliſts, have become guilty of this miſerable Deficiency of neglecting or forſaking the Aſſembling themſelves, in order to perform divine Worſhip on Week-days, and ſome have ſo lamentably been prevailed upon by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of Lukewarmneſs, or by the ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and choaking Cares of this World, the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, or the Love of other Things, or it may be in ſome weak Perſons, by taking a Diſguſt againſt ſome Miniſter, Friend or Friends of the Meeting) have ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abſented religious Aſſemblies, even often on the Firſt-days of the Week, abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God, the Laws of the Land, and the repeated Advices and well known Rules of the Society, they would unreaſonably be accounted Members of. But alas! alas! ſuch are in a miſerable dwindling State and Habit of Soul, laying a Foundation for future Repentance, Anguiſh and Tribulation; many piteous Inſtances of this Kind have appeared (and peradventure ſome ſuch may at this Day be found) under the Profeſſion of the Truth; one
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008146_0026_102E3BE9E2FCB9E0"/>
of which I ſhall here take Freedom to mention, as a Caution worthy to be taken Notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A certain young Man, as I remember, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning Trade and Buſineſs for himſelf, was thereby ſo engroſſed and hurried in his anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mind, that he too much omitted the Attending of religious Meetings; but being attacked by Sickneſs, and brought to a Bed of Languiſhing, his paſt Negligence became his Burden, under the Senſe of which he groaned and bemoaned himſelf; and being aſked by a Friend the Cauſe of his ſo great Diſtreſs of Mind, he anſwered, <hi>It was becauſe he had been too remiſs in going to Meetings, eſpecially Week-day Meetings;</hi> but added, <hi>that if the Lord would be pleaſed to raiſe him up again to his former State of Health, he would for the future be more careful, and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in that important Duty.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! therefore that all in Time of Liberty, Health and Strength of Body, may conſider their own both Duty and Intereſt in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as that they may not ſuffer themſelves, through too eager Purſuit of, or too cloſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Enjoyments of this fading World, or ſupine Indolence, to be deprived thereby of the many Goſpel Privileges offered unto us, of which the peaceable Enjoyment of our religious Meetings is one of great Worth, and always ſo accounted and highly valued by the faithful and truly thoughtful People of God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008146_0027_102E3BEDB601D610"/>4<hi>thly.</hi> Beſides what is afore ſaid touching the great Diſadvantage that accrues to thoſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, who are found deficient in this momentous Duty now treated of, they are bad Examples to the young People and others, and eſpecially thoſe who have Children coming up, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Servants under their Care too, being in the Station of Governors of Families (as they are evidently negligent) loſe their Authority, and render themſelves bad Precedents to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, and ſo, as ſuch, cannot give effectual Precepts and Advice to their Families, but alas! through their diſmal Neglect and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, their poor Children, being too much left to themſelves, often prove Libertines, and run to Ruin. How then ſhall ſuch unfaithful Parents in the Day of Account anſwer for theſe Neglects, both with reſpect to their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and poor Families, and the Meetings they belong, to which, if they had been honeſtly concerned, they might have been of good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? Shall not ſuch unjuſt Stewards be called to an Account? Oh! that all Parents of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Governors of Families, would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and timely conſider how pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Lord <hi>Abraham's</hi> Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for his Children, and for thoſe under his immediate Care was! <hi>Gen.</hi> xviii. 17, 19. <hi>Shall I,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>that Thing which I do? For I know him, that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the Lord.</hi>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:008146_0028_102E3BF0341F3360"/>All thoſe that meet, I ſay, <hi>in the Name of</hi> Jeſus, that is, under a truly awful, religious and conſcientious Concern of Mind, do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform their reaſonable Service to God, and ſo reap his Peace and Bleſſing, but are of ſingular Help and Comfort to the true-hearted in the Meeting; whilſt the abſent Worldlings, being as miſerable Comforters, are neither juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to God, to themſelves, nor to their Friends and Families: Manifold, therefore, I ſay, are the Obligations we are all under, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we that have Children and Families, to come up in the honeſt Diſcharge of that our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service, <hi>viz.</hi> both with regard to the due Performance of, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Our Duties to God; 2<hi>dly,</hi> To our Children and Families; 3<hi>dly,</hi> To the Meetings we reſpectively belong; and 4<hi>thly,</hi> That we may bear our Teſtimony openly to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, in aſſembling ourſelves to wait upon, and worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth, even on Week-days as well as Firſt-days.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> It is almoſt ſurprizing to obſerve, how divers Profeſſors of Truth, who ſeem very diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardful of Chriſt's glorious Promiſe, which they plainly diſcover by their ſlighting and abſenting Meetings, where two or three are met; yet if a noted publick Friend appoints a Meeting, how ſuch are raiſed on the Wing, and flock to hear him, and ſometimes follow him to the next Meeting. Now although we ought certainly, whilſt capable, willingly and thankfully to give the Lord's Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors our Company, and ſeriouſly hear, and rightly apply
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008146_0029_102E3BF2BA421000"/>
their Meſſages; yet inſomuch as bleſſed Jeſus, our great and good Lord and Maſter, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be in the Midſt of two or three rightly met, we ought to prefer him above all; I ſay, without ſlighting or undervaluing the leaſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who bringeth glad Tidings, whoſe very Feet are beautiful upon the Mountains: But they plainly appear to neglect and ſlight the moſt glorious Miniſter and High Prieſt, who too ſeldom attend ſmall Meetings, purſuant to his ſaid conditional Promiſe, and (as it were) Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
            <p>I would by no Means have my Reader to ſuppoſe, by what is afore ſaid, that I am blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Friends for accompanying the Meſſengers of the Lord to the next Meeting, for that is a Brotherly Duty, which I myſelf took great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, whilſt in Health and Strength in my younger Years, and would encourage the right Minded in ſo doing; neither would I hereby diſcourage any who having been Neglectors of Week-day Meetings, may find themſelves awakened and rouſed up by any Inſtrument: I would not, I ſay, diſcourage ſuch from going along with ſuch a Friend to the next Meeting, or further, as the Cords of Truth may draw him, and to keep cloſe to that divine Touch and Influence they have been favoured with, through the Miniſtry of the ſaid Inſtrument, which they may undoubtedly find renewed and increaſed, as they humbly retire to the Maſter and Spring of all Good in their own Hearts, who hath promiſed to be with the two or three,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008146_0030_102E3BF6A19179B0"/>
who are, or ſhall be, rightly gathered, when ſuch inſtrumental Miniſters may be far abſent, or even removed from us (by Death.) The great and good Shepherd, ſpeaking of himſelf and his Flock, ſaith thus, <hi>John</hi> x. 4. <hi>When he putteth forth his own Sheep, he goeth before them, and the Sheep follow him, for they know his Voice.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore he putteth ſorth any, old or young, Maſters or Servants, rich or poor, and goeth before them, let them readily go forth and follow him. We heartily wiſh they may grow and proſper; yet I muſt ſay, whereſoever any Profeſſors of Truth are found and obſerved from Time to Time to neglect or forſake, or, at leaſt, do not duly attend their reſpective Meetings at Home, both on Firſt-days and other Days of the Week; and yet it may be are forward to attend <hi>Monthly, General,</hi> and ſometimes probably <hi>Quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> may not ſuch their Proceedings be juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted irregular and prepoſterous? Or how can we expect thoſe can be of real Service at Monthly and Quarterly-meetings, who ſlight and forſake the Meetings they belong to at Home? It is much deſired therefore, that all profeſſing the bleſſed Principle of Truth, in whatſoever Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Vocations they are placed, may let the Harms of others be their ſeaſonable Caution, that they may be effectually rouſed up and excited to Diligence in the honeſt Performance of this weighty Duty, now ſpoken of in much Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to Souls, the right Diſcharge whereof has often been, and is, attended with the enriching Bleſſing of kind Providence in ſpiritual Things,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008146_0031_102E3BFA2DE4B3F8"/>
and ſometimes in temporal, and the Neglect thereof is attended with Leanneſs of Soul, with many Diſappointments and Diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>And further, with regard to that great Duty Friends owe to their Children, in the due Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Education of them, to which they are bound by the Laws of God and Nature, we ought in the firſt Place to look well to ourſelves, and then to our Children; <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 28. <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>weep not for me,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>but weep for yourſelves, and for your Children.</hi> How ſhall any be rightly concerned for their Children, who are negligent touching their own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? 'Tis to be feared the wide Courſes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children have been often occaſioned (in great Meaſure) by the Indolence and Irreligion of their Parents. I cannot well omit taking Notice of one Stripling, whoſe Parents were Profeſſors of Truth, rich in Things of this Life; yet alas! theſe Parents, being themſelves too remiſs in attending Week-day Meetings, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not good Examples, did not train up their Son in the Performance of that Duty, wherein they themſelves were deficient: So he grew up ſo much indulged in Liberty, that I was credibly informed he has been ſeen, even in the very Time of the Meeting, which was held near their Dwelling-houſe, to walk into the fields with his Fowling-piece, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But oh! what was the Conſequence of ſuch irreligious Proceedings and Liberties; this Youth became rather an Affliction than a Comfort to Friends, lived faſt as a Libertine, and died ſoon in the

Flower of his Age: Which ſorrowful Remarks I make with much Awe, Humility and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> Some Profeſſors of Truth, as hinted before, have betrayed ſo much Indiſcretion, and unmortified Temper of Mind, as to abſent reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Meetings, and it may be, Meetings of Buſineſs too, through ſome Diſlike or Offence taken againſt ſome particular Friend or Friends, or perhaps againſt ſome Steps in the Diſcipline, or it may be, againſt the Miniſter belonging to the Meeting; which unjuſtifiable Steps lead to Confuſion, the Loſs of Unity with the Society, and oftentimes is attended with great Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the immortal Souls of theſe unhappy Perſons, who fooliſhly fall into ſo bad a Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and beſides all this, it affords a very bad Example to the young People (eſpecially) whoſe quick Eyes are upon them, and theſe their By-ſteps, and will very likely make ſhrewd Remarks on ſuch Miſconduct, which is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to all good Men that behold it, but moſt pernicious to thoſe guilty thereof; of whom we may ſay, <hi>Job</hi> v. 2. <hi>Wrath killeth the fooliſh Man, and Envy ſlayeth the ſilly One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> As the truly concerned and faithful Friends to what they profeſs do, whilſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof, find it their incumbent Duty dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to attend Meetings, both on Firſt-days and other Days of the Week; ſo it is their Care both to obſerve, as much as they well can, the Hour appointed for the Gathering of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and alſo when there, to ſit under a fervent

               </gap> Friends, truly concerned to improve their Time and Talents, find Meetings of Worſhip, Times and Places of Improvement, Pleaſure and Profit; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are like careful, induſtrious Tradeſmen, very deſirous, though through ſome Difficulties, to attend thoſe Places where the moſt Gain and Advantage may be in all Likelihood obtained. But pray how ſhould they, who, thro' the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of their Talents of Grace and Truth, find little or nothing of either Profit or Pleaſure in religious Meetings, be deſirous to preſs through Crowds to get to them? Nay, may we not ſafely conclude thoſe, who are remiſs in getting to religious Meetings, do not experience (by reaſon of their own Neglect of the Gift of Grace) that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008146_0034_102E3BFFEA1E7880"/>
ſweet and excellent Gain of Godlineſs, which the Faithful do, and therefore may probably think it ſcarce worth their while to take much Pains about ſuch a Matter; when it is very likely the ſame Perſons, in caſe they had Ground to hope they could gain a Sum of Money, or make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Improvement of their temporal Stock, in the Way of their outward Buſineſs, would be very careful not to miſs the Opportunity, altho' they can ſcarce be prevailed upon to uſe ſuch Endeavours for the obtaining the moſt bleſſed, moſt excellent Company and Preſence of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our glorious High Prieſt, our Saviour, the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and the Prince of Peace, though ſo lovingly invited by him. May not they, who ſlight ſuch a gracious Promiſe, apply to themſelves thoſe Words of the Almighty,— 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 30. <hi>They that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> On the other hand, may not the true and faithful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders of religious Aſſemblies, by Faith lay hold on that Promiſe,—<hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi> And likewiſe receive Conſolation and Encouragement from theſe Words of Chriſt,— <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 32. <hi>Fear not little Flock, for it is your Father's good Pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> Faithful Friends forecaſt their Buſineſs ſo as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo far as in them lies, may interfere and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from attending Week-day Meetings.

concerned for, and rightly bring thoſe up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, who are under their Care? How ſhould thoſe Parents who do not weep for themſelves, rightly weep for their Children? <hi>Weep not for me,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, to the lamenting Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem, but weep for yourſelves and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Nay, ſome of thoſe Parents, remiſs in their Duty to God and their own Souls (in Regard to attending Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to their Offspring, have too often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and taken amiſs the Advice of their well-wiſhing Friends, with reſpect to their Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, reſpecting their own Welfare, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their Childrens Good. Some Parents, it may be, have gone to Meetings themſelves, but have too often left their Children (or at leaſt too many of them) at Home, expoſed, very likely, to unſuitable Company, and undue Liberties. Nay, ſome living in the Town where the Firſt-day and Week-day Meetings were held, have both themſelves and their Children too much forſaken the Aſſembling themſelves together, eſpecially on the Week-days, and perhaps ſome of thoſe irreligious Profeſſors would be ſitting, or walking, or talking in the Street, during the Week-day Meeting-time, and when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to a more becoming Conduct, they have taken it amiſs, and ſpurned violently againſt the Advice and the Adviſer; and by ſuch Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour it has been thought they have harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Children againſt Friends. But, alas! thoſe imprudent Creatures, both Elder and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008146_0038_102E3C0C2136EE00"/>
Younger, have been attended with manifeſt Tokens of the great Loſs they ſuſtained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by divers Ways. May therefore the Harms of others be our ſeaſonable Precautions.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to the Objections ſome have made, or may make, <hi>againſt bringing Children to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Meetings,</hi> ſcarce thinking them, perhaps, capable of receiving Profit therein, I much deſire the Words and Obſervations of our worthy Friend <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> in his Propoſition of Worſhip, Pag. 359, 360, may be ſeriouſly conſidered, as follows: <q>And this Power would ſometimes alſo reach to, and wondefully work in Meetings, even in little Children, to the Admiration and Aſtoniſhment of many.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When honeſt Parents have done what they could, or can do, on Account of their own and their dear Childrens Souls Welfare, all may be little enough; but happy thoſe poor Parents, who being tried with that exceeding bitter Cup, and Heart-breaking Exerciſe, of having a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son or Daughter, can in Sincerity appeal unto the Lord, on this wiſe,—<hi>Lord, thou' knoweſt I have done my Beſt for my Children, both by humble Prayer and frequent Interceſſion with thee for them, as well as by Example and Precept, for their Preſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what will become of thoſe unhappy Parents, who have afforded their Children nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Examples nor Precepts, but diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the greateſt Buſineſs of their Time, that is, of working out their own Salvation, and therefore have neglected (and by that Neglect

Souls, our Children, Families, and our Friends, flock to our religious Meetings, both on Firſt-days and other Days of the Week, taking our Children along with us, and allowing all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Liberty to our Servants? But oh! how ſhall thoſe anſwer for it at the great Day of Account, who are, or ſhall be found negligent in an Affair of ſo great Importance! The late and diſorderly coming to Meetings of ſome of the Profeſſors of Truth, who generally drop in, when thoſe who carefully obſerve the Hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed have ſitten perhaps Half an Hour, or moſt of an Hour, do not only interrupt and hurt the Meeting, but is a bad Example to the young People and others, but the greateſt Loſs is their own. This irregular Practice of coming late to Meetings is inconſiſtent with our Reputation as a religious Society, and contrary to the Practice of Friends in the Beginning, of whom we read, that not only thoſe of advanced Years were good Examples in this Reſpect, but alſo that ſome of their Children, who were left at Home during their Parents Impriſonment for keeing up this Teſtimony, were concerned honourably to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their religious Meetings, and were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo called in queſtion by the ſecular Powers for this their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Teſtimony in thoſe trying and proving Times?

            <p>While I am writing theſe Words, the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Expoſtulation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with backſliding <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, ſprings in my Mind, wherein he movingly cries out on this wiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 6. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh People and unwiſe?

Oh!

grievous dropping of Week-day Meetings may juſtly be called a Backſliding from the Purity and Integrity of our worthy Antients, and the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Faithful in this Day, and from the repeated Advices and Directions of many Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as well as our Yearly-meeting from time to time, who have been engaged to counſel in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love; let ſuch remember the tender Call of the Lord to his backſliding <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, with the Heart-affecting conditional Promiſe annexed thereto, <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 22. <hi>Return ye backſliding Children, and I will heal your Backſlidings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

who in this gracious Toleration are thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully neglecting or dropping their Week-day Meetings, and ſo ſlighting the encouraging Expreſſions of bleſſed Jeſus, the righteous Judge of the Quick and Dead, while they are yet in Health and Strength, and in a Capacity to meet together with the two or three?</p>
            <p>Again, may it be obſerved, that when <hi>Moſes,</hi> that faithful Servant of the Lord, was near leaving the People, being One Hundred and Twenty Years old, he wrote the Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it to the Prieſts which bore the Ark of the Lord, and unto all the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with this poſitive Command and Charge, ſaying, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxi. 12, 13. <hi>Gather the People together, Men, Women and Children, and thy Stranger which is within thy Gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn and fear the Lord your God, and obſerve to do all the Words of this Law: And that their Children, which have not known any Thing, may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as ye live in the Land, whither ye go over</hi> Jordan <hi>to poſſeſs it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pleaſe to mark here, <hi>Strangers,</hi> and even <hi>Children,</hi> were not to be overlooked or left at Home, but to appear among the Elders at the Time and Place appointed; neither were the People of the Lord to drop or omit the due Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Charge ſo long as they ſhould live in the Land. Shall Goſpel Duties then be dropt in this glorious Goſpel Diſpenſation? How many good Friends, even upon their dying Beds, have been frequently concerned to adviſe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008146_0047_102E3C26513E1000"/>
their Survivors, diligently and duly to attend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Meetings?</p>
            <p>May we remember that the <hi>Jews</hi> began their Preparation of the Sabbath, at Three <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Clock in the Afternoon of the aforegoing Day, that is, of the Sixth-day of the Week: Should we not therefore now, as the Meeting-day and Time approaches, be, after a ſuitable Manner, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Minds and Thoughts from earthly Things, and get into a proper Concern for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Name of Jeſus, with the two or three, in order to know him in the Midſt of us. But would it not be a very ſorry and piteous Caſe, if any of us ſhould have our Minds ſo ingroſſed and employed with Things of this World, that we ſhould go talking and communing, on the Meeting-days, about earthly Concerns, almoſt to the Meeting-houſe Door, and likewiſe, Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being broken up, reſume the ſame worldly Subjects of Diſcourſe? If ſuch ſhould in the Meeting receive any Share of the heavenly Seed into their Hearts (being too much like the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Ground) are they not in Danger of having the ſame devoured by the Fowls of the Air? Oh! therefore, how great Care and Circumſpection ought we to be found in, both in going to our Meetings, waiting reverently in them, and awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returning from them, and even in the whole Courſe of our ſhort and uncertain Time? If therefore an honeſt Concern of this Kind was come into, and duly obſerved by the Profeſſors of Truth, that is, a proper Exerciſe, a ſtrict Obſervation of the Hour appointed, and a
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008146_0048_102E3C28D016F520"/>
ſuitable Concern and waiting for the ſenſible Enjoyment of the divine Preſence; all which neceſſary Steps I am well aſſured the Principle we profeſs would, if rightly obeyed, lead all its Profeſſors into; our religious Meetings would, in the beſt Senſe, become Times and Places of Pleaſure and Profit united; and as for the moſt Part, or often, our Meetings have in them ſome Children, ſome infirm Perſons, who are ſcarce able to endure very long Meetings, though we cannot limit the Continuation of our Meetings by the Clock or Hour-glaſs, yet, by the Methods aboveſaid, through the Lord's Bleſſing thereupon, Meetings would be ſhort and ſweet, and the Performance of this our reaſonable Duty would be rendered unto the general not grievous, but joyous and profitable, even to the ſincere Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Flock, according to the Aſſertion of him who has promiſed his bleſſed Company, —<hi>My Yoke is eaſy, and my Burden is light.</hi> And inaſmuch as our Profeſſion of the Guidance and Teachings of the holy Spirit in the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, implies an Abrogation of the typical Ceremonies commanded and practiſed under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, how greatly it behoves us, and under how cloſe Obligations do we lie, who profeſs the bleſſed Truth, ſo to demean ourſelves at all Times, and in all Places (but eſpecially in our religious Meetings) that nothing inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with our high Profeſſion may appear; no ſcandalous Dullneſs or Sleepineſs, no gaping or yawning, no wandering Eyes, no unbecoming or reſtleſs Poſtures, may ever appear in the Times
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008146_0049_102E3C644E0120F8"/>
of our Devotion; for, to be ſure, whether we watch ourſelves rightly or not, the Eyes of the People are upon us; and if, while we profeſs to be come beyond Ceremonies, formal Prayer, premeditated Sermons, formal Singings, and the like, any of us ſhould be ſo unhappy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by an unprudent Conduct, Lukewarmneſs, and an unconcerned Frame of Mind in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Meetings, to give Occaſion to any that have their Eyes upon us, ſome it may be for Good, and ſome otherwiſe, to ſay, <hi>we, or any of us, are ſo poor, that we have neither Shadow nor Subſtance,</hi> we ſhall certainly hurt our Souls, and be bad Examples to others.</p>

            <p>NOtwithſtanding I have ſometimes heretofore taken the Freedom to write unto you in brotherly Love, it may be, in ſome Degree, to the like Import with the following Lines; yet, nevertheleſs, often remembering you in my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in a renewed Manner I now find Drawings in my Mind again hereby to ſalute you in the Love of the Goſpel, even in a dear and near Manner, with earneſt Deſires that ye may every one, in your ſeveral Stations, Growths and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, whether Elders or Younger, Parents or Children, Maſters or Servants, be truly obedient
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008146_0055_102E3C716818F420"/>
to the Dictates and Guidance of the bleſſed Spirit of Truth ye profeſs, that thereby ye may be preſerved from every hurtful Thing, and may be guided into all Truth, both in your temporal Concerns and religious Duties, and in faithfully bearing your ſeveral <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Teſtimonies for God (when call'd thereunto) againſt Tithes, and all antichriſtian Impoſitions, Cuſtoms and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands whatſoever, and may be graciouſly helped to reduce to Practice thoſe excellent Precepts of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Eph. vi. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honour thy Father and Mother</hi> (which is the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment with Promiſe) <hi>that it may be well with thee, and thou mayſt live long on the Earth. And, ye Fathers, provoke not your Children to Wrath, but bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. Servants, be obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the Fleſh, with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in Singleneſs of your Heart, as unto Chriſt; not with Eye-ſervice, as Men-pleaſers, but as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, doing the Will of God from the Heart; with good Will doing Service, as to the Lord, and not to Men: Knowing that whatſoever good Thing any Man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. And, ye Maſters, do the ſame Things unto them, forbearing Threatning, knowing that your Maſter alſo is in Heaven, neither is there Reſpect of Perſons with him. Finally, my Brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might. Put on

            <p>
               <hi>My dearly beloved Friends,</hi> in much brotherly Kindneſs and Charity, I tenderly ſympathize with you that may be under Suffering or Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in any Reſpect, and particularly in this, that divers of the worthy Elders and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in ſome Places, are removed from you by Death, and divers Meetings may now be ſmall and reduced: I beg you will not be too much diſcouraged on this Account; for the all-ſufficient Rock and Root remains, which, as ye duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, will ſupply all your Wants, and will qualify and teach Parents and Elders to be good Examples, and rightly to inſtruct their Children and young Generation, by Precept and Pattern, as nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers, and likewiſe would direct and help Children and Youths to demean themſelves aright toward Parents and Elders, Servants towards Maſters, and Maſters towards Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O dear Friends,</hi> I beſeech you go not out after the <hi>Lo-heres,</hi> and <hi>Lo-theres,</hi> now crying aloud in the Nation, but diligently attend your religious Meetings, both on the Firſt-days and Week-days, and other Meetings for Truth's Service, as you may find your Way open'd, while you are favoured with the Bleſſings of Health and Strength, and there devoutly wait for the ſpiritual Appearance of Chriſt, who hath given this gracious Promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the Midſt of them.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:008146_0057_102DD0274C5D19A0"/>It is now in my Heart lovingly to addreſs and adviſe you, concerning two particular Things, of no ſmall Importance, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Be ſure to watch againſt the leaſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any Thing that would gender to <hi>Diſcord,</hi> and, with all Care and Circumſpection, labour to keep the <hi>Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 10. <hi>Now I beſeech you,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame Thing, and that there be no Diviſions among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment.</hi> Wherefore, whenever any Matter of Debate may happen to be, wherein Friends may be of different Sentiments, it is much to be deſir'd, that all Friends would labour ſo to keep to and under the Government of the meek Spirit of Jeſus, as that all Animoſities, Ill-temper, exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating Expreſſions and Reſentments, may be prevented, and that mutual Love, that certain diſtinguiſhing Characteriſtick of the Diſciples of Chriſt, may ever be in all Caſes maintain'd and retain'd among us; which honeſt Care and Concern would, I firmly believe, greatly tend to the Praiſe of him our heavenly Head, and to the Edification of his Church and People, through the Influence of the divine Spirit, ſo that we might thereby really and experimentally know the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Efficacy of divine Love, according to the Apoſtle's extenſive and moving Aſſertion, 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 16.—<hi>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> O bleſſed

that walk uprightly.</hi> And thus would they be preſerved from the various Snares and Gins that are cunningly laid by our common Adverſary for the Feet of the Youth, eſpecially in this afflicting Caſe of <hi>mixt Marriages,</hi> wherein ſo many of our careleſs, diſobedient Youths have ſo often fallen, and alas! yet are falling, to the inexpreſſible Sorrow of their honeſt Parents, and to the great Trouble and Exerciſe of their truly wellwiſhing Friends, and the Society in general; but alas! the greateſt Loſs is their own. And verily, we have many Inſtances at this Time of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Situation ſuch poor, reſolute, inconſiderate Creatures have brought themſelves into, by their imprudent and diſagreeable Proceedings and Contracts on Account of that very momentous Affair of <hi>Marriage.</hi> Let, therefore, I beſeech you, my dear young and unmarried Friends, the Harms and By-ſteps of others, with the diſmal Conſequences thereof, be your timely Cautions.</p>
            <p>Faithful Friends, in theſe ſorrowful Times, can but deeply lament to ſee ſo many of our young Men and Women ſo far ſtraying from the Principles of their Education, and the ſettled and well known Rules of our Society in divers Reſpects, but in particular, I ſay, in that (which is now weightily before me and many others) even that diſagreeable, dangerous Error of <hi>mixt Marriages,</hi> whereby Confuſion and Perplexity are uſher'd into Families, Meetings, and the Society. How many that might probably have been of ſingular Service in the Society many Ways, have forfeited their Unity with Friends, render'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Bowels of Love, once more I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreat you, that are not yet enthrall'd in that diſmal Yoke of Bondage, <hi>Stand upon your Guard; watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation</hi> of any Kind, and eſpecially that ye be not allur'd into theſe Snares of being <hi>unequally yoked</hi> in theſe Kinds of unſuitable Marriages, which have perhaps ſeem'd pleaſant to ſome at the firſt, but generally have, and do prove bitter Cups afterwards, it having long been, and yet is, the Senſe of ſolid and judicious Friends, that the Hand of divine Providence is againſt ſuch diſagreeable Matches.—<hi>Prov.</hi> xx. 17. <hi>Bread of Deceit is ſweet to a Man, but afterwards his Mouth ſhall be filled with Gravel,</hi> ſaith wiſe King <hi>Solomon.</hi>
