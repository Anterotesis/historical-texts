            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TIRED with oppreſſion in our native land, and in hopes of a better ſituation in America, two hundred of us, hale, hearty, and induſtrious, beſides women and children, embarked at Londonderry, on board the ******, bound for Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>

From the outſet untoward acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents awaited us. We had not been ten days at ſea, when our veſſel ſprung a leak, which, for a long time, baffled all our endeavours. At length, being diſcovered, it was ſtopped, and we eſteemed ourſelves ſecure.—Thougtleſs mortals! the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of to-day never produces the effect of preparing us for the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of to-morrow!</p>
            <p>A guſt aroſe! the elements warred together, as if it were the "laſt groan of expiring nature." The floodgates of heaven ſeemed looſed! dreadful peals of thunder rattled on the ear. The ſtouteſt hearts were appalled. The forked lightning

ſtruck our maſt, and ſet the veſſel on fire. Beſet by two raging elements—the roaring billows, which laſhed her ſides, and ſeemed ready to ſwallow her and us, though they had appeared ſo terrific before—now loſt their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and were regarded—melancholy alternative!—as a leſs tremendous enemy than their new auxiliary.</p>
            <p>With vaſt difficulty, the flame was extinguiſhed—but not until it had rendered our veſſel ſcarcely manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. To complete the meaſure of our woes, our proviſions fell ſhort. A biſcuit and a pint of water, fetid and almoſt as denſe as glue, was the daily portion of each! Every morning ſaw two or three miſerable wretches
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030158_0006_0FE3FAA6FB1048F8"/>
heaved overboard, into a watry grave, in the preſence of their dejected friends and relatives, each hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the hand of death to cloſe his eyes, and free him from his abyſs of miſery.</p>
            <p>"Father! father!" cries a once beautiful, but now emaciated child, whoſe viſage bore irreſiſtible evidence of near-approaching mortality, <q>get me a drink! I faint—I die!—for God's ſake let me have a drop of water to quench my thirſt!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Captain, I beg a little water to ſave my child from death,</q>—<q>You have had your ſhare for to-day, and ſhall have no more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>

               <q>Brute! ſtranger to the tender feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of nature—had you a child—but you are not worthy of having one—you would pity my preſent ſituation, and relieve me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The mother of the child, who had ſwooned away, juſt came to herſelf. She heard his plaintive cries. She joined her voice to his, and beſought the father to procure the water.</p>
            <p>Melancholy, anguiſh, and torture, ſeized the tender huſband's—the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der father's ſoul. The big tear rolled down his cheek. <q>Gracious and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerful God! why viſit your children with ſuch calamities?

the ways of unerring Providence? Not my will, O Lord, but thine be done!</q>
            </p>
            <p>He returned to the ſcene he had juſt quitted. His beloved child lay breathing his laſt. His wife had ſwooned away again. The ſight was too afflictive. His agonies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him. He went to the captain, whom he quarrelled with, ſtruck. The blows were returned. He ſeized a ſword; and the captain, ruſhing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, received it in his breaſt. He cloſed his eyes for ever.</p>
            <p>Diſorder and confuſion enſued in the veſſel. The ſailors plundered every thing they could lay their hands upon: and ſuch was their irregularity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030158_0009_0FE3FAB57AAC08E8"/>
and careleſſneſs, that they ran the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel aground at Synapuxent, in the ſtate of Maryland.</p>
            <p>The ſea ran mountains high. A ſkiff, with about twenty perſons on board, was overſet by an enormous wave. The ſhrieks and piteous cries of men, women, and children, ſoon died away. They were ſwallowed up in one common grave. Moſt of the remainder were drowned in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſwim to land.</p>
            <p>About thirty miſerable wretches of us, gained the ſhore, ſome fortunate enough to ſave their property. We expected there to meet with relief and comfort. Fatal deluſion! Had we been thrown aſhore among the New

Zealanders, among the ſwarthy ſons of Guinea, or among the rapacious Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, our fate could not have been more ſevere. We were cruelly plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Not a valuable article was left us—and we were reduced to beggary in a ſtrange land, without a hope of redreſs.</p>
            <p>Man! man! wretched, infatuated man! Can a ſordid trifle tempt you thus to violate every rule of right and juſtice—to ſteel your heart againſt the feelings of humanity—and to be more cruel and noxious than the raging ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! Short is your day—and then all the vanities of this world will paſs away—the veil that prevents your regarding objects in their true light,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030158_0011_0FE3F98AE2079BE0"/>
will be removed—keen remorſe will prey upon your tortured ſoul, and be an earneſt of your future never-dying woe!</p>
            <p>Rulers of America! Guard againſt this barbarity! make ſevere laws to puniſh the miſcreants who may be guilty of it—and let a civic crown be awarded the man who ventures his own life to ſave that of a fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the direſt diſtreſs!</p>

With a few books, but thoſe judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly choſen by a watchful parent, I acquired a ſenſe of the "Dignity of "human nature." I ſaw, with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious gratitude and reverence, the vaſt and unparalleled advantages of our weſtern hemiſphere. I learned to deſpiſe the ſopperies, the follies, and the pretended refinements of the old world. I enjoyed, with rapture, the boundleſs proſpects of happineſs and virtue, deſtined, as I hoped, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote poſterity, in these extenſive regions.</p>
               <p>From Alleghany's foot I removed to the metropolis of America, as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia proudly vaunts herſelf. I here obſerved manners prevailing,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030158_0016_0FE3FAD3C673F270"/>
which, when I had read of them, as European, I had deſpiſed. I ſaw a few, whoſe example muſt have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful influence, giving a taint to the general maſs, and appearing anxious in endeavouring to accelerate the arrival of that degeneracy, which the patriot endeavours to delay as far as poſſible. Theſe <hi>obſervations,</hi> it may be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſumed, gave me pain. I dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the aſylum, ſo much boaſted of, would be deſtroyed—and that from a ſpreading depravity, the ſtate of America, the revolution of which <q>had revived the hopes of good men, and promiſed an opening to better times, would become a diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to future efforts in favour of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030158_0017_0FE3FAD976216048"/>
liberty, and prove only an opening to a new ſcene of human degeneracy and miſery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And is there, thought I, no perſon to ſtep forward, and endeavour to ſtem the torrent that is gradually ſapping the foundation of morals and manners, and which, if ſuffered to proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly, will bear down every things valuable in its progreſs?</p>
               <p>As I have ever conceived, that even the attempt to accompliſh great objects is laudable, I choſe rather to expoſe my own weakneſs, than be wanting to the public intereſt. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to communicate to my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens the <hi>obſervations</hi> I might occaſionally make, in hopes of being
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030158_0018_0FE3FADC38001710"/>
ſerviceable to the cauſe of virtue, Happy, too happy ſhall I be, if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the humble inſtrument of ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of countenance any ſingle one of the follies or vices, which are ſo carefully tranſplanted from their native ſoil, and which, like other ill weeds, flouriſh apace, and threaten to choke up the valuable plants.</p>
               <p>Conſcious of my inability, unaſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to accompliſh, to the extent I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the grand object I have in view, I have enliſted into the ſervice a few aids de camp who will occaſionally furniſh their ſpeculations. Hence will ariſe an agreeable diverſity of ſtile and ſentiment—and that ſameneſs, ſo lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to diſguſt the reader, be provent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>I invite every man, who is deſirous to advance the beſt intereſts of ſociety, to co-operate in this undertaking.—Perſonality and ſcurrility I deſpiſe, and ſhall avoid. But general ſatire however ſevere, if calculated to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer good purpoſes, ſhall be always acceptable.</p>
               <p>So many times have periodical eſſayiſts aſſumed the pen, and ſo great is the ſameneſs of their ſubjects of diſcuſſion, that moſt of them are nearly exhauſted:—and therefore much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty is hardly to be expected. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <p>THE <hi>liberality</hi> of manners and cuſtoms, daily introducing into our country, muſt afford the higheſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to every lover of elegance and <hi>refinement.</hi> We are as repidly as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſſipating the <hi>ruſt</hi> and <hi>prejudices</hi> of paſt times, and, with a ſpirit of emulation beyond our years, copying
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030158_0022_0FE3FAF389DCF2B8"/>
the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>virtues</hi> of England, France, and Italy. To particularize every inſtance, in which we excel our anceſtors, would require more time and room than I can now devote to the purpoſe—indeed, it would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my abilities, to do juſtice to ſo capacious a ſubject. I ſhall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the preſent, confine myſelf to one leading feature in modern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, wherein their ſuperiority to thoſe of old times is too obvious not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the aſſent of the moſt ſuperficial obſerver.</p>
               <p>The feature I mean, is the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>odious reſtraints</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſagreeable in the married ſtate. Heretoſore, when a man or
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030158_0023_0FE3FAED97875C78"/>
woman made choice of a partner for life, that partner was conſidered as entitled to the chief of his or her cares and attentions. Any breach of this rule was <hi>ridiculouſly</hi> regarded as a violation of the laws of decorum and propriety, which entailed diſcredit on the offending party. The huſband gallanted his wife, to the theatre, to balls, to aſſemblies, to concerts, and to private parties. The <hi>inſipid mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> of ſuch a life muſt be to the laſt degree irkſome and diſguſting; as one of the higheſt gratifications of human nature is variety.</p>
               <p>Behold! what a charming contraſt is exhibited at preſent! In the faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world—(and muſt we not expect,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030158_0024_0FE3FAF65A13FAC8"/>
that this refinement will, in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, like every other, deſcend to the lower claſſes?)—a man is proſcribed from attendiing on his wife, or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in public with her. He may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his paſſion for variety by taking a new lady under his protection every day of his life. How ineffably agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how delightful a change!</p>
               <p>This will introduce, among its other advantages, an unuſual degree of <hi>harmony</hi> in the married ſtate. The chief cauſe, if we believe the writer of that <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>ediſying</hi> comedy, the <hi>ſchool for ſcandal,</hi> why ladies are ſo <hi>refractory</hi> and unmanageable with their huſbands, is the conſciouſneſs of poſſeſſing—what? why that <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030158_0025_0FE3FAFBEF4355B0"/>
old faſhioned</hi> quality, called chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity—a quality, which, however ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the days of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm,</hi> on the firſt ſettlement of this country, ought to be <hi>entirely laughed out of countenance</hi> at preſent. Every thing, therefore, that has a tendency to extirpate this troubleſome quality, muſt be productive of peace and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And I believe no man in his ſenſes will deny, that the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in queſtion will have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tendency that could be wiſhed, to baniſh chaſtity and all her <hi>troubleſome retinue</hi> from our ſhores. Perhaps, they may fly for refuge among the Creek Indians, to the court of the puiſſant prince, Alexander M'Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livray.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030158_0026_0FE3FAFF06F1B1D8"/>
Such antiquated beings are fit only for the uncultivated ſavages—they ought not to diſgrace ſuch an advanced ſtate of civilization as we can boaſt.</p>
               <p>"When a lady," ſays Mr. Sheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, the author of that <hi>valuable come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> I have already mentioned, "com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a TRIFLING <hi>faux pas,</hi> ſhe grows cautious, and ready to <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>agree</hi> with her huſband.'<note n="*" place="bottom">School for Scandal—page 40, American edition.</note>This <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> maxim, which I hope no perſon will controvert, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes beyond a doubt my poſition, that this new mode will be productive of matrimonial concord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:030158_0027_0FE3FB04CDBE0D18"/>
Another of the benefits of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of the human mind, is the catholiciſm it will introduce with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to <hi>children.</hi> As a huſband will not in future have the ſame degree of certainty, that his wife's children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <hi>properly ſpeaking,</hi> to himſelf, he will be no longer ſo <hi>contemptibly</hi> and <hi>illiberally</hi> contracted in his regards and cares of them, as parents uſed to be, in times of <hi>prejudice.</hi> Moreover, it is to be hoped and expected, that he will confer the <hi>ſame favours</hi> on his neighbours, as they on him. Hence, a <hi>community of children</hi> will be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among us, in a much more agreeable way, than that attempted in one of the old republics. How
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030158_0028_0FE3FB082201B040"/>
charming, then, will it be, that a man may point out <hi>likeneſſes of himſelf</hi> in the houſes of almoſt all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance! The political good ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this is equal to its beneficial moral effects.</p>
               <p>Among the French, that nation of gallantry and refinement, the <hi>ſtiff ſtarched</hi> manners that have hitherto prevailed in this country, have been long exploded. A lady's bed-charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which here has been too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered as her <hi>ſanctum ſancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> impervious to every one but the <hi>privileged huſband,</hi> there yields to the ſuperior influence of faſhion and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry. A gentleman has <hi>free acceſs</hi> to it in the morning, before the lady
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030158_0029_0FE3FB0DABAD8C90"/>
riſes, and chooſes it as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for making enquiries after her health. As the ladies univerſally paint there, perhaps this faſhion was introduced in order to give the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men an opportunity of <hi>ſeeing,</hi> before the application of the colours, what could not be ſeen afterwards—that is, the ladies' faces in their natural ſtate. A lady, without the ſmalleſt embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment,

manners, will, it is hoped, be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our great people, who have ſo long and ſo happily diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the <hi>honourable, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> and <hi>patriotic</hi> art of imitating the modes and manners of Europe,—which are ſo <hi>wonderfully calculated</hi> for this hemiſphere.</p>
               <p>The next ſtep we have to take—and which will naturally follow—is the introduction of <hi>

                     </gap>eiſm</hi> from the Italians. I have been much ſurpriſed that the French, who have always paid ſuch particular attention to the refinement of morals and manners, have never borrowed this <hi>admirable</hi> cuſtom from their tranſalpine neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. This is the more ſingular, as
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030158_0031_0FE3FB167899BF00"/>
it is materially connected with, and ſeems a neceſſary conſequence of, the leading features of their matrimonial ſyſtem. This is one proof, among thouſands that might be produced, of nations in a progreſſive ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, ſtopping ſhort, before they arived at the <hi>acme of perfection.</hi> But I hope our moral and political career will not be thus diſgracefully marked. I truſt, as we receive here the hardy German, the vivacious Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, the volatile Frenchman, the grave Engliſhman, the hoſpitable Iriſhman, and the induſtrious Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; that we ſhall cull from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of theſe various nations, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030158_0032_0FE3FB18921A9CF0"/>
form one national ſyſtem ſuperior to that of any of them.</p>
               <p>Conſiſtently with this idea, from England we ſhall borrow the mode of <hi>facilitating divorces,</hi> from which the French and Italians are in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree precluded, by a tenet of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which prohibits a ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, until the death of one of the parties. But our mother country (mother let her be, in dictating our manners, as well as in having ſettled the continent) has rendered ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the faſhionable world as eaſy as could reaſonably be deſired. Thus, for inſtance, when a married pair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tired of each other, and the lady has choſen, among her <hi>male friends,</hi> a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030158_0033_0FE3FB1EA2FC0248"/>
future help-mate, with whoſe <hi>talents</hi> ſhe is well acquainted, the three agree, that the wife and her gallant ſhall be found in ſuch a ſituation, as to warrant a <hi>ſuit for divorce;</hi> which is immediately commenced—the parties are ſeparated—and the lady trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly led to the altar by her para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>This is, in my humble opinion, the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of improvement in this way. Any attempts to change the ſyſtem henceforward, muſt proceed in a retrogade direction. I am loſt in aſtoniſhment and admiration at this important ſecret, reſerved for this age of diſcovery. What ineſtimable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences it muſt have, in a <hi>political
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030158_0034_0FE4B1430720BCD0"/>
moral,</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> point of view, is very evident to even a Baeotian capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p>One of the good effects of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſyſtem, which had almoſt eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my notice, is the encouragement it will afford to the <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> ſtate of <hi>celibacy,</hi> which has ſo often miſtakenly been the object of legiſlative vengeance, among nations of <hi>contracted</hi> manners. Many jealous pated fellows, who are incapable of ſacrificing their <hi>ſqueamiſh</hi> ſentiments at the ſhrine of faſhion, will doubtleſs be fearful of embarking on the hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal ocean, left,
<note place="bottom">A brace of proud antlers their brows 'ſhould adorn.'</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:030158_0035_0FE4B145865EEF88"/>
And thus we ſhall have a hardy race of bachelors, ready for any <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> their fair country-women may impoſe on them. The <hi>advantages</hi> ariſing hence, are too ſelf-evident to require illuſtration. Many married men of my acquaintance can bear <hi>feeling</hi> teſtimony on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>It is a diſtreſſing reflection to me, that I know not to whom the <hi>credit</hi> of introducing this faſhion is juſtly due. Were I acquainted with the parties, I ſhould pay them that tribute of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> which their conduct ſo richly deſerves. But an enlightened poſterity, while enjoying the benefits of this new ſyſtem, will not be unmindful of them. Their
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030158_0036_0FE4B148B2A2DC30"/>
reputation will ſurvive to the lateſt times. They will be claſſed with the <hi>exalted,</hi> characters of other nations, who have had the undaunted reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deſy the ſhafts of ridicule and ſatire, and ſpurn the ſhackles of ſhame, religion, morals, and manners.</p>

               <p>I HAVE read in your ſecond number the ironical defence of the prevalent faſhion in high life, of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands not appearing in public with their wives. This faſhion, which deſerves the utmoſt reprobation, is pregnant with more and greater evils,

than almoſt any other known in our country. I am happy you have ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted on it—and hope it will, by the efforts of our writers, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from theſe ſtates.</p>
               <p>I beg leave to communicate to you a ſtory, for the truth of which I pledge myſelf. It will place in a ſtriking light the conſequences to be dreaded from this pernicious cuſtom, which we have but lately imported from the old world.

Maria Arnold was the daughter of a reſpectable merchant at Hartford, in Connecticut, and was, by bounteous providence, endowed with every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of head and heart, that could qualify her to act in the moſt exalted ſtation. When arrived at ſixteen years of age, her hand was ſought after by numbers of the firſt rate characters in the city. Among the reſt was Mr. Henry Winthrop, an eminent merchant, whoſe congeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of diſpoſition ſoon acquired her eſteem and regard. After an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of a year, ſhe received him on the footing of a lover; and in ſome months afterwards, they were
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030158_0040_0FE4B154C8FC7210"/>
happily united together, at the hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal altar.</p>
               <p>Become the wife of Mr. Winthrop, her virtues had a more extenſive ſphere of action—and expanded into the warmeſt affection for her huſband—tenderneſs for her children (of whom ſhe preſented one to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band every thirteen or fourteen months)—charity and regard for her domeſtics—benevolence and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the circle of her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>When ſhe was in her twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeventh year, the happy mother of ſix children, eſteemed and reſpected by all who knew her—beloved by her huſband and children, the late war
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030158_0041_0FE4B1565CF59AD0"/>
broke out by the fatal engagement at Lexington. Mr. Winthrop, attached to the Britiſh government, and accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to look up to Great Britain with awe and reverence, could not reliſh the idea of reſiſting her power, which he regarded as a political ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. He determined to make ſale of his property, and retire to England. This deſign he ſpeedily carried into execution—and arrived there early in the year 1777.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſſed of an immenſe fortune—fond of high life—and allured by the attractions of the faſhionable world, he commenced a career of gaiety and diſſipation. The mutual attachment between him and his wife, which had
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030158_0042_0FE4B158E1843B10"/>
ſubſiſted uninterruptedly, and had indeed acquired new force every year of their connection, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in this country, was gradually weakened by the courſe of life they led in London. On his arrival, he paid the ſame kind of attention to his beloved partner, that he had been accuſtomed to. But he was told that it was a mere bore for a married man to gallant his wife—that he would be conſidered as a moſt unfaſhionable monſter, ſhould he be ſeen in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in public—and that any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of fondneſs for her, if diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would ſubject him to the ſneers and ſcorn of his acquaintance.</p>

Theſe leſſons he found it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to digeſt. His ardent love could not brook ſuch diſguiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. For a long time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he remained unfaſhionable in this particular, and in ſometimes bringing his children into company. But as inceſſant exhortations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant ridicule will turn almoſt any mortal from a purpoſe, however fixed; he at length gave way to faſhion, and as cautiouſly avoided his wife's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in public, as he would the ſociety of one of the furies.</p>
               <p>Among the gentlemen who beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their cares and attentions on Mrs. Winthrop, whoſe beauty ſhone with moſt diſtinguiſhed luſtre, was Sir Joſeph
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030158_0044_0FE4B15FA5DDA638"/>
Middleton, a man whoſe ſole rule of conduct was the refined ſubtle ſyſtem of Cheſterfield. He had, on the plan of his maſter, ſacrificed largely to the graces; and his ſacrifices had not been in vain. To the attractions of a fine perſon, and enchanting addreſs, he added a moſt refined and highly cultivated underſtanding. He had travelled—and engrafted the moſt elegant of the manners of France and Italy on thoſe of England. Had not his heart been depraved by the ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of faſhion, he would have been an incomparable character. But into moſt of the vices of the times he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered—more, however, from a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030158_0045_0FE4B1612F07DF08"/>
to be a faſhionable man, than from the impulſe of inclination.</p>
               <p>From the moment that Sir Joſeph ſingled out Mrs. Winthrop as the object of his gallantry, ſhe rejected the reſt of the ſurrounding crowd. To Vaux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, to plays, to aſſemblies, to court, he daily led her, and, before many months had elapſed, almoſt entirely eradicated from her mind every trace of love or affection for her huſband.</p>
               <p>still was ſhe virtuous even in thought. She did not know, or allow herſelf to believe, the hold Sir Joſeph daily gained on her affections. He ſaw clearly, that to proceed with any hopes of ſucceſs, it would be neceſſary to proceed with caution. Had he, in
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030158_0046_0FE4B163E163A738"/>
an early ſtage of their acquaintance, even hinted at his real intentions, ſhe would have ſpurned him from her with the moſt profound diſdain and contempt. But this he carefully avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, until he was fully aſſured of his conqueſt. When this was the caſe, he only lay in wait for an opportunity to perpetrate his black deſigns.</p>
               <p>And here, Mr. Obſerver, allow me to pauſe for a moment, and recal your attention to the former ſituation of this lovely but falling angel. When poſſeſſed of virtue, ſhe would have been an ornament to a throne—for as the poet juſtly obſerves,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030158_0047_0FE4B167585913F8"/>
                  <q>
                     <l>Virtue is beauty—but when charms of mind,</l>
                     <l>With elegance of outward form are join'd—</l>
                     <l>When youth makes ſuch bright objects ſtill more bright—</l>
                     <l>And fortune ſets them in the ſtrongeſt light—</l>
                     <l>'Tis all below of heaven we may view,</l>
                     <l>And all but adoration is their due.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But now her mind is in part depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved—the remainder of Sir Joſeph's vile triumph will coſt him little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>One night at a maſquerade ball, he artfully prevailed on her to drink pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty freely of an intoxicating cordial, which, aided by the heat and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her blood, occaſioned by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030158_0048_0FE4B16A845279D0"/>
dancing, ſoon aſcended her head, and deprived her of her faculties. On her return homewards, he gave the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man directions to ſtop at the houſe of an infamous miniſter of his pleaſures. Here, taking advantage of her helpleſs ſituation, and vowing eternal love and ſecrecy, he robbed her of that ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable jewel, which no tears, no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can ever reſtore to loſt, undone woman.</p>
               <p>Sunk now into the depths of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſhe felt, for a time, the keeneſt remorſe for the crime ſhe had been guilty of. But Sir Joſeph took too much pains, not to remove her anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Frequent repetitions rendered her ſo callous and unconcerned, that
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030158_0049_0FE4B16C0CB68828"/>
her guilt ſoon became public, and at length reached Mr. Winthrop's ears. This rouſed him from the lethargy into which his blind purſuit of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous faſhion had thrown him. By the agency of a truſty ſervant, he gained information of an aſſignation between them. He went to the place, and was on the point of ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, but, notwithſtanding all his vigilance, a confidante of his wife's gave her notice of his approach, ſo early as juſt to allow Sir Joſeph time to eſcape by a back window. However, he left behind him his hat and part of his clothes, which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient proofs of his villainy, and of the guilt of Mrs. Winthrop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:030158_0050_0FE4B16F859D8000"/>
The injured huſband, in the firſt moments of his rage, was on the point of ſacrificing her to his juſt reſentment. But an inſtant's reflection made him determine not to imbrue his hands in female blood. He reſolved to take vengeance of the adulterer—and next morning ſent him a challenge, which was accepted. They met. They fought. Mr. Winthrop received a mortal wound—and expired, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſorrow at having launched into ſuch a ſcene of diſſipation, which had deſtroyed his happineſs—blaſted his wife's reputation irretrievably—and hurried himſelf into an untimely grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:030158_0051_0FE4B1710D844808"/>
This dreadful cataſtrophe nearly brought her to a ſenſe of her infamy.—She caſt a retroſpective eye on the ſcenes which ſhe had paſſed through—ſhe bewailed the deplorable gulph in which ſhe was ſwallowed up—and made many ſtrong reſolutions of reformation, which, for a ſhort time, ſhe endeavoured to carry into effect. But Sir Joſeph renewed his efforts to replunge her into her former condition. For a time he was unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. But at length, when the poignancy of her grief was ſomewhat abated, and her contrition propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably diminiſhed, ſhe liſtened again to his inſinuations—and was prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to accept the hand of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030158_0052_0FE4B175516304F0"/>
murderer of her huſband, who now calls her his. They are immerſed in all the ſcenes of profligacy and vice, which the capital of England affords—and I think you will allow, they furniſh an awful leſſon of the danger of adopting modiſh manners, and of departing from the paths of honour and rectitude.</p>

            <p>—"Is this, good God!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed I, "is this freedom? Is this what we have been ſo long contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for? Is this the fruit of a ſeven

years war? Farewell to heaven-born Liberty!"—</p>
            <p>A cynical old man, who ſat in a corner, his eyes half ſhut, and envelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the ſmoke which he emitted from his mouth, in large volumes, knocking the duſt out of his pipe, and ſtaring me ſtedfaſtly in the face, aſked me if I had read Sidney, Locke, Price, or any of the other celebrated writers on the ſubject of liberty, and if I underſtood what was the real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the word? My mind being ſomewhat untuned, and not chooſing to enter the liſts of controverſy with a genius who had ſo forbidding an appearance as that which preſented itſelf to my view, I replied in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030158_0055_0FE4B17CD9444300"/>
He then entered into a moſt elaborate diſquiſition on the nature of liberty—ſaid that ſelf-taxation was its very ſum and eſſence—and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in a moſt copious and fluent harangue, when, wiſhing to indulge a little reflection, I called the waiter, deſired him to pay himſelf out of a dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, for the coffee I had juſt drank—wiſhed the haranguer a good day—and returned home—</p>
            <p>Here, when I became a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, I endeavoured to picture to my imagination the numbers who muſt inevitably taſte of <hi>the bitter cup of miſery</hi> "by virtue of this act." Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures, vendues, impriſonments, croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my mind without end—While
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030158_0056_0FE4B180378E2B00"/>
I was in this ſympathetic frame of thought, the caſe of an unfortunate ſoldier, my boſom friend, my Pylades, ſuggeſted itſelf to my perturbed imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>My Pylades, as I uſed to call him, in return for the name of Oreſtes, with which he honoured me, had borne the fatigues and hardſhips, the hunger and thirſt, of a ſeven years war—had been in almoſt all the principal engagements—had been ſeveral times taken priſoner, and put on board guard-ſhips, where he experienced what would have deſtroyed perhaps any other man—In all theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcenes, theſe viciſſtudes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030158_0057_0FE4B181C3E99258"/>
he had conducted himſelf with a heroiſm, a magnanimity, which would put to ſhame the vounted fables of antiquity—After having undergone all this, he had, a few days previous to the termination of the war, fallen in defence of that country, whoſe rights and liberties he prized more than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence itſelf.—A tender ſpouſe and ſix liſping children, the eldeſt not eight years old, would, in a ſhort ſpace, have been bleſt with his preſence, had not a ſiend, in ſhape of an Indian, cut ſhort his precious life—</p>
            <p>Iſabella, ill fated Iſabella, the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all his joys, and ſolace of all his cares, was panting in hourly expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his long wiſhed for return:—
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030158_0058_0FE4B18541963060"/>
her tender heart throbbed with every breath of wind, and the ſmalleſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which flattered her with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive hope of embracing once more the lord of her ſoul;—never! never! to be realized!—</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding every poſſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution was taken to prepare her for the direful news, in order to avoid the conſequences to be feared from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſcloſure of her woe, ſhe ſunk lifeleſs on her couch, when the luck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs tidings reached her ear, doomed never to hear a ſound of joy!—One fit followed cloſe on the heels of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for two days ſucceſſively—and at length, the extreme violence of her grief having ſomewhat ſubſided, ſhe fell
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030158_0059_0FE4B186C9B7C718"/>
into that ſtate of torpor and apathy, which too often ſucceeds the paroxyſms of madneſs and deſpair.</p>
            <p>Her only not-adored Pylades had expended the little patrimony he was in poſſeſſion of, in ſupport of the cauſe of freedom and America—She was therefore left, in every ſenſe of the word, deſolate; and the ſmall proviſion ſhe was entitled to, as a recompenſe for his ſervices, was totally inadequate to the ſupport of herſelf and tender offspring!—</p>
            <p>And perhaps, ſays I, in ſome ſhort time hence, the amiable, the engaging Iſabella, with accompliſhments to adorn a crown, and to ſoften and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize barbarity itſelf in human ſhape,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030158_0060_0FE4B18B64D11450"/>
perhaps ſhe ſhall feel the relentleſs hand of ſome harpy catchpole, "by virtue of the funding bill"—The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly train of reflection into which this threw me, made me ſink into a reverie, in which I conceived Iſabella was aſſeſſed at a ſum, trivial indeed to perſons in affluence, but enormous to her—I beheld her borne down by the weight of affliction, lying on the bed of ſickneſs, without a being to adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comfort to her, except her dear children, the only objects of her care, on whom ſhe caſt many a wiſhful eye, recommending them to the care of her omnipotent Creator—</p>
            <p>Thus afflicted, thus ſorlorn, thus woe begone, a man of uncouth form, in the guiſe of a COLLECTOR, made
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030158_0061_0FE4B18CEC210328"/>
his appearance—"Madam," he ſays, " I come for ten dollars, the ſum at which you have been aſſeſſed by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a late act of aſſembly"—With faultering accents, and pallid counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſhe articulated an aſſurance, that "if her life was at ſtake for a tenth of that ſum, ſhe muſt incur the forſeit"—Well, madam," ſaid he, "with a perfect <hi>ſang froid,</hi> dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt ferocious look at the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken mourner, you muſt abide the conſequences."</p>
            <p>After a tedious interval of forty days, the collector made his return to a juſtice of peace, who directly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enquiry, iſſued his warrant to a conſtable to diſtreſs and diſtrain, and
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030158_0062_0FE4B18F6AD39F80"/>
in default, to take the body of the DELINQUENT into cuſtody—</p>
            <p>Methought I beheld this ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted conſtable poſſeſs himſelf of every article the houſe contained—while Iſabella lay diſſolved in a trance into which his unſeaſonable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and rough, ſavage behaviour had caſt her—the two eldeſt of her young ones, wailing and lamenting around her, and the others gazing, with childiſh aſtoniſhment, at a ſcene, the horrors of which they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally incapable of conceiving.</p>
            <p>A few days after ſeizure, a public vendue converted her little furniture to money, but ſo deſtitute had ſhe been, that there was a deficiency in
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030158_0063_0FE4B192E4D594A8"/>
the ſum at which ſhe had been aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.—</p>
            <p>My heart ſunk within me, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the dreadful cataſtrophe, which cloſed the melancholy trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:—</p>
            <p>The conſtable, with a poſſe, came and ſeized the unfortunate delinquent! He dragged her, half dead with afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſtreſs, and deſpair, through the ſtreets, to a loathſome jail. Here ſhe was reduced to have recourſe to a bed of ſtraw! She, who had been accuſtomed to the endearments, the care, the attention, of a fond, an ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing huſband, whoſe chief ſtudy had been to anticipate her every wiſh, was now, ſad reverſe! without a being to

hand her a draught of water, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the burning heart of a fever, which had ſeized and was preying on her—And in a few days, DEATH came to her relief, and called away her ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſoul, to thoſe regions of never-end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs, which God has prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thoſe he loves. Her breath was cloſed in prayers for her infants, and for the forgiveneſs of her perſecutors!</p>
            <p>Gracious Power! (ejaculated I) that watcheſt over the tranſactions of this ſublunary world, how many ſuch ſcenes will a ſhort time realize, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in every corner of the ſtate!—Is the "aſylum" which, we fondly ſlattered ourſelves, had been prepared "for the diſtreſſed and perſecuted of

"all nations," deſtroyed?—Is the pleaſing illuſion vaniſhed? Have we been but dreaming of felicity, and do we now awake to mere <hi>"vanity and "vexation of ſpirit?"</hi>—Have we all this while been but making a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from one tyranny to another—And is there to be no freedom, no happineſs, this ſide the grave!</p>

            <head>[From the Columbian Magazine, Sept. 1786.] SKETCH of the Life of the late NATHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIEL GREENE, Major General of the Forces of the United States of America.</head>
            <p>THIS gallant officer, whoſe death is ſo generally and ſo juſtly regretted, was born in the town of Warwick, Kent county, Rhode-Iſland, in or about the year 1741, and was the ſecond ſon of a reſpectable citizen of the ſame name, (deſcended from one of the firſt ſettlers of the colony) who was extenſively concerned in lucrative iron-works, the property of which, at his death, (prior to the war) he left to his children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:030158_0067_0FE4B19DE6E5B3E0"/>
The General was endowed with an uncommon degree of judgment and penetration, which, with a benevolent manner and aſſable behaviour, acquired him a number of valuable friends, by whoſe intereſt and influence, he was, at an early period of life, choſen a member of the aſſembly of the then colony of Rhode-Iſland. This truſt, in which he gave the higheſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his conſtituents, he continued to poſſeſs, until, and at, the period, when the folly and madneſs of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſevered a world from her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>After the ſkirmiſhes at Lexington and Concord, when a ſpirit of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſpread, like wild-fire, over the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030158_0068_0FE4B1A146F1ADF0"/>
continent, Rhode-iſland was not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in her contributions for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral defence. She raiſed three regiments of militia, the command whereof was given to Mr. Greene, who was nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated brigadier-general. The liberty, ſafety, and proſperity of his country being expoſed to imminent danger, the pacific principles of quakeriſm, in which he had been educated, proved inſufficient to repreſs the ardent ſpirit of liberty with which his boſom glowed.</p>
            <p>He led the troops under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to Cambridge, and was preſent at the evacuation of Boſton by a force which, in England had been vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtated as treble the number that
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030158_0069_0FE4B1A2D003C6F8"/>
would be requiſite to dragoon America into unconditional ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>General Greene's merit and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well in the council as in the field, were not long unnoticed by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington, who repoſed in him the utmoſt confidence, and paid a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deference to his advice and opinion, on all occaſions of doubt and difficulty. This excited the jealouſy of ſeveral officers, of older date and higher rank, who were not wanting in endeavours to ſupplant him: but in vain—the commander in chief knew and prized his worth as it deſerved.</p>
            <p>He was appointed major-general by congreſs, the 26th of Auguſt, 1776. Towards the cloſe of that year, he
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030158_0070_0FE4B1A550392320"/>
was at the Trenton ſuprize; and, at the beginning of the next, was at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Princeton, two enterprizes not more happily planned than judiciouſly and bravely executed, in both of which he diſplayed his talents, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his noviciate under the American Fabius.</p>
            <p>At the battle of Brandywine, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Greene diſtinguiſhed himſelf by ſupporting the right wing of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army, when it gave way, and judiciouſly covering the whole, when routed and retreating in confuſion; and their ſafety from utter ruin was gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally aſcribed to his ſkill and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were well ſeconded by the troops under his command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:030158_0071_0FE4B1A7D1280760"/>
At the battle of Germantown, he commanded the left wing of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army—and his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were exerted to retreive the fortune of that day, in which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct met with the approbation of the commander in chief.</p>
            <p>In March, 1778, he was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quarter-maſter general, which office he accepted under a ſtipulation that his rank in the army ſhould not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it, and that he ſhould retain his right to command in time of action, according to his rank and ſeniority.</p>
            <p>In this ſtation, he fully anſwered the expectations formed of his abilities; and enabled the American army to

move with additional celerity and vigour.</p>
            <p>At the battle of Monmouth, the commander in chief, diſguſted with the behaviour of general Lee, depoſed him in the field of battle, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed general Greene to command the right wing, where he greatly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to retrieve the errors of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and to the ſubſequent event of the day.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the year 1778, an attack being planned by the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, in conjunction with the French fleet, on the Britiſh garriſon at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, Rhode-iſland, general Sullivan was appointed to the command, under whom general Greene ſerved. This
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030158_0073_0FE4B1ADD5B3F438"/>
attempt was unſucceſsful. The French fleet having failed out of harbour, to engage lord Howe's fleet, they were diſperſed by a ſtorm, and the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans were obliged to raiſe the ſiege of Newport; in doing which general Greene diſplayed a great degree of ſkill in drawing off the army in ſafety.</p>
            <p>After the hopes of the Britiſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to execute ſome deciſive ſtroke to the northward, were fruſtrated, they turned their attention to the ſouthern ſtates, as leſs capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and more likely to reward the invaders with ample plunder. A grand expedition was, in conſequence, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at New-York, where the army embarked on the 26th of December,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030158_0074_0FE4B1B056AB5840"/>
1779, and landed on the 11th of February, 1780, within about thirty miles of Charleſton, which, after a brave defence, was ſurrendered to Sir Henry Clinton, on the 12th of May.</p>
            <p>A ſeries of ill ſucceſs followed this unfortunate event. The American arms in South Carolina were in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unſucceſful, and the inhabitants were obliged to ſubmit to the invaders, whoſe impolitic ſeverity was extremely ill calculated to anſwer any of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for which the war had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced.</p>
            <p>Affairs were thus cicurmſtanced, when general Waſhington appointed general Greene to the command of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030158_0075_0FE4B1B3D36BAE00"/>
the American forces in the ſouthern diſtrict. He arrived at Charlotte, on the ſecond day of December, 1780, accompained by gen. Morgan, a brave officer, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf to the northward, in the expedition againſt Burgoyne. He found the forces he was to command, reduced to a very ſmall number, by defeat and by deſertion. The returns were nine hundred and ſeventy continentals, and one thouſand and thirteen militia. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſtores, proviſions, forage, and all things neceſſary, were, if poſſible, in a more reduced ſtate than his army. His men were without pay, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without clothing; and ſupplies of the latter were not to be had but from
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030158_0076_0FE4B1B6CE2C1128"/>
a diſtance of two hundred miles. In this perilous and embarraſſed ſituation, he had to oppoſe a reſpectable and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious army. Fortunately for him, the conduct of ſome of the friends of royalty obliged numbers, otherwiſe diſpoſed to remain neuter, to take up arms in their own defence. This and the prudent meaſures the general took for removing the innumerable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſadvantages he was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and for conciliating the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the inhabitants, ſoon brought together a conſiderable force, far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erior, however, to that of the Britiſh, who eſteemed the country perfectly ſubjugated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:030158_0077_0FE4B1B8588C7838"/>
After he had recruited his forces, with all the friends to the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he could aſſemble, he ſent a conſiderable detachment, under gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Morgan, to the weſtern extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſtate, to protect the well diſpoſed inhabitants from the ravages of the tories. This force, which was the firſt that had for a conſiderable time appeared there, on the ſide of the Americans, inſpired the friends of liberty with new courage, ſo that numbers of them crowded to the ſtandard of general Morgan. He at length became ſo formidable, that lord Cornwallis thought proper to ſend colonel Tarleton to diſlodge him from the ſtation he had taken.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030158_0078_0FE4B1BADC9DBEA0"/>
This officer was at the head of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand regular troops, and had two field pieces. He came up, on the 17th of January, 1781, at a place called Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, with general Morgan, whoſe force was much inferior, and was compoſed of two-thirds militia, and one-third continentals. An engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the immediate conſequence.</p>
            <p>The brevity of this ſketch will not permit me to go into a detail of the diſpoſitions made on either ſide. Let it ſuffice to ſay, that the brave Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan gained a complete victory over an officer, the rapidity and ſucceſs of whoſe attacks, until that time, might have entitled him to make uſe of the declaration of Caeſar, <hi>"veni, vidi,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030158_0079_0FE4B1BD60E72FF0"/>
vici."</hi> Upwards of five hundred of the Britiſh laid down their arms, and were made priſoners—a very conſiderable number was killed. Eight hundred ſtands of arms, two field-pieces, and thirty-five baggage-waggons fell into the hands of the victors, who had only twelve killed, and ſixty wounded.</p>
            <p>This brilliant ſucceſs quite diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed the plan of operations formed by lord Cornwallis. Having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no idea of any enemy to oppoſe in South Carolina, the conqueſt of which he had deemed complete, he had made every preparation for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arms to the northward, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the laurels, which he imagined awaited for him. He now found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030158_0080_0FE4B1C0D8FAF178"/>
obliged to poſtpone this deſign. He marched with rapidity after general Morgan, in hopes not only to recover the priſoners, but to revenge Tarle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;s loſſes. The Americans, by a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of movements, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of providence,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Britiſh urged the purſuit with ſo much rapidity, that they came to the ford of the Catawba on the evening of the ſame day on which the Americans had croſſed it. Before the next day, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy fall of rain rendered it impaſſable.—Had it riſen a few hours earlier, the Americans would have had no chance of eſcape, and their priſoners would have been retaken by the enemy. Some time after, the ſame providential interference took palce in paſſing the Yadkin. A ſudden and rapid riſe, after the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans had croſſed, prevented lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis from getting over. [Vide Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, Vol. II p.206, 208.]</note> eluded his
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030158_0081_0FE4B1C373976D90"/>
efforts, and general Greene effected a junction of the two diviſions of his little army, on the 7th of February. Still was he ſo far inferior to lord Cornwallis, that he was obliged to retreat northward, and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vigilance and activity of his enemy, he brought his men in ſafety into Virginia.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate he received ſome rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements, and had the promiſe of more—on which he returned again into North Carolina, where, on their arrival, he hoped to be able to act on the offenſive. He encamped in the vicinity of lord Cornwallis's army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—By a variety of the beſt concerted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvres, and by the ſecrecy and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030158_0082_0FE4B1C5F4E240F8"/>
promptitude of his motions, he ſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly ſupported the arrangement of his troops, that during three weeks, while the enemy remained near him, he prevented them from taking any advantage of their ſuperiority, and even cut off all opportunity of their receiving ſuccours from the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of March, he effected a junction with a continental regiment, and two conſiderable bodies of Virginia and Carolina militia. He then determined on attacking the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh commander without loſs of time, being perſuaded," as he declared in his ſubſequent diſpatches, <q>that if he was ſucceſsful, it would prove
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030158_0083_0FE4B1C8737923A8"/>
ruinous to the enemy—and, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that it would be but a partial evil to him.</q> On the 14th he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Guilford court-houſe, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh then lying at twelve miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>His army conſiſted of about four thouſand five hundred men, of whom near two thirds were North Carolina and Virginia militia. The Britiſh were about two thouſand four hundred, all regular troops, and the greater part inured to toil and ſervice in their long expedition under lord Cornwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, who, on the morning of the 15th, being apprized of general Greene's intentions, marched to meet him. The latter diſpoſed his army in three
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030158_0084_0FE4B1CCB47FF4E8"/>
lines; the militia of North Caroilna were in front—the ſecond line was compoſed of thoſe of Virginia,—and the third, which was the flower of the army, was formed of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal troops, near fifteen hundred in number. They were flanked on both ſides by cavalry and riflemen, and were poſted on a riſing ground, a mile and a half from Guilford Court Houſe.</p>
            <p>The engagement commenced at half an hour after one o'clock by a briſk cannonade. After which the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh advanced in three columns, and attacked the firſt line, compoſed, as has been obſerved, of North Carolina militia. Theſe, who, probably, had
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030158_0085_0FE4B1CE400CD910"/>
never been in action before, were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic ſtruck at the approach of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and many of them ran away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firing a gun, or being fired upon, and even before the Britiſh had come nearer than 140 yards to them. Part of them, however, fired, but they then followed the example of their comrades. Their officers made every poſſible effort to rally them—but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the advantages of their poſition, nor any other conſideration, could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to maintain their ground. This ſhameful cowardice had a great effect upon the iſſue of the battle. The next line, however, behaved much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They fought with great bravery; and after they were thrown into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030158_0086_0FE3FABE55061868"/>
rallied, returned to the charge, and kept up a heavy fire for a long time, but were at length broken, and driven on the third line, when the engagement became general, very ſevere, and very bloody. At length, ſuperiority of diſcipline carried the day from ſuperiority of numbers. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict endured an hour and a half, and was terminated by general Greene's ordering a retreat, when he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the enemy were on the point of encircling his troops.</p>
            <p>This was a hard fought action. Lord Cornwallis ſtated his loſſes in killed, wounded, and miſſing, at 532, among whom were ſeveral officers of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable rank. To thoſe who are uſed
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030158_0087_0FE4B1D0C3EAEE00"/>
to conſider the thouſands killed in the plains of Germany, very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without producing any viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence on the fate of a war, the number here mentioned muſt appear inſignificant. But this battle was, nevertheleſs, deciſive in its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Lord Cornwallis was, three days after, obliged to make a retrograde motion, and to return to Wilmington, ſituated two hundred miles from the place of action. He was even under the neceſſity of abandoning a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of thoſe who were moſt dangerouſly wounded.</p>
            <p>The loſs of the Americans was about four hundred killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. However, this was not ſo ſeverely
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030158_0088_0FE4B207B7807F00"/>
felt, as the deſertion of a conſiderable number of militia, who fled home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and came no more near the army.</p>
            <p>Some time after this engagement, general Greene determined to return to South-Carolina, to endeavour to expel the Britiſh from that ſtate. His firſt object was to attempt the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Camden, where lord Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was poſted with about nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men. The ſtrength of this place, which was covered on the ſouth and eaſt ſides by a river and a creek, and to the weſtward and northward, by ſix redoubts, rendered it impracticable to carry it by ſtorm, with the ſmall army general Greene had, conſiſting of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030158_0089_0FE4B1D345522308"/>
about ſeven hundred continentals. He, therefore, encamped at about a mile from the town, in order to prevent ſupplies from being brought in, and to take advantage of ſuch favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as might occur.</p>
            <p>Lord Rawdon's ſituation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely delicate. Colonel Watſon, whom he had ſome time before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached for the protection of the eaſtern frontiers, and to whom he had, on intelligence of general Greene's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſent orders to return to Camden, was ſo effectually watched by general Marian, that it was impoſſible for him to obey. His lordſhip's ſupplies were, moreover, very precarious:—and,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030158_0090_0FE4B1D79001BB88"/>
ſhould general Greene's reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments arrive, he might be ſo cloſely inveſted, as to be at length obliged to ſurrender. In this dilemma, the beſt expedient that ſuggeſted itſelf, was a bold attack; for which purpoſe he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his muſicians and drummers, and every perſon capable of carrying a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. He ſallied out on the twenty-fifth of April, and attacked general Greene in his camp. The defence was obſtinate, and, for ſome part of the engagement, the advantage appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in favour of America.—Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant colonel Waſhington, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the cavarly, had at one time not leſs than two hundred Britiſh pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. However, by the miſconduct
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030158_0091_0FE4B1D918F655C8"/>
of one of the American regiments, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was ſnatched from general Greene, who was compelled to retreat. He loſt in the action about two hundred kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, wounded, and priſoners.—Lord Rawdon loſt two hundred and fifty eight.</p>
            <p>There was a great ſimilarity between the conſequences of the affair at Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and thoſe of this action. In the former, lord Cornwallis was ſucecſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful—but was obliged to retreat two hundred miles from the ſcene of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for a time abandon the grand object of penetrating to the north <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ard. In the latter, lord Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don had the honour of the field, but was ſhortly after reduced to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030158_0092_0FE4B1DB99457B80"/>
of abandoning his poſt, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him a number of ſick and wounded.</p>
            <p>The evacuation of Camden, with the vigilance of general Greene, and of the ſeveral officers he employed, gave a new face to affairs in South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, where the Britiſh aſcendency declined more repidly than it had been eſtabliſhed. The numerous forts, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned by the enemy, fell, one after the other, into the hands of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans. Orangeburg, Motte, Watſon, Georgetown, Granby, and all the others, ſort Ninety-ſix excepted, were ſurrendered; and a very conſiderable number of priſoners of war, with mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030158_0093_0FE4B1DE1EE2D470"/>
ſtores and artillery, were found in them.</p>
            <p>On the 22nd of May, general Greene ſat down before Ninety-ſix, with the main part of his little army. The ſiege was carried on for a conſiderable time with great ſpirit: and the place was defended with equal bravery. At length, the works were ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that a ſurrender muſt have been made in a few days, when a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement, of three regiments, from Europe, arrived at Charleſton, which enabled lord Rawdon to proceed to relieve this important poſt. The ſuperiority of the enemy's force, reduced general Greene to the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native of abandoning the ſiege altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030158_0094_0FE4B1E244BE1C80"/>
or, previous to their arrival, of attempting the fort by ſtorm. The latter was more agreeable to his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſpirit: and an attack was made on the morning of the 29th of June. He was repulſed, with the loſs of one hundred and fifty men. He raiſed the ſiege, and retreated over the Saluda.</p>
            <p>Dr. Ramſay, to whom the writer of this ſketch is indebted, for moſt of the facts herein contained, ſpeaking of the ſtate of affairs about this period, ſays,—"truly diſtreſſing was the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the American army: when in the graſp of victory, to be obliged to expoſe themſelves to a hazardous aſſault, and afterwards to abandon the ſiege: when they were nearly maſters
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030158_0095_0FE4B1E3CCD04218"/>
of the whole country, to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to retreat to its extremity: after ſubduing the greateſt part of the force ſent againſt them, to be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of encountering ſtill greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcements, when their remote ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation precluded them from the hope of receiving a ſingle recruit—in this gloomy ſituation, there were not wanting perſons who adviſed general Greene to leave the ſtate, and retire with his remaining forces to Virginia. To arguments and ſuggeſtions of this kind he nobly replied—'I will reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the country, or die in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.' This diſtinguiſhed officer, whoſe genius was moſt vigorous in thoſe extremities, when feeble minds
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030158_0096_0FE4B1E682E7BE70"/>
abandon themſelves to deſpair, adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the only reſource, now left him, of avoiding an engagement, until the Britiſh force ſhould be divided."</p>
            <p>Some ſkirmiſhes, of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, took place between detached parties of both armies in July and Auguſt. September the 9th, general Greene having aſſembled about two thouſand men, proceeded to attack the Britiſh, who, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of col. Stewart, were poſted at Eutaw Springs. The American force was drawn up in two lines: the firſt, compoſed of Carolina militia, was commanded by generals Marian and Pickens, and col. De Malmedy.—The ſecond, which conſiſted of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030158_0097_0FE4B1E9F64F3E78"/>
troops from North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by general Sumpter, lieut. col. Campbell, and colonel Williams; lieutenant-colonel Lee, with his legion, covered the right flank; and lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-colonel Henderſon, with the ſtate troops, covered the left. A corps de reſerve was formed of the cavalry, under lieutenant-colonel Waſhington, and the Delaware troops under capt. Kirkwood. As the Americans came forward to the attack, they fell in with ſome advanced parties of the enemy, at about two or three miles a-head of the main body. Theſe being cloſely purſued, were driven back—and the action ſoon became general.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030158_0098_0FE4B1ECF18108E0"/>
The militia were at length forced to give way, but were bravely ſupported by the ſecond line. In the hotteſt part of the engagement, gen. Greene ordered the Maryland and Virginia continentals to charge with trailed arms. This decided the fate of the day. "Nothing," ſays dr. Ramſay, "could ſurpaſs the intrepidity of both officers and men on this occaſion.—They ruſhed on, in good order, thro' a heavy cannonade, and a ſhower of muſquetry, with ſuch unſhaken reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that they bore down all before them." The Britiſh were broken, cloſely purſued, and upwards of five hundred of them taken priſoners—They however made a freſh ſtand, in
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030158_0099_0FE4B1EE7A95F0A8"/>
a favourable poſition, in impenetrable ſhrubs and a picquetted garden. Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel Waſhington, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made every effort to diſlodge them, was wounded and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. Four ſix pounders were brought forward to play upon them, but they fell into their hands; and the endeavours to drive them from their ſtation being found impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Americans retired, leaving a ſtrong piequet on the field of battle. Their loſs was about five hundred; that of the Britiſh upwards of eleven hundred.</p>
            <p>General Greene was honoured by congreſs with a Britiſh ſtandard, and a gold medal, emblematical of the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030158_0100_0FE4B1F1020FA238"/>
engagement and ſucceſs, "for his wife, deciſive, and magnanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in the action at Eutaw ſprings, in which, with a force inferior in number to that of the enemy, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a moſt ſignal victory."</p>
            <p>In the evening of the ſucceeding day, colonel Stewart abandoned his poſt, and retreated towards Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, leaving behind upwards of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty of his wounded, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtands of arms. He was purſued a conſiderable diſtance—but in vain.</p>
            <p>The battle of Eutaw produced moſt ſignal conſequences in favour of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. The Britiſh, who had for ſuch a length of time lorded it abſolutely in South Carolina, were, ſhortly after
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030158_0101_0FE4B1F384B05910"/>
that event, obliged to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Charleſton, whence they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ventured but to make predatory excurſions, with bodies of cavalry, which in general met with a very warm and very unwelcome reception.</p>
            <p>During the relxation that followed, a dangerous plot was formed, by ſome turbulent and mutinous perſons in the army, to deliver up their brave gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Britiſh. This treaſonable deſign owed its riſe to the hardſhips, wants, and calamities of the ſoldiers, who were ill paid, ill clothed, and ill fed. The conſpirators did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed twelve in number: and a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſcovery defeated the project.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:030158_0102_0FE4B1F7FA48CAA8"/>
The ſurrender of lord Cornwallis, whoſe enterpriſing ſpirit had been by the Britiſh miniſtry expected to repair the loſſes, and wipe away the diſgrace, which had been incurred through the inactivity and indolence of other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, having convinced them of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of ſubjugating America, they diſcontinued offenſive operations in every quarter. From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year 1782, it was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently reported, that Charleſton was ſpeedily to be evaucated: it was offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially announced the ſeventh of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt; but did not take place until the ſeventeenth of December.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:030158_0103_0FE4B1F9867A0CF0"/>
The happy period at length arrived, when, by the virtue and bravery of her ſons, aided by the bounty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, America compelled her invaders to recogniſe her independence. Then her armies, quitted the tented fields, and retired to cultivate the arts of peace and happineſs. Among the reſt, general Greene reviſited his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, where he proved himſelf as valuable a citizen, as the Carolinas had witneſſed him a gallant officer. Diſſenſions and jealouſies had extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſtructive influence among the Rhode Iſlanders, whoſe animoſity had ariſen to ſuch a degree, as to threaten the moſt ſerious ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: general Greene exerted
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030158_0104_0FE4B1FC06743CA8"/>
himſelf to reſtore harmony and peace among them once more; and was happily ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>In October, 1785, he ſailed to Georgia, where he had a conſiderable eſtate, not far diſtant from Savannah. Here he paſſed away his time, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in his domeſtic concerns, until the hour of his mortality approached. Walking out one day in June 1786, he was overpowered by the extreme heat of the ſun, which brought on a diſorder that carried him off, a few days after, on the 19th of the ſame month.</p>
            <p>When the melancholy account of his death arrived at Savannah, the people were ſtruck with the deepeſt
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030158_0105_0FE4B1FE868C29A8"/>
ſorrow. All buſineſs was ſuſpended. The ſhops and ſtores throughout the town were ſhut: and the ſhipping in the harbour had their colours half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſted.</p>
            <p>The body was brought to Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, and interred on the 20th. The funeral proceſſion was attended by the Cincinnati, militia, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the interment of the corpſe, the members of the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnati retired to the coffee-houſe in Savannah, and came to the following reſolution:</p>

            <p>General Greene left behind him a wife, and five children, the eldeſt of whom was about 11 years old.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the 12th of Auguſt, the United States in Congreſs aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled came to the following reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>

            <p>AMIDST an exuberant variety of fanciful and new-fangled opinions, lately obtruded on the public, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with all the dexterity that caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry can afford, there is none more abſurd than that of thoſe perſons who decry and endeavour to prevent the migration of Europeans to America.

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030158_0113_0FE4B21405D4E3B0"/>
migration. Few, alas! are the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics of Europe: and from thoſe few, emigration is extremely rare. And it may be made a queſtion, whether the abject ſlaves or lordly ariſtocrats of Venice or Genoa, would be much more eligible perſons to naturalize here, than the <hi>"ſubjects of monarchies,"</hi> however deſpotic. Thoſe Germans to whom Pennſylvania owes ſo much with reſpect to agriculture, improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, induſtry, and opulence, were tranſplanted from the moſt deſpotic ſoils.

            <p>What then becomes of the random aſſertions of this writer? What end can he propoſe to anſwer but to divide the people of this country, and create diſſentions and ill blood between the old citizens, and thoſe who are on every occaſion ſpoken of with a kind of ſupercilious and impertinent oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy and contempt as <hi>new comers—new comers?</hi> Are not the unhappy diviſions between conſtitutionaliſts and republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030158_0115_0FE4B21A1E32AAC8"/>
enough to impede and prevent the welfare and happineſs of the ſtate? Muſt more diſtinctions and differences be created, in order to counteract the efforts of true patriots to promote the common good? The monitorial page of hiſtory warns mankind inceſſantly, to beware of the ſhoals and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands to be dreaded from inteſtine diviſions. The death-bed maxim of Micipſa, given to Jugurtha, "By unanimity weak ſtates gather ſtrength; by diſcord, powerful ones fall to ruin," has been wiſely adopted as the motto of the United Provinces, and is equally applicable to the United States. To what was owing the fall of Carthage, of mighty Rome, of Mexico, of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030158_0116_0FE4B21C9E603AD8"/>
Peru? To inteſtine diviſions. What fixed the power of the Macedonians in Greece?—What eſtabliſhed the Romans in Greece, in Gaul, in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and in almoſt all their conqueſts? What ſubjected Wales and Ireland to England? What crowned Henry the fifth of England in Paris? What proſtrated China to the Tartars? What enabled three royal robbers to plunder Poland, and to ſtrip it of ſome of its moſt valuable territories, and five millions of people? The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine diviſions of the inhabitants of thoſe various countries. In ſine, let hiſtory be carefully examined, and it will appear, that few empires, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſtates, or republics, have ever
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030158_0117_0FE4B2201C11D638"/>
been deſtroyed, without internal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord being one of the primary cauſes. Surely, then, he muſt be a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemy to this country, who endeavours to excite jealouſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union here, from which ſo many evil conſequences muſt naturally and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ariſe. Let all ſuch perſons meet with the deteſtation and ſcorn they merit. Let the Americans, to uſe the words of this paragraphiſt, "give a preference to our old citizens," whenever their merit and abilities en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to it. But ſhould the <hi>new comer</hi> be found to poſſeſs thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in a higher degree, let him not be expoſed to neglect, abuſe, or ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, merely becauſe, actuated by a
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030158_0118_0FE4B2235810FED8"/>
love of liberty, he has given this country a preference to his own, and abandoned his friends and relatives to coaleſce with the inhabitants of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, who, as general Waſhington de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in his farewel addreſs, "HAVE OPENED AN ASYLUM FOR THE OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSED AND DISTRESSED OF ALL NATIONS."</p>
            <p>As this is a ſubject on which many well meaning perſons have been led to form very erroneous opinions, by the artful inſinuations of deſigning men, it will be allowable to purſue it a little further. In Europe, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of preventing emigration is fully underſtood; and in moſt ſtates no pains are ſpared to chain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030158_0119_0FE4B224E01349D8"/>
to the ſoil. To entice ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts and manufacturers from Britain is a high crime and miſdemeanor: and, according to Chambers, in the ſame country, artificers in iron, ſteel, braſs or other metal, or in wool, going out of the kingdom into any foreign country, without licence, are liable to be impriſoned three months, and fined any ſum not exceeding one hundred pounds. And thoſe who go abroad, and do not return on warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given by the Britiſh ambaſſadors, are diſabled from holding lands by deſcent or deviſe, from receiving any legacy, &amp;c. and are deemed aliens. It is the ſame in ſeveral other ſtates of Europe. Edward the third who
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030158_0120_0FE4B2285EB6C718"/>
eſtabliſhed the woollen manufacture in England, effected it by enticing ſome weavers from Flanders. Such was the origin of that trade which forms the baſis of Engliſh opulence and commerce to this day. May not ſome of the emigrants from Europe, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh manufactures here which in time will prove equally lucrative and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial? The impolicy of Lewis the fourteenth in revoking the edict of Nantz, and the conſequent emigration from France of hundreds of thouſands of valuable artiſts and manufacturers, imparted various arts to Germany, Holland, and England, whereof France had had an almoſt entire monopoly. Among theſe we may
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030158_0121_0FE4B229E6E06C50"/>
enumerate the manufacture of paper, ſilk, looking glaſſes, . . The expulſion of the Moors from Spain tended greatly to the impoveriſhment of that country, and to the abridgment of its manufactures, trade, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Are not theſe and numerous other inſtances which might be addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſufficient to prove how far ſage policy requires America to hold out every poſſible encouragement to indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious perſons to migrate here, with their acquirements, their property, and their families? What then ſhall we ſay of thoſe who are inceſſantly heaping ſcurrility and abuſe on them? The anſwer is obvious. They muſt be either ignorant, illiberal, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030158_0122_0FE4B22E7121E180"/>
mean perſons: or thoſe who have ſome ſelfiſh or party purpoſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by ſuch a vile conduct. If the former be the caſe, they claim our pity or contempt: if the latter, our hatred.</p>

               <head>Mr. CHALMERS.</head>
               <p>THIS gentleman is, in ſome reſpects, the firſt performer in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. In others, he is ſecond to Mr. Hodgkinſon, who, as a general actor, ſtands undoubtedly at the head of his profeſſion.</p>
               <p>In genteel comedy, the palm muſt be given to Mr. Chalmers. In this
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030158_0124_0FE4B232777F7948"/>
department he ſtands unrivalled. His Belcour cannot be excelled. He ſhines with diſtinguiſhed luſtre in this character, which is drawn in the happieſt manner, and with all the fire and animation of a Congreve or Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quhar. To the violent paſſions—the punctilious ſenſe of honour—the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of this ſon of the torrid zone, Cumberland could not wiſh more complete juſtice done.</p>
               <p>His Belville, in the ſchool for wives, is nearly equal to Belcour, He aſſumes the variety that marks this character, with the utmoſt eaſe and propriety—and is by turns an affectionate, though a diſſolute huſband—an abandoned ſeducer—and a man of ſuch true
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030158_0125_0FE4B234FA923F58"/>
honor, as to refuſe to raiſe his arm, except in ſelf-defence, againſt him whom he has endeavoured to injure in the tendereſt point, his ſiſter's virtue.</p>
               <p>His Modely, in the Farm Houſe, gives the fulleſt expreſſion to the author's ideas. The licentious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the depravity of principle, the faſcinating affability of this well-drawn portrait, ſit on him as eaſy as the dreſs he wears.</p>
               <p>In the Clandeſtine Marriage, he does ample juſtice to the excentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of that variegated character, Lord Ogleby—to his gallant and amiable attentions to the fair ſex—to
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030158_0126_0FE4B238F24D6930"/>
his vanity—to his generoſity—and to his affectation of priſtine vigour, while groaning under the excruciating tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ariſing from his diſſolute life.</p>
               <p>His Vapid, in the Dramatiſt, is by no means inferior to the former. To this character and that of Marplot, in the Buſy Body, it may be objected, that they are not within, they are beyond nature. They carry the improbable conſpicuouſly ſtamped on their foreheads. Mr. Chalmers, however, by his excellent perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, almoſt induces the ſpectator to believe theſe perſonages not only probable, but actually before his eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:030158_0127_0FE4B23A8000A410"/>
In no character, perhaps, does he ſhine to more advantage, than in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Puff, in the Critic. To equal him in this, is difficult—to excel him, impoſſible. This part requires inceſſant exertion; and the ſpectator is loſt in aſtoniſhment, at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abated life and ſpirit, diſplayed for an hour and a half, during which mind and body have hardly a moment's relaxation. The humorous extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraneous flights in which he occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally indulges, give the higheſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſeaſoning to the intellectual feaſt.</p>
               <p>He has ſeldom attempted low co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. But when he has, his ſucceſſ has been conſiderable. His Trappanti, in She Would and She Would Not,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030158_0128_0FE4B23DF1BA1A40"/>
is perfectly natural, and puts in the moſt conſpicuous light all the roguery, cunning, and humour, that Cibber beſtowed on the character.</p>
               <p>I have but ſeldom ſeen him in tragedy, and am therefore, not fully competent to paſs an opinion on him as a tragedian. So far, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as I have ſeen, his abilities in this line are inferior to thoſe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays in the former. In awful or terrific ſcenes, he verges towards rant—he works himſelf into a degree of violent paſſion, which often affrights, but ſometimes fails of exciting the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the ſpectator.</p>
               <p>His Hamlet is, however, extremely well performed. In the interview
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030158_0129_0FE4B23F794A1788"/>
with his mother, he is truly great—and likewiſe when the players repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their tragedy before the king and queen.</p>
               <p>His La Motte, in Fontainville Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, is not equal to the former. This character is hardly natural, and is therefore the more difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. However, the ſtorm of conflicting paſſions, by which he is impelled forward to the perpetration of the crime that threw him into the power of Lord Montault, is fully and forcibly expreſſed in his countenance and manner.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Mr. Chalmers poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes all the eſſential qualifications that conſtitute a capital performer.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030158_0130_0FE4B243CF885950"/>
His addreſs is eaſy and unconſtrained—he hardly ever requires the Promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's aid—his delivery is equally becoming and natural in the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Peter Puff—the airy flights of Belcour—the ſeductive ſophiſtry of Belville—or the tardy but monitory repentance of Beverly.</p>

               <p>PERHAPS I ſhall not be charged with injuſtice or partiality, when I venture to pronounce this lady the firſt actreſs in America. In Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, ſhe ſtands at a great diſtance from every rival; and her abilities in genteel comedy are very great, far beyond what are uſually met with in thoſe who excel in the former department. In the terrific, the awful, the pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſcenes of highly finiſhed tragedy, ſhe has an unlimited command over
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030158_0132_0FE4B247D7C37F00"/>
the feelings of the ſpectators. And it not unfrequently happens, that hardy veterans, unappalled in the field of battle, bear teſtimony, by the trickling tears, "courſing, each other down their cheeks," to her aſtoniſhing powers. I have never ſeen a performer, not even excepting the far-famed Mrs. Seddons, who has been able to excite in me ſuch highly pleaſurable emotions, as I have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly experienced from the excellent performance of Mrs. Whitlock.</p>
               <p>In that unfeeling character, Lady Macboth, ſhe diſplays, in its genuine colours, that headlong ambition, which ſtifles the voice of humanity, of loyalty, of honour, and of female timidity,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030158_0133_0FE4B24B50A14748"/>
Her madneſs is admirably counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>
               <p>In Milton's Maſque of Comus, ſhe adds new dignity, by the force of the moſt excellent delivery, to the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſentiments of that great writer.</p>
               <p>Who, that has ſeen her Mrs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verley, in the Gameſter, can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold admiration and applauſe, at the tenderneſs, the ſenſibility, the diſtreſs, the ſo naturally exhibits in the various ſtages of this uſeful, this inſtructive tragedy?</p>
               <p>Eliza Ratcliffe, in the Jew, is by no means ſo intereſting as the former character; however, her ſenſibility and terror, on the rupture between her huſband and brother—her perfect reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030158_0134_0FE4B24E48030E50"/>
on the honour of the former, when he ſolemnly promiſes to avoid any further quarrel—her reſpectful behaviour to Sir Stephen Bertram, in their interview—her anxiety and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, when ſhe apprehends his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations on her ſuppoſed ſudden good fortune, are only ironical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of her real poverty—and her joy at the happy reconciliation between her huſband and his family, are expreſſed with great juſtice and propriety.</p>
               <p>In the Orphan, ſhe performs Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, in a capital manner. Her well expreſſed love for the gentle Caſtalio, and diſlike for the brutal Polydore—her agonizing torture at the ſcorn and
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030158_0135_0FE4B250C7228DA8"/>
contempt ſhe experiences from her huſband—her horror at the diſcloſure of the inceſtuous, but involuntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with her brother-in-law—and her ſubſequent madneſs and death, cannot fail of receiving the loudeſt tributes of applauſe from every judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpectator. And could excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of acting compenſate for the groſſeſt fundamental errors of a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic compoſition, Mrs. Whitlock in Monimia, Mr. Chalmers in Chamont, Mr. Whitlock in Acaſto, and Mr. Moreton in Caſtalio, might warrant a repetition of this tragedy. But the groſſneſs of many of the ſentiments expreſſed by polydore—the diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incident on which the entire inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030158_0136_0FE4B2524D761F08"/>
of the piece turns—and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied butchery which cloſes it, ought to conſign the Orphan to eternal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
               <p>In that finiſhed portrait, Lady Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Irwin, in Every one has his Fault, ſhe appears to as much advantage, as in any of the characters ſhe aſſumes, Filial tenderneſs and affection ſpurned to the ground by an unrelenting and hard-hearted father, cannot poſſibly find expreſſion beyond what ſhe exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. The corroding cares of a tender wife, whoſe loved and loving huſband is in danger of an ignominious death, are moſt pathetically depicted in her countenance, and by ſympathy affect the ſpectators with a portion of her
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030158_0137_0FE4B254CF9AB870"/>
diſtreſs. But what can be beyond the grand ſcene in which ſhe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers her long-loſt ſon, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles between her regard for him and her love for his father, whether, at the expenſe of the former, ſhe ſhall keep the fatal pocket-book, or reſtore it, to the danger of the latter? This exquiſite treat for feeling minds is hardly equalled—but certainly not excelled by any ſcene ever written in our language; and to the praiſe of Mrs. Whitlock, it muſt be ſaid, that the merit of the actreſs is at leaſt equal to that of the author.</p>
               <p>To conclude. Mrs. Whitlock has a dignified carriage; her pronunciation is animated; her voice and her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030158_0138_0FE4B258EFC96DD0"/>
are capable of every inflection neceſſary to expreſs the moſt oppoſite emotions and paſſions, with the utmoſt promptitude—her memory is ſo good, and her application ſo aſſiduous, as to leave her little indebt to the prompter's aid—and, except her perſon, which approaches towards the maſculine, ſhe has every qualification deſirable in an actreſs.</p>

               <head>NUMBER III. Mr. HARWOOD.</head>
               <p>THIS gentleman, who, perhaps, ranks next to Mr. Chalmers, among the male performers, is in high favour with the amateurs of the drama.—At his entré here, he attracted little attention—but ſuddenly came forward with great and unexpected eclat.</p>
               <p>The firſt character in which he made a conſiderable figure, was that of Dr. Lenitive, in the prize, or 2, 3, 5, 8, in which he charmed the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030158_0140_0FE4B25E01FBB4A8"/>
by his humour and originality—the avarice of this diſciple of Galen, his groſs ignorance, his ridiculous pedantry, his upſtart pride, on his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed good fortune, were moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably perſonated. The ſpectator was led into that agreeable deluſion which deceives him into a belief, that the tranſient ſcene is acting on the great ſtage of the world, which conſtitutes the chief merit of a good performer.</p>
               <p>His Fretful Plagiary is even ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Lenitive. He does complete juſtice to the teſtineſs of this literary ſhark, and to his affected indifference for and agonizing torture under the cauterizing criticiſms of the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper writers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:030158_0141_0FE4B25F88BF5970"/>
His Walter in the delightful after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of the Children in the Wood, is well performed, but inferior to Hodgkinſon's.—However, he has improved conſiderably in the ſucceſſive repreſentations. His ſong of "Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Dump" is extremely well ſung, and accompanied with natural and highly humourous geſtures. In the interview with Oliver, whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to diſſuade from his in<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>tion of murdering the infants, and in the ſcene where they are brought in by their parents, he is equal to Hodgkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The parts in which he is inferior, are, when he is diſcovered by Sir Rowland, and throughout in his courtſhip with joſephine, which Mr.
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030158_0142_0FE4B263C61EBA08"/>
Hodgkinſon repreſents with more true nature and grace.</p>
               <p>His Sir David Dunder, in Ways and Means, gives great ſatisfaction. His articulation is particularly adapted to the volubility of this hoſpitable knight; as likewiſe to that of</p>
               <p>Prattle, in the Deuce is in Him, in which his performance was extremely natural.</p>
               <p>His Jabal in Cumberland's Jew, was received with great applauſe, as he filled the character with perfect propriety.</p>
               <p>In the Baron of Oakland, Haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tower, Fulmer in the Weſt-Indian, and the Planter in Yarico and Inkle, he appeared to no great advantage.
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030158_0143_0FE4B2654D00E350"/>
In the firſt, the affected dignity of the baſe uſurper did not ſeem to become him.</p>
               <p>In Old Barnacle in the Romp, he diſplays the rough <hi>noli-me-tangere</hi> manners of a boiſterous ſon of the waves, extremely well.</p>
               <p>His Canton, in the Clandeſtine Marriage, is as good a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the finicking, fantaſtic, and fawning manners, beſtowed in moſt Engliſh plays on French characters, as any I have ſeen. But it is to be hoped, that in "this country of good ſenſe," we will riſe ſuperior to the deſpicable and odious vice of holding up the inhabitants of any country, or profeſſors of any ſect, as objects of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030158_0144_0FE4B267D058C8B0"/>
ridicule, to gratify our over-weening vanity by the flattering compariſon.</p>
               <p>His Mayor of Coventry and Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fery Latimer are judiciouſly played and command great approbation.</p>
               <p>From his great ſucceſs in humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous characters, it was hardly ſuppoſed that his powers were calculated to do juſtice to the tenderneſs of conjugal love. But who enjoyed the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite pleaſure communicated by the interview with his Sall in the Purſe, that did not inſtantly acknowledge how egregious was the miſtake? Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick himſelf could hardly have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in this ſcene, had he played the part. It was affecting to the higheſt degree. The ſoul that
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030158_0145_0FE4B26B496430A8"/>
can be unmoved at ſuch a capital diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of the moſt intereſting emotions of the human breaſt, muſt partake largely of the nature of "the rugged rhinoceros, or the Ruſſian bear." In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, throughout the whole of the Purſe, his performance is highly juſt and natural.</p>
               <p>To conclude. Mr. Harwood is an extremely valuable actor. His merits in many characters are of the firſt rate. He can aſſume as great a variety of countenance and manner as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former in this city. His articulation is either rapid as the falls of Niagara, or ſlow and ſtately as the meandering Suſquehanna, according to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he repreſents. He is, however,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030158_0146_0FE4B26EAFEF3D80"/>
often indebted to Mr. Rowſon's aid—which, whether it ariſes from defect of memory, or want of application, is certainly a conſiderable drawback on the gratification received from his performance. He is young, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and bids fair, at no very diſtant period, to arrive at a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree of reputation in his profeſſion.</p>

               <p>THIS enchanting little actreſs poſſeſſes as high a degree of favour as any performer that ever appeared in America. Nature has been uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly liberal to her. She has a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing figure, and a prepoſſeſſing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which, if any dependance is to be placed on phyſiognomy, is "the title page to a moſt captivating vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume." Her voice is ſweet and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious. She ſings agreeably, and more naturally, than ſome whoſe vocal
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030158_0148_0FE4B273EE6699E0"/>
powers and execution are far ſuperior to hers, in the opinion of the amateurs.</p>
               <p>Her performance of the Country Girl has been pronounced by compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judges nearly equal to that of the celebrated Mrs. Jordan, who, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is regarded as having arrived at the <hi>acme</hi> of excellence in this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The craft and artifice, beſtowed by native inſtinct, to counteract the ſelfiſh and baſe deſigns of her ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated guardian, are admirably co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the moſt natural and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>Her Edward, in Every One has his Fault, is equal to any of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. She divides with Mrs. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the merit of that moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030158_0149_0FE4B275755DED20"/>
ſcene, in which the mother and ſon diſcover each other. Her well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupported ſuſpence and anxiety, while torn with rival paſſions—gratitude to her grandfather for his protection, and irreſiſtible ſilial love for her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—cannot be too highly praiſed. The diſtreſs ſhe diſplays, at parting with her grandfather, when love tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over gratitude, is highly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>In the Spoiled Child, ſhe is always received with unbounded applauſe. Never did port ill-mannered boy with more nature, naiveté, and ſpirit, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs an old-maidiſh aunt, or play on the foibles, and take advantage of the blind ſide of a doting fond father,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030158_0150_0FE4B279B3256DF8"/>
than this actreſs. She aſſumes the dreſs, and with the dreſs the genuine manner of the young tarpaulin, with the utmoſt eaſe. And in this diſguiſe, one time of performance, ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as genuine a tribute, as was ever beſtowed. The ſtory has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy told in the papers; but I ſhall, I hope, be pardoned for repeating it here. A ſailor in the pit, was ſo charmed with the air, the manner, of her ſinging the ſong
<q>
                     <l>"Yo yea,"</l>
                  </q>
that he emptied his pocket of his laſt dollar, which he threw on the ſtage, to teſtify his ſatisfaction at the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of "the little gem'man," as he termed her. But, poor fellow, he
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030158_0151_0FE4B27B4096A668"/>
was rather roughly handled; for the action being miſtaken for an inſult, he was driven out of the houſe, amidſt the hiſſes and abuſe of the ſpectators.</p>
               <p>In Emily, in the Deuce is in Him, her performance is natural and ſpirited. But nature, in chooſing the materials for her compoſition, threw in an over proportion of the riſible. Humour and merriment are, therefore, her predominent qualities. Nature ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times triumphs, in ſpite of every effort to diſguiſe or counteract her. This was never more perceptible, than in the interview with her limping lover, colonel Tamper, whoſe awkward and disfigured appearance ſo completely tickled her fancy, that ſhe could not
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030158_0152_0FE4B27EB97997B0"/>
reſiſt the impulſe to laughter, at a moment when ſhe wiſhed to appear in the utmoſt diſtreſs. The ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance has occurred on ſomeother occaſions. It is hoped the little char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will attend to this friendly hint, and in ſerious parts, lay in a ſuitable ſtock of gravity.</p>
               <p>In Priſcilla Tomboy, ſhe is hardly equal to Mrs. Hodgkinſon, who ſhines in this character.</p>
               <p>Her Joſephine is extremly well performed, and I think ſuperior to Mrs. Hodgkinſon's. In the lover's altercation, and in pa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing with the children, her merits are very great.</p>
               <p>In India <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhe repreſents to advantage, the novel-reading miſs.
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030158_0153_0FE4B28044E7F370"/>
The diſappointment of her ſcheme of an elopement—her chagrin at the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying proſpect of being thrice called in church, and kiſſed by the greaſy church-warden—and her reſentment at the impoſition practiſed upon her, are unexceptionably well played.</p>
               <p>Her Moggy M'Gilpin, in the Highland Reel, is truly excellent.</p>
               <p>Her Page, in the purſe, is highly intereſting. Her ſong of
<q>
                     <l>"When I was a little he,"</l>
                  </q>
is enchanting. The diſplay of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her mother, on the peruſal of her letter, and the pathos of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties for a continuance of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's friendſhip, are chefs d'oeuvre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="unknown:030158_0154_0FE4B2843A191F88"/>
In fine. Mrs. Marſhall may, as a general actreſs, aſpire at a firſt rank in America.—The degree of favour ſhe acquired on her arrival here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded on the baſe of intrinſic excellence, has gained additional ſtrength in proportion as ſhe has been the ſubject of critical examination. She can with equal eaſe, grace, and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety aſſume the for ard, pouting airs of an awkward countryminx—the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of a rude boy, better ſed than taught—the ſtaid manners of a well-educated lady—and the ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of a Juliet. In all her extenſively variegated line of acting, ſhe meets with well earned plaudits. And it is to be hoped, that ſhe will
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030158_0155_0FE4B285C884C170"/>
ever bear ſtrongly impreſſed in mind the large ſhare of eſteem ſhe has at ſtake—and be as careful in preſerving, as ſhe has been happy in acquiring, the unanimous good wiſhes of her libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral patrons, the citizens of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</p>

            <head type="sub">In a Letter to a Friend.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have aſked my opinion reſpecting over-trading, of which you ſeem to be highly afraid. But I hope ſo clearly to point out its advantages, as to remove all your ſcruples, and to induce you to purſue the ſteps of ſo many of your fellow citizens, who enjoy all the comforts and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of this laudable practice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="unknown:030158_0157_0FE4B28BCC614408"/>
With all my partiality for it, I freely acknowledge, that its benefits do not appear very evident, but at particular ſeaſons, and during times of ſtagnation.—When buſineſs is briſk, one is tempted to overlook the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. But he muſt be a moſt incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible ſceptic, that can doubt its bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, when money is ſcarce, when trade is dull, when banks curtail diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, during the winter and ſummer months, when buſineſs is at a ſtand, and nothing doing, what reſource can a man have, who has not over-traded, to keep himſelf employed? None. He is devoured by vapours, by ennui, by liſtleſſneſs.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030158_0158_0FE4B28F099D3268"/>
Time hangs on his hands a heavy burden.</p>
            <p>But mark the contraſt. The man who has run himſelf comforably in debt, to the amount of 15, 20, or 30,000 dollars, has not an unemployed vacant hour, day or night. As ſoon as he riſes in the morning, he has to exerciſe himſelf in walking over the city to borow a few dollars here and there—What a charming opportunity it gives a man to ſee his acquaintance! How acceptable muſt his viſits be, which are certain title-pages to a beggarly requeſt for money! What a touchſtone he is to prove the ſincerity of his friends!—When he lies down at night, ſlumber flies from his pillow,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030158_0159_0FE4B2909AE62778"/>
and his whole attention is turned to deviſe ſiſcal arrangements for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day.</p>
            <p>As times grow worſe, theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts increaſe. You have the pleaſure ſometimes of borrowing daily, to pay the ſucceeding morning or afternoon. What a reſpectable ſight it is, to behold you or your clerk, ſneaking to the bank after the directors have gone away, to anticipate, by a few hours, the knowledge of their deciſion upon the notes you have offered! What a mournful countenance you exhibit, when your notes are returned to you, hanging out of your book, with the mark of the beaſt on them! How you puff and blow running about
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030158_0160_0FE4B2932DEF4ED0"/>
from ſtreet to ſtreet, to borrow money, and get into bank before three o'clock! What a number of promiſes you make, impoſſible to be performed!</p>
            <p>As the climax riſes, new ſhifts open to your view. To over-draw is a moſt capacious one. It ſtays for a while the impending torrent of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. What a charming exerciſe for your dexterity, to keep your book out of the hands of the clerks, leſt they ſhould ſeize it, and expoſe how frequently the balance is on the wrong ſide!</p>
            <p>When borrowing is at an end, and the clerks of the banks grow too wary to allow you to over-draw, a further advantage ariſes. You are
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030158_0161_0FE4B295D11D7070"/>
introduced to the acquaintance of that very worthy and conſcientious race of men, who ſeem born for the relief of perſons in diſtreſs. I mean the friendly claſs of uſurers. You may at firſt hire money of them, at one per cent. a month—afterwards at two—and, as their <hi>charity</hi> grows with your diſtreſs, it will probably riſe to four or five, if your ſufferings ſhould be ſo great as to excite an extraordinary degree of ſympathy in their tender hearts.</p>
            <p>You will probably think that this is the ne plus ultra of the advantages of this mode of doing buſineſs. So did I at firſt. But I ſoon diſcovered my miſtake. Rats, they ſay, deſert a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030158_0162_0FE4B298EA9E89A8"/>
ſinking ſhip. They are warned by the inſtinct beſtowed on them by mother nature. The uſurers poſſeſs an inſtinct ſimilar to this—and generally ſmell out a ſinking firm, from which they contrive to make an early eſcape. Then your acquaintance extends fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A worthy man, whom they call a notary public, kindly calls on you, brightens up your recollection of a note you forgot to pay a bank, and demands payment, which you are not able to make. This viſit, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing you are poſſeſſed of any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, diſplays your countenance to great advantage. The pleaſing mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of charming red with which it
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030158_0163_0FE4B29BA59F4578"/>
ſuffuſes your cheeks, heightens your natural beauties to the utmoſt degree.</p>
            <p>I have not noticed the amount of the intereſt you pay. Suppoſing you to have the moderate ſum of 12,000 dollars of bank money in trade, you do not pay much more than 1,000 dollars a year. This is a mere baga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telle, unworthy of notice. Indeed, were it not for ſome ſuch drain as this, it would be impoſſible to find employment for the immenſe profits of trade at preſent.</p>
            <p>Another advantage which I paſſed over, is, the improvement in polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good behaviour, which you derive from your cringing viſits to directors and preſidents of banks—
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030158_0164_0FE4B29F22C6FC10"/>
your dancing attendance at their levees—your requeſts, they will be ſo kind as to pay attention to your notes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might extend the enumeration much farther—but ſhall conclude for the preſent with the obſervation, that the man who involves himſelf by over-trading, has, in the fulleſt ſenſe of the words, <hi>"taken up his croſs"</hi>—a croſs which half a life may be too little to enable him to lay down again.</p>

            <p>ARE the preſent times, really and <hi>bona fide,</hi> as diſtreſſing and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as they are univerſally ſaid to be? This queſtion, which to many will appear as ridiculous as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, does the ſun preſide over the day, is aſked with all the coolneſs and gravity of a ſtoic, and a ſerious anſwer is requeſted. Locke has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where obſerved, that a want of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030158_0166_0FE4B2A503124140"/>
with preciſion the ideas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by words in general uſe, is one of the moſt abundant ſources of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ignorance and error. Perhaps, without incurring the charge of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, it may be added, that the moſt familiar terms are often leaſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The <hi>ignobile vulgus,</hi> (with "reverence due and ſubmiſſion" be it ſaid, five-ſixths of mankind) pick up a ſet of phraſes, which they repeat, parrot-like, by rote, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any clear idea of them, or being able, if required, to define their meaning,—Leſt, therefore, our ideas of diſtreſs and calamity ſhould not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide with thoſe of our readers, we will aſk a queſtion or two.—What is
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030158_0167_0FE4B2A68C2E9378"/>
diſtreſs?—What is calamity?—Some folk, very probably, think it <hi>mighty diſtreſſing,</hi> that a man who begins bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with a ſlender capital, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps on the <hi>broad bottom</hi> of a patched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up credit, cannot keep his country houſe, his phaeton, his chaiſe, or even his pair of horſes; that he cannot have above half a dozen diſhes ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his table every day—nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain his friends <hi>en homme comme il ſaul.</hi> This is all the fault of the <hi>damned bad times!</hi>—It is, indeed, <hi>mighty calamitous,</hi> that the blind god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs Fortune ſhould have been ſo unkind to many <hi>ſunny boys, hearty fellows, jovial ſouls, ſprightly lads,</hi> and others of that noble fraternity, as
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:030158_0168_0FE4B2A90B62E6D8"/>
to have made them ſons and heirs of poverty and empty purſe, at the ſame time that <q>Nature indulgently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed them with all the <hi>innocent deſires, appetites, wiſhes</hi> and <hi>paſſions,</hi> of dukes and earls;</q> ſo that while they have all the faculties and talents requiſite to ſhine with <hi>wonderful eclat,</hi> in the ſporting away ſome thouſands per annum, they are obliged to confine themſelves to the <hi>obſcurity</hi> and <hi>inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificance</hi> of their ſtores—<hi>What a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able caſe!—</hi> It is alſo <hi>dreadfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing,</hi> that a clerk or ſhopkeeper, who is <hi>charitably</hi> and <hi>innocently</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to provide for a <hi>female friend,</hi> in ſome retired country ſpot, ſuch as Kenſington, Germantown, &amp;c.—ride
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:030158_0169_0FE4B2AB8F1F4AC8"/>
out ten or a dozen miles to dinner on Sundays—play a few games at billi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards now and then—<hi>keep it up</hi> two or three nights in the week—and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf in various other <hi>equally harmleſs</hi> modes of recreation, ſhould be obliged, by the <hi>general dullneſs of the times,</hi> to ſtupify himſelf <hi>plodding over his waſte-books, his journals</hi> and <hi>his ledgers,</hi> or <hi>warming his toes,</hi> kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the threſhold of his employer's door—and all this owing to the <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſeaſon, bad times, ſcarcity of money, ſtagnation of trade, &amp;c.</hi>—Is it not alſo <hi>a moſt lamentable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> that an artizan or mechanic, who could find a thouſand <hi>laudable ways</hi> of recreating himſelf at <hi>billiards,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030158_0170_0FE4B2B083BCF860"/>
bowls, tennis, all fours,</hi> &amp;c. or over his glaſs of <hi>cherry bounce,</hi> his <hi>brandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling,</hi> or his <hi>bowl of bub,</hi> ſhould be obliged, by the mere ſeverity of the times, to work ſix days in the week, at <hi>ſo very low a rate</hi> as five, ſix, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or eight dollars?—Hard muſt be the heart of him who can hear of all thoſe <hi>unparalleled miſeries and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes,</hi> without ſhedding—<hi>tears of blood.</hi>—We may juſtly cry out with the Mantuan bard—<hi>"Quis, talia ſando, temperet a lacrymis?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A truce with irony—or (as the four cynic will ſay) with nonſenſe. Do not people in general live comfortably here? Have not bankruptcies (the moſt inſallible <hi>criteria</hi> of bad times)
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:030158_0171_0FE4B2B20B4ADE80"/>
ſubſided for a conſiderable time paſt? Do not manufacturers ordinarily find a ready vent for all the goods they make? Is not the number of unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed mechanics very ſmall?—If the intelligent reader ſhall anſwer theſe queſtions in the affirmative, it is an obvious inference, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times cannot, in ſtrict propriety of language, be called calamitous or diſtreſſing.</p>
            <p>Whoever purſues this very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflection to a greater extent, will probably agree, that of the few who give themſelves the trouble of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by far the major part have only confuſed ideas of even the moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar terms; whence all their premiſes
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030158_0172_0FE4B2B5876D9898"/>
and concluſions are involved in a chaos. This is the only mode of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for the univerſality of the outcry againſt the miſery of the times. That there is vaſtly leſs money here at preſent than immediately ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the concluſion of the late war, is inconteſtible: but with nations as with individuals, happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon wealth. Is the cit, poſſeſſed of his tens of thouſands, or the planter, owner of boundleſs acres, and numerous corps of the ſwarthy victims of his avarice and pride, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically happier than the merry cobler, who ſits in his ſtall, ſinging,
<q>
                  <l>I care for nobody, no, not I,</l>
                  <l>If nobody cares for me!"</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:030158_0173_0FE4B2B70FD22BC0"/>
Are the lazy enervate ſons of Mexico and Peru, who annually deluge Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope with their gold, ſilver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, happier than the hardy, innocent, and poor inhabitants of Switzerland? In the ſcale of reaſon and common ſenſe, doubtleſs not. To purſue this analogy:
<q>
                  <l>Reaſon's whole pleaſure—all the joys of ſenſe</l>
                  <l>Lie in three words—health, peace, and competence."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So ſung Pope, relatively to the happineſs of individuals: what is true of them will equally hold with reſpect to aggregate bodies—for whatever conſtitutes the happineſs of one man, ſhould equally conduce (whim and
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030158_0174_0FE4B2BB11483990"/>
caprice excluded) to that of his neighbour—and ſo on, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> It is unneceſſary to add, that if each member of a ſociety be happy, the ſociety itſelf muſt conſequently be ſo. What is deducible from this?—That Pennſylvania, poſeſſing a <hi>healthy</hi> climate—being in the enjoyment of <hi>peace</hi>—and producing more than is neceſſary to procure a ſupply of all thoſe articles (if any ſuch there be) which ſhe muſt have recourſe to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations for, [i.e. in other words, being poſſeſſed of a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>] if ſhe be not really happy, ſhe muſt charge it to the account of her own folly, imprudence, and party squabbles.</p>
