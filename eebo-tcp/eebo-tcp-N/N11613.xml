            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HOME-FELT joys, this day, poſſeſs our breaſts, on account of the diſtinguiſhing bleſſings of LIBERTY and FREEDOM, which illuſtriouſly exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, animating the members of this community.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY! the darling of generous and noble ſouls, extends her hand once more, without controul, to give in her ſuffrages for men to rule us in the fear of GOD.</p>
            <p>WITH gratitude to the Almighty Preſerver of our privileges, we ſee the returns of this joyful anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and the leaders of this people aſſembled, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore wiſdom and influence from heaven, to conduct our public affairs at this difficult and trying day.</p>
            <p>GLOOMY and threatning indeed, is the cloud impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our land and nation. Our privileges, civil and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014675_0005_0F948B87DB2BE308"/>
are imminently endangered. Under theſe alarming circumſtances, the admonitory language of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and revelation is this, <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made us free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY an allegory borrowed from what is written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> and their reſpective offspring, the apoſtle had been illuſtrating their diſtinguiſhing privileges: Immediately upon which, our text is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced—of a noble import, conſidered only as reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting chriſtian liberty. But it is propoſed, upon this occaſion, to apply in a more general view, what might be ſuggeſted with a particular reference.</p>
            <p>WE have glorious privileges aſſerted—liberty and freedom belonging to us, not merely as men, originally created in GOD'S image, holding a diſtinguiſhed rank in his creation, but alſo as chriſtians, redeemed by the blood of CHRIST. The divine author, purchaſer and beſtower of all theſe mercies and bleſſings, expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned CHRIST JESUS, who, by his perfect obedience and the ſacrifice of himſelf made compleat atonement for ſin—purchaſed reconciliation with GOD—temporal favours and bleſſings for a ruined world, and eternal glory for all that truly believe in him.</p>
            <p>HERE is alſo a very important duty, enjoined by the higheſt authority, to exert ourſelves in maintaining and defending our liberties and privileges. <hi>Stand faſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

WHAT is IMPLIED in the DUTY ENJOINED, to STAND FAST THEREIN.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>FIRST. As to our liberty and freedom, civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. Theſe may be conſidered as general terms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding our ineſtimable rights and privileges of a civil and ſacred nature.</p>
            <p>MAN was originally formed ſuch a creature, and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe circumſtances that infinite wiſdom determined it was not good for him to live alone. The glorious CREATOR put him under ſtrong and endearing obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of convenience, inclination and neceſſity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him into ſociety, furniſhing him with reaſon and language to continue and enjoy it. For perpetual ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the human mind was not adapted, nor the ſtrength of an individual proportionate to his neceſſities. From hence ſociety appears convenient and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of nature is a ſtate of freedom and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. No one can therein challenge a ſuperiority over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Every man was amenable to GOD alone. Nor could he invade his neighbour's property, or abridge his natural liberty, without violating one of nature's moſt ſacred laws. In this apoſtate world, the inability of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtue renders government abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>THE motives upon which individuals made a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſurrender of that plenitude of power which they poſſeſs in a ſtate of nature, are abundantly obvious. For, though in that ſtate, no one was ſubject to the controul of another; but in this reſpect was abſolute lord of his own perſon and poſſeſſions; yet every one being his equal, and the greater part no ſtrict obſervers of juſtice and equity; the enjoyment of property, in this ſituation muſt be very precarious. Therefore he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily relinquiſhes that condition which muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014675_0007_0F948B890DE7F790"/>
be attended with unceaſing fears and dangers, to unite with others for the mutual preſervation of their lives, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and properties. But then—freedom from abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, deſpotic power is ſo neceſſary unto, and cloſely connected with a man's preſervation that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his preſervation and life together.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>WHEN mankind form into ſociety and ſubmit to the neceſſary reſtrictions and ſubordinations of government, it lies with the people, under GOD, to determine who ſhall make and execute the laws by which they ſhall be governed. Man's liberty in ſociety is to be under no legiſlative power, but that eſtabliſhed in the common wealth; and to be ſubject to no human laws but thoſe enacted by that legiſlature. Theſe are conceived to be firſt principles, coeval with time, and ſanctified by uſe—of importance in the diſputes of the preſent day.</p>
            <p>As to the rights and immunities of a free ſtate, we have been moſt highly favoured of the LORD. When new ſtates were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, a free form of government, obtained in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and various other parts of Europe. Under the <hi>Saxon</hi> heptarchy and after the union of thoſe kingdoms, liberty prevailed in <hi>England,</hi> as hiſtory informs us.</p>
            <p>UPON the Norman conqueſt, deſpotic power was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by King William the firſt. His ſon, to ſecure his crown, ſolemnly engaged to reſtore it's ancient laws and government. Similar promiſes were made by ſome ſucceeding Princes, who neglected the due performance and involved the nation in a bloody war. The Barons and people nobly exerted themſelves to recover their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, 'till the charter of Britiſh privileges, the Magna Charta, was ſolemnly confirmed by King John. Sordid
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014675_0008_0F948B89798474F0"/>
attempts have ſince been made, to deprive the people of their ineſtimable rights; which have ever involved their authors in wretched misfortunes; terminating in the loſs of their lives or crowns. The lawleſs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Charles the firſt, to eſtabliſh arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, introduced a civil war, which raged until his blood quenched the flame. His ſon, King James the ſecond, enterprized abſolute rule, and had almoſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the civil and religious liberties of his country. At this critical time GOD raiſed up, and the people, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant of their rights, invited over the Prince of Orange; upon which James abdicated the throne and kingdom. Thus hath GOD preſerved our nation, in times paſt.</p>
            <p>THE American colonies in general, and <hi>Connecticut</hi> in ſpecial, have enjoyed moſt diſtinguiſhing privileges. If a perfect civil conſtitution cannot be found exiſting; yet our own we eſteem, by far, the moſt eligible; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of which are illuſtriouſly demonſtrated at the preſent day. Our legiſlature conſiſts of two houſes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually elected by the freemen of the corporation, under the ſacred ſolemnity of an oath, to give in their ſuffrages ſo as they verily believe in their conſciences may be moſt conducive to the beſt good of the government. Beyond all diſpute, frequent elections are a noble preſervative from the execrable ſin of venality in rulers. Our General Aſſembly, thus compoſed, enact our laws, appoint our judges, erect our courts, preſcribe their powers, and adjuſt the method of procedure. Our rulers are not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners obtruded upon us, from whence, interference of intereſt and diſaffection would naturally ariſe. While the people retain their elective power, rulers muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſhare very largely in the choiceſt affections of a free people. Such hath been the public virtue of this people, that thoſe in higheſt ſeats of honor, dignity and authority, in this colony, have been revered for their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014675_0009_0F948B8A337CF438"/>
ſuperior wiſdom and integrity, virtue, magnanimity and piety. The public have been ſerved, from time to time, by men of probity and a public ſpirit. Inſtead of the bramble in Jotham's parable, to diſtreſs us, we have ſat under the ſhadow of a pleaſant and fruitful vine—Our air healthful—our ſoil fertile, liberally rewarding the diligent huſbandmen—yielding different crops for our ſuſtenance. If one fail, a famine may not enſue, as it doth in many countries. Every town is a corporation inveſted with ſingular power to ſuppreſs immoralities which are provoking to GOD, and deſtructive to civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Every family is entitled to the ſtrength of the community for its defence. We have enjoyed all the ſweets and felt very little of the burdens of government.</p>
            <p>WHILE our government is ſo popular; yet where are civil rulers and executive courts ſo truly revered as in this colony? Where is ſo little of riotous and factious behaviour?</p>
            <p>AS our civil liberties and privileges are nearly connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and greatly promotive of our religious (on which account they are chiefly to be eſteemed) ſo our religious privileges are not inferior to our civil. Every one has GOD'S word, may read and judge for himſelf—may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip GOD in the way he verily believes Heaven will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Every eccleſiaſtical ſociety may chuſe its own miniſter, and provide for his ſupport. Happily deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Romiſh ſuperſtition, unappointed rites and ceremonies, and that eccleſiaſtical hierarchy, which neither we, nor our fathers were able to bear—we <hi>may ſerve God without fear.</hi> Difference of ſentiment reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the non-eſſentials of religion, ſeems one of the unavoidable conſequences of man's dreadful apoſtacy. None may impoſe for doctrine, the commandments of men; or force others to believe with them. Surely

the ſacred rights of conſcience, are ever to be treated with utmoſt delicacy. But if any under pretence of conſcience, ſap the foundation of civil ſociety, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially injure it, they are to be reſtrained by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil arm. Civil rulers are GOD'S miniſters for good to mankind—a terror to evil works, and to puniſh evil doers, by ſalutary laws, faithfully executed. In fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of virtue, to ſuppreſs immorality, and ſupport religion, we have a ſyſtem of excellent laws enacted, while different perſuaſions enjoy the moſt generous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedom. What greater civil or chriſtian liberty can be enjoyed, or even wiſh'd for, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this colony are indulged?</p>
            <p>THAT no external advantage may be wanting, to render us happy, if we are not wanting to ourſelves; we have a flouriſhing ſeminary of learning in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, for the inſtruction of our youth; from whence many ſtreams have iſſued, rejoicing the church and city of our GOD.</p>
            <p>A PEOPLE thus <hi>exalted to heaven,</hi> ſhould be all grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to GOD for diſcriminating favours—emulous to excel in obedience and ſubjection, by leading moſt <hi>quiet and peaceable lives, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, To conſider by whom theſe privileges were purchaſed for, and beſtowed upon us?</p>
            <p>ALL things were originally created by CHRIST. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was placed at the head of this lower creation, with dominion over all creatures therein—crowned <hi>with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honor, but little inferior to the angels in heaven.</hi>—Soon did man dreadfully apoſtatize from a ſtate of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meval integrity. This was an act of the moſt horrid treaſon againſt the KING of KINGS. Thereby the whole patrimony of temporal and ſpiritual bleſſings was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014675_0011_0F948B8BC2458EE8"/>
CHRIST JESUS interpoſed, redeemed the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated inheritance, <hi>being appointed heir of all things, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible.</hi> By purchaſe and by power, <hi>he delivers from the bondage of corruption, and vindicates into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVE ſinners a reprieve from hopeleſs torment?—The means of grace afforded?—The ſchools of CHRIST opened?—His goſpel preached, and ordinances ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, to train us up for heaven?—Have we free acceſs to GOD, and hopes of glory? All flow from CHRIST as their foundation. Are temporal favours confer'd upon ſinful creatures? They come from CHRIST who is <hi>heir of all things, and by whom all things conſiſt.</hi> Every bleſſing is therefore to be conſidered as flowing to us through the blood of JESUS. Civil government is his inſtitution. <hi>The powers that be, are ordained of God. By him, princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</hi> In ſcripture, we have the character of civil ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers decypher'd—the deſign of government pointed out—the duty of ſubjects enforced. In carrying into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution the glorious purpoſes of divine providence and grace, GOD hath choſen, in numberleſs inſtances, to uſe the mediation of others. Agreeably, civil rulers are his <hi>miniſters for good to mankind;</hi> while CHRIST is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from whence flow all our bleſſings.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, What is implied in the duty enjoin'd, <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT others may endeavour by fraud or violence to deprive us of our ineſtimable privileges, is here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; yet we muſt aſſert them; highly eſteem, and conſcientiouſly improve them; zealouſly, and with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vigour, exert ourſelves to maintain and defend them.</p>
            <p>

THE duty enjoin'd in our text ſuppoſes that others may endeavour, by fraud or violence to deprive us of our ineſtimable rights and privileges. We need'nt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the hiſtory of paſt ages, to find this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified. Not long ſince, the Britiſh parliament made ſolemn declaration, "<hi>That it has a right to make laws binding upon the colonies, in all caſes whatſoever.</hi> In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, taxes have been impoſed upon us without our conſent—chartered privileges vacated—various cruel edicts paſſed. The time would fail us to enumerate and particularly conſider thoſe which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate our eſſential rights. To enfore which edicts, fleets and armies have been ſent over, compelling us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſobey the divine precept in our text, or engage in a civil war. Theſe colonies have nobly choſen the latter. Whoever will impartially conſider the tragical ſcenes of the paſt year, and the cauſes of them (me thinks) cannot help but ſee that our precious privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have been invaded; and that heaven hath arreſted the hand of violence in its ravages. At <hi>Lexington,</hi> our countrymen were attack'd, fired upon, and ſome of them impiouſly ſlain. From thence the inhuman mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of their fellow-ſubjects, proceeded to <hi>Concord;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which an action enſued "<hi>inglorious to the Britiſh arms.</hi>" The horrors of a civil war then commenced.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the violence uſed to deprive us of our ineſtimable rights and privileges, we are under indiſpenſible obligations to aſſert them. As rational creatures, and profeſſing chriſtians, a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and acquaintance with them is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. What is ſacred by the laws of GOD, nature and compact, may not be buried in oblivion, or ſunk under the carnal rubbiſh of luxury and ſtupidity. The rights belonging to us, as men and chriſtians, we are to underſtand and aſſert.</p>
            <p>

AGAIN. We muſt highly eſteem, and conſcientiouſly improve them. They demand our higheſt attention. GOD'S glory, our own and other's beſt good, with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſpecial command, lay us under the moſt ſacred obligations thus to value them. Were they of trifling importance, or our necks galled with the yoke of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power and oppreſſion (thoſe engines of accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated miſery and deſtruction to mankind) our caſe had been far different. But (bleſſed be GOD) from thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curſes we are hitherto delivered. We are called to LIBERTY, one of heaven's choiceſt bleſſings to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Amidſt the various calamities of life, LIBERTY adminiſters conſolation—redoubles the pleaſures of our higheſt gratifications—inſpires the human breaſt with nobleſt ſentiments—dilates the heart—expands the ſoul, and is the ſource of almoſt every thing excellent and deſirable on earth. This animates induſtry and oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy—promotes commerce—procures wealth—che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes the liberal arts and ſciences, and wears a moſt friendly aſpect upon all the moſt important intereſts of mankind, while it encourages and promotes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practice of religion.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY is the glory of a community, and enſures its felicity ſo long as it is retained. SLAVERY, on the other hand, debaſes the mind—clogs the fineſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſoul; diſcourages induſtry, frugality, and every thing praiſe-worthy; introduces ignorance and poverty, with the moſt fordid vices, and univerſal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. How ſtriking the contraſt! If this cannot convey any tolerable idea of the bleſſings of FREE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM, let the hiſtory of mankind inform us, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject condition of thoſe people where ſlavery clanks her chains, contraſted with thoſe that are free born. In <hi>Turkey,</hi> every houſe, at the death of it's maſter, is at the diſpoſal of the Grand Segnior.</p>

               <q>LIBERTY, (ſays a celebrated author) is the natural birth-right of mankind; and yet, to take a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive view of the world, how few enjoy it!

In Europe itſelf, what a diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween liberty and ſlavery! <hi>Ruſſia, Poland,</hi> the chief of <hi>Germany, Hungary, Turkey,</hi> the greateſt part of <hi>Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi> The following bear no proportion to them, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh iſles (obſerve, this writer is an Engliſhman) <hi>Sweeden, Holland, Switzerland,</hi> and the <hi>Germanic</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> ſtates.

            <p>BY the price paid for them, eſpecially by the blood of the great REDEEMER, and as they are tranſmitted to us through the blood of our illuſtrious anceſtors, let our privileges be eſtimated. Shall not thoſe ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly purchaſed, and nobly tranſmitted, be highly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, and conſcientiouſly improved?</p>
            <p>OUR ever memorable anceſtors, left their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in times unfriendly to liberty, civil and religious; and gave illuſtrious proofs of riſing ſuperior to the moſt diſcouraging obſtacles; leaving their houſes, lands, and tendereſt connections, with every thing dear and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable among men, for the undiſturbed fruition of thoſe rights, ſacred by the laws of GOD and nature. For this they brav'd the dangers of the ſea, ſurmounting perils, want, toil, famine, and even the ſword of the wilderneſs; among the aſperities of nature, ſeeking an aſylum for liberty, which they ſought in vain from the juſtice and policy of a powerful empire. GOD ſent them into the world to plead the cauſe of liberty, and prepare weſtern manſions againſt arbitrary power, for the perſecuted lovers of freedom. Having by purchaſe or conqueſt, obtained an indiſputable title to their lands; they cou'd'nt but think the produce, by the divine bleſſing on their labors, to be their property, with an excluſive right of diſpoſal. Property without this, is but an inſignificant name. To them was ratified a legiſlative power, reſpecting their internal policy. They quitted the mortal ſtage with joyful hopes that this fair inheritance, purchaſed at a vaſt expence of treaſure and blood, would be tranſmitted, unimpaired, to their

poſterity. Our privileges are a moſt noble legacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to us; a ſacred depoſit, committed to our care. Blood infinitely precious, was the original pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and rather than deſpotic power ſhould prevail, let us ſeal the ſurrender with the laſt drop of our own. What are the lives of this numerous aſſembly, with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads added thereto, if our blood may be honored as the channel of conveyance for our precious privileges, to countleſs multitudes yet unborn!</p>
            <p>METHINKS we may this day, well nigh ſee the ghoſts of our departed progenitors, and hear thoſe bleſſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, in ſolemn accents, through the vaſt of Heaven, addreſſing us, ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith</hi> CHRIST <hi>hath made you free.</hi> At the ineſtimable price of his blood, the glorious REDEEMER purchaſed theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings for his people.

Let your hearts glow with moſt ardent gratitude to the fountain of all grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and your lives be entirely devoted to GOD'S glory. Wiſely eſtimate, improve and maintain your ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble privileges civil and ſacred. Nor can you wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw them away, without incurring JEHOVAH'S moſt tremendous indignation and curſe. GOD, Angels and Saints in glory are looking on. When you have ſuch a glorious cauſe, and ſuch ſpectators, conſider, what ſhould be your behaviour. Truſt in GOD, and firmly defy every danger. Let the blood of CHRIST animate you. Your heaven daring impieties, profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, intemperance, and other abounding iniquities, contempt of goſpel grace, and abuſe of the moſt bleſſed privileges, have procured your preſent calamities. <hi>Remember from whence ye are fallen, repent and do the firſt works;</hi> and Zion's GOD will ſupport his cauſe in America.

OUGHT we not then to be zealouſly engaged? Are not our ſacred as well as civil privileges greatly threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Is not the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by the Quebec bill, ſet at the head of the Romiſh church in <hi>Canada?</hi> A colony of far greater extent than the iſlands of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Let us be zealous in a good cauſe, defending the truths of the goſpel with the armour of light; without the leaſt ſhuddering at the impotent thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of papal mandates. What awful tragedies hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped authority acted, in church and ſtate! It hath ſhed rivers of blood—introduced purgatory, tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, with all the other abſurdities of the church of Rome. Men's ſouls, no leſs than their bodies are thereby enſlaved.</p>
            <p>THOSE ſervile doctrines of indefeaſible right, paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance, are not the doctrines of reaſon, good policy or revelation. An attempt to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them from ſcripture is highly criminal. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to lawful authority, acting agreeable to this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Heaven ſtrictly enjoins; and by this argument enforces <hi>they are miniſters of</hi> GOD <hi>for good.</hi> But, when they become the reverſe, and counteract every kind deſign of Heaven in their ordination—rob mankind of their rights—plunder and deſtroy them—form conſpiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt freedom and the ſtate—commence rebels to the laws of their country, of nature, of reaſon and of GOD—that the Apoſtle's argument for entire ſubjection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its force or that reſiſtance is then a damnable ſin, wants proof. The hiſtory of all ages will evince that the public intereſt hath ſucceeded beſt, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have retained, in a good meaſure, the power in their own hands.</p>

If it flouriſhes, all our intereſts are better ſecured. We muſt ſhare our country's fate. From ſordid views, deſpicable hopes or fears, poſſibly ſome few, may be ſo vile as to abandon their GOD and country. Human language wants a name, to paint out thoſe.—We have the means of perpetuating our privileges, by the divine bleſſing on our endeavours. Our preſent diſtreſſes loudly admoniſh us to ſtir up ourſelves in the fear of GOD. Nor may the moral cauſes thereof be forgotten. The judgments of GOD are executed in token of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to wake up the guilty, ſecure ſinner, that he may learn righteouſneſs and flee from the wrath to come</p>
            <p>WITH deepeſt penitence, we ſhould reflect upon our ſtupidity and careleſsneſs, ſo provoking to GOD, under his ſolemn, remarkable goings. Wonderful have been the diſpenſations of divine providence towards us and our fathers in this land. GOD ſent the waſting peſtilence before them to make way for the ranſomed of the LORD to come in. By a ſeries of remarkable providences GOD hath defended and eſtabliſhed the proteſtant cauſe in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. How often did our predeceſſors experience glorious ſalvation while their numerous enemies were vanquiſhed! Sometimes, GOD with his own hand hath immediately deſtroyed thoſe that ſought our ruin. Thus he did to that powerful French armament, which was ſent againſt us, ſoon after the reduction of <hi>Cape-Briton,</hi> the laſt war but one. To go no further back than the laſt year; GOD hath been merciful to us (in many inſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es) not only beyond our deſerts, but beyond our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The battle at Lexington and Concord (hinted at above) in which a thouſand diſciplined Britons, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by night marched out, ſuddenly fell upon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly maſſacred a few of our countrymen; but were obliged precipitantly to retreat the ſame day; leaving many dead, having more wounded, and before night the reſt almoſt harraſſed to death.</p>

SOON after this, Ticonderoga was taken by our men without the effuſion of any blood.

            <p>VARIOUS artifices had been uſed to engage ſeveral tribes of Indians to fight againſt us; but were remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unſucceſsful. Thoſe who in all former wars thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our blood, would now be at peace with us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the unjuſtifiable methods taken to induce them to diſtreſs our frontiers.</p>
            <p>AT the battle on Bunker's-Hill, in which ſo few of our men were killed, when almoſt ſurrounded with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal numbers and a multitude of cannon, and many, (perhaps more than a thouſand) of the enemy were ſlain, the hand of GOD is to be devoutly acknowledged, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the heads of our men in the day of battle. This action was remarkably calculated to teach our men cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in their advances, and inure them to the thunder of cannon. How ſupriſingly were they ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, longing for another battle!</p>
            <p>WHEN our northern army had inveſted the fort of St. John's and almoſt expended their ammunition; that Chamblee ſhould then be taken, with plenty of warlike ſtores, whereby our army was ſupplied, was owing to a moſt gracious providence.

The ſtrong city of Quebec, defended ('tis ſaid) by 1500 men, was inveſted and afterwards attempted to be ſtormed, by about one thouſand of our men. In this vigorous attack, the gallant General Montgomery, with a number more was ſlain; ſome were captivated and the reſt repulſed.

It is apprehended, Heaven hath not ſuffered one ball in a thouſand, which they have levelled againſt us, to do any execution.</p>
            <p>WE muſt be greatly wanting to ourſelves, to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to our country and to our GOD, if we do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert ourſelves to maintain our rights. The public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, demand the attention of all, in their reſpective de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, to inſpire and invigorate their beſt efforts for its advancement; and eſpecially thoſe in public truſt; that with inextinguiſhable ardour, they purſue the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good. In any member of ſociety a ſelfiſh, narrow, contracted temper is criminal: But in thoſe of public character 'tis odious, and under our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, unſufferable.</p>
            <p>A LATE writer in England obſerves, <q>The nation in general look on the ſtruggle, between the colonies, in defence of their rights and freedom, and the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power which would enſlave them, in a very inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting point of view. They conſider American free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as the palladium of their own. Many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſh for your firmneſs, perſeverance and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. America is conſidered as an aſylum from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. If you preſerve your conſtitutional rights and liberties, you may depend upon it, that people, arts and manufactures will flock to you from all parts of the globe. Riches and power will follow of courſe. Take care that you do not fall into the vices, luxury and oppreſſion, which have brought deſtruction to all former great ſtates and kingdoms, and now threaten

the like to <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Conſider the importance of the parts you are now to act. The freedom and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of yourſelves, your poſterity, of the whole Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh empire, and the oppreſſed of all nations ſeems to depend upon you. Think! O think what ſhould be your conduct where a charge of ſuch conſequence devolves upon you! Providence hath placed you in a moſt important ſtation, ſee that you diſcharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, with faithfulneſs and dignity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Biſhop of ST. ASAPH, in his ſermon before the ſociety, &amp;c. holds up to view the future greatneſs and glory of America, inſtead of repreſenting us as ſavages and barbarians, which had been too common upon that occaſion. In his Lordſhip's patriotic ſpeech in favour of BOSTON's charter, he obſerves, <q>arbitrary taxation is plunder authorized by law. It is the ſupport and eſſence of tyranny, and has done more miſchief to mankind, than thoſe other three ſcourges from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſword, peſtilence and famine. In whatever hands the power of taxation is lodged, it includes and implies all other power. He adds, my Lords, I have ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay my thoughts before you, on the greateſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concern that ever came under your deliberation, with as much honeſty as you will find from others, and with a melancholy aſſurance that not a word of it will be regarded. And yet, my Lords, by your permiſſion, I will waſte one ſhort argument more on the ſame cauſe. My Lords, I look on America as the only great nurſery of freemen now left upon the face of the earth. The moſt precious remains of civil liberty the world can now boaſt of, are now lodged in our hands; and GOD forbid that we ſhould violate ſo ſacred a depoſit. By enſlaving the colonies, you not only ruin the peace, the commerce and fortunes of both countries, but you extinguiſh the faireſt hopes, ſhut up the laſt aſylum of mankind. I think, my
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014675_0024_0F948B9E4D081328"/>
Lords, without being weakly ſuperſtituous, a good man may hope that heaven will take part againſt the execution of a plan which ſeems big, not only with miſchief, but impiety. In which hope we all moſt cordially unite.</q> 
               <hi>Hath not Heaven as yet, anſwered the pious wiſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN addition to what is before mentioned, we may here add, that in the encounters at Noddles and Hog-Iſlands, and in one more lately at Georgia, we loſt not a man, though imminently expoſed.</p>
            <p>DID not Heaven alſo moſt apparently take part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them when it conſumed ſome of their veſſels by lightning: and when a terrible ſtorm deſtroyed much of their ſhipping on the banks of Newfoundland, with the treaſures they had taken out of the ſeas, where we had been prohibited fiſhing—many men loſt their lives, (ſome ſay above three thouſand) who, it is confidently affirmed were to have come againſt us, when the ſeaſon for fiſhing was over. GOD immediately interpoſed, and prevented them. Beſides, the colonies are ſurprizingly united, conſidering the methods that have been uſed to divide and deſtroy. What Union and reſolution have our provincial aſſemblies and conventions mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted! How wonderfully has the ſpirit of wiſdom, love, peace, goodneſs, unanimity, and fortitude inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the grand American Congreſs! To their reſolves, the people have yielded remarkable obedience. In all which GOD is to be acknowledged; and while the propect bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens before us, our obligations to ſupport our rights are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſed. Under the Jewiſh Theocracy, GOD deſtroyed thoſe who were intimidated, and diſcouraged their brethren.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>MAY it pleaſe your HONOR, the honorable COUNCIL, and REPRESENTATIVES, in General Court aſſembled:</p>
            <p>IN this dark and difficult day, you will conſider yourſelves as the guardians of our excellent conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which has true Engliſh liberty for its baſis. Nor can it fail of giving you ſingular conſolation, that (under GOD) you hold theſe places of public truſt and honor, by the ſpontaneous ſuffrages of a free people. You will ever bear in mind, that wiſdom, prudence, courage and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, a public and patriotic ſpirit (which on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion have ſo often been recommended) with the true fear of GOD in your hearts, are eſſential qualifications for civil rulers—Religion inſpires the mind with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude—makes it truly great, and in ſcripture, always forms a principal part of the good ruler's character. <hi>The fear of the</hi> LORD <hi>is the beginning</hi> and perfection <hi>of wiſdom.</hi> It wou'd be moſt abſurd for the miniſters of GOD not to revere the Almighty. Therefore, you will conſider yourſelves as under peculiar obligations to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify religion. To promote virtue, example is more efficacious than human laws. While you ſhow your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the noble patrons of chriſtian liberty, you will patronize learning by all due encouragements.</p>

When you are called to deliberations and determinations of moſt univerſal concern, may GOD grant you all that wiſdom, grace, firmneſs and magnanimity you need.

Let your heads, hands, fortunes and lives be devoted and conſecrated to your country's good. When our hoſt goeth forth, againſt the moſt unnatural enemy, let us keep ourſelves from every wicked thing, as we would not pull down Heaven's vengeance upon the land, and thoſe who defend the common cauſe.
