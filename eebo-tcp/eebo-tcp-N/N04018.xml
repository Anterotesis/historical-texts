         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Some take it as a Wiſh for his Recovery of <hi>bodily Health;</hi> making the Proſperity of his <hi>Soul</hi> (which is here acknowledg'd) the Rule and Standard of that. And in this View of the Words, we might note from them, That ſuch as have <hi>proſperous Souls</hi> may nevertheleſs have <hi>ſickly</hi> and <hi>afflicted Bodies:</hi> And for the weakly and ſick Servants of Chriſt, we ſhould wiſh their Recovery of <hi>Health,</hi> as the greateſt outward Bleſſing: And finally, it's a <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>admirable</hi> Caſe, when any one is viſibly ſo bleſſed in Spirituals, as that we may venture to make the Meaſure of his <hi>Soul-Proſperity</hi> the Rule of our Wiſhes for his <hi>bodily Health.</hi> Alaſs, what Multitudes are there of neglected and unproſpering Souls, even among Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Profeſſors,

whether ſick or well in Body! And as for ſuch, to make the Apoſtle's Wiſh in this Senſe, wou'd be a curſing, rather than bleſſing them, and wou'd imply a wiſhing them undone for both Worlds, miſerable both in Body and Soul.—But I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Text in this Light at preſent.</p>
            <p>Others take it as a Wiſh for the Health and Proſperity of his <hi>Soul.</hi> And conſidering it in this View, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Obſervations may be made from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is ſuch a Thing as the <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Health of the Soul.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Soul-Proſperity and Health is the <hi>beſt Bleſſing</hi> we can wiſh to any.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The moſt healthy and proſperous Soul is capable of ſtill <hi>further Improvements;</hi> and accordingly (whatever we wiſh any one) an Increaſe of ſpiritual Proſperity and Health is <hi>above all Things</hi> to be wiſhed for him.</p>

The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt ſhould and faithful Miniſters will (as they have Opportunity) be <hi>obſervant</hi> of the Symptoms of Soul-Proſperity and Health in others, readily <hi>acknowledge</hi> the ſame where it appears, and make it their moſt ardent <hi>Wiſh</hi> on behalf of their chriſtian Friends, that they may increaſe herein.—But this laſt, being peculiarly a Leſſon to myſelf, I ſhall reſerve for the Subject of my own private Meditations; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy this Diſcourſe on the three former, which are of more common Concernment.</p>

               <p>Here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall briefly premiſe ſome Hints upon the <hi>Subject</hi> of this Proſperity and Health, the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004954_0004_100E461757F98708"/>We read, <hi>Job</hi> 32.8. <hi>There is a Spirit in Man; and the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them Underſtanding.</hi> The Scriptures every where ſuppoſe Man a Compound of Matter and Spirit. The Soul is an intelligent and undying Principle within us; a ſpiritual inviſible think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subſtance, diſtinct from our material and animal Part; ſurvives the Body, and has an eternal Exiſtence. [See <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28.] Hence holy <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to <hi>depart,</hi> that he might <hi>be with Chriſt,</hi> that is, in his immortal Spirit. (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.) When the Man <hi>Jeſus</hi> felt his Body diſſolving, he <hi>committed his Spirit</hi> into his Father's Hand, and <hi>gave up the Ghoſt. (Luke</hi> 23.46.) So dying <hi>Stephen</hi> went out of the World calling upon the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to <hi>receive his Spirit. (Acts</hi> 7.59.) —What are the <hi>Spirits in Priſon</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19.) but Souls of wicked Men departed this Life, and doom'd to a State of Miſery in the other World? And what are <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect</hi> (Heb. 12.23.) but the Souls of Believers diſcharg'd from the Incumbrance of their Clay-Tabernacles, and paſſed into Glory? — In a Word, what are <hi>we</hi> that dwell on the Face of the Earth, but Spirits that <hi>abide in the Fleſh?</hi> (Phil. 1.24.) Hence the LORD is ſtiled <hi>the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh.</hi> (Num. 27.16.) He is ſo, as he <hi>formeth the Spirit of Man within him</hi> (Zech. 12.1.) and as <hi>his Viſitation preſerveth our Spirit.</hi> (Job. 10.12.)</p>
               <p>O let us all remember, and carry the Thought about with us continually, that we have <hi>Souls,</hi> as well as Bodies: <hi>Souls</hi> unſpeakably preferrible to our Bodies; <hi>Souls, the Redemption whereof is precious</hi> (Pſal. 49.8.) <hi>Souls, the Salvation</hi> whereof is the <hi>End of our Faith</hi> (1 Pet. 1.9.) And <hi>Souls,</hi> the <hi>keeping</hi> whereof we muſt daily <hi>commit to God, as to a faithful Creator, in well-doing</hi> (1 Pet. 4.19.) Not caring for the Things of the World, what we ſhall eat or drink, or wherewith be cloathed, but <hi>caring for the Things of the Lord, that we may be holy both in Body and Spirit</hi> (1 Cor. 7.34.) That we may <hi>glorify God in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004954_0005_100E461982D5BD10"/>
our Body, and in our Spirit, which are God's</hi> (1 Cor. 6.20.) <hi>As Strangers and Pilgrims, abſtaining from fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul;</hi> and <hi>living unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> as thoſe who <hi>were as Sheep going aſtray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls.</hi> (1 Pet. 2.11, 25.)</p>
               <p>O my Brethren, the SOUL is the Man. God the Father of Spirits, he weigheth the Spirits, and judgeth of you by the hidden Man of the Heart. You ought alſo to judge of yourſelves by this; and if you wou'd know what Manner of Perſons you are, you muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know what Manner of Spirit you are of.—You muſt take Heed to your Spirit, denominate yourſelves from this, and make this your principal Care. O let not the Fleſh and the World have the Aſcendant in your Eſteem, and the Throne in your Hearts. Let not your Soul lie neglected, and bury'd in the Pleaſures of Senſe, or the Cares of this Life. <hi>What is a Man profited, if he gain the whole World, and loſe his Soul? Or what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> (Matth. 16.26.) Learn, I beſeech you (my Friends) every one of you, to place a juſt Value upon your immortal Part, and to make your <hi>Soul</hi> your Care in the firſt Place. Think often and think ſolemnly, that you have a <hi>Soul</hi> made for Immortality, bound to an eternal World, and which in a little Time muſt be conſign'd to an unalterable State of Happineſs or Miſery. And can any of you bear the Thought of going to Hell, or miſſing of Heaven at laſt! O ſee your Danger, and don't <hi>deſtroy your own Soul.</hi> Realiſe the Neceſſity of caring for your <hi>Soul;</hi> and look that you do not <hi>reward Evil to yourſelves,</hi> thro' Preſumption or Deſpair. Tremble to think what <hi>Indignation</hi> &amp; <hi>Wrath, Tribulation</hi> &amp; <hi>Anguiſh</hi> ſhall be upon <hi>every Soul of Man that doeth Evil.</hi> But remember, that <hi>the Soul of the Righteous</hi> ſhall inherit <hi>Glory, Honour</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> everlaſting. And altho' you may ſome of you be without any preſent Grounds for Hope of this, as having in you ſtill <hi>the Soul of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004954_0006_100E461CAD6FF928"/>
Wicked,</hi> an evil Heart of Unbelief; yet thro' the Riches of divine Grace there's a Poſſibility of getting your <hi>Soul reſtored</hi> to Life, yea, to Health and Proſperity by Jeſus Chriſt. Tho' your Soul be in a State of Perdition, yet not ſuch as that of the Spirits in Priſon. No, while the God of all Patience reprieves you from Hell, you ought to look on it as poſſible for you to eſcape the Wrath to come; poſſible for you to be born from above, and ſo to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. You have a <hi>Soul,</hi> tho' ſpiritually <hi>dead,</hi> yet capable of being raiſed into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Life by the Power of God, and of being made a <hi>Veſſel of Mercy, prepared for Glory;</hi> yea, capable of a bleſſed Proſperity and Health in the preſent World, a ſpiritual Health and Proſperity, which is the Beginning and Earneſt of everlaſting Glory and Felicity.</p>
               <p>This leads us,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To conſider that <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> mention'd in our Text, as what the <hi>Soul</hi> is the Subject of.</p>
               <p>Now if we view the Soul of Man in it's <hi>philoſophical</hi> Notion only, it may be ſaid to proſper and be in Health, when the <hi>Intellectuals</hi> are not in a diſeas'd infirm Eſtate, but ſound, regular and vigorous as to the common Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Reaſon; the Wit ſharp, the Judgment ſolid, the Memory tenacious, Ideas clear, and Arguings ſtrong, Knowledge increaſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—But this State of the human Underſtanding is common to Saints and Sinners; is but a partial and very defective, low Kind of Soul-Proſperity, and capable of exiſting ſeparate from that intended in our Text. It may be called indeed rather the Health of the <hi>Brain,</hi> than of the Soul; at leaſt it depends imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the happy Texture of the Brain, a regular Circulation of the nervous Fluids, and Freedom of the animal Spirits, producing a lively Imagination, and aſſiſting the intellectual Functions.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle in our Text had a more exalted View, and wou'd be underſtood in a <hi>theological</hi> Senſe. The <hi>Proſperity and Health of Soul,</hi> which he ſpeaks of, is of a ſublime and ſpiritual Nature, not merely intellectual, but moral; and refers not ſo much to an orderly State of the

                  <hi>Head,</hi> conſidering Man merely as rational and ſocial; but to the holy Frame of his <hi>Heart,</hi> his Conſcience, Will and Affections, as well as Underſtanding, conſidering him in his Relation to GOD, as a Subject of moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Creature formed for religious Service, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the glorifying and enjoying of God, his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End.</p>
               <p>Looking at Man in this Light, his <hi>Soul</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>proſper</hi> and be in <hi>in Health,</hi> when his Powers as a moral Agent are reduc'd under a proper Regulation, and duly exerciſed on their reſpective Objects; ſo as that the <hi>Soul</hi> truly anſwers the End of its Being, and enjoys that inward moral and ſpiritual Happineſs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was originally deſigned for. There is ſuch a Thing as Proſperity and Health of the Soul in this Senſe, actually exiſtent in the Life which now is, tho' too uncommon.</p>
               <p>Indeed conſidered as taking Place in the preſent World, it is not to be underſtood in a ſtrict and abſolute Senſe, as if any Souls dwelling in Fleſh had already attained, or cou'd attain a proper (legal) <hi>Perfection</hi> of Holineſs and moral Happineſs, excluſive of all Mixtures, and free from all Defects. For even inſpir'd Prophets and Apoſtles renounc'd all Pretenſions to this; as you may read both in the old Teſtament and New. [<hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9.—<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13.—1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10.— 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8.]</p>
               <p>Verily, ſince the Day of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, there never was an Example of complete unblemiſh'd Sanctity, or indefective moral Felicity; ſave only the Man <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who being conceived in a miraculous Way, by the Power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> was exempt from the common Contagion of original Sin, and his Life (in Correſpondence to his innocent Nature) <hi>holy, harmleſs, and undefiled.</hi> But excepting this ſingle Inſtance, never was Man upon Earth whoſe <hi>Soul</hi> enjoy'd <hi>Proſperity</hi> and moral <hi>Health</hi> in a ſtrict Perfection. This is reſerved for the peculiar Priviledge of the coming World. And the <hi>Saints in the Earth,</hi> the moſt excellent of them, muſt be

ſaid to be in an unproſperous unhealthy State of Soul, compar'd with the perfected Spirits in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, there is a Senſe, a lax and leſs proper Senſe, in which ſome Souls ſtill tabernacling in mortal Bodies of Fleſh and Blood, may be ſaid to <hi>proſper</hi> and be <hi>in Health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wou'd obſerve here diſtinctly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a <hi>comparative</hi> Light, as viewed in Contradiſtinction to <hi>unregenerate</hi> Sinners, all that are <hi>born again</hi> may be ſaid to have <hi>Souls proſpering</hi> and <hi>in Health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Righteous are repreſented as a <hi>peculiar People,</hi> a <hi>choſen Generation;</hi> whoſe ſpiritual State, moral Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Soul-Privileges and Relations are all ſuch as ſpeak them <hi>the excellent in the Earth, more excellent</hi> than others. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26.) The <hi>Ungodly</hi> are Strangers to thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings, which righteous Souls enjoy. They may proſper in the World, heap up Riches, and ſwim in ſenſual Pleaſures, poſſeſs uninterrupted Health of Body, yea, and very improv'd Intellectuals too: But ſtill their <hi>Souls</hi> do not <hi>proſper,</hi> in the Senſe of our Text; no, their Souls are <hi>lean from Day to Day,</hi> in a ſtarving pining periſhing Condition.—Whereas now the <hi>Godly</hi> are ſuch as have been <hi>born again, born of God,</hi> begotten to a new, a divine and heavenly Life; and have Meat to eat, which the World knows nothing of, whereby the divine Life is ſupported and nouriſh'd in them.</p>
               <p>A regenerating Change indeed is the <hi>fundamental</hi> Thing. True Proſperity and Health of Soul implies an habitual State of moral Rectitude, reſtor'd to the Soul in the new Birth. <hi>Health</hi> preſuppoſes <hi>Life:</hi> This is as the Foundation, and that as the Superſtructure. Spiritual Life is the radical Principle; which the Soul muſt have put into it by the creating Hand of God, or it can never be ſaid to <hi>proſper</hi> and be <hi>in Health.</hi> The Man in this happy Caſe is one whom <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> in ſuch a Meaſure, as that his <hi>Soul</hi> may be ſaid truly to be <hi>alive unto God,</hi> to <hi>live in the Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>walk, not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> He is no longer

               </p>
               <p>The holy Scriptures, concurrent with the Experience and Obſervation of all Ages, do repreſent Mankind as in a <hi>fallen</hi> Condition; their Souls miſerably out of Order, infeebled, deprav'd, and corrupted in all their Powers; ſo far from Health and Proſperity, that they are by Nature even <hi>dead in Sins.</hi> Indeed Man was at firſt form'd after the <hi>Image of God,</hi> in every Faculty poſſeſſing an excellent Rectitude. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29.) But by ſinning againſt God, our firſt Parents fell from the Eſtate, wherein they were created; and all <hi>Adam</hi>'s natural Poſterity, being not only in his Loins, but included in the Covenant made with him, and ſo involv'd in the common Guilt of the firſt Tranſgreſſion, do juſtly inherit the Pollution contracted and the Miſery incur'd by his Apoſtaſy. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 19.)</p>
               <p>But, bleſſed be the God of all Grace, who in his infinite Wiſdom and Mercy has found out an admirable Expedient for our Recovery, and in the Fulneſs of Time ſent his Son, incarnate in human Nature, to ſave his People from their Sins. He was <hi>wounded for our Tranſgreſſions,</hi> that <hi>by his Stripes</hi> we might be <hi>healed.</hi> (Iſai. 53.5.) He <hi>gave himſelf for us, that he might purify unto himſelf a peculiar People.</hi> (Tit. 2.14.)</p>
               <p>And ſuch a People he actually hath in the World; <hi>which in Time paſt were not a People, but are now the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,</hi> who <hi>by his Stripes are healed.</hi> (1 Pet. 2.10, 24.) Multitudes have experienc'd the purifying Efficacy of his Blood, the healing Virtue of his Croſs, and the quickning Power of his Reſurrection; even ſome of the greateſt Sinners. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 5.)</p>
               <p>Now the Work of the Holy Ghoſt in applying the Redemption by Chriſt, for the quickning and healing of Men's Spirits, is one Thing imply'd in this <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Health of the Soul,</hi> as eſſentially neceſſary to it: and in regard of that, every believing Soul may be ſaid to be <hi>in Health</hi> and <hi>proſper,</hi> if compar'd with what it was by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004954_0010_100E462B70F04260"/>
Nature, or with what the Souls of ſuch be as are yet unconverted.</p>
               <p>Be the Faculties of the Soul, in its meer <hi>rational</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ever ſo much enlarg'd and improv'd; be it inriched with all Knowledge; be its Chambers filled with Treaſures of common Science and human Prudence: Yet if there be not a renewing Operation of the HOLY GHOST, producing a total Change in the <hi>moral</hi> Temper and Frame of the Soul, it is not a Soul <hi>proſpering</hi> and <hi>in Health.</hi> No, 'tis a ſickly, feeble, crazy, poor and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul, notwithſtanding all its intellectual Furniture; yea, and notwithſtanding any Ornaments of ſeeming <hi>Virtue,</hi> it may make a Shew of, which is merely <hi>Ethical,</hi> and reaches little higher than the ſenſitive Appetites.</p>
               <p>The <hi>inner Man</hi> muſt be heal'd of all the ſpiritual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers and Wounds it got by the Fall, and which have been increas'd and inflam'd by actual Sins from time to time: The Blindneſs of the Mind, the Hardneſs of the Heart, and Numbneſs of the Conſcience, the Stubbornneſs of the Will, the Madneſs of the Paſſions, and every moral Diſeaſe muſt be bro't under an effectual Cure; or elſe the <hi>Soul</hi> can't be ſaid to <hi>be in Health and proſper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Soul that may juſtly have this Character apply'd to it, is a Soul awaken'd out of its native State of ſpiritual Death, and reſtor'd to its true and genuine <hi>Life:</hi> A Soul, that has <hi>Chriſt formed in it,</hi> that is <hi>quicken'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him,</hi> and made <hi>conformable</hi> to him: A Soul <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed</hi> by the Holy Spirit, in all its Powers; the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding rightly inform'd, and the Judgment rightly fix'd; the Will rightly bent and reſolv'd; the Conſcience purg'd and rightly engag'd; the Affections placed on right Objects, and the Paſſions reduc'd under a right Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Soul, that has juſt Ideas impreſs'd upon it, and wiſe Thoughts prevailing in it; a Soul, that has its Views directed to the beſt Ends, and whoſe chief Study is to pleaſe and honour God; a Soul, that is weaned from this preſent World, that is cut off from the Love of Sin, and no longer makes Self it's Idol, is divorced from the Law, and ſubdu'd to the Goſpel: A Soul, that has Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that lives by Faith, and brings forth Fruits meet for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; that dwells in Love, and has its Converſation in Heaven; delights in the Service of God, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him: in a Word, a Soul attemper'd by Grace to the Performance of ſpiritual Duties, and to the Fruition of ſpiritual Bleſſings; humbled by a Senſe of its own Unworthineſs, and yet truſting in Chriſt Jeſus, and longing for the Enjoyment of him in Glory everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This, this is the Soul alive and in Health; and which only can be ſaid to <hi>proſper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Soul has noble Lineaments of the moral <hi>Image</hi> of God upon it: This Soul is a <hi>Temple</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt; and has <hi>eternal Life</hi> commenced in it. This Soul has <hi>Heaven</hi> as it were bro't down into it. 'Tis bound for Heaven, &amp; intitled to it, as its proper Inheritance; is in an habitual Preparedneſs for it, and ſhall for certain be finally put in Poſſeſſion of it.—This Soul is furniſh'd with thoſe <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> that are the true Riches. This Soul is become <hi>Light</hi> in the Lord, and has found the Knowlege of the holy One, that Pearl of great Price. This Soul is a Partaker of his <hi>Holineſs;</hi> a Partaker of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in all its reveal'd and communicable moral Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tho' as yet in a very imperfect Degree.—This Soul obtains <hi>Peace</hi> in believing, and good <hi>Hope</hi> through Grace; and has everlaſting <hi>Conſolation,</hi> at leaſt in the Principles and Grounds of it, or in Title and Reverſion, if not in actual Enjoyment.—This Soul is admitted into all thoſe divine and ſpiritual <hi>Relations,</hi> and relative Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which are connected with true Proſperity, and which the Saints in Heaven eſteem their Bleſſedneſs and great Glory. Such a Soul, being vitally and myſtically united to Chriſt, is made the Righteouſneſs of God in him, and has the Righteouſneſs of God our Saviour imputed to him for his Juſtification; has Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction placed to his Account, and his Debt to vindictive Juſtice cancel'd, no more to be remembred againſt him. His Guilt is totally and for ever blotted out; he's out of Debt; is made accepted in the Beloved, and ſtands unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004954_0012_100E4633306E9EE0"/>
right in the Court of Heaven. This Soul is ally'd to Angels, eſpouſed to Chriſt, reconciled to God, adopted into his Family, and appointed an Heir of Salvation with eternal Glory.—This Soul is in an habitual <hi>Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> for all <hi>Events;</hi> and as no Evil ſhall come nigh to hurt it, ſo in its own Apprehenſion (while conſcious of its bleſſed State,) nothing can happen amiſs to it: For it has learnt to look with a ſacrificing Eye upon all its deareſt Enjoyments, and has the Aſſurance from God, that all Things work together for Good to them that love him.— This is the truly <hi>living Soul.</hi> Chriſt has given it <hi>eternal Life,</hi> and declar'd that it ſhall never periſh, nor ſhall any of its Adverſaries be able to pluck it out of his Hands. Being in Chriſt, there is no Condemnation to ſuch an one. He is not of them which draw back unto Perdition, but of them which believe to the ſaving of the Soul: And nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate him from the Love of God in Chriſt.—In a Word, ſuch a Soul, waſhed, juſtify'd and ſanctify'd as it is, hath a Title to and Meetneſs for the heavenly Inheritance. This is purchas'd for him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and promis'd to him, taken Poſſeſſion of by the Forerunner in his Behalf, and an Earneſt given him by the Spirit which dwelleth in him. He has Treaſure in Heaven, and none can rob him of it.</p>
               <p>Happy the Soul, in ſuch a Caſe! How excellent its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, how glorious its Condition! Such a Soul may be ſaid truly to <hi>proſper</hi> and <hi>be in Health;</hi> at leaſt in Compare with the Souls of others. Surely the <hi>ungodly are not ſo:</hi> But are empty of all truly moral and ſpiritual Good, wretched and miſerable and poor and blind and naked; condemn'd as Criminals by the Law, led Captive by the Devil, and pining to Death in their Chains.—Compar'd with them, every renew'd Soul, tho' but a Babe in Chriſt, a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Grace, and a Child in Underſtanding, compaſſed about with many Infirmities, may nevertheleſs be called a <hi>Soul proſpering and in Health.</hi>

                  <p>Had the firſt Man perſever'd in his Obedience, he had for ever poſſeſs'd, and ſo had we, a Soul <hi>in Health</hi> and <hi>proſperous,</hi> with regard to intellectual and moral Perfections and Bleſſings.—But alaſs! <hi>By one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners. By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, in that</hi> (or in whom) <hi>all have ſinned. By the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation. Then were all dead.</hi>—'Tis the Scripture-Account of the Origin of that Darkneſs, Defilement, Diſorder, and Death, which now diſgraces human Nature; and which Mankind uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally had been everlaſting Strangers to, if <hi>Adam</hi> (our firſt Father and federal Head) had ſtood in his primitive Character and Condition, wherewith a good God ſaw fit to honour and diſtinguiſh him.</p>
                  <p>O what Bluſhing and Shame, what Trembling and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row become us, when we conſider how awfully Man differs now from what he was originally, as he came out of his Creator's Hand! With what Tears of Confuſion and Aſtoniſhment ſhou'd we lament our common Guilt and Fall in <hi>Adam!</hi> Verily Tears of Blood are not ſufficient for us to ſhed on ſo fearful and melancholly an Occaſion. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our Head: Wo to us that we have ſinned!</hi> Alas, we were <hi>altogether born in Sin;</hi> and in this Senſe, <hi>were Tranſgreſſors from the Womb.</hi> We brought into the World with us a <hi>carnal Mind,</hi> an <hi>evil Heart;</hi> and <hi>out of the evil Treaſure in our evil Heart</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all our evil Thoughts, and evil Words and Actions. O how loathſome and forlorn our Caſe in a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! <hi>The whole Head is ſick, and the whole Heart faint; there's no Soundneſs in us; but we are full of Wounds and Bruiſes and putrifying Sores, from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot,</hi> in moral and ſpiritual Reſpects. And well then may God's Soul abhor us in our natural

State, even as our Soul loatheth him. Surely <hi>we were by Nature the Children of Wrath, even as others,</hi> being <hi>the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> (Eph. 2.2, 3.)</p>
                  <p>Let us labour for a thorow <hi>Conviction</hi> of this Doctrine of Original Sin. 'Tis moſt evidently the Doctrine of Scripture: and abundantly confirm'd by the penitential Confeſſions of Believers in every Age. Nor can any of you, if you conſult your own Experience, find juſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to diſpute it. Do you not feel a <hi>Law of Sin</hi> working in you, and <hi>the Imagination of your Heart evil from your Youth up?</hi> (Gen. 8.21.) Were not the earlieſt Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Reaſon in you attended with Out-breakings of Corruption? How can you account for the firſt <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>luſtful Thought</hi> you had, but by aſſigning an <hi>evil Heart</hi> as the immediate Cauſe? Surely, it did not come from <hi>without</hi> but ſprang from <hi>within,</hi> out of the Heart (<hi>Mar.</hi> 7.21) <hi>Then when Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin.</hi> (Jam. 1.15.) And while we ſee <hi>Children</hi> ſo early, ſo univerſally mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting an Averſion to what is Good, and a Diſpoſition to what is Evil, very often too againſt the Light of the beſt Inſtructions, againſt the Force of the beſt Examples, and notwithſtanding all poſſible Reſtraints of a wiſe and holy Government over them, what other Cauſe can we reſolve the ſad Effect into, but the native Pravity of their own Mind and Conſcience? This is the Root of Bitterneſs, which ſpringing up betimes, doth ſo defile our Childhood and Youth. The Fruit being ſo early and conſtantly bad, argues the Tree to be bad. <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit; neither can a corrupt Tree produce good Fruit: Wherefore by their Fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> And by this Rule of judging, we know every one to be by Nature a <hi>corrupt Tree:</hi> not excepting even the rare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch as are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctify'd from the Womb.</hi> For theſe being ſanctify'd but in part, do by the frequent breaking out of remaining Luſts diſcover, that they were originally <hi>corrupt Trees,</hi> even as others.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine lies in the Foundation of the grand Scheme of Man's <hi>Redemption.</hi> For without the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of original Sin, what ſo great Need was there for the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004954_0015_100E463BDDA20388"/>
Mediation of the Son of God, or for the Sanctification of the Spirit? Might not merely the <hi>Reſtraints</hi> of Providence and common Grace have been ſufficient to preſerve <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity innocent, if born free of all Participation with him in his Guilt and Pollution? And if ſo, what Occaſion for all that Coſt and Pains, which the only wiſe God has laid out in the Affair of Man's Salvation! But if that be conſider'd, Things muſt needs appear in a very different Light to every impartial Inquirer.—Let this Thought teach you (my Friends) the <hi>Importance</hi> of the Doctrine of original Sin; and ſerve to ſettle you in the firm Perſwaſion of its <hi>Truth.</hi> Be upon your Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impotent Cavils and perverſe Diſputings of Men of corrupt Minds. <hi>Let no Man deceive you with vain Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And being eſtabliſhed in the Belief of the Truth, be often entertaining your Minds with ſerious <hi>Meditations</hi> upon it; applying it ſolemnly to your own Caſe, and bringing it home to your ſelves in particular. If any of you are among the happy Examples of <hi>early Piety,</hi> give God the Glory of his diſtinguiſhing Grace towards you, and be you very thankful: Yet never forget the abject Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you were born in; guilty, polluted, and wretched, like the reſt of the World. Nor have you quite ſhock off <hi>the old Man</hi> to this Day, but have <hi>a Body of Death,</hi> to be groaning under as long as you live on Earth; and the Senſe of this muſt needs daily call back your Thoughts to the <hi>Day of your Nativity,</hi> when you <hi>lay in your Blood, caſt out to the loathing of your Perſon.</hi>—But are not ſome of you only as <hi>whited Sepulchres?</hi> Perhaps by the Advantage of a religious Education, and early Strivings of the Spirit, you may have been kept from many groſſer Follies, may have behav'd orderly, with ſomething of moral Decency, yea, with an Appearance of real Piety, more than common, yet all this while remain unacquainted with vital Godlineſs, and your inward Part is very Wickedneſs. If ſtill uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, your <hi>Heart</hi> is like the reſt of the Sons of Men, <hi>full of Evil:</hi> having in it the Seeds of the worſt Immoralities, which wou'd ſhoot up, and bring forth abominable Fruits, were

it not for divine Reſtraints. Alas, the very beſt of you in a State of Nature, are but as the <hi>Lion</hi> in a Cage, whoſe native Fierceneſs is not mortify'd, tho' he appear cool and tame. Or you are as the <hi>Swine,</hi> tho' externally waſhed from its Filthineſs, yet retaining ſtill its natural Diſpoſition to wallow in the Mire. Such as you, have greateſt Need very frequently and ſolemlny to dwell in your Thoughts upon the deep Depravity of human Nature; leſt you ſhou'd be impos'd upon by deceiving Appearances, and loſe your Souls by a falſe Peace, for want of an effectual Sight of inherent Corruption.—And you who are now <hi>bearing the Reproach of your Youth,</hi> ſtained with open Impiety &amp; Vice, while you mourn your earlieſt Crimes, as well as later Offences, ſee that you run up all to the Spring-head, as repenting <hi>David</hi> did, and bewail your unhappy Caſe as <hi>ſhapen in Iniquity</hi> and <hi>conceived in Sin.</hi> (Pſal. 51.5.)</p>
                  <p>A mortifying and humbling Reflection this to us all! What can ſuch baſe-born Wretches as we, have to glory in! How abſurd for us, that are by Nature of ſo filthy and vile a Spirit, ſo guilty and miſerable, to pride ourſelves in the Beauty of our Bodies, in the Honour of our Parentage, in the Riches of our Inheritance, or even the Privileges of our Baptiſm and Education! O my Friends, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of original Sin ſhou'd <hi>hide Pride from Man,</hi> and darken the Glory of all our external Proſperity, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Advantages too, whether natural or acquir'd. O let us get and maintain a realiſing affecting Senſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin, which has ſo impoveriſhed, deform'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd and degraded our Souls: And let the Thought of this ſubdue our Pride and Vanity, give a powerful Check to every ſelf-exalting Imagination, humble us to the Duſt, keep us low in our own Eyes, and make us even abhor our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the holy God, with whom we have to do. To this End let us beg at the Throne of Grace, that a divine <hi>Light</hi> may <hi>ſhine into our Hearts,</hi> to lay them open to our View, and thorowly convince us of the <hi>evil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi> which <hi>cleaveth to us;</hi> elſe we ſhall never be duly humbled, and brought to repair to the Healer of Souls.</p>

                     <hi>USE II.</hi> We have Reaſon to admire the infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, in raiſing up a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to reſtore our Souls from the Ruins of the Fall; and ſhou'd adore his amazing <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the Recovery of apoſtate Creatures.</head>
                  <p>O what Manner of <hi>Love</hi> is this, that when we had been ruin'd by Means of the Sin and Fall of the firſt Man, another Mediator ſhou'd be rais'd up, &amp; ſent to redeem us out of that State of Guilt and Miſery we were plung'd into, and reſtore our <hi>Souls</hi> once more to <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Health!</hi> Had the bleſſed God ſeen fit, he might have glorify'd his Juſtice in our everlaſting Deſtruction, without a Remedy; as he caſt off the <hi>Angels</hi> which ſinned. But O aſtoniſhing Diſtinction of ſovereign Grace, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for our Recovery by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Lord from Heaven! <hi>Herein is Love; not that we loved God, but that God loved us, and ſent his only begotton Son, that we might live thro' him.</hi> (1 Joh. 4.10.)—And O the amazing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion of the Son of God, who <hi>though he was rich, yet for our Sakes became poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be rich.</hi> (2 Cor. 8.9.) O the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould come to <hi>reſtore that which he took not away;</hi> that he ſhould ſuffer for Sins (the Juſt for the Unjuſt) in order to bring us unto God, that our Souls might live and proſper and be bleſſed for ever. Never was there ſuch Love as this, ſeen amongſt Men, or Angels. <hi>The Love of Chriſt paſſeth Knowledge.</hi> We cannot ſufficiently admire it. — Nor can we eno' admire the Condeſcenſion and Grace of God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in undertaking the Office of applying the Salvation purchaſed by Chriſt to the elect People of God. O if we have been made Partakers of the Benefit, methinks we can't but ſing the Praiſes of divine Love.</p>
                  <p>And ſurprizing is the Diſplay of divine <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the Work of Redemption, as God has wonderfully ſuited his Salvation to the Nature of Man and the Reaſon of Things, to the Ends of his own Glory and our Felicity. He does not ſave Men <hi>in their Sins,</hi> but from them; and reſtores
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004954_0018_100E4647AF6A61C8"/>
that moral Purity to the Soul, which is fundamental to the Happineſs of reaſonable Creatures, and was indeed our primitive Glory. In this he manifeſts his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> together.</p>
                  <p>And how is the <hi>Power</hi> of God magnify'd in this ſo great Salvation! The SON of God diſplay'd his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence in the obtaining eternal Redemption for us. And the SPIRIT of God reveals his almighty Arm in the <hi>Application</hi> of purchaſed Redemption. When any Soul is begotten to a new and ſpiritual Life, and begins to <hi>proſper</hi> and be <hi>in Health,</hi> it is <hi>by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Self-Converſion is as much an Impoſſibility to the Sinner, by his own ſolitary Strength, as Self-Reſurrection to a breathleſs Corpſe. Neither is this Work in the Power of Means and Inſtruments. No, the whole Efficiency is DIVINE. All created Holineſs is but a Ray from <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> who ariſeth on whom he will <hi>with Healing in his Wings.</hi> Only the ſame almighty Hand, which form'd Man at firſt after the <hi>Image</hi> of God, is able to reſtore it in the Soul. Upon a Survey of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their loſt and dead Eſtate, the Language of the Prophet might fitly be ſighed over them, <hi>Can theſe dry Bones live!</hi> And it muſt be confeſſed, <hi>With Man it is unpoſſible: But all Things are poſſible with God.</hi> The converting and healing of a Soul, verily 'tis the LORD'S Doing. 'Tis ſpoken of as a <hi>creating</hi> Work, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to <hi>raiſing the Dead</hi> (Eph. 2.5, 10.) Which imports an irreſiſtible Omnipotence exerted in producing the bleſſed Effect.—Look off from Creatures, look above Men and Means, when you behold any Inſtance of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, under the Miniſtry of the Word; and think not <hi>as though by our own Power or Holineſs we had made this Man to walk.</hi> No, but <hi>the Power of the Lord was preſent to heal him.</hi>—And let me note to you by the Way, that all thoſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> are juſtly to be ſuſpected as <hi>falſe,</hi> which exalt the Power of <hi>Man,</hi> and deny the Neceſſity of a <hi>divine</hi> Influence, to work a regenerating Change in Sinners. The Caſe of the <hi>Woman</hi> (Luk. 8.43.) <hi>which had ſpent all her Living upon Phyſicians, neither could be healed of any,</hi> is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004954_0019_100E464A459C7660"/>
a lively Emblem of the Caſe of an apoſtate Soul, <hi>without Strength</hi> to reſtore itſelf, and finding the whole Creation <hi>without any healing Medicines.</hi> The Aſſerters of <hi>Pelagian</hi> FREE-WILL, or the Sufficiency of our natural Faculties, by human Helps, without the immediate Operation of ſupernatural Grace, to the Ends of Holineſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, appear in my Apprehenſion very evidently <hi>removed from the Grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel, which yet is not another.</hi> Our Lord has left us that expreſs Aſſurance, WITHOUT ME YE CAN DO NOTHING. And <hi>if any Man teach otherwiſe, not conſenting to wholeſome Words, even the Words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is proud, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing.</hi>—Let us look on this Doctrine of Chriſt as <hi>a Doctrine according to Godlineſs:</hi> I truſt you have (ſome of you) found it ſuch by happy Experience, and you ought boldly to confeſs it; however profane Wits may explode and flout at it, in their vain Opinion of an Ability and Liberty in fallen Man, which derogates from the Honour of divine Grace, and perverts the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>O let the Sovereignty and Power, Wiſdom, Holineſs and Mercy of God in the Salvation of Souls, be equally our Meditation and Wonder and Praiſe continually. Let us daily ſteep our Thoughts and warm our Hearts in this heavenly Study, which will be the noble Employment of Saints and Angels throughout a bleſſed Eternity.</p>

                     <hi>USE III.</hi> What Joy and Satisfaction ſhou'd we take in the <hi>Converſion</hi> of Sinners; and how ought we to mourn the Caſe of <hi>unconverted</hi> Souls?</head>
                  <p>In every Converſion <hi>a Soul is ſav'd from Death.</hi> (Jam. 5.20.) 'Tis brought into a new and excellent Life, and put in a Way to glorious Proſperity, Health and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And ſhall we not rejoyce, when any are bro't to <hi>believe unto the ſaving of the Soul!</hi> Verily there's <hi>Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth.</hi> (Luk. 15.7.) Every new Converſion ſpread a freſh Tranſport of Joy all over Heaven; it puts a new Song into the Mouth of Angels; and is highly pleaſing to God. The Holy Ghoſt rejoyces
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004954_0020_100E464C8A919100"/>
in a new Triumph of his Power and Grace: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer rejoyces in a new Teſtimony to the Merits of his Croſs and Efficacy of his Mediation: The Father rejoyces in a freſh Witneſs to his electing Love, the Birth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Heir, and a new Addition to his Family. This is emblematically repreſented in the Parable of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Son,</hi> in whoſe return his Father rejoyced, and <hi>killed the fatted Calf, becauſe he had received him ſafe and ſound.</hi> (Luk. 15.27.)—How do we rejoice in the Return of a Child or a Friend, thought to have been loſt; and in his Recovery, after having been ſick nigh unto Death! With what Pleaſure do we receive ſuch an one, as virtually rais'd from the Dead! And ſhall we not much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and exult in the Return of a loſt Sinner, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a periſhing Soul. Do's not Love to our Fellow-Creatures, and a Regard to the Honour of God and Intereſt of Chriſt demand this of us? Ought we not to imitate the Example of holy Angels? Are we not willing to participate in the Joy of Heaven on ſuch an Occaſion!</p>
                  <p>At the ſame Time we ſhou'd <hi>lament,</hi> that the truly living Soul is ſo <hi>rare</hi> a Spectacle: And ſhould bemoan the unhappy Caſe of Sinners in their <hi>Unregeneracy.</hi> Alas, <hi>their Miſery is great upon them.</hi> Be they Kings and great Men of the Earth, dwelling amidſt the higheſt Honours, Riches and Pleaſures of this World, yet ſo long as <hi>aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Life of God,</hi> what is the Life they live! mean and low, little better than brutal. The moſt proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dignify'd Sinner is but a <hi>vile Perſon</hi> (Pſal 15.4.) a <hi>brutiſh Perſon; he is like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> (Pſal. 49.10, 12.) Verily a rueful putrifying Corpſe is not more horrible to the bodily Sight, than ſuch a Perſon (dead in Sins) is to thoſe who have Eyes to <hi>diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Good and Bad.</hi> O what an odious horrid Spectacle is the Sinner, with a rotten Heart and unclean Hands, with the Image of Death and the Smell of Hell-Fire upon him! — But how lovely, how glorious a Sight the humble Convert, with the Beauty of Holineſs, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Heaven, and the Preſages of eternal Life
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004954_0021_100E4651280861F0"/>
upon him! While the other are our Grief, let theſe be our Delight. Let every new Converſion we ſee or hear of, open a freſh Spring of Joy in our Hearts, and fill our Mouths with Praiſe. As the Number of Converts in <hi>Zion,</hi> in this remarkable Day of divine Power and Grace, is on the increaſing Hand, and <hi>much People are daily added to the Lord</hi> in one Place and another, how ſhou'd all that wou'd approve themſelves Lovers of Chriſt and Souls rejoyce and give Thanks! <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord: Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul.</hi>—Whatever Darkneſs and Difficulty may hang about the Minds of any, let them take Example from Act. 11.18. <hi>When they heard theſe Things, they held their Peace, and glorified</hi> GOD.—O how ſhou'd we mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Lord with Thankſgiving, who is ſo marvellouſly at this Day <hi>viſiting</hi> our Land, to <hi>take out of it a People for his Name,</hi> and in ſo extenſive a Manner <hi>reviving his Work</hi> amongſt us! May it ſpread ſtill more and more, till the whole Land, yea the whole Earth, is filled with the Glory of the Lord! <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>This remarkable Work has ſurprizingly by various Means and Inſtruments been increas'd and extended, ſince the Rev. Mr. ADAMS, Paſtor of the firſt Church in <hi>New-London,</hi> and <hi>a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Brother unto them (as I ſuppoſe)</hi> publiſh'd his Thoughts upon it (Anno 1735) in a Preface to the Rev. Mr. <hi>E. Williams</hi>'s Ser. on <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.4 5.—I beg Leave on this Occaſion to repeat from him the following Lines.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>We have heard of the <hi>Grace of God</hi> in ſome Parts of the Country; how his <hi>good</hi> SPIRIT hath been at work in divers Towns, to awaken a Concern in many about <hi>what they ſhall do to be ſaved;</hi> that this Concern continues, that it ſpreads, and that Perſons are flocking into the Churches, as <hi>Doves to their Windows:</hi> It muſt be look'd upon as a <hi>Token for Good,</hi> and ſhould produce Praiſes to the LORD, who is graciouſly <hi>viſiting his People.</hi> Only let them who are thus awakened, take Care that they do not reſt in a deceitful Work; and look well to their future <hi>Converſation</hi> (eſpecially ſince ſo many Eyes are upon them) that it be altogether <hi>as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt</hi>—</p>
                           <p>It is not to be doubted, but that the <hi>great Enemy of Souls</hi> will endeavour to diſgrace and throw an Odium upon this good Work. It is no new Thing for him to ſow <hi>Tares</hi> in the LORD'S <hi>Feild</hi> among the <hi>good Wheat,</hi> eſpecially if the <hi>Servants ſleep.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But ſo long as this Concern is awakened by the reading and hearing of the Word; while it reforms the Life, and cleanſeth the Way; takes People off from their vain Confidences, and brings them kindly over to Jeſus Chriſt; makes them ſerious, watchful, prayerful and heavenly-minded; helps them to govern better their Thoughts, Words and Actions, Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Inclinations, Paſſions and Affections; diſpoſeth them to be juſt and righteous, kind and charitable to all that are about them; and finally, fills them with Love to God, his Truths, his Ways, his Worſhip and his People; Now it hath <hi>ſuch Marks of a divine Work,</hi> that the more general it is, ſo much the better: and as it advanceth and ſpreads thro' the Country, we ſhould all cry, <hi>Grace, Grace unto it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Some People at a Diſtance hearing of this Concern and Stirring, are quite at a <hi>Loſs</hi> how to account for it; they <hi>wonder</hi> what ſhould be the Occaſion, and nothing leſs than ſome <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> ſent from above, or ſome Expectation of the World's ſudden coming to an <hi>End,</hi> ſeems to them ſufficient to make it either ſo great or ſo extenſive.</p>
                           <p>Others <hi>mock</hi> and <hi>deride.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But what is there after all ſo very unaccountable in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Or what is there ſo very peculiar in their Circumſtances, who are now, thro' the Mercy of God, ſo very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned? Ought not all unconverted Sinners ſadly to think of their loſt and undone Condition without an Intereſt in Chriſt, if they would act reaſonably? and will they not alſo be bro't to it in the Day when the Lord ſhall <hi>open their Eyes?</hi> Truly it is wonderful, to think how they reſt Day and Night, while they have Reaſon to judge that they are yet in the <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity.</hi> Then ſhall theſe wondering People know the meaning of this Diſpenſation, when the Spirit of Grace and Supplication ſhall drive them into their <hi>inner Chambers,</hi> to unboſom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord: And it would be one of the beſt Days of all their Lives, were they bro't into the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004954_0023_100E46566F4F8AB0"/>In order to know whether your Souls <hi>proſper</hi> and are in <hi>Health,</hi> my Friends, it's neceſſary that you firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether you have ever experienc'd that <hi>New-Birth,</hi> which is fundamental to all true ſpiritual Health and Proſperity. Let me ſpeak freely to you: In Caſe you have not been made <hi>alive to God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> you are vain Pretenders, and do but boaſt of a falſe Gift, in claiming the Character of <hi>proſperous</hi> and <hi>healed Souls.</hi> Alas, there are Multitudes in the profeſſing World, to whom that pungent Rebuke is applicable, Matth. 9.12. <hi>They that be whole, need not a Phyſician.</hi> It ſeems ſpoken of the <hi>conceitedly</hi> whole, who imagine they want no Healing. Like thoſe whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, Prov. 20.12. <hi>There is a Generation, that are pure in their own Eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their Filthineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some there be, that are <hi>groſs Sinners,</hi> but labouring of a <hi>ſtupify'd</hi> Conſcience, they go on quietly in known ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Wickedneſs; tho' under the greateſt Danger by fatal Wounds, yet inſenſible and utterly unconcern'd to get ſpiritual healing. Theſe, if they were not Strangers to all ſerious Self-Reflection, muſt needs know themſelves to be under the Power of unmortify'd Luſts, and in the Way to eternal Deſtruction. But <hi>the God of this World hath blinded their Mind,</hi> and <hi>ſeared their Conſcience as with a hot Iron,</hi> that they feel no Impreſſions from God's Word or Providence, feel no Remorſe or Shame for Sin, no Fear of Death or of Wrath to come. They are dead aſleep, by the Force of Unbelief, by the Force of ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Errors, or prevalent Luſts, which make their Ears heavy, that they cannot hear, and their Eyes dark, that they cannot ſee; at leaſt, in ſeeing they do not underſtand, and in hearing they do not perceive. As it is ſaid of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 7.9. <hi>Gray Hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth it not.</hi> Thus many a Sinner, tho' the evident Tokens of Perdition are upon him, yet he knoweth it not; he is <hi>willingly ignorant:</hi> And <hi>when he heareth the Words of the Curſe,</hi> ſtill <hi>he bleſſes himſelf in his Heart,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I ſhall have Peace, though I walk in the Imagination of mine Heart, to add Drunkenneſs unto

Thirſt.</hi> Deut. 29.19. Sinners, that have their Conſcience thus benumb'd and ſenſeleſs, often are found truſting in their religious Parentage, external Profeſſion and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation to God, as the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who glory'd in having <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, yet did not the Works of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and who made their Boaſt of GOD, yet were Children of the <hi>Devil.</hi> (Joh. 8.41, 44.) Theſe are poſting on to the <hi>Damnation of Hell,</hi> yet are ſo ſtupify'd as not to conſider their Hazard, nor ever really apprehend their Neceſſity of a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>But others there be, of a more refin'd Character, yet equally in Danger of periſhing by Means of a deluded Fancy, and falſe Hopes, from other Cauſes. I have in my Eye now ſuch as are under the Power of a <hi>deceived</hi> and <hi>flattering</hi> Conſcience; ſuch as have taken up a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Opinion of <hi>themſelves,</hi> as if they were <hi>ſomething</hi> in Religion, while indeed they are <hi>nothing.</hi> Some unhappily form a wrong Judgment of their State, by applying <hi>falſe Rules,</hi> and others by <hi>miſapplying</hi> the true; and having enroll'd themſelves among the Children of God, their confident Preſumption breeds a Calm in their Breaſts, lulls Conſcience aſleep; and ſometimes an Imagination that <hi>the Bitterneſs of Death is paſt,</hi> produces a ſingular Satisfaction and Chearfulneſs of Mind. By Reaſon of ſome ſenſible <hi>Changes</hi> they've experienc'd in themſelves, under the common and lower Operations of the Spirit, they fondly dream, that they are <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>need not a Phyſician.</hi> For Inſtance, they have been bro't under legal Awaknings (it may be, very ſtrong Convictions, great Terrors, and long continu'd) and afterwards have emerg'd out of their Darkneſs and Diſtreſs, perhaps into a Light and Joy ſurprizing to them; have felt Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Duty at Times, Meltings of Paſſion, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly good Affections; have reform'd their external Practice to a great Degree; are grown warm Advocates in the Cauſe of Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now here they reſt, and build their Hope, at a Diſtance from Chriſt and Grace. On ſuch Accounts as theſe, they <hi>flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own Eyes,</hi> ſuppoſe themſelves <hi>converted</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004954_0025_100E465DAD4733A8"/>
                     <hi>healed,</hi> and think their <hi>Souls</hi> in a <hi>proſperous</hi> Way; while yet in Truth they remain under the Power of Death, ſome ineffectual Check only is given to their Diſeaſe, and their Wounds are but ſooth'd for the preſent, by a meer pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liative and ſuperficial Cure. Indeed they never were truly <hi>broken-hearted,</hi> never thorowly <hi>wounded in Spirit,</hi> nor ever apply'd the true Goſpel-Remedy. Conſcience is over-rul'd and ſilenc'd; but not truly heal'd and pacify'd. What Convictions they had, are only worn off; they've <hi>quench'd the Spirit;</hi> and the Calm they poſſeſs, is but a temporary and falſe Peace; their Joy but a flaſhy and imaginary Pleaſure. That awful Word is applicable to them, Iſai. 44.20. <hi>He feedeth of Aſhes; a deceived Heart hath turned him aſide, that he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Soul, nor ſay, Is there not a Lie in my right Hand!</hi> Alas, they ſtill <hi>need the Phyſician,</hi> as much as ever; tho' <hi>their Heart thinketh not ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some who have paſſed under <hi>no</hi> remarkable Change, but appear'd hopefully pious from their Childhood, are little better than that <hi>young Jew</hi> in the Goſpel (Matth. 19.) to whom our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid, <hi>One Thing thou lackeſt:</hi> And who, after ſolemn Proteſtations of his unblemiſh'd Morals, yet when put to the Trial choſe to part with a Saviour and renounce Heaven, rather than ſacrifice the World and deny his Luſts. Had this young Pretender a <hi>healed Soul,</hi> a <hi>clean Heart,</hi> and a <hi>right Spirit</hi> within him, think you! Nay, but a ſick Soul, a foul Heart, and a falſe Spirit, under the diſguiſe of a fair Profeſſion and plauſible Appearance. Is it not to be fear'd, that among <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſors many are but <hi>as that young Man,</hi> deceiving their Neighbours, cheating themſelves, and mocking God by <hi>a fair Shew in the Fleſh?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others who have actually had a viſible and perhaps very remarkable Change wro't upon them, may yet be no better Chriſtians than that <hi>Simon,</hi> who from a noted <hi>Sorcerer</hi> became a Goſpel-Profeſſor, and doubtleſs for a time was look'd on by others (perhaps too by himſelf) as a notable Inſtance of converting Grace; but at Length his Hypocriſy being detected, he met with that awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004954_0026_100E4660FA343520"/>
from an inſpir'd Apoſtle, (Act. 8.) <hi>Thou haſt neither Part nor Lot in this Matter: For thy Heart is not right in the Sight of God.—For I perceive, that thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity.</hi> So as to many a Profeſſor, it may be fear'd, notwithſtanding their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretenſions as to inward Feelings, and a conſpicuous Alteration in Externals, that after all <hi>their Heart is not right with God,</hi> is not <hi>ſound in his Statutes,</hi> but ſtill <hi>goeth after their Covetouſneſs,</hi> or other fooliſh and hurtful Luſts. Their Corruptions are only under a preſent Reſtriction; but really retain a ſecret Power and Dominion. It is but an imperfect Work they've known, whether of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Their boaſted Experiences are eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; their Graces but glittering Counterfeits; and all their Virtue but unregenerate Morality: they are aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Life of God; and have but the dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe of Religion.—Indeed it becomes ſhort-ſighted fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Man to be very cautious in applying ſo dreadful a Cenſure to particular Caſes. I apprehend, the Word of God, which ought to be our governing Rule, forbids our explicitly condemning particular Perſons in regard of their inferior State, and pronouncing poſitively againſt them the Charge of Hypocriſy, but upon notorious Evidence of bad Externals, inconſiſtent with a credible Profeſſion. However, in general we have Reaſon ſadly to fear, that many a forward and ſhowy Profeſſor is really but an empty Pretender; and at beſt no better than an <hi>Almoſt-Chriſtian,</hi> in the Sight of HIM <hi>whoſe Eyes are as a Flame of Fire,</hi> which pierce thro' the thickeſt Vizors, and often ſee a wretchedly diſtemper'd Spirit under a beautiful Outſide, and viſible Form of Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>O let us then (how candid ſoever we are in judging of others) be inclin'd rather to Severity in Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Self-judging. Let it be our Concern to get Conſcience ſufficiently inform'd by the Word and Spirit of God; and let an enlighten'd Conſcience do its Office, in impartially trying and cenſuring us, that we may not by a deceitful Peace and a preſumptuous Hope betray our immortal Souls into remedileſs Ruin. O conſider, my

Friends, you may have many commendable Attainments, in real Gifts and ſeeming Graces; you may have verily experienc'd admirable Changes in your Temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that carry the Face of ſaving Converſion: and yet after all your Convictions, your Illuminations and your Humiliations, your Terrors and Comforts, your Tears, Confeſſions, and Amendments, you may ſtill be but gliſtering Hyprocrites, and fail of the <hi>waſhing of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> that purifying and healing Work of the SPIRIT on the <hi>hidden Man of the Heart.</hi> O beware of all thoſe treacherous and falſe Reſts, which Sinners in <hi>Zion</hi> are apt to lean upon, and which in the End will certainly prove broken Reeds, that ſhall pierce them through with many Sorrows; leaving them, after the ſhort Pleaſure of a deluded Hope, to ſink down to Hell, under the Anguiſh of an amazing Diſappointment, an irretrievable and eternal Diſappointment! I beſeech every one of you to take Warning, and ſee that you don't content yourſelves with any but the ſureſt Evidences of a real Work of ſaving Grace, in the <hi>reſtoring your Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall now propound to you ſeveral <hi>Heads of Self-Examination,</hi> or Marks for Trial of your State: attend, and examine yourſelves, each of you, as I go along.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Have you ever been made to know and feel the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd wounded and periſhing State of your Soul by Nature?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be, you have felt Terrors of Conſcience and Fears of Hell, with ſome Senſe of Shame and Remorſe for actual Sins, eſpecially for ſcandalous Iniquities: But if you have experienc'd true evangelical Convictions, you have been made to ſee and mourn <hi>the Sin which dwelleth in you,</hi> to ſee and mourn the dead Condition you are in by Nature, and to <hi>know the Plague of your own Heart;</hi> as the Expreſſion is, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.38. Well, reflect ſolemnly, and recollect what has been your Experience in this leading Point.</p>
                  <p>Have you ever had the extream Neceſſity and Exigence of your Caſe in a natural State, preſented to your View in a powerful convincing and affecting Light? Have
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004954_0028_100E4668B675D560"/>
you ſeen your <hi>Nature</hi> overſpread with the Leproſy of Sin, in Body and Soul; the Mind clouded, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſtorted, the Will vitiated, the Paſſions corrupted, the Conſcience depraved, the whole Man defiled? Have you ſeen your <hi>Life</hi> ſtain'd with actual Pollutions, from your Youth up, in numberleſs Inſtances, and all dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aggravated! Have you ſeen all your <hi>Duties</hi> attended with abominable Mixtures of Corruption and ſinful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection? Has the Badneſs of your Hearts appear'd to you, with ſingular Evidence, from the Filthineſs of your very beſt Duties, when view'd in the Glaſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which is ſpiritual, and holy and juſt and good?</p>
                  <p>Have you ſeen the <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of your natural Condition, as under the Bondage of Corruption and Chains of Guilt; odious to the Holineſs of God, and obnoxious to his Juſtice; expos'd to die eternally, by the moral Efficacy of your Diſeaſe, and by the righteous Sentence of the Law? Has Deſtruction from God been a Terror to you, and the Arrows of his Quiver enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Reins? Has Conſcience been duly awaken'd to a Senſe of the Wounds given by Sin? Have you been brought to look on <hi>Sin</hi> (particularly thro' the Glaſs of Chriſt's Sufferings) as the moſt malignant and hateful Evil, worſe than the very worſt of bodily Plagues? Have you not only felt the Pain of your diſtemper'd and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Condition; but under your ſpiritual Pollutions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd a loathſome Spectacle in your own Eye? Has the Corruption of your Nature, as well as the Defilements of your Life, been Matter of Grief and Shame and Terror to you? Has the <hi>Enmity of a carnal Mind againſt God, an evil Heart of Unbelief,</hi> the Source of Diſobedience, been deplored by you with many Confeſſion, Prayers, and Tears and Fears? Made to know the Plague of your Heart, and deeply affected with a Senſe of the abſolute Need of your <hi>Spirit's</hi> being healed, have you been put upon earneſtly inquiring after ſome proper and ſufficient Remedy? Have your been bro't to deſire the ſaving and healing of your <hi>Soul</hi> with more Solicitude than ever you wiſh'd for Recovery from bodily Sickneſs? Infinitely

to prefer this ſpiritual Healing, before carnal Eaſe and falſe Reſt, and to reſolve you will ſeek the Bleſſing, and accept of it upon any Terms!</p>
                  <p>Have you been beaten off from <hi>Self-Confidence,</hi> and every <hi>Creature-Dependance;</hi> ſeeing your Wounds and Bruiſes and Diſtempers incurable by any Skill and Power of yours, or by all the Art and Application of Men and Means? Have you been reduc'd to an utter Deſpair of Relief from your own Sorrows, Reformations, Performances in Religion, by any Virtue in themſelves; and from all human Helps whatſoever? Have you ſeen alſo your <hi>Unworthineſs</hi> of divine Relief; and been convinc'd, that a holy God might juſtly abandon you as a Hell-deſerving Wretch?— And has this Proſpect of your diſtreſſed Caſe pull'd down the Pride of your Heart, ſubdu'd your haughty Spirit, and brought you to God's Foot; humbly acknowledging his Righteouſneſs, if he ſhou'd ſpurn you away from his Preſence, and yet reſolvedly caſting yourſelf on his free and ſovereign Mercy in Chriſt? — Which brings me to another Inquiry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Have you been effectually perſuaded and enabled to apply to</hi> CHRIST, <hi>as the one only appointed and ſufficient Healer and Saviour of Souls?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Senſible that you are dangerouſly ſick, and need a Phyſician; convinc'd, that all Creatures are Phyſicians of no Value; finding, that in vain you have uſed many Medicines, that you have laboured in the Fire, and wearied yourſelf for very Vanity; and feeling yourſelf under the moſt preſſing Neceſſity of a <hi>divine</hi> Phyſician, and a <hi>divine</hi> Remedy, have you been bro't with Agony of Heart to enquire after GOD <hi>the Saviour,</hi> and been made <hi>willing in the Day of his Power?</hi> Willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God, and be healed by his medicinal Grace, as diſpenſed in and thro' Chriſt? Willing to be waſhed, to be ſanctify'd, to be juſtify'd in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by his Spirit? Willing to be ſaved by Grace through Faith? — Have you been divinely enlighten'd and aſſiſted to <hi>believe the Record, which</hi> GOD <hi>hath given of his</hi> SON; and upon the Credit of his Teſtimony to

                     <hi>receive</hi> CHRIST, as the Phyſician of Souls, the only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd, the only qualified, the only efficient Healer? Has Sin been ſuch a Burden upon your Conſcience, as to render CHRIST <hi>precious to you,</hi> and make you welcome this bleſſed Phyſician? Conquer'd and melted by the Conſideration of his redeeming <hi>Love,</hi> have you <hi>yielded up</hi> yourſelf, as a poor ſtrengthleſs worthleſs periſhing Creature, to be made a Monument of his <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> Grace? Have you had any ſuch impreſſive View of his perfect <hi>Sufficiency</hi> and gracious <hi>Readineſs</hi> to heal and ſave thoſe that come to him, as hath by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, yet pleaſing Conſtraint, drawn you to put your <hi>Confidence</hi> in him, to <hi>fly for Refuge,</hi> and <hi>lay hold upon the Hope ſet before you?</hi> Have you carry'd your Complaints to him, open'd your Caſe without Reſerve, thrown yourſelf upon his Compaſſion, and ſolicited his Help; moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately begging, that he wou'd deliver and heal your Sin-ſick periſhing Soul; and this with a full Dependence on his Skill, Fidelity, and Ability, to ſave you to the uttermoſt, if he undertake for you?

                     <pb n="30" facs="unknown:004954_0031_100E467297EDE290"/>3. <hi>What Symptoms are there of a Cure begun upon you?</hi> What Signs of Life and Health of Soul? What Evidences of ſpiritual Healing, from the Effects?</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling</hi> has been apply'd by the Hand of the SPIRIT, in the Goſpel-Way of <hi>Faith</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, there is without Controverſy a <hi>healing</hi> Work wrought on your Soul, in all its Powers: And if you are really conſcious of a <hi>Faith unfeigned</hi> dwelling in you, this may be a ſatisfying Evidence, that your <hi>Soul is in Health and proſpers.</hi> Faith <hi>in the Blood of Chriſt</hi> is eminently the Medium, employ'd by the Spirit of Grace, in beginning and carrying on this bleſſed Work of ſpiritual Healing. As ſure therefore as you are that you have <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo ſure you may be that your Soul is actually under this bleſſed Work: Here's at leaſt a ſtrong preſumptive Argument of it. But then in Order to judging whether you have the <hi>Faith of God's Elect,</hi> and whether you have indeed experienc'd the <hi>healing</hi> Virtue of the <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> apply'd by Faith, it is requiſite that you examine what Fruit of the Spirit, what Work of Faith, what Signs of ſpiritual Life and Health you have upon you. Inquire then into the <hi>Influences</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> diſcoverable upon you, both privative and poſitive, both inward and outward.</p>
                  <p>Can you ſay in Truth, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt?</hi> Is your old Man crucify'd with him; the Fleſh, with its Luſts, mortify'd; the World crucify'd unto you, and you unto the World? Have you an habitual Brokenneſs of Heart, and Tenderneſs of Conſcience? Have you frequent Humblings and Breakings of Spirit for Sin, original and actual, former and later? Do you hate Sin, as Sin, and therefore every Sin? Are you afraid of ſinning in any the leaſt Inſtance, in the moſt ſecret Places, and even in Thought as well as Speech and Behaviour? Do you watch and pray, that you enter not into Temptation? Do you ſolicitouſly abſtain from the Appearance of Evil, reſiſt the very firſt Beginnings, and guard againſt all known Occaſions of Sin? Is the Deſire of your Soul after Sin-killing (as well as Sin-reſtraining) Grace? Do you
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004954_0032_100E4676A5BD2DB8"/>
labour the Mortification of that which is naturally your moſt beloved Luſt, and find yourſelf by Grace habitually kept from your own Iniquity? Do you mourn the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Corruption in you; thankful for any Degree of ſpiritual Healing; and earneſtly panting for a thorow Cure; longing to have the very Principle and Root of your Diſeaſes, in a corrupted Nature, quite deſtroyed, and your Soul tranſlated to the World of Perfection, above the Influence of all thoſe unhappy Objects, which here feed and nouriſh your ſpiritual Diſtempers? Are you thus dead to Sin, the Fleſh, and the World?</p>
                  <p>And are you at the ſame Time dead to the <hi>Law?</hi> I mean not, as a Rule of Practice, but as a Covenant of Life. Is your Hope of Righteouſneſs and Life by the <hi>Law,</hi> ſlain? Has that ſelf-ſufficient and ſelf-righteous Principle, ſo deeply radicated in the Heart of proud Man, received a deadly Wound? And is it dying daily in you? Are you, while careful to do the Commandment, yet watchful againſt that legal Spirit, which will be as a dead Flie in the precious Oyntment? Not going about to eſtabliſh your own Righteouſneſs, nor leaning to your own Powers, do you daily depend upon a crucify'd JESUS, as the Lord your Righteouſneſs and Strength? The Life you now live, is it by the Faith of the Son of God?—If you are become dead to the Law, by the Body of Chriſt, it is that you ſhou'd be marry'd to another, even to him who is raiſed from the Dead, that you ſhou'd bring forth Fruit unto God. Well, inquire whether from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of a new Nature you have your Fruit unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are indeed ſerving God in Newneſs of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Are you verily ſuch as do <hi>live godly in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> Do you in Truth live, not to yourſelf, but to him that loved you and died for you and roſe again? Have you thoſe ſpiritual Senſes, thoſe ſpiritual Appetites and ſpiritual Faculties, which are eſſential to the new Man, evidential of the new Birth, and neceſſary to walking in Newneſs of Life? And do you feel a determinative divine Influence, exciting the Powers of your new Nature, drawing them
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004954_0033_100E467BA8DD7CA0"/>
into Exerciſe, and enabling you to maintain a Courſe of holy and ſpiritual Action?</p>
                  <p>What's your <hi>inward Life?</hi> Is it a Life of Repentance, and of Faith with Love in daily Exerciſe? Is it a Life of Dependance upon Chriſt, Deſire towards him, Devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, Communion with him, and Satisfaction in him? Is it a Life fill'd up with holy Thoughts, and holy Affections, holy Deſigns, holy Reſolutions, and holy Endeavours; cleaving to the Lord with Purpoſe of Heart, purifying your Soul in obeying the Truth through the Spirit, and herein exerciſing yourſelf always to keep a Conſcience void of Offence, both towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man?</p>
                  <p>What's your <hi>outward Life?</hi> Do you ſhew your Faith by your Works, and ſtudy to adorn the Doctrine of God your Saviour in all Things; doing common Actions after a godly ſort, and diligently following every good Work? Do you live, not only a Life of Sobriety and Self-Denial, but of Devotion to God, and of Benignity to Men? What's the Life you live in Secret, in the Family, in your publick Appearance, Commerce, Converſation, and Buſineſs in the World? What's your Manner of Life on the Sabbath-Day? And what on common Days? What in Proſperity? What in Adverſity? What in the ſeveral Relations and Capacities you ſuſtain? Is it a Life becoming ſuch as profeſs Godlineſs? Is it as becometh the Goſpel? Adjuſted to Goſpel-Rules, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Goſpel-Principles, and directed to Goſpel-Ends?</p>
                  <p>Is CHRIST the main Scope of your whole Life? Do you live upon him, live by him, live for him? Does Chriſt live in you, and his Image appear upon you? Is the Current of your Thoughts, Aims, Purpoſes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours from him and to him? Is it your earneſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and Deſire, that Chriſt may be magnify'd in you? Do you go forth in his Strength daily to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the Chriſtian Life; by Prayers of Faith deriving vital Influences from him your Head, and fetching in that ſupply of the Spirit, which you continually need?
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004954_0034_100E467E68CE80B0"/>
Do you come to the Light, that your Deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God?</p>
                  <p>In fine, after all, and in the midſt of all your Services for God, do you account yourſelf an unprofitable Servant, diſclaim and deteſt all Pretenſion of recommending your ſelf to the Favour of God by any Works of Righteouſneſs, which you have done, and have your Eye ſingly to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt upon you by a gracious Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Acceptance here and Recompence hereafter; determined to <hi>look for the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal Life,</hi> and to <hi>account all Things but Loſs, that you may win Chriſt, and be found in him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, my Friends, I have interrogated you in a Variety of Particulars. Aſk yourſelves theſe important Queſtions again and again, in ſolemn Manner: and let <hi>Conſcience</hi> give an upright Anſwer. Let Conſcience report what has been your real Experience, what the prevailing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of your Hearts, and the general Tenor of your Lives; compare them with the Rule of the Word, and paſs an impartial Judgment. O make a Buſineſs of this Self-Inquiry, and be afraid of Self-Deluſion, in an Affair of ſuch Conſequence. Ought you not, as reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be concern'd to know the true State of your <hi>Souls,</hi> and to be afraid of <hi>loſing</hi> your Souls by undoing Miſtakes and ſelf-flattering Dreams! Believe it, Multitudes <hi>think themſelves ſomething, while they are nothing; and fatally deceive themſelves.</hi> Affect your Hearts with the Conſideration, that <hi>you</hi> are as liable to be deceiv'd, as others; that it will be <hi>no Relief</hi> to you, to have the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> of others, whoſoever or how many ſoever, periſhing with you under the ſame Deception; and that if you have been deceiving yourſelves hitherto, it will be good for you to be <hi>undeceiv'd</hi> now in Time, while there is yet Room for the Hope and Uſe of an effectual Remedy.— But conſider on the other Hand, if on due Self-Diſcuſſion you find ſufficient Grounds to conclude, that your Souls are indeed <hi>renewed,</hi> and recover'd to a State of ſpiritual <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> the Reflection on this will tend to fill you with Admiration of the diſtinguiſhing Grace of God

towards you, to make you ſtudious of honouring him by the beſt Returns of Gratitude, to ſweeten the Comforts and alleviate the Troubles of Life, to fortify you againſt the Fears of Death and Judgment, and give you a chearful Expectation of Eternity; as knowing that the New-Birth is the Beginning of an endleſs Life, and ſpiritual Health in this World the earneſt of everlaſting Happineſs in the next. <hi>Wherefore my Brethren, give Diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> 'Tis a Duty of vaſt Concern, and expreſly enjoyn'd upon you by the Word of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.— Attend this momentous Duty, as you wou'd <hi>ſhew yourſelves Men.</hi> And beg of God to <hi>ſearch you.</hi>

Leſs of Pain, leſs Anguiſh and Difficulty will in all Probability attend the ſearching and healing your Wounds now than hereafter: and the ſooner your Soul is reſtored, the greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and the longer Opportunity you will have, through Grace, to eſtabliſh and advance your Soul's Proſperity, Health and Vigour; to work for God on Earth, and to lay up Treaſure in Heaven. Therefore <hi>as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To Day, if you will hear his Voice, harden not your Heart.</hi> (Heb. 3.7, 8.) O Sinner, indulge no longer a falſe Peace &amp; carnal Eaſe: give not Way to Excuſes and Delays. <hi>What meaneſt thou, O Sleeper! Ariſe, and call upon God, if ſo be that God will think upon you, that you periſh not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can't readily think of any more proper <hi>Advices</hi> to you in your preſent Caſe, than theſe. <hi>Immediately,</hi> as far as poſſible by the help of common Grace, break off your <hi>evil Cuſtoms,</hi> and ſtrive to avoid every Conſcience-waſting preſumptuous Sin. — <hi>Immediately</hi> quit your immoderate Purſuit of the <hi>World,</hi> and ſet Bounds to your Buſineſs, Cares and Pleaſures in it, that theſe may not prove fatal Impediments to your obtaining Conviction.—<hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> ſhake off your vain <hi>Companions,</hi> and betake yourſelf to the Acquaintance of ſerious Chriſtians, whoſe Converſation may be inſtructive and quickning to you.— <hi>Immediately</hi> take up the Practice of <hi>Cloſet-Duties;</hi> or if
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004954_0038_100E468D76EDB4E0"/>
ſtatedly obſerv'd, be more afraid of trifling in ſecret Religion.— Reſolutely <hi>meditate</hi> on awakning and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects.—Daily <hi>read</hi> the Holy Bible. — Be <hi>ſwift to hear</hi> the Word preached, attend a faithful ſearching Miniſtry, and <hi>take heed how you hear.</hi>— And when under any Ordinance or Providence, you find <hi>Conſcience</hi> begin to be touched, now <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> that you may not loſe the Impreſſion, but that it may be thorowly ſet home upon you. Know it, after all the Means you can poſſibly uſe, it is the Work of the divine SPIRIT to convince Sinners: Yet he ordinarily does this in the Way of Means. O neglect not any appointed Means then: And yet have your Eye to the SPIRIT of Grace as the alone efficient Cauſe. Obſerve his Motions. Pray for his powerful Influences. Call for a Sight of Sin, and Sorrow for Sin: Call for Conviction, for Humiliation, for a broken Heart, as you regard the Life of your Soul: Call inſtantly for theſe, call aloud, pray and ſtrive hard for theſe. Let mournful Reflections on your ſick Condition, and awful Proſpects of your amazing Hazard, be cheriſh'd and not repelled: yea, let them lie down and riſe up with you, follow you into the World, and accompany you Day and Night, that you may ſeek Salvation in earneſt, and never return to a fatal Reſt in your Sins.—And when this comes to be the Caſe with you, happily you may be <hi>made ready for the Lord,</hi> prepared for the glad Tidings of the Goſpel, be diſpoſed to welcome the Phyſician, and by coming to him, have your Soul recovered to ſpiritual Life and Health.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean Time, whatever Comfort of <hi>Hope,</hi> you may enjoy, believe me, 'tis but <hi>the Hope of the Hypocrite,</hi> which ſhall <hi>periſh</hi> as the Spider's Web, &amp; leave you <hi>aſhamed,</hi> in the Hour of Death and in the Day of Judgment, if you go out of the World with an unrenewed unhealed Soul.—Ah, how <hi>inexcuſable</hi> will you be, if you periſh from under the Light and Warnings of the Goſpel! Your Blood will be upon your own Head, if you deſpiſe and reject the Phyſician of Souls. —You are ſick nigh unto Death, the Graves are ready for you, Hell gapes to receive
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004954_0039_100E468FA3CC8918"/>
your guilty Spirit: And <hi>how can you eſcape, if you neglect ſo great Salvation!</hi> —The Phyſician you need, is knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at your Door now, and waits that he may be gracious: But tho' he hath long Patience, he will not wait always. He may leave you, ere you are aware: and then how impoſſible your Recovery! No created Arm can relieve your Soul: Sink it muſt into eternal Perdition, and none can help it. <hi>O Inhabitant of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>that makeſt thy Neſt in the Cedars, how comely ſhalt thou be when Pangs come upon thee, the Pain as of a Woman in Travail!</hi> For ſo it is written, <hi>When they ſhall ſay, Peace and Safety, then ſudden Deſtruction cometh upon them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child; and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> (1 Theſ. 5.3.)—If Conſcience never be rouſed againſt you in this World, it will awake with a Vengeance in the next; it will roar like a Lion, and tear you in Pieces. In Proportion to your Guilt ſhall be your Torment: And there will be none to deliver. The only Saviour will be turned againſt you; and <hi>He will make you as a fiery Oven in the Day of his Anger.—WO unto you that laugh now: for you ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> (The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25.) And if you wou'd prevent your <hi>mourning at the laſt,</hi> when ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd before the great God unto Judgment and when it will be too late to obtain Mercy, then haſten <hi>now,</hi> even to Day, while it is called to Day, haſten to get among <hi>the Mourners in Zion.</hi> O that I cou'd by any Means ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Evil of Sin, &amp; the Terrors of Death, Judgment and Wrath to come, as that theſe Things might appear in their Reality before your Eyes! O bethink yourſelves, and conſider what a Caſe you wou'd be in, if now you were taking your final Leave of the World, if now you were called before the awful Judgment-Seat, if Chriſt were this Moment revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire to condemn and puniſh impenitent Sinners! Let Conſcience be ſtartled at the tremendous Proſpect. Inſtantly ſhake off vain Merriment; laugh no more in your pleaſing Dreams, and mad Security: But let your Heart meditate Terror, and be bowed down heavily, at the Sight of your ſinful Sickneſs, Miſery and Hazard.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004954_0040_100E46949523D1C8"/>And now, ſuppoſing this to be the Caſe with ſome of you, I ſhall apply myſelf,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>convinced</hi> Sinners.</p>
                  <p>If there be any here preſent, whoſe <hi>Souls</hi> are not in <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> but who are now awaken'd to ſome Senſibility of your ſick and periſhing State, perhaps are deeply wounded in Spirit, and are crying out for a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; to ſuch I wou'd direct a few Words by way of Counſel, Caution and Encouragement.</p>
                  <p>Let me ſay here,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Look to it, that you don't miſcarry in the firſt Step toward Converſion, by <hi>miſtaking</hi> the Nature of true <hi>Conviction,</hi> and imagining yourſelves in the <hi>full Experience</hi> of this, while yet perhaps eſſentially defective in it.— <hi>The</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>when he cometh, convinces of</hi> SIN, <hi>and of</hi> RIGHTEOUSNESS, <hi>and of</hi> JUDGMENT. (Joh. 16.8.) As Agent under and for CHRIST, in the Application of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, he works Conviction in a Way becoming his own Character as the Spirit of Grace and Truth, in a Way ſubſervient to the Ends of his bleſſed Office, and purſuant to the Deſign of the Saviour's Undertaking; and in a Way accommodated to the intellectual Nature of Man, in its State of Apoſtaſy; informing his <hi>Judgment,</hi> as well as influencing his Paſſions; working on his <hi>Hopes,</hi> as well as his Fears; <hi>encouraging</hi> him from the rich Proviſions of <hi>Grace,</hi> as well as terrifying him by the flaming Sword of Juſtice; <hi>humbling</hi> and <hi>melting</hi> his Heart, as well as pricking his Conſcience; directing him to a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> as well as affecting him with his Malady; and making Uſe of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as well as of the Law, to theſe Purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Examine now into your Experience; and take heed, that you don't deceive yourſelves, by taking up contented with a partial and imperfect Work of Conviction. Know it, <hi>ſuch</hi> a Work, for the <hi>Kind</hi> and for the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of it, as will make you thorowly feel your <hi>Soul-Sickneſs,</hi> and <hi>Need of a Phyſician;</hi> as will make you ſolemnly attentive to the <hi>Goſpel-Report,</hi> reconcil'd to the Method of Salvation <hi>by Grace through Faith in the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> reſtleſs under the Burden of <hi>Sin,</hi> and diſpoſed to welcome the <hi>Saviour,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:004954_0041_100E46989E35BFD8"/>
in his whole remedial Undertaking, and for all its Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, upon the moſt ſelf-denying Terms, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Reſerve; <hi>ſuch</hi> a Work, I ſay, and <hi>ſo much</hi> of it, there muſt be in your real Experience, if you wou'd not fail in Point of <hi>common Grace,</hi> uſually previous and preparative to Converſion. O look to it, that with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this introductory Work you do indeed <hi>begin in the Spirit,</hi> and that you do not <hi>end in the Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Then, beware of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from hopeful Beginnings of Conviction, &amp; relapſing into <hi>Security.</hi>—True Conviction, in any Degree of it, is an Inſtance of divine preventing Mercy. It is the Fruit of the SPIRIT <hi>ſtriving</hi> with you. O forſake not your own Mercies. <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> (1 Theſ. 5.19.) Don't ſlight Conviction, nor oppoſe it: but follow it on, fall in with it, and labour to promote its genuine Effects. As you love your Souls, be always in Care, that you <hi>do not turn the Grace of God into Wantonneſs;</hi> that you do not <hi>grieve</hi> and <hi>vex the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> by wilful Reſiſtance or affected Stupidity under his Hand. A juſt God may by this be provoked to cut you down ſuddenly by <hi>Death;</hi> or he may ſwear in his Wrath, that his SPIRIT ſhall forever ceaſe ſtriving with you: and if either of theſe awful Events ſhou'd happen, you are undone, without Remedy.— O let this Reflection be as a Thunderbolt ſhot into your Conſcience, to keep it awake: and let the dreadful Sound in your Ears put you upon fleeing for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before you.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Beware of <hi>reſting</hi> in <hi>Conviction.</hi> Alas, Conviction may proceed to a high Degree and to a great Length, and yet after all may leave you ſhort of that <hi>Faith</hi> in the Blood of Chriſt, without which you will never experience its healing and ſaving Efficacy.—If you think to be your own Phyſicians, and expect Healing meerly by Virtue of your own Repentances, Reformations, and Practice of Duties; or if you go about to make a Righteouſneſs of your Humiliation and religious Concern, expecting hereby to oblige the Divine Phyſician to pity and relieve you; in either Caſe you may procure to yourſelves a Shew of Healing, but verily <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> Without
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004954_0042_100E469C1D39F6D0"/>
the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling</hi> apply'd to cleanſe and heal your Souls, you muſt in the End be ſhut out of Heaven among the defiled and abominable, muſt deſcend with bleeding Wounds to the Place of unutterable Horror, and take your Lot with unpardon'd Devils and damned Ghoſts, where the Fire is not quenched. Nay, the Memory of your paſt Experiences will dreadfully enrage your Wounds hereafter; and your practical Contempts of the Blood of Chriſt will make it ſerve only as Oyl further to inflame the Vengeance of eternal Fire. O take heed then, that you don't any of you ſtop at meer Conviction, nor reſt in its beſt Effects, ſhort of Goſpel-Faith. Verily, no Change of Opinion, no Change of Paſſion, no Change of moral Diſpoſition and Conduct will avail to the Ends of healing and ſaving your Souls, without a regenerating Change and Heart-purifying Faith. O dread a Deluſion here, in the grand turning Point. Be not cheated by a fallacious Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Don't deceive yourſelves; and let no Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you by vain Words. Conſult not with Fleſh and Blood in the Caſe. Turn away your Ear from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Flatteries, nor liſten to the corrupt Advices of falſe Friends about you, but <hi>ceaſe from the Inſtruction which cauſeth to err.</hi> Nature (I know) impatient of Trouble, and eager to ſhake it off, is apt to ſeek Eaſe by the neareſt, tho' not the ſafeſt Methods. Let Conſcience, directed by the unerring Word, ſet Bounds here: and reſolve to ſeek and receive Healing only in the Goſpel-Way, by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) To ſeek Chriſt and Healing in this Way of Faith, <hi>haſten</hi> as much as poſſible, and beware of indulging volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Delays.</hi>—Every wilful Delay is a virtual refuſing for the preſent, is utterly inexcuſable, and very dangerous. The longer you cheriſh a dilatory Diſpoſition, you will but ſet yourſelves at a wider Diſtance from Chriſt and Healing; your Unbelief will contract a greater Stubbornneſs, and the Wounds of Conſcience grow more difficult of Cure. Do you now ſtand off from Chriſt, and neglect ſo great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in Hopes of a <hi>more convenient Seaſon?</hi> O fooliſh Preſumption! Take Heed leſt it betray you into fatal
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004954_0043_100E469EA4FF2160"/>
                     <hi>Security,</hi> by a final withdraw of the convincing SPIRIT from you; or elſe into horrible <hi>Deſpair,</hi> by the Tempter's telling you <hi>hereafter,</hi> that it's too <hi>late,</hi> as he do's now, that it is too <hi>ſoon.</hi> — But, you are acted perhaps by ſome other Views, in thus ſtanding aloof from the Phyſician. Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you think your ſelves <hi>unworthy</hi> to come to Chriſt? Here's the Shew of <hi>Humility:</hi> but it's a ſpurious Grace, the Iſſue of a haughty Mind. Do you ſtay away from Chriſt on the Proſpect of coming to him ere long better <hi>recommended,</hi> by good Qualities in you, or good Works done by you, that may purchaſe his Favour, and intitle to the Benefits of his Redemption? If ſo, here's the Pride of your Hearts, &amp; the Snare of the Devil. <hi>Obedience</hi> is the Daughter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <q>
                        <hi>Good Works</hi> are a good <hi>Nurſe</hi> to Faith: but if you make Works the <hi>Mother</hi> of Faith, that Faith is not right, it's but a <hi>Baſtard-Faith.</hi>
                     </q> —Be it that you think (as many poor Souls do at ſuch a Time) that you muſt not dare to <hi>believe,</hi> until your <hi>Agonies</hi> of Sorrow and Terror have riſen up to the Height of others Experience, in ſome very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Caſes, ſingled out by you for a Standard; I muſt needs let you know, <hi>This is your Infirmity.</hi> Such as you, who (in the Meaſure of more common Experience) have taſted the Bitterneſs of Sin, and feel your periſhing Condition without a Saviour, and are lamenting after him, but ſtill <hi>defer</hi> the great Tranſaction of cloſing with or coming to him, for Fear of <hi>preſuming;</hi> I muſt tell you, if you want further Conviction of any Thing, it is of the Sin &amp; Miſchief of your <hi>Unbelief,</hi> which holds you off from the Phyſician, hold you down upon the Rack of a tormenting Conſcience, and keeps your Wounds open and bleeding. O labour for a deeply impreſſed Apprehenſion of the infinite <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> of UNBELIEF, the <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſable</hi> Obligation of FAITH, and the egregious <hi>Folly</hi> of DELAYS. And let this View of Things give <hi>Speed</hi> to the Motion of a trembling diſtreſſed Soul towards the deſired Saviour. That Exhortation to the awak'ned <hi>Jaylor,</hi> ſhews what is the proper and immediate Duty of convinced Sinners, Act. 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> O <hi>haſten</hi> the Flight of Faith towards our Lord <hi>Jeſus

Chriſt;</hi> as the Manſlayer of old fled with ſwifteſt Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the City of Refuge. Look <hi>inſtantly</hi> to JESUS, as the ſtung Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs were to look imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the brazen Serpent, for healing.</p>
                  <p>I know indeed, the <hi>Arm of the Lord</hi> muſt be ſtretched out, and this muſt <hi>draw</hi> you, or you'l never be <hi>able</hi> effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to come to Chriſt: yet, I beſeech you, let not <hi>the Scriptures</hi> be <hi>wreſted</hi> by you, in this Caſe, <hi>to your own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> The Doctrine of Man's <hi>Inability</hi> will groſly be perverted, if you make it a Pretext for voluntary Delays and careleſs Neglects of incumbent Duty. Alas, Sinner, if you finally miſcarry, a righteous God will charge <hi>you</hi> as the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Cauſe, nor will you have any Cloke for your Sin. Your ſpiritual <hi>Impotence</hi> will never ſerve you with any coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Plea in apologizing for your wilful <hi>Unbelief</hi> &amp; ſpiritual <hi>Sloth.</hi> If any is hugging himſelf in the Dream of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Safety, from ſuch an Excuſe, let him know, <hi>His Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſlumbereth not.</hi>— The Senſe of your own Weakneſs and Inſufficiency ſhould rather put you in Fear, awaken your Care, and deter you from all Negligence. O let it have this Effect upon you. Agreably I proceed to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Under the Excitements and Aids of divine</hi> common Grace, <hi>be earneſtly and diligently purſuing after ſaving</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, <hi>in a cloſe Attendance upon the inſtituted</hi> Means <hi>of obtaining it; and beware of indulging any ſinful Neglect, or ſlothful Management.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ordinarily the bleſſed God worketh by his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Means.</hi> The common Work of the Spirit, whereby Sinners are brought under Conviction and Humiliation, is uſually begun and carried on by the <hi>Means</hi> of God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: and convinced Sinners muſt perſevere in an unwearied Attendance upon the <hi>Means,</hi> if they hope to ſecure the <hi>End</hi> of that Work they are under, as <hi>preparatory</hi> to ſaving Converſion. Indeed it would bewray great Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance &amp; Preſumption in you, to <hi>reſt</hi> in meer <hi>Means,</hi> to depend on them to do the Office of the <hi>divine Efficient,</hi> or to depend on your own Endeavours in the Uſe of them, as <hi>deſerving</hi> at his Hands. However, let it be conſider'd alſo, it would bewray great Ingratitude to God, to ſlight the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004954_0045_100E46A79A3CC430"/>
common Operations of his Spirit; and an unſufferable Affront to him, to <hi>receive his Grace in vain,</hi> or not to give Diligence, that under its Reſtraints and Aſſiſtances you may go the utmoſt Lengths, you are capable of in your preſent Condition, both from Sin and towards Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Common Grace,</hi> tho' ſpecifically different from ſaving Grace, yet is alſo <hi>the Fruit of the</hi> SPIRIT, an improva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Talent, good in its Place, and to its proper Ends and Uſes. The SPIRIT is <hi>good;</hi> and all his Gifts and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do participate of his Goodneſs. His <hi>common Grace</hi> is good in its <hi>Kind;</hi> and all its genuine Applications and Actings do partake of the Goodneſs of their Principle. Hence a Sinner, under the Government and in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>common Grace,</hi> tho' he <hi>cannot pleaſe God</hi> (in the Senſe of that Scripture-Expreſſion) yet he <hi>leſs diſpleaſes</hi> him, than the openly profane, or the careleſs Hypocrite. He is <hi>leſs abominable,</hi> when behaving as he ſhould under Conviction and Humiliation, than in the Fulneſs of his Pride and Security. While, by the Help of the SPIRIT in his lower Operations, the Sinner is diligently and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly attending the inſtituted Courſe of <hi>Means,</hi> he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>leſs provokes</hi> God, than if he totally neglected or but formally and coldly &amp; occaſionally attended them. Such an awak'ned inquiring Sinner may be ſaid to be <hi>not far from the Kingdom of God;</hi> he keeps in the <hi>Way</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſing;</hi> and is doing what hath an <hi>inſtrumental</hi> Aptitude to promote the Soul's <hi>Preparation</hi> or Prediſpoſition to Faith in Chriſt, by which <hi>Faith</hi> he may <hi>pleaſe</hi> the Lord.</p>
                  <p>While then you are juſtly cautious and afraid of <hi>reſting</hi> in any Attainments intellectual or moral, that are the Reſult of meer <hi>common Grace,</hi> which neither are Converſion, nor can merit it; yet you muſt be cautious too of <hi>undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>neglecting</hi> the SPIRIT in his <hi>common</hi> Influences. So likewiſe, while you are careful to look beyond your ſelves, and above all Means and Inſtruments, unto the FIRST CAUSE, from whom comes down every good and perfect Gift; you are, notwithſtanding, to value the <hi>Means</hi> in their Place and Order, and be diligent in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, by the Help of <hi>common Grace,</hi> to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

Let no dark Reflections or gloomy Proſpects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to ſilence <hi>Prayer,</hi> to diſpirit unto <hi>Duty,</hi> or obſtruct your Progreſs in the careful painful Uſe of all appointed Means. As, on the one Hand, you muſt be vigilant leſt the Adverſary of Souls ſhould precipitate a ſuperficial Healing of your bruiſed Spirit, in the Methods of <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiſm</hi> or Self-Righteouſneſs, and thus deſtroy your Soul by a <hi>falſe Peace</hi> and <hi>preſumptuous Hope:</hi> So, on the other Hand, you muſt take Heed, leſt he drive you to a wicked and damning <hi>Deſpair;</hi> by exaſperating your Wounds, blinding your Eyes to the Goſpel-Remedy, or repreſenting it to you in a diſparaging Light, and overwhelming you with the Terrors of Law and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>For I muſt obſerve to you, altho' the <hi>Fears</hi> of awaken'd Sinners, ſo far as they have <hi>true Grounds</hi> and a <hi>proper Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> are certainly Products of the Holy SPIRIT, as <hi>the Spirit of Bondage;</hi> yet that <hi>Fear of Amazement,</hi> which hath a ſlaviſh helliſh Torment, and that <hi>Deſperation,</hi> which drives Men to <hi>put from them the Word of God,</hi> or makes them lie down in ſullen Negligence, are Things that do not belong to the Work of the convincing SPIRIT, nor are the genuine Effects of any immediate Impreſſions of <hi>His</hi> upon their Souls: No, but they ſpring out of a <hi>corrupt Heart</hi> and <hi>guilty Conſcience,</hi> and the Impreſſions of <hi>Satan,</hi> acting in the Form of a cruel Accuſer and malicious Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifier. O <hi>be not ignorant of Satan's Devices, leſt he get an Advantage againſt you.</hi> He has his Affrightments, as well as Allurements: be upon your Guard againſt both. When provoked, under Impreſſions of Guilt &amp; Wrath, to deſpond, and give over the Care of your Salvation as hopeleſs, look upon it as (what it is in Truth) a <hi>Temptation;</hi> and reſiſt the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is a Liar and a Murderer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. O conſider, you do but credit and pleaſe <hi>that wicked One,</hi> by all your <hi>unbelieving</hi> Fears, your reſolute <hi>Deafneſs</hi> to Goſpel-Encouragements, your ſinful <hi>Demurs,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004954_0048_100E46B109593BF8"/>
Diſtruſts, Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Objections,</hi> whereby you thruſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Hope, and deaden your Heart to Duty. This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Conduct is derogatory to Goſpel-Grace, a Reproach to the Father of Mercies, a Diſparagement to the meek and compaſſionate Redeemer, a Grief to the Holy Spirit, the maddeſt Cruelty to your own Soul, and a Gratification of <hi>your Adverſary the Devil, who goeth about as a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> "whoſe Trade is to tear poor Souls in Pieces, and torture them all he can". Realiſe it, there is a <hi>Terror</hi> that is dangerous, unprofitable, unneceſſary; ariſing from Unbelief, and deſponding Tho'ts and Paſſions, under a <hi>Satanick</hi> Influence. Beware here. Tho' the Devil would fain perſwade you, that the Day of Viſitation is over with you, that your Caſe is unremediable, and hopeleſs like his own, yet believe him not. What tho' your Diſeaſes and Wounds be truly immedicable, by all the Skill and Power of Creatures, and ſo your Caſe is hazardous &amp; deplorable? Yet ſtill it is not <hi>deſperate.</hi> I this Day bring you the glad Tidings, that <hi>there is Balm in</hi> Gilead, <hi>and a Phyſician there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you feel your ſelves ſick and periſhing? Do your Wounds ſmart and pain you? Do your putrifying Sores make you even ſtink in your own Noſtrils? And are you afraid of dying by the Force of your malignant Maladies? O be thankful to God, who has open'd your Eyes to ſee your Danger, and awaken'd you to this Senſibility of your threatning Sickneſs and horrible Bruiſes. But, whatever the Devil and a deceitful Heart may ſay to affright you, don't give Way to deſpairing Apprehenſions. Believe it, there is a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and in him is Help to be found. He has a ſovereign Remedy for every Malady, effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for every Grievance. Your Sin and Miſery do not exceed the Sufficiency of your Phyſician, or the Virtue of his Remedies. He is able even to <hi>raiſe the Dead:</hi> He <hi>quick'neth whom he will:</hi> and his Compaſſion is equal to his Power. He is taking you in Hand; and if you don't repulſe him in the Methods of his Wiſdom and Grace, by Unbelief, Impatience &amp; Diſpondence, nor affront him by returning to Security and Preſumption, there are promiſing

Signs at preſent of a merciful Cure intended for you. Verily, <hi>there's Hope in Iſrael for you as concerning this Thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' your Diſtreſs &amp; Anguiſh of Conſcience may be great and long continued, yet look upon the Dealings of your Divine Phyſician with you as but wholſome Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſubmit to his wiſe &amp; faithful Meaſures; attend his ſalutary Means; and hope, O trembling ſelf-humbling Sinner, hope for a bleſſed Iſſue. The Day ſeems to be dawning upon your Soul; or if at preſent you are in the Horror of Darkneſs, nevertheleſs the Day-Light may be near approaching. <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> may ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe, and dart his healing Beams upon you. <hi>Yet a little while,</hi> and the Phyſician may come to <hi>bind up your broken Heart.</hi> Have you not ſeen many Inſtances of his healing Power &amp; Mercy; and that in Caſes as helpleſs &amp; hopeleſs as yours? Let theſe Examples be your Encouragement: or they will render you the more inexcuſable, and ſerve to aggravate your Self-Deſtruction, if you periſh at laſt.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe Tho'ts make you reſolv'd &amp; unwearied in dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeeking the Lord, while he may be found.—You have at leaſt the Motive of a <hi>Who can tell?</hi> O caſt your ſelf on his ſovereign Grace; and go on, go on ſeeking, <hi>if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure</hi> He may be found of you. <hi>Seek</hi> JESUS <hi>that was crucify'd,</hi> whoſe Blood is an adequate Remedy, be your Caſe ever ſo bad. Here, here is your Remedy, diſtreſſed Soul! Methinks, if you have any true feeling of your Sickneſs and Wounds, it muſt ſomething ſolace your aking Heart, to hear of this glorious effectual Remedy.

                  <p>You that have obtained the incomparable Bleſſing of a <hi>healed Soul,</hi> be thankful to your Divine Phyſician. Let not Men and Means, but God your Saviour, have the Praiſe.

                  <p>But theſe Hints muſt ſuffice here.— And thus I have largely conſider'd (what I had my Eye principally to) the firſt Propoſition.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here I might ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) One Caſe is, when there is a remarkable Proficiency in chriſtian experimental <hi>Knowledge;</hi> ſingular Improvement in ſpiritual Wiſdom and Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Another Caſe is, when there's a diſtinguiſhing Growth in <hi>Grace,</hi> and Progreſs in the Divine <hi>Life;</hi> the new Man increaſing in the Vigour and Activity of it's holy Principles &amp; Powers of Operation.</p>

                  <p>In all theſe Reſpects there's a gradual Difference among vital Chriſtians: and where any do <hi>excel,</hi> in all or either of theſe Points of ſuperior Attainment, ſuch may be ſaid, by way of <hi>Eminence,</hi> to have Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>I muſt not ſtay to illuſtrate theſe ſeveral Heads: but ſhall now hint at ſome Reflections, by way of APPLICATION.</p>
                  <p>USE. 1. How <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>venerable</hi> are all ſuch Souls as <hi>proſper</hi> in this exalted Senſe! —They are the wiſeſt, and beſt, and moſt felicitous Souls on Earth. And how happy, how amiable the Place, that is full of theſe proſperous Souls!</p>
                  <p>USE 2. Let it be for a <hi>Lamentation,</hi> that the <hi>Number</hi> of ſuch Souls in the profeſſing World, and even among our ſelves, is ſo exceeding <hi>ſmall.</hi> How few ſtrong and lively, even among living Chriſtians!</p>
                  <p>USE 3. Let us all <hi>examine</hi> into our Character, by the Rules here preſented us— Do we make happy Advances in Chriſtian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience, in Faith and Holineſs, in Hope and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Then may our <hi>Souls</hi> be denominated truly, yea, eminently <hi>healthful</hi> and <hi>proſperous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I come to another general Note from the Text.</p>

               <p>If we ſhould conſider the Nature and Dignity of the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man, or the Neceſſity and Advantages of this <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> of Soul; if we ſhou'd conſider the infinite <hi>Price</hi> and divine <hi>Power,</hi> by Virtue of which we obtain it; if we ſhou'd conſider the united <hi>Suffrages of Believers,</hi> or even the Sentiments of <hi>Sinners</hi> themſelves, in their dying Moments, or under Awaknings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Point wou'd eaſily receive a clear and full Confirmation.—But I muſt not dwell here.</p>
               <p>USE. 1. Hence the vaſt Obligations of <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to God our Saviour, lying upon all true Believers; in that he hath given them this Bleſſing of Bleſſings, <hi>the Spirit of Love &amp; of Power and of a ſound Mind.</hi>
