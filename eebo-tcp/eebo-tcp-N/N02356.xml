            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is one part of our Honour and Happiness in this Country, among the many difficulties and troubles which have attended the Settlements and growth of it unto this day, that there have not been w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nting from time to time honest and worthy <hi>Persons,</hi> and some learned, who have delivered down to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity a plain and true account of the <hi>Wars</hi> which we have had with the <hi>Indian Natives</hi> in one part of the Land and in another.</p>
            <p>We owe much unto <hi>Those</hi> who have done us this Service from the beginning, and they have herein served God, as well as obliged the World. For it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has been, and ever is like to be a grateful thing to Mankind to be informed of the rise and growth of <hi>Provinces,</hi> and of the sufferings of their feeble infant state: And from the days of <hi>Moses,</hi> who wrote the first <hi>History,</hi> the beginning of the World, and of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> the wise and pious among Men have scarce known a more sacred Pleasure, nor found a more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Entertainment, than in tracing the footsteps and windings of Divine Providence, in the planting of <hi>Colonies</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> here and there, thro' the Earth.</p>
            <p>Nor let it seem vain in me to say, that in the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the <hi>New-England</hi> Churches and Provinces, there have been some Circumstances so like unto those of <hi>Israel</hi> of old, (after their entrance into <hi>Canaan</hi>) that I am p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, on Principles both humane and religious, I gladly introduce the following <hi>Memoirs</hi> to the publick view, with my hearty thanks to the <hi>Honourable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> for the great pains he has taken (among other his publick Services) to transmit these Particulars of the <hi>two last Wars</hi> with the Indian Enemy down to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>That the Generation to come might know them, and set their hope in God, and not forget his Works, but keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> must not expect much Entertainment or Curiosity in the story of a <hi>barbarous War</hi> with cruel and perfidious <hi>Salvages</hi>: It is the benefit of <hi>Posterity,</hi> in a religious Improvement of this dry and bloody Story, that we aim at, in preserving some Remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And that in times to come, when we are dead and forgotten, <hi>Materials may remain for a continued &amp;

entire History of our Country:</hi> And we hope that they who come after us will take the like Care in their Times for the Children which shall be born.</p>
            <p>Let it suffice in praise of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> if the Facts related be true and exact, and that the Style be familiar, plain and easy, as all <hi>Historical Memoirs</hi> should be writ. As to the Truth of it, none (I suppose) will have any doubt to whom the <hi>Author</hi> is known; and to whom among us is he not known? Or by whom among the lovers of the Country is he not esteemed for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate regards unto the religious and civil Liberties of it?</p>
            <p>The Reverend Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> wrote the <hi>Remarkables of the Eastern War</hi> before this, from the year <hi>1688.</hi> unto the year <hi>1698. ten</hi> years, wherefore he called his Book, <hi>Decennium Luctuosum.</hi> This Book may claim the like <hi>Title,</hi> for the first War here related, from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> the <hi>10</hi>th <hi>1703.</hi> to the <hi>13</hi>th of <hi>July 1713.</hi> did also continue just <hi>ten</hi> years.</p>
            <p>To these <hi>ten</hi> years of Trouble and Distress the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> has added an Account of another but shorter War of <hi>three</hi> years, from <hi>July 25. 1722.</hi> to <hi>December 15. 1725.</hi> When the <hi>Salvages</hi> by their <hi>Delegates</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd their Submission, and signed Articles of Peace in the Council-Chamber in <hi>Boston;</hi> for the lasting effects whereof we are humbly waiting on a Gracious GOD with our earnest Prayers. And we owe abundant <hi>Praises</hi> to his Holy Name for the great <hi>Successes,</hi> with which he has been pleased to crown the <hi>Counsels</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> in this <hi>last</hi> short <hi>War;</hi> to the humbling the insolent Enemy and bringing them so soon to sue for the Peace which they had broken. <hi>Not unto us, O LORD! not to us; but to thy Name give Glory; for thy Mercy and for thy Truth sake!</hi>

The plain hand of <hi>Providence</hi> and not their own Conduct <hi>facilitated</hi> and quickned their March. God sent 'em timely <hi>Information</hi> where the <hi>Indians</hi> had plac'd their Guards upon the River, that they might shun them, and so come upon the Town un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered.

            <p>THE keeping a <hi>Register of Memorable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,</hi> as it has been the practice of former Ages, so it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for the advantage of Posterity: And in as much as the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me near the Seat of Action, where I have had greater Opportunities than many others of remarking the Cruelty and Perfidy of the <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy, I thought it my Duty to keep a Record thereof. Not that at first I design'd to make these <hi>Memoirs</hi> publick but now am perswaded to it by some whose Judgment I pay a deference unto. In the collecting them, I have us'd all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and have been assisted therein not only from the Abstracts of Original Letters, but from Persons of the best Credit and Reputation, and yet doubtless some small Occurences may have slipt my knowledge.</p>
            <p>I might with <hi>Orosius</hi> very justly entitle this His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>De miseria hominum,</hi> being no other then a Narrative of <hi>Tragical Incursions</hi> perpetrated by Bloody <hi>Pagans,</hi> who are Monsters of such Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the words of <hi>Virgil</hi> may not unaptly be apply'd to them.</p>

And probably that very Sin of ours in neglecting the welfare of their <hi>Souls.</hi> For <hi>we</hi> have not expressed the like laudable Care for them, as hath been done in the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> parts of the Country. But indeed we have rather aimed to advance a private Trade, then to instruct them in the Principles of true Religion. This brings to my remembrance a remarkable saying of one of their Chief <hi>Sachems,</hi> whom (a little before the War broke out) I asked, Wherefore it was they were so much bigoted to the <hi>French</hi>? Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Traffick with them was not so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous as with the <hi>English.</hi> He gravely reply'd, <hi>That the Friars taught them to Pray, but the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish never did.</hi>

            <p>And it is also remarkably observable that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the <hi>Settlements</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> of Figure and Distinction, not one of them have been utterly destroy'd where ever a <hi>Church</hi> was gathered.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Eastern parts</hi> have been remiss, this should no ways detract from the praise of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable zeal of the Venerable Mr. <hi>Elliot,</hi> and the indesatigable Pains which the renown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now considering the League that has been solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized with the <hi>Indians,</hi> together with their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Treachery so notoriously perpetrated, it's no wonder if in the sequel of this History, we find them under some signal Remark of the Divine Displeasure.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002796_0006_0FE63A9860282D80"/>NOT that I am unsensible that many have stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd the <hi>English</hi> as chiefly culpable in causing the first Breach between them and us; by invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Properties, and defrauding them in their Dealings: But to censure the Publick for the sinister Actions of a few private Persons, is utterly repugnant to Reason and Equity. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering the great Care that the <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slative</hi> Power had taken to protect the <hi>Natives,</hi> and their Interests.</p>
            <p>WHAT hath formerly occur'd of this kind is none of my business to discant upon here; but as to the Infraction which I am about to make mention of, I never yet heard the least Word in their favour, but all sorts of Persons do condemn their Perfidy.</p>
            <p>AT the arrival of Governour <hi>Dudley</hi> in the Year 1702. the whole Body of <hi>Indians</hi> was in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable good Frame and Temper; but being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the <hi>French,</hi> they soon began to threaten and insult the <hi>English:</hi> Upon which in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Year <hi>Iune</hi> the 20th. a <hi>Congress</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Casco,</hi> where the Chiefs of the several <hi>Tribes</hi> met,
viz. Mauxis, <hi>and</hi> Hopehood <hi>from</hi> Naridgewalk, Wanungunt, <hi>&amp;</hi> Wanadugunbuent <hi>from</hi> Penobscot, Wattanamunton, Adiawando <hi>and</hi> Hegen <hi>from</hi> Pennecook, <hi>and</hi> Pigwacket.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mesambomett,</hi> and <hi>Wexar,</hi> from <hi>Amasconty,</hi> with about 250 Men in 65 Canoos, well arm'd, and mostly <hi>painted</hi> with variety of Colours, which seemingly were affable and kind, and yet in some Instances gave cause of jealousy.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Tent</hi> being fixt for entertaining the <hi>Governour</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002796_0006_0FE63A9860282D80"/>
and Gentlemen who accompanied him, together with the <hi>Sagamores</hi>; His Excellency very kindly saluted them, saying,
<q>That as he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated by the Great and Victorious <hi>Queen of England,</hi> he came to visit them as his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> and to reconcile whatever Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences had hapned since the last <hi>Treaty.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>AT this they made a pause, but after a short Intermission Captain <hi>Simmo,</hi> who was their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor arose, and said,
<q>That they acknowledged his Favour in giving them a Visit at such a juncture, with so many of the <hi>Council</hi> and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of both <hi>Provinces</hi>; assuring him, that they aimed at nothing more than <hi>Peace</hi>; and that as high as the <hi>Sun</hi> was above the Earth, so far distant should their Designs be of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the least breach between each other.</q>
And as a Testimony thereof they presented him a Belt of <hi>Wampam,</hi> and invited him to the <hi>Two Pillars</hi> of Stones, which at a former Treaty were erected, and called by the significant Name of the TWO BROTHERS; unto which both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties went, and added a greater Number of Stones.</p>
            <p>THIS Ceremony being performed, several Volleys were discharged on each side; and the <hi>Indians</hi> added their usual dancing, singing, and loud acclamations of Joy. <hi>Trading-houses</hi> in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places were hereupon engaged; and that the Price of Commodities should be stated, and an <hi>Armourer</hi> fixed at the publick Charge: Many <hi>Presents</hi> were also made them, which they kindly received; so that every thing lookt with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising Aspect of a settled Peace: And that which afterward seem'd to confirm it, was the coming

               </gap>or that they were <hi>as firm as the Mountains,</hi> and should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue so, as long as the Sun and Moon endured.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Eastern</hi> Inhabitants, who before had thoughts of removing, were now encouraged to stand their Ground; several more were also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to settle among them, partly from the fertility of the Soil, the plenty of Timber, the advantage of Fishery, and several other Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But I should have taken notice of <hi>two</hi> Instances in the late Treaty, wherein the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Perfidy of these bloody Infidels did notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously appear. 1<hi>st.</hi> As the Treaty was concluded with Volleys on both sides, as I said before, the <hi>Indians</hi> desired the <hi>English</hi> to fire first, which they readily did, concluding it no other but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement; but so soon as the <hi>Indians</hi> fired, it was observ'd that their Guns were charg'd with Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; having contrived (as was afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd) to make the <hi>English</hi> the Victims of that Day. But Providence so order'd it, as to place their chief Counsellours and <hi>Sachems</hi> in the Tent where ours were seated, by which means they could not destroy one without endangering the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. As the <hi>English</hi> waited some Days for <hi>Watanummon</hi> (the <hi>Pigwacket Sachem</hi>) to compleat their Council, it was afterward discovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they only tarried for a Reinforcement of 200 <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who in three Days after we
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002796_0007_0FE63A986252C228"/>
returned came among them; having resolved to seize the Governour, Council and Gentlemen, and then to Sacrifice the Inhabitants at pleasure; which probably they might have done, had they not been prevented by an overuling Power.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this Disappointment, they were still resolved on their bloody <hi>Design:</hi> For within six Weeks after the whole <hi>Eastern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was in a Conflagration, no House standing, nor Garrison unattackt. <hi>August</hi> 10th at nine in the Morning they began their bloody <hi>Tragedy,</hi> being about five hundred <hi>Indians</hi> of all sorts, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h a number of <hi>French</hi>; who divided themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several Companies, and made a Descent on the several Inhabitants from <hi>Casco</hi> to <hi>Wells</hi> at one and the same time, sparing none of every Age or Sex.</p>
            <p>AS the milk white Brows of the Grave and <hi>Ancient</hi> had no respect shown; so neither had the mournful cries of tender <hi>Infants</hi> the least pity; for they triumph'd at their Misery, and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such as the skilfullest Artists, who were most dexterous in contriving the greatest Tortures; which was enough to turn the most <hi>Stoical Apathie</hi> into Streams of mournful Sympathy and Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>THE Town of <hi>Wells,</hi> which valiantly stood its Ground both in the former and latter War, suffered now great Spoil, nor could escape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loss of 39 that were kill'd and taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cape-Porposs</hi> being inhabited only by a few Fishermen, was wholly laid desolate. But the Garrison at <hi>Winter-Harbour</hi> defended itself with much Bravery; yet it was at last overpowered

by Force, and then submitted on Terms</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saco-Fort</hi> was also attackt by the Enemy with great Fury; they kill'd eleven, and carried twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Captive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spurwink,</hi> which was principally inhabited by the <hi>Iordans,</hi> had no less than twenty two of that Family kill'd and taken.</p>
            <p>THOSE at <hi>Scarborough</hi> were mostly in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whom the <hi>Indians</hi> not willing to encounter, sent a <hi>Captive</hi> before with a Flag of Truce; but the <hi>Officer</hi> being acquainted with their Intreagues, slighted the Message, secured the Captive, and made a vigorous Defence. However, by a long Siege they were so reduced, that had not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits been sent them, they had utterly been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perpooduck</hi> was of all places (for number) the greatest sufferers, being but nine Families, and no Garrison to retire unto; neither any Men at home, where they took eight, and inhumanly butchered twenty five; among whom was the Wife of <hi>Michael Webber,</hi> who being big with Child, they knockt her on the head, and ript open her Womb, cutting one part of the Child out; a Spectacle of horrid Barbarity.</p>

Their Voice to him at first seem'd like the Voice of <hi>Iacob,</hi> but their Hands were like the Hands of <hi>Esau: With their Tongues they used deceit, and the Poison of Asps was under their Lips.</hi> For no sooner had they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him, but with Hatchets under their Mantles they violently assaulted him; having a number that lay in Ambush near them, who shot down one of his Guards: But being a Person of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Strength, as well as Courage, he soon wrested a Hatchet from one of them, with which he did good Execution: Yet if Sergeant <hi>Hook</hi> (with a file of Ten from the Fort) had not spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily succoured him, they would soon have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him. Mr. <hi>Phippeny</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kent,</hi> who accompanied him, were attackt by others, and soon fell by their Fury; for being advanced in Years, they were so infirm, that I might say of them as <hi>Iuvenal</hi> did of <hi>Priam,</hi> They had scarce Blood enough left to tinge the Knife of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p>THE Enemy being defeated in this their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, fell upon the several Cottages which lay round, and destroyed all they could.

            <p>THE Use of <hi>Snow-shoes</hi> appearing very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for marching in the Winter Season, occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Act in both <hi>Provinces</hi> for supplying the Frontiers therewith: And this Season, which before was dreaded as most hazardous, was now the time of greatest safety, and of less difficulty in travelling.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Southern</hi> Parts not thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in so much Danger, did in a little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come secure, which the Enemy taking notice of, fell on <hi>Deerfield,</hi> of which the Reverend Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> gave me the following Account. That Collonel <hi>Schuyler,</hi> who was always a kind and faithful Intelligencer, gave timely warning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which awaken'd some, but was slighted by

others: However, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor of that Place, was strongly possest that the Town would in a little time be destroyed; sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying as much in his publick Ministry, and private Conference; and could not be satisfied till he had got twenty Soldiers to be posted there. A few Nights before the Assault was, they were strangely amused, by a trampling Noise round the Fort, as if it were beset by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi> Towards Morning, being <hi>February</hi> 29th. the Enemy sent Scouts to discover the posture of the Town, who observing the Watch walking in the Streets, returned and put them to a stand: A while after they sent again, and were advised, that all was then still and quiet: Upon which, two hours before Day, they attackt the Fort, and by the advantage of some drifts of Snow, got over the Walls. The whole Body was above two hundred and fifty, under the Command of Monsieur <hi>Arteil,</hi> who found the People fast asleep and easily secured them. The most considerable part of the Town thus fell into their Hands. They left no Garrison unattackt, excepting that of Capt. <hi>Wells</hi>; But at <hi>Benoni Stebbins</hi>'s they met with some repulse, and lost several. Sixty of the <hi>English</hi> fell, whereof many were stifled in a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; and a hundred were taken Captive, who with a melancholly Countenance condoled each other's Misery, yet durst not express the Anguish of their Souls. That Day and Night were spent in plundering, burning and destroying. The next Morning they withdrew into the Woods, car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(before mentioned) whose Sufferings, with his Neighbours, through a deep Snow, over moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Desarts, were exceeding great; besides many Trials and Fears which they laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>The Country being alarm'd, several hastned to their Relief; about thirty of those which first came, charged the Enemy in the rear, and being strengthned with a further Supply, pursued them with good Success; but the Enemy returning, and being much superiour in Number, kill'd nine of ours in the Skirmish.</p>
            <p>The Day after there was a considerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the lower Towns, as well as from the County of <hi>Hartford,</hi> but for want of <hi>Snow-shoes,</hi> were unable to pursue them. Some of our Captives then in <hi>Canada,</hi> knowing the Enterprize that was on Foot, sent several Letters unto their Friends, which the Enemy did carefully put into a Bag, and hung it upon the limb of a Tree in the high-way; which Letters were afterwards found, and gave Satisfaction of those that were then alive among them.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Indians</hi> by Land were every way distressing of us, the <hi>French</hi> by Sea were as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious to impoverish us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 7th. 1704. they fitted out a <hi>Privateer Shallop</hi> with twenty seven Men, to intercept our <hi>Southern</hi> Trade as they came laden with Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which if they had succeeded in, would not only have supplied their own indigent Forces, but the <hi>Indians</hi> also; (who were then forming a desperate Design against us) But thro' the favour of God to us, they were cast away on <hi>Plimouth</hi>

Shore. A like signal Favour to us was the taking a <hi>Store-Ship</hi> of theirs (by our <hi>Virginia</hi> Fleet) of Forty Guns, bound to <hi>Canada,</hi> in which were twenty Officers, two thousand small Arms, with Ammunition answerable; besides a vast number of Crucifixes, and Presents of a greater value for encouraging the <hi>Indians</hi> in acts of Hostility against the <hi>English.</hi> In the Engagement their General was slain, the only Man that fell in Battle, by whose Interest those <hi>Stores</hi> were procured; which loss was so affecting, that (as some of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives afterwards reported) it caused a deep Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation throughout <hi>Canada</hi> a considerable time after.</p>

However they surpriz'd a Servant of his, as she went to the Well for Water, whom (after they had examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning her Master, the State of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and other Affairs) they knockt on the head,

The Enemy soon drew off, but fearing a pursuit, dismist one of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with this Caution, that if the <hi>English</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them they would Slay the Prisoners, but the unfortunate Messenger in returning back was Slain by another <hi>Indian.</hi> On the same Morning another Party attacked a Farm house two Miles off, but the fury of the Dogs so alarm'd the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, that they instantly got up and fired se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Guns to very good advantage, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented any further attempt. As for those at <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comuck</hi> they were immediatly pursued, three made an Escape, eight were rescued, nineteen slain, &amp; three carryed to <hi>Canada.</hi> Next day Major <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> pursued them with a number of Horses, and came upon their Track, but the Ways were so impassible, that they sent their Horses back with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002796_0013_0FE63AA79A98AF70"/>
a resolve to follow them on Foot, but some prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lame, and others tyring, caused the rest to desist. I would here remark, that a little before the Troubles at <hi>Pascomuck,</hi> and the Farm house before mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the People at <hi>Springfield</hi> heard a great shooting; Unto some it seem'd to be at <hi>Westfield,</hi> to others at a <hi>Village,</hi> and to some again in the <hi>Woods</hi>; so that many hastned to their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but when they came all was still and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, the reason whereof is hard to assign, and yet we have repeated instances in History of the like nature.</p>
            <p>Under all those Sufferings from a cruel Enemy little or no impression could ever be made by us upon them, by reason of their retiring into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessable Swamps, and Mountains.

15th. they sail'd Eastward, visiting all parts as they went along, till they came to the Green Islands, where they took Monsieur <hi>Lafebure,</hi> and his two Sons with a <hi>Canada Indian,</hi> whom they examined apart: The Father at first seem'd Surly and Croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the young Men were much of the like Temper, but being told what they must trust un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in case they did not confess, were afterwards Submissive, and promis'd to Pilot them where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were directed.

of War was held, and Lievt. <hi>Giles</hi> was sent to the Town with a Flag of Truce and Summons to Surrender; Their Answer was,

Upon which a descent was made upon them that Night, but little effected until the Morning, and then the Forces drew up and drove all before them.</p>
            <p>There was at this time a considerable plenty of Brandy, and Clarret in their Houses, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved a snare than service to our Men; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the <hi>Indians,</hi> who naturally affect strong Drink, but this was soon prevented, by breaking in the heads of the Casks. Lieutenant <hi>Baker</hi> and one more were kill'd in this Attack, and not above six died in the whole Expedition. Most of their Houses were burnt, and much Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taken, but with as little Effusion of Blood as possibly could be. The <hi>General</hi> ordered their Damms to be dug down, and their Fortifications to be laid in Ashes. Having as great success as reasonably could be expected, thro' out all the Territorys of <hi>L' Accadia,</hi> and <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> where he took a hundred Prisoners, burnt and laid wast all the <hi>French</hi> Settlements, (except the Town of <hi>Port-Royal</hi>) a great many Cattle were also kill'd, and the <hi>Indians</hi> driven into such Confusion, that they left their Wigwams and retired into private Cells.</p>
            <p>ON <hi>Iuly</hi> 4th. a Council of War was call'd to concert what next to do, who resolved, that as the Fort was alarm'd, the Enemy was more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than at first; and that as many of our Men
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002796_0014_0FE63AB4790BED78"/>
were tyred and defective, it would be best to return; which was also consented unto by our Sea-Officers. But notwithstanding the Fatigue that this worthy <hi>Gentleman</hi> had undergone, and the Dangers he had run; the Spoil he had done, and the Victories he wan, yet he could not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Censures of many. Some indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol'd his Valour and Conduct even to an <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole,</hi> while others endeavoured to lessen it with as much Disgrace and Infamy. Some thought he did too much, others too little: But after one and another had pass'd their Sentiments, the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly</hi> (which was then sitting) voted him <hi>Thanks for the good Services he did both to the</hi> Queen <hi>and</hi> Country.</p>
            <p>The Governour of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> being in fear of a new Enterprize, sent <hi>Lewis Allein</hi> as a Spy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Colour of a <hi>Flag of Truce,</hi> with six Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (whereof Mr. <hi>Hoddy</hi> of <hi>Piscataqua</hi> was one) to observe and know the Motion of the <hi>English.</hi> But being suspected, he was apprehended and searcht, and in his Pocket-book was found this Direction; <hi>That if any Enterprize was on foot, he should (in his</hi> Advice-book) <hi>joyn</hi> L. A. <hi>the two first Letters of his Name, close together; if it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Agitation, to place them at some Distance; but if nothing was in Motion, then to sign a</hi> Cross.</p>
            <p>While our Forces were engaged in visiting the Enemy abroad, great care was taken of covering the Frontiers at home; and yet very daring As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults were frequently made by small numbers. At <hi>Oyster-River</hi> they wounded <hi>William Tasket,</hi> and at <hi>Dover</hi> they way-laid the Inhabitants as they returned from publick Worship: After that they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002796_0015_0FE63AB480294A50"/>
kill'd a Lad near <hi>Casco</hi> Fort. About the same time some of the Enemy were Fishing up <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> River, and being trackt by a small Scout of our Volunteers, one <hi>Englishman</hi> and five <hi>Mohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen Indians,</hi> they pursued them to such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that they slew the whole Company, save one, which were nine in number.

about dividing the Skin before the Bear was kill'd. Their Dissention at last was so great, that upwards of two hundred return'd in discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. However the rest came on, and sent Scouts before to observe the Posture of the <hi>English,</hi> who reported, that they were as thick as the Trees in the Woods.

One of them was an Officer of some Distinction, which so Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated their Spirits, that in revenge they fired the Meeting House, kill'd several Cattle, and burnt many Out-houses. About the same time Capt. <hi>Allen</hi> from <hi>Westfield</hi> discovered a small Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with whom he had a Skirmish, and lost one Man, but kill'd three, and rescued a Captive. After this, between <hi>Hadley</hi> and <hi>Quabaug,</hi> we had one wounded and another Slain. By this time came Major <hi>Tailor</hi> with his Troop, (who always distinguish't himself of an active Spirit to serve his Country) Capt. <hi>Prescot, Buckley,</hi> and <hi>Willard</hi> with their Companies, who were so vigorous and intense in pursuing the Enemy, that they put them all to flight. And yet a little while after they fell on <hi>Groaton,</hi> and <hi>Nashaway,</hi> where they
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002796_0017_0FE63AB7E9838870"/>
kill'd Lieut. <hi>Wyler,</hi> and several more. It was not then known how many of the Enemy were slain, it being customary among them to carry off their Dead: However it was afterward affirm'd, that they lost sixteen besides several that were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After this they divided into smaller Parties, and did much Mischief, as at <hi>Aimsbury, Haverhil,</hi> and <hi>Exeter. August</hi> 11th. they wounded <hi>Mark Giles</hi> of <hi>Dover,</hi> (with his Son) who thro' anguish of Pain, and much effusion of Blood, expired a few days after. At the same time another Partie fell on <hi>York,</hi> where they slew <hi>Matthew Austin</hi> nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The five Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> which are called by the Name of the <hi>Oneydes, Onnondages, Cayonges, Senneches,</hi> and <hi>Macquaus,</hi> all this while stood Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But being like to be influenced by the <hi>French Missionaries</hi> who came among them, Colonel <hi>Townsend</hi> and Mr.<hi>Leverett</hi> from the <hi>Massachusetts,</hi> Capt. <hi>Gold</hi> and Capt. <hi>Levinston</hi> from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> were Commissionated to give them a Visit, and strengthen the Alliance with them; which they did to so good Effect, that they promis'd to take up the <hi>Hatchet,</hi> whenever the Governour of <hi>New-York</hi> should desire it. But why so fair an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was lost, when the Interest of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> lay bleeding, was matter of Surprize and Admiration to some, of Censures and Reflections to others.

with us in our Wars. In the midst of War, there seems a secret League between them and the Governour of <hi>Canada,</hi> not to suffer the least breach to be made on one another by any of their <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although my Design was only to remark the barbarous Insults of those bloody Pagans on the Territories of <hi>New-England</hi>; yet I think it not improper to take a short view of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent on <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> considering the nearness of its Scituation, and that several of our <hi>Eastward Indians</hi> were confederate with them.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of <hi>August,</hi> one hundred and forty <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> in two Sloops, early in the Morning, from <hi>Placentia,</hi> arrived at <hi>Bonovist,</hi> and surprized the <hi>Pembrook Galley,</hi> the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Pool,</hi> and a lesser Vessel, in which was thirty Ton of Oil: Capt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gill</hi> of <hi>Charlestown</hi> was there at the same time, in a Ship of fourteen. Guns, with twenty four Men. He was furiously attackt, but defended himself with great Courage and good Conduct, from diverse bold and desperate At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which they made upon him. When he had beat 'em at small Arms, they then brought the Galley to bear upon him with her great Guns, which he return'd in the like Language. They then set Fire to the <hi>Society,</hi> with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of burning him alive; but the Wind proving contrary, drove her ashore on a Rock, where she soon consumed. They then set the lesser Ship on Fire, which burnt to such a degree, by reason of the Oil, that it would soon have devoured him, had not the Buoy-rope of the Anchor got beteen the Rudder and the Stern, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002796_0018_0FE63AC64BDAB6B8"/>
kept off the blazing War from him. The scituation of the Fort was such, as that it was not able to protect the Town of St. <hi>Iohns</hi>; upon which it was wholly laid in Ashes, the Inhabitants being mostly fled into the Woods. The loss that Capt. <hi>Gill</hi> sustained in the whole Encounter, was but one Man slain and two wounded.</p>
            <p>I now return to the <hi>Westward,</hi> where on the 25th of <hi>October,</hi> the Enemy did some Mischief. <hi>Lancaster</hi> was alarm'd, and the Alarm was a means of the untimely Death of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> their worthy Pastor. Several of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who belonged to the Garrison, were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by hard Travelling the Day before, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of the Enemy. This caused this good Man out of Pity and Compassion, to Watch that Night himself; accordingly he went into the Box, which lay over the Flanker, where he staid till late in the Night: But being cold, (as was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) he was coming down to warm himself; when one between Sleeping and Waking, or surpriz'd thro' excess of Fear, fir'd upon him, as he was coming out of the Watch-house; where no Man could rationally expect the coming of an Enemy.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> altho' he was shot through the Back, came to the Door and bid them open it, for he was wounded. No sooner did he enter, but he fainted away: As he came to himself, he asked who it was that shot him? and when they told him, he pray'd God to forgive him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him himself, believing that he did it not on purpose; and with a composed frame of Spirit, desired them that bewailed him not to weep, but
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002796_0019_0FE63AC64E053FA8"/>
pray for him, and his Flock. He comforted his sorrowful Spouse, and expired within an hour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Harvest being now gathered, and the Winter approaching, the Enemy like Beasts of Prey, retired to their private Cells: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it necessary to discover their Head quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it was resolved, that Col. <hi>Hilton,</hi> with two hundred and seventy Men, should go to <hi>Naridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk</hi> with twenty Days Provision: At which time the Country appeared like a frozen Lake, the Snow four foot deep; yet neither Officers nor Soldiers were in the least discouraged; but when they came unto the Fort, could not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the least step of an <hi>Indian,</hi> only a few deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Wigwams,</hi> and a large Chappel, with a Vestry at the end of it, which they set on fire.</p>
            <p>The Winter Season requiring <hi>Snow-shoes,</hi> an Express was sent Col. <hi>Patrick</hi> to supply the Frontiers therewith, which he no sooner forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Express was intercepted, by a <hi>Mount-Real</hi> Scout, who robb'd him of <hi>Fifty Pounds</hi> that he had in his Pocket, which at their return they presented to the Governour, who converted it into a <hi>Bowl,</hi> and called it by the Name of the <hi>New-England</hi> Gift.</p>
            <p>Early in the Spring, Capt. <hi>Larraby</hi> was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Cruise on the Shore of <hi>L' Accadia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the <hi>French</hi> from their Fishery, having <hi>Whale-Boats</hi> to attend him: Capt. <hi>Fowl</hi> was also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht in a Sloop of War, who on the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of <hi>Cape-Sables</hi> took a small Vessel formerly belonging to the <hi>English,</hi> which had Cattle and Sheep on Board her.

burnt a few Houses, and kill'd some Cattle; but the Inhabitants were so miserably poor, and their Circumstances so desperate, that they rather chose to be Prisoners among the <hi>English,</hi> than at Liberty among the <hi>French.</hi>

            <p>The descent that the Enemy again made on <hi>New foundland,</hi> was more terrible and surprizing than the former; for on <hi>Ianuary</hi> 21st. at break of day, Mounsieur <hi>Supercass,</hi> Governour of <hi>Placentia,</hi> came with five hundred and fifty <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, Port-Royal,</hi> and other places adjacent, and a company of Salvages, of whom <hi>Assacombuit</hi> was Chief; who ransack'd and laid waste all the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Settlements in a few Days, and then fell on St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, where in the space of two hours all were become Prisoners of War, excepting those in the Castle and Fort. The Night before the Enterprize they were oblig'd to lye on a Bed of Snow, six foot deep, for fear of being discovered, which caused such cold and numbness in the Joynts of several, that the General vow'd revenge, and accordingly Executed his Resentment, for that he destroy'd all before him, and gave no Quarter for some time; till Mounsieur <hi>Boocore,</hi> who was a Gentleman of more Humanity, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose and abate his Fury: The Number that they took alive was one hundred and forty, whom they sent unto the Garrison, not out of pity to the Prisoners, but with a design to Starve the whole.

            <p>Upon this the several <hi>Governours</hi> contributed their utmost Assistance; and considering that <hi>New-York</hi> (with the adjacent places) lay nearest the <hi>Lake,</hi> it was resolved that Col. <hi>Nicholso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it often happens in the course of Divine Providence, that when our Expectations are at the highest, things come to nothing. For while our Forces were ready, and after a vast Expence by long waiting, there was a stop at home from any further proceeding for that time; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosioned Col. <hi>Nicholson</hi> to imbarque again for <hi>England,</hi> to revive the Expedition, if possible.

            <p>Monsieur <hi>Maneval</hi> was then made Governour, who built a small Fort at <hi>Port Royal,</hi> which lies on the edge of a Basin one League broad, and two long, about sixteen foot of Water on one side, and six or seven on the other, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants drove a considerable Trade, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased much in the adjacent Parts, till Sr. <hi>William Phips</hi> ih the Year 1690, took possession of it in the Name of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and administred the Oaths of Allegiance to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; but in a little time they revolted.

After these unspeakable Difficulties they arrived at <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck December</hi> the sixteenth, where they were handsomely entertained, and after some time of Refreshment, discours'd about the Prisoners.

This caus'd the Enemy to triumph, and the more because they slew a superiour Officer, whom they soon scalpt, and with utmost revenge struck their Hatchets in his Brains, leaving a Lance at his Heart. Next day about a hundred Men went in pursuit of them, but could not discover any. One of the slain was buried on the spot, the other two brought home, where the Collonel was decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interr'd, the several Troops in great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity attending his Corps.

Upon this they went further <hi>East,</hi> and took three more; after that a certain <hi>Indian</hi> (thro' discontent) surrender'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and informed of <hi>Mauxis</hi> and several others that were at <hi>Penobscot,</hi> which our Forces had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto; and as they returned went up <hi>Saco</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where they took two, and kill'd five more. Now altho' the Number that we destroyed of them seems inconsiderable to what they did of ours, yet by Cold, Hunger, and Sickness, at least a third of them was wasted since the War begun.

proving foggy, and the Wind freshning, the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi> ask'd the <hi>Pilots</hi> what was best to do? who advised that as the Fleet was on the <hi>North</hi> Shore, it would be best to bring too, with their heads unto the <hi>Southward</hi>: but he obstinately refusing, acted the reverse, and ordered their heads unto the <hi>North,</hi> which was so astonishing unto the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,</hi> that one and another foretold their Fear (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Officers) and the Destiny that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them before the Morning; which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fell out. For at one of the Clock nine Ships with 1500. Men were all cast ashore, and most of the rest in as eminent danger; but so soon as the former struck, they fired their Guns, which gave Caution to the rest: Some of which wore, and stood off; others were so encompassed by the <hi>Breakers</hi> that they were oblig'd to bring too their Anchors, which was their last Refuge; but before the day approached, the Wind happily shifted to <hi>W. N. W.</hi> upon which they cut their Cables and came to sail. Soon after a Council of War was call'd, but the result not known until the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then the <hi>Flag</hi> bore away to <hi>Spanish Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> without giving the usual Signal: On which many of the windward Ships were left behind; but a small Man of War was ordered to Cruise the next day for those that were left, and to take up such as might be alive among the dead, who were about six hundred. After this they made towards the Fleet, but were eight days in getting down; during which time the Wind was <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> and had our Fleet proceeded, (as it were to be wish'd they had) might easily have got unto <hi>Quebeck</hi> in forty eight Hours.</p>

               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:002796_0038_0FE63B174336EBF8"/>Upon this disaster the whole Country (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Nation) was alarm'd, and many Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Jelousies arose; some imputing it to Cowardize, but most to Treachery, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Influence of some Malecontents then at Helm; otherwise why would a matter of such vast Importance to the <hi>British</hi> Kingdom, be hush't up in silence, and the Principal Officers not Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to appear. If the <hi>Admiral</hi> was in fault wherefore was he not call'd to an Account? Or why did not the <hi>General</hi> to vindicate himself, lay a Remonstrance before the Council Board? And the <hi>Pilots,</hi> (who were order'd from hence at so great a Charge to the Country to represent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a true light) been examined? But instead thereof, dismist without being ask'd one Question. However one thing is remarkable, that among those that were shipwrack'd and lost their lives, there was but one single Person that belong'd to <hi>New-England</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Nicholson</hi> at this juncture was industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously engaged in getting the <hi>Battoes</hi> ready for passing the <hi>Lake</hi> with a considerable Number of Friend <hi>Indians,</hi> as well as English, for the attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Mount Real,</hi> which next to <hi>Quebeck</hi> was the place of greatest Importance in all the <hi>French</hi> Territories. But just as he was ready to embarque an Express came and gave an Account of the miserable Disaster that befel the Fleet: Whereas, if he had proceeded, his whole Army would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have been cut off; For upon advice of our Fleets misfortune, the <hi>French</hi> drew off all their Auxiliaries and most of their <hi>Militia</hi> to reinforce <hi>Mount Real,</hi> being advis'd of the descent that was
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:002796_0038_0FE63B174336EBF8"/>
making on them. So great was our loss in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, that it Affected the whole Country se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years after; as the Advance &amp; Expence of so much Money and Provisions might well do. And it as much flusht the Enemy; for out of the ruins of our Vessels they not only got much Plunder, but fortified their Castle and out Batteries with a considerable Number of Cannon. They moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stirr'd up the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> about <hi>Annapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Royal</hi> to revolt from their Allegiance to the <hi>Crown.</hi> Capt <hi>Pigeon</hi> being ordered up the River for Timber to repair the Fort, was violently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt by no less than one hundred and fifty, who kill'd the whole Boats Crew, wounded the Fort <hi>Major,</hi> and afterwards very barbarously Murdered him: They also slew Capt. <hi>Forbis</hi> the Engineer, besides several others, and took thirty four of them Prisoners. Soon after this, we were informed of the Arrival of our <hi>British</hi> Forces in <hi>England,</hi> on the 9th. of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> where on the 15th. following, the Admirals Ship the <hi>Edgar</hi> was accidentally blown up, with 400 Seamen and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other People on board, all the Officers being on shore.</p>
            <p>The reduction of <hi>Canada</hi> was a matter of great Consequence, not only to the Interest of <hi>New-England</hi> and the adjacent Colonies; but also to the whole <hi>British</hi> Empire. Not that in it self it is of such intrinsick Value; for that the Cold is so great, and the Ice so rigid, as to imbargo it more than half the Year: But as the ingenious Mr. <hi>Dummer</hi> observes in a Letter of his to a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord</hi> in the Year 1712, the Consequence would be very valuable; for as it extends above
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002796_0039_0FE63B1745623838"/>
one thousand Leagues towards the <hi>Messisippi,</hi> it would require a vast consumption yearly of the <hi>English</hi> Manufactury to support it; there being so great a number of several Nations that live behind, which bring down vast quantities of Furs of all sorts, as amount to an incredible Sum. But her Majesty's Royal Aim, as he notes, was not so immediately to advance a Trade, as the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Peace of her good Subjects in <hi>North America</hi>; being thorowly apprized that so long as the <hi>French</hi> inhabit there, so long the <hi>English</hi> would be in hazard.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hudson's Bay</hi> Company, as well as <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland,</hi> have given a melancholly Account of the many Ravages that have been committed there by the powerful Assistance of those <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> I'm not insensible that many have blamed <hi>New-England,</hi> and cast the Odium wholly on them for not succeeding in this Enterprize; but why <hi>New-England</hi> should be branded with such Infamy, I never could yet hear the Grounds, or any Reason assigned, but what sprung from some capricious Brains, who were no well wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers either to the Cause or Country, and would stigmatize us if possibe, as Enemies to the <hi>Church,</hi> and Disloyal to our <hi>Sovereign.</hi> But why Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Church?</hi> or wherein is it that we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them? save only in the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which none of them will allow to be Essential. We indeed are called <hi>Dissenters</hi>; but many of those that are of the <hi>Church,</hi> dissent more from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother than we do: For what we dissent from, is, (as they themselves term it) only in matters of Indifferency; but many of them are Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002796_0039_0FE63B1745623838"/>
from their own <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi> Is not our <hi>Doctrine</hi> the same? the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as strictly solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized? and our Mode of Worship as agreeable to the primitive Constitution, as any other Church in the World? Not but that we have degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the pious Steps of our Fore-fathers; yet I am bold to say, that as to number, there are as many sincere and good People in <hi>New-England,</hi> as in any one part of the World. But I beg pardon for this Digression, which is only to wipe off the Calumny that is too often cast upon us. Now as to our <hi>Loyalty,</hi> such pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may be given thereof, as will be surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to Posterity.

               </gap>e assembled, to know the Result of matters: It being a Custom among them on all such Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, to have the whole of their Tribes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:002796_0045_0FE63B286E201B00"/>
having no other Record of conveying to Posterity, but what they communicate from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son, and so to the Son's Son. When the several Articles were read and explained, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters upon Oath, (the Delegates being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) they signified an unanimous Consent and Satisfaction, by loud Huzza's and Acclamations of Joy: Many Presents were then made them, which were thankfully received, and every Tribe had their proportion given out; but they were so disorderly, that <hi>Mauxis</hi> (altho' he was the chief <hi>Sagamore</hi> in all the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts) was rob'd by the Morning of all he had; upon which he made a miserable Complaint unto the <hi>English</hi> next Day, of the unruliness of his young Men, who had stollen away all he had, therefore beg'd a new Supply. But altho' their Government is so <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical,</hi> and their Chiefs have so little Respect and Honour shewn them, yet in their Council they observe a very excellent Decorum; not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any to speak but one at a time; which is deliver'd with such a remarkable Pathos, and surprizing Gravity, that there is neither Smile nor Whisper to be observed, until he that speaks has finish'd his Discourse, who then sits down, and after that another riseth up.</p>
            <p>The Peace thus concluded and so firmly ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave matter of Encouragment to the <hi>Eastern</hi> Inhabitants for re-settling their former Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; who were also countenanced and assisted by the Government, even from <hi>Cape-Porpas</hi> to <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>In this brave attempt of Capt. <hi>Harmon,</hi> which was effected in ten minutes, we lost not one Man, yet at the same time a great Body of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> lay near, who being startled at the Noise that was made, arose and fired several Guns, but did no Damage.</p>

            <p>The number of Vessels were about sixteen which the Enemy took at <hi>Canso,</hi> as they went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Harbours for their Necessity; which so soon as Governour <hi>Philipps</hi> was apprised of, he summoned the several Masters ashore with the Sailors, and proposed the fitting out of two Sloops well Man'd for recov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However they resisted so well as they could for about half an hour, in which time Capt. <hi>Eliot</hi> received three Wounds, when Mr. <hi>Broadstreet,</hi> who commanded the Soldiers, entred

with Hand-<hi>Granado</hi>'s, most of the <hi>Indians</hi> jumpt over-board, who were shot in the Water. Those that ran down in the hold, were tore in pieces by the Shells, so that only five escaped, who were wounded. One of our Men was kill'd, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urt, particularly the Corporal of the Troops, who had five Swan-shot in his Body. Capt. <hi>Eliot</hi> being ill of his Wounds, was oblig'd to return, carrying with him seven Vessels into <hi>Canso,</hi> which he retook with fifteen Captives, six hundred Quintals of Fish, and two heads of the Chiefs of those <hi>Indians</hi> that were among them. Upon this the Governour ordered the same Sloop back with a fresh supply of Men to reinforce Capt. <hi>Robinson,</hi> who in a Week after brought in two <hi>Indian</hi> Scalps, a Scooner and a Sloop which they took at <hi>Mallegash.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that he met with a <hi>French</hi> Man and an <hi>English</hi> Captive, who informed of a Body of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and five Vessels that lay at a little distance, which he immediately went in pursuit of; but fearing the event, was not willing at first to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them, but kept at some distance, and then three Canoos with three <hi>Indians</hi> in each double arm'd drew near, one of which came on board, as the rest lay on their Paddles, whom they treated friendly in expectation of a greater Prize. But the <hi>Indian</hi> growing jealous attempted to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and presented his Gun to Lieut. <hi>Iephson</hi>'s breast, which he putting by, shot him dead. Upon this they fir'd upon those in the Canoos, and kill'd three. The Enemy was so numerous ashore, that he thought it not safe to encounter them; however he took one Vessel. At this

time they had twenty of our <hi>English</hi> Captives, but could not come to a fair Capitulation about their Redemption. However the Captain warn'd them to use them well, for as we had thirty of theirs at <hi>Annapolis,</hi> twenty at <hi>Boston,</hi> and as many more at <hi>Canso,</hi> as they treated ours, so we would theirs. Mr. <hi>Broadstreet</hi> now steer'd to the <hi>Westward</hi> of the Harbour where Capt. <hi>Eliot</hi> had the dispute before mentioned, where he retook three Vessels more, but could see neither Captive nor <hi>Indians.</hi> The Day after Capt. <hi>Blin</hi> very happily arrived with a Flag of Truce, and redeem'd seven Vessels and twenty four Captives, who otherwise would have been put to Death. From thence he sail'd to the <hi>Cape,</hi> and in his returning back, took three or four <hi>Indians,</hi> which he carried to <hi>Boston.</hi> Capt. <hi>Southack</hi> being inform'd of a small Body that was then at <hi>Astagenash</hi> in the Gulph of St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>Golden</hi> the famous <hi>Fryar</hi> did reside, had an intent to visit him; but in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage thro' the Gutt was happily diverted, where meeting with two Canoos, in which were six <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> he kill'd one, and took the other five.</p>
            <p>The <hi>General Assembly</hi> not finding the former Bounty sufficiently encouraging to Volunteers, now pass'd an Act of <hi>one hundred pounds</hi> a Scalp to all such as supported themselves, and whoever was subsisted by the Publick, should have <hi>sixty pounds</hi> for the like: That any Company or Troop issuing forth upon an Alarm, should over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Establishment have <hi>thirty pounds,</hi> and an encouraging Reward besides, for all Prisoners that they took; and whatever Plunder might be taken should be shared among them: And if any Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers

Their first appearance seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed terrible, considering their Number, with the fewness of those that were to defend; who fought the Garrison some time, and shot <hi>Samuel Brooking</hi> thro' a Port-hole, after that they had kill'd fifty head of Cattle, and burnt twenty six dwelling Houses. The same Day in the Evening came Col. <hi>Walton</hi> and Capt. <hi>Harmon,</hi> with about thirty Men in two Whale-boats, who with those of Capt. <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Penhallow</hi>'s Men, (that could be spared out of the Garrisons) made about <hi>seventy,</hi> and gave them Battle some time: But the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were so numerous, that they were like to have hem'd them in, had they not fought upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>

At his first firing he kill'd <hi>seven,</hi> after that <hi>two</hi> more, and wounded another, which was their whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Who being within a Day and halfs march of our Frontiers, would probably have done Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, had they not been so seasonably prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Their Arms were so new and good, that most of them were sold for <hi>seven pounds</hi> apiece, and each of tham had two Blankets, with a great many spare <hi>Moggasons,</hi> which were supposed for the supplying of Captives that they expected to have taken. The Plunder was but a few Skins; but during the March our Men were well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with <hi>Moose, Bear,</hi> and <hi>Deer</hi>; together with <hi>Salmon Trout,</hi> some of which were three foot long, and weighed <hi>twelve pounds</hi> apiece.</p>

               <hi>April</hi> 13th. 1725. there came two <hi>Indians</hi> to <hi>Macquoit,</hi> and took one <hi>Cockram,</hi> a Soldier of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen years of Age, whom they carried thirty Miles into the Woods. The first night they pinioned him, but left him loose the second. He took an opportunity (as they were asleep,) to knock them both on the head, Scalpt 'em and brought their Scalps away with him, and their Guns. But in his return he was so unhappy as to loose a Gun, and one of the Scalps, in fording over a River.· When he came to the Garrison and gave an account of the whole affair, there went out a Party the next Morning and found the <hi>Indians</hi> both dead according to the information that he had given. He was not only rewarded according to the <hi>Act,</hi> but was advanced in his Post, for his brave Action, and for the encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Monday</hi> after came another Party to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> where they slew <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mathew Scales,</hi> which was a great weakning to that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, being very active and industrious Men, and the principal supporters thereof.</p>
            <p>After this they went to <hi>Cape-Porpos</hi> and way-laid Lieut. <hi>Trescott</hi> with some others, as they were passing along the Road, whom they fired on, and wounded the said <hi>Trescott</hi> in several place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A Vessel from <hi>Canso</hi> about this time arriving, brought an account of seventy <hi>Indians</hi> that fell on an Out-house in view of the Garrison, where they kill'd seven Men, one Woman and a Child, and from thence went to Capt. <hi>Durell</hi>'s Island, where they beset a fortified House in which were only four, who engag'd them several Hours; one

of which was in a little time shot thro' a loop-hole, but the remaining three held out and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselves with such bravery, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was obliged to draw off with considerable loss.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Lovewell</hi> being still animated with an uncommon zeal of doing what Service he could, made another attempt on <hi>Pigw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o in case of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as also for the relief of any that might be sick or wounded; and having one of his Men at this time sick, he left the <hi>Doctor</hi> with eight Men more to guard him: With the rest of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he proceeded in quest of the Enemy, who on <hi>May</hi> the 8th about 10 in the Morning, forty miles from said Fort, near <hi>Saco</hi> Pond, he saw an <hi>Indian</hi> on a point of Land: Upon which they immediately put off their Blankets and Snapsacks, and made towards him; concluding that the Enemy were a head and not in the rear. Yet they were not without some Apprehensions of their being discovered two days before, and that the appearing of one <hi>Indian</hi> in so bold a manner, was on purpose to ensnare them. Wherefore the Captain calling his Men together, proposed whether it was best to engage them or not; who boldly reply'd, <hi>That as they came out on purpose to meet the Enemy, they would rather trust Providence with their Lives and die for their Country, than return without seeing them.</hi> Upon this they proceeded and mortally wounded the <hi>Indian,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing returned the Fire, and wounded Capt. <hi>Lovewell</hi> in the Belly: Upon which Mr. <hi>Wyman</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:002796_0061_0FE63BB2777CC5E0"/>
fired and kill'd him. But their dismantling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at this juncture proved an unhappy snare; for the Enemy taking their Baggage, knew their strength by the number of their Packs, where they lay in ambush till they returned, and made the first shot; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Engagement continued ten hours, but altho' the shouts of the Enemy were at first loud and terrible, yet after some time they became sensibly low and weak, and their appearance to lessen: Now whether it was thro' want of Ammunition, or on the account of those that were slain and wounded, that the Enemy retreated; certain it is they first dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hem in their return. Their number was uncertain, but by the advice which we afterwards received, they were <hi>seventy</hi> in the whole, whereof <hi>forty</hi> were said to be kill'd upon the spot, <hi>eighteen</hi> more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Wounds, and that twelve only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. An unhappy instance at this time fell out respecting one of our Men, who when the Fight began was so dreadfully terrified, that he ran away unto the Fort, telling those who were

there, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pt. <hi>Lovewell</hi> was kill'd with most of his Men; which put them into so great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, that they all drew off, leaving a bag of Bread and Pork behind, in case any of their Company might return and be in distress.</p>
            <p>The whole that we lost in the Engagement were <hi>fifteen,</hi> besides those that were wounded. <hi>Eleazer Davis</hi> of <hi>Concord</hi> was the last that got in, who first came to <hi>Berwick</hi> and then to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> where he was carefully provided for, and had a skilful Surgeon to attend him. The Report he gave me was, That after Capt. <hi>Lovewell</hi> was kill'd, and Lieut. <hi>Farewell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> wounded, that Ensign <hi>Wyman</hi> took upon him the command of the shattered Company, who behaved himself with great Prudence and Courage, by animating the Men and telling them, <hi>That the Day would yet be their own, if their Spirits did not flag</hi>; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven'd them anew, and caused them to fire so briskly, that several discharged between twenty and thirty times apiece. He further added, that Lieut. <hi>Farewell,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Fry</hi> their Chaplain, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah Iones,</hi> and himself, who were all wounded, march'd towards the Fort; but <hi>Iones</hi> steer'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and after a long fategue and hardship got safe into <hi>Saco.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fry</hi> three days after, thro' the extremity of his Wounds, began to faint and languish, and died. He was a very worthy and promising young Gentleman, the bud of whose Youth was but just opening into a Flower.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iacob Fullam,</hi> who was an Officer and an only Son, distinguish'd himself with much brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. One of the first that was kill'd was by his hand; and when ready to encounter a second,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:002796_0062_0FE63BB279FDD728"/>
it's said, that he and his Adversary fell at the very instant by each others Shot· Mr· <hi>Farewell</hi> held out in his return till the eleventh day; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time he had nothing to eat but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a few Roots which he chewed; and by this time the Wounds thro' his Body were so mortified, that the Worms made a thorow Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. The same day this <hi>Davis</hi> caught a Fish which he broil'd, and was greatly refresh'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but the Lieut. was so much spent, that he could not taste a bit. <hi>Davis</hi> being now alone in a melancholy desolate state, still made toward the Fort, and next day came to it, where he found some Pork and Bread, by which he was enabled to return as before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>Just as I had finished this Account, I saw the <hi>Historical Memoirs</hi> of the ingenious Mr. <hi>Symmes,</hi> wherein I find two things remarkable, which I had no account of before: One was of Lieut. <hi>Robins,</hi> who being sensible of his dying state, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired one of the Company to charge his Gun and leave it with him, being perswaded that the <hi>Indians</hi> by the Morning would come and scalp him, but was desirous of killing one more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died. The other was of <hi>Solomon Kies</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who being wounded in three places, lost so much Blood as disabled him to stand any longer; but in the heat of the Battle, calling to Mr. <hi>Wyman</hi> said, he was a dead Man; however said that if it was possible he would endeavour to creep into some obscure hole, rather than be insulted by these bloody <hi>Indians</hi>: But by a strange Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as he was creeping away, he saw a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo in the Pond, which he roll'd himself into,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:002796_0063_0FE5F581811920C0"/>
and by a favourable Wind (without any assistance of his own) was driven so many miles on, that he got safe unto the Fort.</p>
            <p>In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.11, 12, 13. it is recorded to the immortal Honour of the Men of <hi>Iabesh Gilead,</hi> that when some of their renowned <hi>Heroes</hi> fell by the hand of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> that they prepared a decent Burial for their Bodies.</p>
            <p>Now so soon as the Report came of Capt. <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vewell</hi>'s defeat, about fifty Men from <hi>New-hampshire</hi> well equipt, marched unto <hi>Pigwackett</hi> for the like end, but were not so happy as to find them: But Col. <hi>Tyng</hi> from <hi>Dunstable,</hi> with Capt. <hi>White</hi> who went afterwards, buried twelve; where at a little distance they found three <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> among whom was <hi>Paugus,</hi> a vile and bloody Wretch. Now the reason why no more of the Enemy could be found, was because it's customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among them to conceal their dead, and bury them in some places of obscurity.</p>
            <p>Give me leave here again to relate (as I did before respecting Col. <hi>Hilton</hi>) that six or eight Days before Capt. <hi>Lovewell</hi> was defeated, we had a current Report several miles round of his being so, with little or no variation both as to Time and Circumstances.</p>
            <p>Our encountering the Enemy at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance was so terrible and surprizing, that they never found any body after. And tho' our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this War can bear no comparison with those of our <hi>British</hi> Forces, (which have caused the World to wonder) yet not to mention the bravery of these Worthies, who died in the Bed of Honour, and for the interest of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:002796_0063_0FE5F581811920C0"/>
would be a denying them the Honour that is due unto their Memory, and a burying them in Oblivion.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Wyman,</hi> who distinguish'd himself in such a signal manner, was at his return presented with a Silver hilted Sword and a <hi>Captains</hi> Commission. <hi>Edward Lingfield</hi> was also made an Ensign, and the <hi>General Assembly</hi> (to shew a grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to the Soldiers, and a compassionate Sympathy unto the Widows and Orphans,) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Sum of <hi>fifteen hundred pounds</hi> to be given them, under a certain regulation. And for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouragment of <hi>Volunteers,</hi> ordered <hi>four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> a day out of the Publick to be paid every one that would enlist, besides the bounty of <hi>one hundred pounds a Scalp.</hi> Upon which a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave Men under the Command of Capt. <hi>White,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wyman,</hi> and others went out, but the Extremity of the Heat prevented their Marching far.

they were under made their lives miserable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After this they went out again, and meeting with several others, they represented their ready desires of having a Treaty of <hi>Pacification</hi> with the <hi>English.</hi> Upon which Col. <hi>Walton,</hi> from <hi>New-Hampshire,</hi> Col. <hi>Stoddard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wainwright,</hi> from the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachusets,</hi> were appointed Commissioners to go unto <hi>St. Georges</hi> to hear and report what they had to offer. They arrived there <hi>Iuly</hi> the second, and sent the said two <hi>Indians</hi> with a Letter unto their Chiefs, letting them know that they were come; who in six days after appeared under a Flag of Truce.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Bean</hi> the Interpreter was sent to meet them.

And indeed they had Cause of being so, for that about ten days before under a Flag of Truce, some of the <hi>English</hi> Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously attempted to lay violent Hands upon them, but lost one in the Skirmish, and had another wounded, which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Morrow; who after a friendly Entertainment were dismist. The next day their whole Body came within a quarter of a Mile of the Garrison desiring the <hi>English</hi> to come to them; which they refused, saving, that they were sent from the several <hi>Governments</hi> to hear what they had to offer; but assured them that if they came to them no injury should be offered. After a short con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation they comply'd, provided that the <hi>English</hi> would engage it <hi>in the Name of God.</hi> And then the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> sent in thirteen of their <hi>Chiefs,</hi> expecting the like number of <hi>English</hi> to be sent them. So soon as they met, the Commissioners demanded what they had to offer, who complimented them with the great satisfaction they had in seeing them in so peaceable a disposition, and that it was also the intent and desire of their hearts. It was then ask'd wherefore they made War upon the <hi>English</hi>? Who replied, because of their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon their Lands so far <hi>Westward</hi> as <hi>Cape-Nawagen,</hi> where two of their Men as they said were beaten to Death. Unto which 'twas an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That that very Land was bought by the <hi>English,</hi> and that the Deeds from their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours were ready to be shewn; And admitting it was true what they said, that the <hi>English</hi> did so inhumanly beat two of their <hi>Indians,</hi> yet it was not justifiable in them (according to the Articles of Peace) to commence a War at once, without first making Application to the <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Conference being over, they propos'd a further <hi>Treaty</hi>; which after some debate was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be at <hi>Boston.</hi> They then moved for a
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:002796_0065_0FE63BC6759D6338"/>
               <hi>Cessation of Arms,</hi> but our Commissioners, having no power, replied, that if they went to <hi>Boston</hi> it might probably be granted. But in the mean time moved that each Party should be on their Guard, for that it was the Custom of Nations to carry on the War on both sides till matters were fully concluded. The <hi>Indians</hi> reply'd that as they desired Peace, they were resolved on calling in their young Men, promising for themselves and those also of their <hi>Tribe,</hi> that no Hostility should be formed against us.</p>
            <p>The Treaty being over, Capt <hi>Loran</hi> and <hi>Ahan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,</hi> who were two of their Chiefs, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Gentlemen to <hi>Boston,</hi> where they were friendly Entertained, and after a Capitulation of matters, return'd in a Vessel prepared on purpose, with a promise of bringing more of their Chiefs with them in forty days after their arrival, for a final Issue of all differences.</p>
            <p>Several Constructions and Censures were pass'd on this <hi>Treaty</hi>; some thinking the <hi>English</hi> were more forward for a Peace than the <hi>Indians,</hi> and that as we now knew their head quarters, might easily destroy their Corn, and disrest them in their Fishery, which would bring them to a ready composition. Altho' the <hi>Penobscot Indians</hi> seem'd <hi>Guarantee</hi> for the other Tribes, yet as we knew them Treacherous, we could put no confidence in them, but rather lay our selves open unto a Snare, and become the more secure! Something like this accordingly fell out; for on <hi>September</hi> 15th a Party of them fell on some of <hi>Cochecha</hi> while at work in the Field, where they slew one, Scalpt another, cut off the Head of a third, and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:002796_0065_0FE63BC6759D6338"/>
carried a fourth Captive; all which belong'd to the Family of the <hi>Evans's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few days after another Party attack'd a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison at <hi>North Yarmouth,</hi> but were so stoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed that they made no impression; but at their drawing off, kill'd several Cattel. Two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some appear'd at <hi>Mowsum</hi> and then at <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> Cove, which lies <hi>Eastward</hi> of <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> and is two Leagues within the line agreed upon; where they took and burnt two Shallops which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Stephen Hunuel,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Soaper,</hi> whom with five Men and a Boy, they carried to the <hi>Winniganse,</hi> and knockt him on the head. Some conjectured these <hi>Indians</hi> came from <hi>Canada,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they belong'd to the <hi>Eastward,</hi> for that an <hi>English Iacket</hi> was afterwards seen on one of them; but the <hi>Eastern Indians</hi> laid it on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>At the same time the <hi>English</hi> had several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies out, as at <hi>Amarascoggin, Rockamagug, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridgwalk,</hi> &amp;c. Where Col. <hi>Harmon</hi> and others went, but made no discovery. Some thought that <hi>We</hi> hereby infring'd on the Articles made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween rhem and us, unto which it may be repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that these places were not within the <hi>Penob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot</hi> Line; and altho' they promis'd to do what they could in restraining others from falling on the <hi>English,</hi> yet as several Scouts from other Places were then out, they could not absolutely engage for them; Wherefore it was now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for us to secure our Frontiers.</p>

            <p>Thus we have seen the Events of <hi>twenty three</hi> Years, in most of which we have heard nothing but the <hi>sound of the Trumpet, and the alarm of War.</hi> And in the time of the intervening Peace, we met with many Interruptions and Acts of Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which prevented the growth of our <hi>Eastern</hi> Settlements.</p>
            <p>It's surprizing to think that so small a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Indians</hi> should be able to distress a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

so large and populous, to the degree we have related. The <hi>Charge</hi> of the War in the last three Years was no less than <hi>One hundred and seventy thousand pounds</hi>; besides the constant Charge of watching, warding, scouting, making and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of Garrisons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may modestly be computed at upwards of <hi>seventy thousand pounds</hi> more. Yet after all, the Enemy have but little cause of Triumph; for that one third of them (at least) have been destroy'd, and one of their Tribes so shattered (at <hi>Naridgwalk</hi>) that they are never more like to make any formidable head.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Peace</hi> seems once more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the <hi>Treaty</hi> beforementioned, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Difficulty will be to support and maintain it. If <hi>Trading Houses,</hi> which are now resolved on, (by the Wisdom of the Gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But altho' it was agreed on with the several <hi>Delegates</hi> that the <hi>Treaty</hi> should be ratified and confirmed in a publick and solemn manner by the <hi>Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
