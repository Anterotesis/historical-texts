            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Very well; it is prudently done! When I was married, my late husband and I were very poor, indeed; and when my Robert, your husband, was born I put myself to many, many, little inconveniencies, that my child might want nothing. Now, it is your turn to make these sacrifices. When children are small, the mother should forego many of her wishes, to provide for their wants.</p>

My late husband, poor man, at first, had no property, nor had I; but we were very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. My son is a rich man, through our industry: for God's sake! let him chuse as his heart directs! if the young woman is poor, she will be grateful, and the more readily nurse me when I am old.

That is no reply. Such sores heal easily.

                     <p>Sir, for the last three days have I run about with the perseverance of the ant, in quest of some person who would give me bread for work. Sir, you are a Jew; to you I will confess it—to a Christian I would not. For these two days not a morsel have I tasted—

No, no!— that must not be.</p>

                     <p>God! If it was thy will that I should be poor— why didst thou plant this pride in my bosom?—No, sir, charity I cannot accept: but procure me work, and I will thank you. Grant me some respite with regard to my debt;—and I, with my wife and child, will thank you.</p>

Do not dissemble,—Pray, don't:— I have long observed you.—There is, among us, a novice whom we dislike:—he who now holds the cards.—Your looks,—the air of bitter scorn, with which you more than once, viewed his blunders,—have convinced me, that I address myself to one who is master in our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

you can be silent! Brothers of a trade must not betray one another. But if you hesitate on another score; if you mistrust my character;—I would have you to know, Sir, that I am a man of known and undoubted honour. I am well received in all the first houses.

                     <p>The task is the easiest in the world. I am engaged in a law-suit: my opponent has produced three witnesses, who have sworn in his favour: I must bring six to outswear them.

                     <p>True—I am myself a member of the Society—I have known the joy of restoring a husband to his wife, a son to his mother. I may say, in truth, that I was ever one of the most active members. My associates eagerly flew to attempt the recovery of my son. No means was left untried. For hours I hung over his breathless body, pressed his palid lips with mine, and employed every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable art to rekindle the flame of life—in vain.—I kneeled till my knees were stiffened: till my voice was hoarse—I called on the God of mercy. God heard me not—No, he heard me not. I have lost my all. Nothing remains to me, but money, money, which I would give all away ten thousand times—to hear but once more the voice of my son, even as he called to me for the last time, "Father!"—from the stream—Go, sir, leave me, leave me alone! You have made me to open my lips to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain!—And I had resolved not to complain!—You have brought, burning tears into my eyes!— and I had determined not to weep. No, my grief shall suffocate me in silence. And should you still talk of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, after having thus seen the lacerated bleeding heart of a father, then, sir—then you are a common beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar!

<stage>(<hi>He walks about wildly</hi>)</stage>
Are there no other means? Cannot I take a brush, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent myself to clean people's shoes, as they pass? No honest shift that will supply bread to my family, can be disgraceful.
<stage>(Pauses)</stage>
Or, shall I follow the gambler, and make myself his accomplice in robbery? Would it be an unpardonable crime, to commit an act of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery—but <hi>for once</hi> in my life?—And this, to prevent all that is dear to me, from perishing for hunger?—No, Maxwell! think of the noble soul of thy wife! Do not wound her heart with worse than the pangs of death.
<stage>(<hi>Pauses again</hi>)</stage>
That gentleman was in the right: better, better far, to leave wife and child, than by my presence, to enhance their sufferings. Must <hi>they</hi> not live without <hi>me,</hi> because <hi>I</hi> cannot live without <hi>them?</hi> I will be gone: I will go to India. Fool! Will that give them bread? Oh! could I, but by any honest means, secure to them subsistence; I would set off for India, this moment. They might weep for my absence. But, if they had only bread to eat; what, though they should moisten it with their tears?
<stage>(<hi>Again a pause</hi>)</stage>
O God! thou who feedest the fowls of the air, who clothest the callow young in the nest!—pour but one ray of cheering light into my soul! Shew me only a protector for my wife!

the saviour of my wife. Stay! Let me accustom myself to thy view!
<stage>(pauses)</stage>
Well, and what matters it? Thou goest to India—art dead to Arabella—but, wilt live in her remembrance, while Harry lives—Thy blind and aged mother is provided for—Happy!
<stage>(<hi>deeply affected</hi>)</stage>
happy! Why not? Is she to be miserable, because I am so? Dost thou love her as dearly as she deserves?
<stage>(<hi>with mild dignity</hi>)</stage>
Well, then, true love is capable of sacrificing even itself.
<stage>(<hi>pauses</hi>)</stage>
No, it is not any malignant influence, imposing on my disordered fancy! This is the path which fate points out—the only one. No tenderness for my own feelings, shall draw me back.

Oh God! let me find him as I wish!—as I wish? No, as I am forced to wish!—</p>

                     <p>I shall not scruple to lay open my heart to you. It is not haughty disdain; it is self-torturing caprice— But my feelings are those of man; and I will not strive against them—Walwyn—of all human beings, you are the last, whose assistance I would accept.</p>

                     <p>Is it caprice? can a man of such feelings name it so; when my whole heart revolts with horror, against the idea of assistance from you? My Arabella loved you— To assist us, would give you a degree of merit, in the eyes of my wife, which I could not patiently think of. Could I look upon her without shame and anguish, while her conscious looks might seem to tell me—that we were supported by the bounty of him, who was once, my rival in her love? Could I bear to reflect—could I suffer her to reflect, while I eat each meal—"This morsel we owe to Walwyn: but for his charity, we might starve?"—No, no, generous man, I should thank you, and—hate you!</p>

                     <speaker>Max.</speaker>
                     <p>You would force upon me a present of a thousand pounds—Will you not, in mercy, utter a few syllables to relieve my despair? Pity these agonies, this almost alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of mind, under which you behold me!—</p>

                     <p>Though I am at a loss to conceive, how my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer can give you relief; yet your demand is so earnest and so singular, and my feelings are so pure and sanctified that I do not hesitate a moment to confess—I still love Arabella.</p>

                     <speaker>Max.</speaker>
                     <p>Is your love but a pensive remembrance?—Or is it lively as the cherished dream of yesterday? have the colours of the picture faded?—or are they still bright and vivid?</p>

                     <p>A man, who has for these eight years, studiously avoided all intercourse with you—a man who has relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iously respected the rights of the husband, and the virtue of the wife—may answer without hesitation;—I still love her, as on the first day I wished her mine! She was my all; she is so still; till death, she shall continue so!— I have now answered you, Maxwell. But, why would you urge the enquiry? Why strive to make old wounds bleed afresh, or inflict new ones?</p>

For these three days I have in vain sought to find the means of earning subsistence for my family. I must either see them starve —or must beg or steal for them. At last, however, I have found a man who will supply sustenance to myself, if I chuse to go to India.</p>

I have yet one hope left, I am not utterly bereft of every good. An hour may yet come, when happiness shall be mine.

She this morning laid her hand on mine—
<stage>(<hi>in a whisper</hi>)</stage>
—Look here, this is her blood!—Can you now conceive, what burns within me?—Arabella's blood is on my hand!—with her blood, she has supported my mother and my child. To her, I in return, sacrifice more than my life!—my love! What a wife I resign to you! I will go to her—see her for the last time—prepare her for your visit. Within an hour, I shall expect you, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well! my benefactor! an hour hence, you shall rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence me—as <hi>your</hi> benefactor!

But Arabella has breathed a divine spark that electerizes my whole body and soul.—Yes! my death will put all again into its due order.—She will weep—oh, she <hi>will</hi> weep! But time will combine her in happy union, with the object of her first love—an union that will dry up all her tears. And, when returning spring shall dress with flowers the turf that covers my poor remains, she will give her hand, over my grave, to the worthy Walwyn!—and now, Robert, thou hast well nigh drained the cup of sorrows—Wilt thou now shrink with loathing from the last dregs? Am I as one of those fools whom a satiety of sensual enjoyment drives, to rid themselves of an existence of which they are unworthy? as those ideots of superstition who cast themselves, to be crushed under the chariot wheels of their idol!—No! I die for my wife, for the beloved of my soul! I die for my mother! for my child!

                     <p>This testimony gives me pride. But I am conscious, that I have deserved it.
<stage>(With animation)</stage>
Yes, Arabella, I am yet entirely such as I was eight years since. Fortune has, indeed, made me rich; but my heart, my soul, are still the same.
<stage>(<hi>He perceives Arabella to be under embarrassment, and moderates his ardour</hi>)</stage>
Pardon, me for having hinted at what is no more to be mentioned. At sight of you, I felt as an old man might do, who meeting with an ancient friend, remembers his spring of life.—And I seemed to myself, for the moment, to grow young again. Ah, no wonder, that your dear image should to me dissolve into a dream, the realities of eight long years: and should, with the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of enchantment bring back the moment, when you last gave me your hand. Your cheeks were then, as now, pale; tears then flowed from your eyes as now.</p>

                     <p>Walwyn, I said,—I love you. Fate unites me to another. Were you capable of asking me to tear this bond asunder;—did but one look of your's, invite me to it:—I should lose my last consolation—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of loving and respecting you—On my hand you pronounced the vow of virtue.—</p>

                     <p>Holding your hand, I swore eternal fidelity to my husband. I, too, have kept my oath. I do not say I have found the task a hard one; No: I have found it easy; for, I possess a worthy man. For the first year, I might devote many a secret tear to the remembrance of the sweet dreams of younger years; yet these have been long assuaged by the new feelings of a mother's fondness.—Maxwell's wild fancy of this day, might perhaps have been to me less extravagant, <hi>before I was a mother.</hi> A childless pair might dare to part! But, now, Walwyn, now, no power on earth can break asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bonds of my duty,—No, not the power of love itself.</p>

                     <speaker>Wal.</speaker>
                     <p>I have not interrupted you: for, where I love, I delight to admire. The word escaped; but it came from the heart of a man who knows no wish of which
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037759_0051_100F03E79E1D51F0"/>
he can need to be ashamed. Arabella misunderstood me. I listened to your husband, merely to gain time, to sooth the fever of his soul, to save him from the wild phrenzy of despair. His sufferings have awakened within him, powers hitherto unknown to himself, of which the new-born consciousness is pleasing. <hi>To sacrifice himself for his wife</hi>—is the splendid idea, on which he, at present, delights to gaze till his mind's eye becomes blind to every ray of other hope.—It is for this, that his pride devises so many refined pretensions for refusing the assitance of a friend. These would he scarce resign for the sake of the salvation of his family and himself; for resigning these,—he would lose the idol of his fancy, created by love, nutured by want and despair, raised by disordered nerves to be the tyrant of his soul.—He must be gently and softly led back from the precipice to which he is hurried. As to the night-walker,—we must not call him by his name, but, in silence stretch out our arms, that if he fall, he may sink on the bosom of a friend!</p>

                     <p>Pshaw, pshaw!—such things one don't like to be paid for. Besides, I can't say, after all, that it was I who saved him. For when I had laid him on the bank, he was as dead as a herring. But, there is a society in London, do you see, who will not let a brave fellow drown himself, without a struggle to save him. Some of them were quite at hand. Great gentlemen! God knows who! They instantly seized the body, and continued rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing warming and blowing, till he opened his eyes.</p>

                     <p>To the house of a rich wine-merchant, three doors from this.—He was the busiest of them all.—He belongs also to the society.
<stage>(<hi>Walwyn exit in haste</hi>)</stage>
God's blessing on the worthy gentleman! When I perceived that life was again stirring in him, I had his house shewn me; for I am vastly fond of bringing good news.— That poor lady on the ground is his wife I dare say?</p>
