            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU have in theſe words ſome account of the heavy ſentence, and bitter ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Cain,</hi> after the commiſſion of a crime the moſt horrid upon reflection, and moſt ſhocking to human nature, the deſtruction of a fellow-creature—the image of God in one ſenſe—and, the wickedneſs of his diſpoſition excepted, in every other reſpect, the<note n="*" place="bottom">

WHAT adds ſomething to the terror na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conceived upon ſuch an occaſion, was the novelty of the offence, it being the firſt tranſgreſſion of the kind that we read of in hiſtory; and, therefore, not only more affecting to the murderer himſelf, but alſo to the beholders, who, from this firſt outrage upon humanity, muſt begin to look upon the world as a curſed habitation, having ſuch a ſpectacle before their eyes as man deſtroying man—creatures the firſt in dignity in the viſible creation, juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as it were, from the hands of their Creator, and yet the one defeating the purpoſe of the other's being, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in his brother, and that brother's poſterity, a then conſiderable part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race.</p>
            <p>WAS the firſt ſtate of nature then, a ſtate of war? And men in ſingle ſettlements, and occupations, neceſſarily in a ſtate of danger and enmity? Could religion do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prevent bloodſhed?—And was the only remedy to be found for theſe evils the friendly ſuccour of a community, and the additional power derived from aſſociation, and a common-wealth?</p>
            <p>THIS ſhould ſeem, by what is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, to have been the caſe; and that in thoſe very early times the inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012773_0005_0F8A9368DB95DFD8"/>
aſſiſted by the dawnings of reaſon, pointed out to men, that religion, unleſs it were genuine, could not of itſelf be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon as an inſtrument of peace and quietneſs: But that the chief, if not the only public ſecurity for their perſons, or property, was to be found in the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws of a good community, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing from this hiſtory, that religion might be productive of diviſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of diſorders. For by what we can gather from hence, it ſeems in one family to have been diſtinguiſhed into two kinds, namely the religion of thoſe, who called themſelves the ſons of God, and the religion of thoſe were ſtyled the ſons of men; of one of which ſects <hi>Abel</hi> was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been the head; and of the other <hi>Cain;</hi> and their opinions in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect moſt likely oppoſite: It being very evident from the relation of the fact, that it was ſome matter of religion, which had made the difference between the two brethern.</p>
            <p>THE neutrals therefore (for ſuch a party, there is reaſon from the context to believe there was) obſerving, that though religion, when true and genuine, may be a ſtrong and natural obligation upon the wiſe and good, who ſee it's foundations, yet as it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012773_0006_0F8A93698715E378"/>
may be ſometimes falſe in itſelf, and then attended with ſuperſtition, enthuſiaſm, and perſecution; at other times, though good in it's kind, yet aſſented to only in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and then deluſive and hypocritical, not operating to good works, in which reſpect we find, that the religion of <hi>Cain,</hi> notwithſtanding his ſacrifice, had been defective, they grew diffident of ſuch a precarious inſurance for common honeſty, chooſing rather to ſecure themſelves by uniting in ſociety, building cities, and eſtabliſhing rules, and ordinances for the defence of their perſons, and properties, and lodging a power in the hands of ſome public officers for upholding and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the laws, which were to protect them.</p>
            <p>FROM the regulations of ſome of theſe well ordered ſocieties, who by reaſon of the growing barbarity, and inſecurity of the times, might be very vigilant againſt a fugitive, <hi>Cain</hi> ſeems to have had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt apprehenſion of danger—<hi>I ſhall be a fugitive,</hi> ſays he <hi>and a vagabond in the earth, and it ſhall come to paſs that every one, that findeth me, ſhall ſlay me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS forlorn and reſtleſs condition of a fugitive, driven from place to place like a wild beaſt from the deſert, and conſtantly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012773_0007_0F8A936A0CF7EE58"/>
denied reception, is no more than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence of committing murder. The whole ſpecies are alarmed at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſuch a monſter, they ſhun him as a lion, that ſpares no man in his rage, arm themſelves againſt him as a public enemy, that can neither be truſted nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; and if they ſlay him, think that they are doing God ſervice, by removing the common diſturber of the peace of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>CAIN, therefore, to avoid the dangers, which ſurrounded him in the parts already inhabited, went and dwelt in the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> perhaps a deſert, ſo called from his wanderings, whoſe ſituation at this preſent time is hard to be exactly determined. All that we are told of it is, that it lay to the eaſt of Eden, and ſerved him for an hiding-place, till by time and recollection he could extricate himſelf from his preſent difficulties.</p>
            <p>IN order to which, he forms an alliance by marriage, and, as the only place of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, builds a city of his own, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his diſcendants into a community, after the example of the more regular part of the ſpecies, who, as they are deſcribed in this chapter to have already put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012773_0008_0F8A936AE0C02BA8"/>
into a poſture of defence, ſeem to have been before-hand with him in this invention.</p>
            <p>THUS much then being premiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the natural hiſtory of mankind from their very origin: I ſhall take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from a view of the polities of theſe early ages to prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> THAT (according to the laws of nature) the only cauſe or motive for form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſocieties was in order to procure, by mutual aſſiſtance, and friendſhip, a greater degree of comfort, ſecurity, and peace, than could be obtained in a ſolitary, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> THAT murderers being guilty of oppoſing and defeating theſe ends of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, declare themſelves <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to be public enemies; and conſequently, that <hi>every one, who findeth</hi> them has a <hi>right to ſlay them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> THAT a chief magiſtate, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, refuſing to execute that right for the ſubject, and oppoſing him at the ſame time in the uſe of it, doth thereby diſſolve the original compact of the ſtate; loſes all title to the obedience of his people; and leaves them, as once, again in a ſtate of nature, to take their own meaſures, and ſhift for themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:012773_0009_0F8A936B93E0FD40"/>
BUT firſt, I am to prove, that the only cauſe or motive for forming ſocieties, was in order to procure, by mutual aſſiſtance and friendſhip, a greater degree of comfort, ſecurity and peace, than could be obtained in a ſolitary diſunited ſtate.</p>
            <p>AND here, as almoſt all our appetites, purſuits, and faculties, ſpeak ſome depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on our fellow-creatures, or attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, it might be taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that man muſt want much of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral happineſs, which God intented for him, and his own being requires, when he is excluded from ſociety.</p>
            <p>'MORE things are neceſſary,' ſays an excellent Philoſopher, <q>to ſuſtain life, or at leaſt to make it in any degree pleaſant and deſirable, than any one man can make or provide for himſelf, merely from his own labour and ingenuity. Meat, drink, cloathing and houſe, and that frugal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture which is abſolutely requiſite, with a little neceſſary phyſick, ſuppoſe many arts and trades, many heads and many hands. If he could make a ſhift in time of health, to live as a wild man under the covering of trees and rocks, feeding upon ſuch fruits, herbs and roots, and other things, as the earth ſhould afford in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for his labour, or happen ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012773_0010_0F8A936C44DA89D8"/>
to preſent him; yet what could he do in ſickneſs and old age, when he would not be able to ſtir abroad, to collect the gifts of nature and enjoy her beneficence?</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS lonely and helpleſs condition, plainly ſhewing, that an union with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures is extremely neceſſary to the convenience and comfort of every human creature; I ſhall lay down two maxims, which may ſerve as principles to regulate that union, and render it ſubſervient to human happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE firſt is, that ſociety without benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence can never preſerve this union.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond, that ſociety without benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will make men more unhappy, than if they had never been at all united.</p>
            <p>THE firſt obſervation is true. For it is not the forming themſelves into a body, that can keep men united. A collected number may be called a community, and while they remain together, they have the appearance of ſuch: But if their be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an union of hearts and affections, they want the eſſence of ſociety. Like the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in a thread of ſand, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be together, they are really ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and but one remove from diſſolution.</p>
            <p>FOR men muſt come together either upon
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012773_0011_0F8A936D5262D150"/>
good deſigns to each other, or upon bad: The former not being here ſuppoſed, the latter muſt take their place; and as bad deſigns can have nothing for their object but hurt or deſtruction, with either of theſe ſociety cannot ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>FOR if the firſt formers of human ſociety when herded with ſavages, removed from amongſt them with a view to ſecurity and better treatment, and miſſed of their aim, finding no better accommodation than they left, does not the cauſe ſtill ſubſiſt, why they ſhould remove again? The ſame ſavage principles remaining, of unbounded ſelf-intereſt, and rapine, will produce the ſame ſavage actions; defeat the end of the new ſociety, and drive them for ever to other ſettlements, but never preſerve them in any.</p>
            <p>BECAUSE ſuch principles muſt occaſion continual ſtruggles and convulſions, and fill the world with acts of violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, the ſtrong ſtill oppreſſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the weak. The conſequence of which muſt be broils, and bloodſhed in particular rencounters; or a general civil war; or elſe a lingering declenſion of the ſtate, the weakeſt members decaying firſt.</p>
            <p>NOT that the diſeaſe will ſtop, with the loſs of theſe; the few, who ſurvived the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012773_0012_0F8A936DF591FD40"/>
pillage and deſtruction of their fellow-creatures, through dread and jealouſy of each other, muſt be forced to ſeparate, ſecuring themſelves, as they can, againſt the attacks of that uncharitable cruel tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which leſſened their number at the firſt.</p>
            <p>UPON this ſtate of miſery and confuſion which muſt neceſſarily enſue when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity is broken up, by the unnatural conduct of it's members in not purſuing the welfare of the whole, but their private animoſities, and private intereſts, I cannot but make my ſecond obſervation, in effect to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>II. THAT the unfortunate people, who were led to compoſe ſuch a ſociety, are made more unhappy by their conjunction, than if they had never been united.</p>
            <p>FOR the real end of ſociety being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual help and aſſiſtance, people who come into it, poſſeſſed with ſuch a fond and honeſt notion, are apt to require ſomething more to their ſubſiſtance, than a cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſkins, and the roots, and herbs, of an hermit: Being now conſorted, as they think, with reaſonable creatures, and not amongſt the beaſts of the field, they natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect more from them, than from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, and have made their happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, in great meaſure, as in ſocieties it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012773_0013_0F8A93731270E2E0"/>
neceſſarily muſt, upon the good offices they are to receive from others; but the want of charity, ſtops all interchange of kindneſs, and reduces them to a worſe ſtate than that of the hermit, who being bred to miſery, never expected any one's aſſiſtance, while theſe in a juſt hope of help from their fellow-creatures are lamentably loſt, like the Mariner, who periſhes in the ſight of ſhore, within the aſſiſtance of his friends.</p>
            <p>IT is this diſappointment of expected help that doubles the ſorrowful ſighing of the priſoners, that provokes afreſh the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's tears, and orphan's cries, that deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the groans of the miſerable, and adds a more piercing accent to all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
            <p>IN theſe, and ſuch like circumſtances, when people find all hopes of ſuccour from mankind eluded, and withal receive griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous injuries from others, which they could never have received from themſelves; it is no wonder that they grew weary of their own ſpecies, and prefer ſolitude to ſociety.</p>
            <p>IT is upon theſe occaſions that we read in hiſtory of the ſeparation of particular perſons, and ſometimes of the ſeceſſion of an whole multitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012773_0014_0F8A9373C5289650"/>
THUS, for inſtance, <hi>Timon,</hi> the honeſt <hi>Athenian,</hi> whoſe love of juſtice and plain dealing had led him into many a ſnare in his intercourſe with a corrupt, deceitful, rotten-hearted people, and whoſe reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that account acquired him the name of the man-hater, after he had been long credulous and benevolent to his own hurt, retired at length from the generation of vipers, and left them to ſting each other.</p>
            <p>AND thus, in the firſt period of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man common-wealth, the commons, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and wounded to the heart by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, came to a determination to break up the ſtate, and to leave the city; which revolution would certainly have taken place, had they not been ſoothed by the temper and ſagacity of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and lured by the promiſes of better uſage.</p>
            <p>SUCH paſſages as theſe are recorded in hiſtory, and where that has been ſilent, the dens and caves of the earth, the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of inhumanity in ſavage countries, are a teſtimony to the world, that people look upon a ſtate of ſolitude, however contrary to the proper ſtate of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be yet a better condition than they can expect to find in a bad ſociety.</p>
            <p>AND yet it has been obſerved before, from the ſituation and purſuits of men,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012773_0015_0F8A93749C73C870"/>
that he is a ſocial creature: Of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, without ſome union and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with his fellow-creatures, his life muſt be very deſtitute and very miſerable. The ſum of the matter then is this, that if you take away affection from mankind, let them live how they will, they muſt live in miſery.</p>
            <p>II. But what I have hitherto advanced is only a ſtep towards the proof of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition, touching the legality of killing murderers:</p>
            <p>FOR if ſociety cannot ſubſiſt without common friendſhip; how much leſs can it ſubſiſt, if it harbour in it common enemies?</p>
            <p>THE matters urged in proof of my firſt propoſition plainly ſhew, that the end and deſign of forming ſocieties, was for the ſake of procuring a greater degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſecurity, and peace:</p>
            <p>BUT murderers, being guilty of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and defeating all theſe ends, declare themſelves <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> or by the very deed, to be public enemies: Therefore, as every member of a community is intereſted in the public peace, his own being bound up, and included in that of the public, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that every member of a community has a right to ſlay a murderer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:012773_0016_0F8A937549FAC770"/>
AND that the ancient practice ſupported people in this right, may be plainly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the converſation of <hi>Cain,</hi> and GOD's reply to it, as a thing eſtabliſhed—'therefore,' ſays he, (i. e.) <q>becauſe the thing is ſo, as you repreſent it; that, by common cuſtom of the world, <hi>every one may kill you, that meets you,</hi> I will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my authority; and, by puniſhing you in my own way, that is, by ſetting as a mark, my curſe upon you, I will take the execution of vengeance upon myſelf.</q> The vengeance you ſee was due, and in the common courſe of things would certainly have been executed in the uſual manner, but for the interpoſition of divine authority.</p>
            <p>FOR by the law of nature, no human law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver or ruler can remit the earthly or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment due to murder, unleſs ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by an act of the whole community; or ſcreen an offender of that ſort, if any one individual demand his puniſhment, for the reaſons before produced. Becauſe a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer is a public enemy, that is, an enemy to every individual, as well as to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. To demonſtrate this more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly—It appears from what has been ſaid, that the end and deſign of ſociety is to procure to mankind, by mutual aſſiſtance and friendſhip, a greater degree of ſecurity,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012773_0017_0F8A937610143DD0"/>
peace and comfort, than in a ſolitary ſtate they could expect to poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>WHOSOEVER, therefore, by his actions ſhall declare himſelf an enemy to thoſe ends, doth at the ſame time declare himſelf a public enemy: For he is an enemy to the public tranquility.</p>
            <p>THIS character may be juſtly fixed upon a man, not only when he diſturbs a multitude at once; but even when he makes an attack upon a ſingle perſon; if that attack be ſuch as deprives a perſon of his being, or even of his well-being. For it makes ſociety no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a place of ſecurity; and therefore it puts every individual into the ſame ſtate of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; though real deſtruction may as yet have affected but few. In this general alarm, then, or appearance of danger, every man has a right to put himſelf into a ſtate of defence; and as his own ſecurity is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that of the public; to oppoſe and deſtroy that object, which puts his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the hazard by diſturbing the public peace.</p>
            <p>HE has a right therefore, to deſtroy a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derder for deſtroying the public ſecurity: Becauſe an attempt of that ſort in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own ſecurity, as a private man, the caſe is alarming to every individual, as well as of the body politic: And therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012773_0018_0F8A9376D220DE80"/>
the power of acting in conjunction with the community, as in other caſes, againſt a public enemy; he has a right in this caſe, to oppoſe the public enemy, as a ſingle man; which is a privilege, which he enjoys by the right of ſelf defence.</p>
            <p>To deny, that a man is poſſeſſed of ſuch a power as this, is only the doctrine of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and traitors, whoſe crime no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can equal, and who ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>IT is to aſſert, ſays an excellent writer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the religion of nature, contrary to truth, that a man either has not the faculties and powers, which he actually has, for his defence, or that the author of nature has given them to him in vain. For to what end does he poſſeſs them, if he may not uſe them? And how may he uſe them, if not to his own preſervation, when he is attacked, and abuſed, and perhaps in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being deſtroyed?</p>
            <p>IF a man has no right to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt inſults, pain, and death; it muſt be becauſe the aggreſſor has a right to aſſail him, and to uſurp a power over him, and what is his; but this pretenſion, where a man is not an offender, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the notion of property; every man has ſomething, which is truly his—
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012773_0019_0F8A937797E0E270"/>
His life and limbs for inſtance, and let us for the preſent only ſuppoſe, that there may be more. And as men in a ſtate of nature, are allowed by all Civilians to have been born equal, no man has a right to hurt another's property, or interrupt his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but if a man may not defend himſelf, it ſuppoſes that the other has that right, which includes a great abſurdity, namely, a licence to commence an injury, or begin a violence, which is in nature a more unreaſonable demand, than only a licence to repel it.</p>
            <p>FOR he who begins is the true cauſe of all that follows, and whatever falls upon him from the oppoſition made by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending party, is but the effect of his own act: Or the violence, of which he is the author, reflected back upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>AND with regard to ſociety, ſince he who begins to violate the happineſs of another does what is wrong; we may be ſure, that he who endeavours to obviate or put a ſtop to that violence, in that reſpect does what is right;—right, I ſay, with reſpect to the community.</p>
            <p>FOR with regard to himſelf, ſince every man is obliged to conſult his own happineſs, there can be no doubt but that he not only may, but even ought to defend it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012773_0020_0F8A937849DE7958"/>
OTHERWISE he will fail in his duty to himſelf, and deny that his happineſs is his happineſs, or which is the ſame thing, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer what ſhould be his happineſs, by the malice of others, to become his miſery.</p>
            <p>THIS right of ſelf-defence then may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be exerted upon the apprehenſion of danger, and therefore the appearance of danger will always give a man juſt cauſe to exert it.</p>
            <p>I AM not to ſtay, ſays an excellent Civilian, till a man ſhall actually begin to make an attack upon my perſon; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray my own ſafety ſo far, as to ſuffer him by my negligence to take ſuch advantages, as may effect my own ruin.</p>
            <p>WE do not know how ſoon, a perſon, who has done a thing once, may do it again, he has declared himſelf to be a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous creature, an enemy to man, by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a man. It is enough then that he awakens our ſuſpicions, in ſuch a manner, as to put us in fear of our lives. When this fear commences, the time of action commences againſt an adverſary. And therefore, when it is reported, that a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer infeſts ſociety, we may immediately proceed to act againſt him, if he come in our way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012773_0021_0F8A93798399D448"/>
BECAUSE his is a character, that always raiſes a ſuſpicion of our being hurt: We are by no means certain, but that he may immediately give freſh proofs of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed temper, by effecting our own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore, at the very moment, that theſe fears ariſe, and his approach to our perſons makes him dangerous, that very moment, as he has forfeited all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from civil ſociety, and is as little to be truſted, as a perſon poſſeſſed by canine madneſs—that very moment he may be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>AND whenever the laws of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular country are deficient in this reſpect and come not in to the aid of the law of nature, in matters of ſuch importance as the immediate danger of loſing a life, that country is not fit to be any longer our place of reſidence; ſince the laws are not able to protect the ſubject in the article of perſonal ſafety, and ſelf-defence, and, therefore, no longer worthy of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or regard.</p>
            <p>III. Having thus clearly demonſtrated from principles and maxims undeniably true, that every man has by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an unalienable right to ſlay a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, becauſe a murderer is a public ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, dangerous to the peace and ſafety of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012773_0022_0F8A9379FAA64840"/>
the community, and therefore to his own peace; my laſt obſervation touching the concurrence of the laws upon ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion will lead me to the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, which was to conſider more minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what aid an individual may expect from the public in ſupport of ſuch a right; where I believe it will appear;</p>
            <p>"THAT a Chief-magiſtrate or Governor refuſing to exerciſe that right, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and at the ſame time denying him the privilege of uſing it for himſelf, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſſolve the original compact of the ſtate; loſes all title to the obedience of his people; and leaves them, as once, again in a ſtate of nature, to take their own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to ſhift for themſelves."</p>
            <p>FOR though, upon entering into ſociety men may, for convenience, (and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we ſee is the end of coming into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety) lodge or depoſit this right in the hands of others, yet it is occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable, and only depoſited in truſt.</p>
            <p>"A man (ſays my Author) may part with ſome of his natural rights, and put himſelf under the government of laws, and of thoſe (people) who in their ſeveral ſtations are entruſted with the execution of them, in order to gain their protection, and the privileges of a regular ſociety:—But if the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012773_0023_0F8A937BDB15AB88"/>
queſtion be aſked—what natural rights a man may part with, or how far he may part with them? The general anſwer, I think, may be this: Some things are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to our being—(and therefore not to be parted with)—and ſome it is in our power to part with.—From ſuch as theſe then we may recede, as far as is conſiſtent with the end, for which we do it—and not further."—For inſtance, ſuppoſe our end be ſafety, we cannot then convey away the means of ſafety ſo far as to loſe that end. For this would be a contradiction.</p>
            <p>EVERY member of a community has a right to ſafety: He enters into ſociety, with the view to ſecure that right, and the ſtipulations and engagements on the part of the magiſtracy, to fulfil the laws and compacts of the country, are always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by the very nature of civil compacts, to be a ſecurity for the ſame.</p>
            <p>EVERY civil government, therefore, to a ſubject, who is not a criminal, is ſuppoſed to be an Aſylum, or place of ſafety: For otherwiſe it contradicts the very end and deſign of civil government. That is, it is a contradiction to itſelf.</p>
            <p>BUT no nation can be a place of ſafety, where the government avowedly harbours
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012773_0024_0F8A937C03384F70"/>
murderers; and in defiance of law and juſtice perſiſts in the act: Becauſe in this caſe they are perſiſting in that, which muſt deſtroy all ſafety. Since murder and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are directly oppoſites, the one implying the ſecurity of a man, the other his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and, therefore, they mutually expel each other.</p>
            <p>SUCH a government then acts contrary to the ends and purpoſes of ſociety: And, therefore, if ſuch a government cannot be altered or diſſolved it muſt deſtroy ſociety: To avoid which conſequence, ſociety has a right,—1<hi>ſt,</hi> to alter that government—and if that cannot be effected by fair means—then 2<hi>dly,</hi> to diſſolve it—and <hi>laſtly,</hi> if that be not in their power—the members have then a right to forſake ſuch a ſociety, and ſhift for themſelves.—</p>
            <p>OF theſe in their order—</p>
            <p>AND 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Upon ſuppoſition, that a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould act contrary to the ends and purpoſes of ſociety, as in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid caſe of murder, individuals have a right to alter that government.</p>
            <p>FOR they have been deceived in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the compact. They entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſociety in order to have their ſeveral properties aſcertained, and to be quiet in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012773_0025_0F8A937E0566BC78"/>
the poſſeſſion of them; eſpecially in the poſſeſſion of that, which is the greateſt of all, and the foundation of all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, the property which they have in their own lives.</p>
            <p>THEY may remonſtrate then againſt a deception of this high nature and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as a breach of contract, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an alteration in the meaſures of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>IF the parties, who form the government refuſe to comply with the demand, and perſiſt in the denial, they bring on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caſe; and by turning the power of the government againſt the individual, which ſhould have been for his protection, they give the individual a right to deſtroy that government.</p>
            <p>AND this upon the ſame principle of ſelf-defence, that authoriſes him to deſtroy a ſingle man.</p>
            <p>FOR if a man cannot part with his right of ſelf-defence againſt a ſingle murderer, he cannot (<hi>a fortiori</hi>) part with his right of ſelf-defence againſt a combination of murderers; but a government combining with murderers is a combination of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers; therefore a greater nuiſance, an object far more dangerous, as conſiſting of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012773_0026_0F8A937FDA34B5B0"/>
a greater number, and for that reaſon, it he can compaſs it, the more worthy to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>"THIS reaſon is deciſive, ſays profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor <hi>Barbeyrac,</hi> and ſufficient to refute the opinion of thoſe, who pretend, as does <hi>Grotius</hi> for one, (in his <hi>Jure Belli et Pacis</hi> Lib. II. Cap. 1 §. 9.) that the right of a juſt defence of one's-ſelf ceaſes, when the unjuſt aggreſſor is a prince, or ſome other perſon inveſted with authority in civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. So far from it, that the moment a magiſtrate, or a ſuperior, let him be what he will, carries himſelf maliciouſly, and from deliberate choice, to ſuch an exceſs of madneſs, he puts himſelf in a ſtate of war with thoſe, which he thus attacks: The bonds of ſubjection are broken, and the ſubject or inferior, who never pretended, and who never could engage to carry his obedience to this exceſſive length, re-enters from thenceforth into his natural rights, or the rights of a ſtate of nature."</p>
            <p>So that we ſee, when a man, who is in danger from a bad government, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alter it, nor diſſolve it, the defect of means to obtain one or the other of theſe ends, introduces the third and laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed caſe of neceſſity, and gives him a right, where a government acts contrary to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012773_0027_0F8A93809A26A808"/>
purpoſes and inſtitution of ſociety, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that government, and to ſhift for himſelf.</p>
            <p>FOR, where there is no protection, there is no obligation to ſtay: And, where there is danger, as there muſt be danger from a combination of murderers, there is great reaſon to depart. Self-preſervation, the primary law of nature, as well as the cement of ſociety, will, in this caſe, oblige him to abandon his preſent ſituation, and ſeek a place of refuge for himſelf.</p>
            <p>THIS matter is briefly ſtated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in this manner, in the religion of nature delineated, <hi>Sect.</hi> vii. propoſition ix.</p>
            <p>"IN reſpect of thoſe things, (ſays the Author) which the laws of the place take no cognizance of, or if they do take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of them, yet if the benefit of thoſe laws cannot be had, he who is a member of ſociety, in other reſpects retains his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty—and muſt endeavour to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth and his beſt prudence—For in the firſt caſe, where there is no cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance taken, there is nothing to limit him. And in the other, it is the ſame as nothing; ſince in effect there is no law, where no effect or benefit from it is to be had,"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:012773_0028_0F8A93814D2E8AD0"/>
How much greater then, will I add, muſt be his danger, and in proportion how much more precipitant his flight? If the magiſtrate ſhould not only neglect him in danger, but even become his purſuer, and appear as a murderer, at the head of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, directing them to do their office.</p>
            <p>IN this ſituation the perſon ſtopping or hindering his eſcape is guilty of the ſame wrong, as thoſe who perſue him to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and, therefore, may be treated in juſt the ſame manner. For he that would turn me back upon an adverſary, that purſues me with an armed force to deſtroy me, is acting the ſame part as that adverſary: And, therefore, for the ſame reaſon, may be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>UPON this principle is founded the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of ſudden emigrations from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered ſtate, which the government, when violence has been committed, have no right to withſtand, or withſtand at their own peril, it being an unjuſt detention. For, in circumſtances preſſing and dangerous, long and formal declarations may hazard the lives or defeat the deſign of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants. Beſides, the rulers of a ſtate have no right at that juncture to expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance. Where the compact is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the government is from that time
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012773_0029_0F8A938217C261D8"/>
nothing but mere tyranny: And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in ſuch a caſe the departure itſelf is a legal, though tacit renunciation of all connexion; as the arrival and ſettlement in a ſtrange land are preſumed to be a real, though tacit, ſubjection to another country.</p>
            <p>THIS is generally the expedient where the refugees are diſperſed, and in number not ſufficient to make a ſettlement of their own: But if they can collect themſelves and form themſelves into a colony, that colony has a right to depart. We have examples of this ſort in the ſeceſſions of the old Romans, which the ſenate did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to withſtand: But what is neareſt our purpoſes, our own anceſtors have left us a remarkable precedent upon a like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. In the time of <hi>Charles</hi> I. when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes ran high between the ſubject and the Prince, when the public money was ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and replaced by force when their liberties were gone, and their perſons viſibly in danger, when no one could ſpeak a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able word of the government but thoſe who ſhared, or expected to ſhare the plunder of the public, by being placemen and penſioners to the court: They preferred a wilderneſs to a country which was ſo ſoon to be the ſcene of diſtraction and bloodſhed, and ſought an aſylum in America. To their new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,

as a mark of their deſcent, and the beſt means of preſerving their memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and exiſtence as a people; they gave it their national name, and called it NEW-ENGLAND, ſince the name of the old was now to give way to that of Great-Britain, and be loſt in oblivion for ever. The bad government at home, alarmed by this revolt and foreſeeing their own decay in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the ſubjects, (<hi>The want of people is the deſtruction of the Prince. Proverbs</hi> xiv, 28.) prevailed upon the King to iſſue a a proclamation debarring them acceſs even to thoſe inhoſpitable deſerts. Eight <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, were detained by order of the council, in which were embarked Sir <hi>Arthur Hazelrig, John Hampden,</hi> and <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> who, contrary to the law of nature, as well as their own inclinations, were forced back again to a land divided and unſettled, to ſhare in the perils of a civil war, in the beginning of which the great Mr. <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> was ſlain, but <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſurvived to be afterwards of the number of thoſe, who took vengeance upon the perſon of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate King; for having ſuffered his ſervants, in this and other inſtances, to make ſo bad an uſe of his power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:012773_0031_0F8A93838FEF9ED0"/>
THESE are the ſubjects, which, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the increaſing danger of the times, as well as the original melancholy occaſion of theſe diſcourſes, the conſcientious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my duty would not permit me to paſs over in ſilence. I am required by the law of nature, and by the precepts of that religion, which is here by law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the obligations of civil ſociety, (and which come nearer to the heart of man) by the ſympathetic feelings of humanity, to cry aloud and ſpare not, till the arm of the deſtroyer ſhall be withheld.</p>
            <p>FOR, notwithſtanding the mighty offence, which ſome people affected to take at the doctrine of my firſt ſermon, tending to ſhew the ſupreme and indiſpenſable authority of the laws of God, and the impiety and fatal conſequences of ſcreening and abetting murder—the practice has been ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued—out of an high regard, no doubt, to the conſtitution and the ſupport of magiſtrates, who, when acting againſt law, ought not to be ſupported at all; and when acting according to law—muſt be very ſtrangely ſupported! By hiring ruffians to murder the people aſſembled to chooſe their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; yet even this, you are told, was to keep the peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:012773_0032_0F8A9384CB33B8B8"/>
BUT if their peace be death; you have the more reaſon, to be all alarmed upon the occaſion, and to find, or make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, ſome better proviſion for your defence, than the preſent cobwebs of your broken laws. Conſider, that murderers are public enemies, equally dangerous to the whole community, as ſudden and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious in their attacks as Lions and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers—that ſuch monſters combined are more to be dreaded than when alone—and then moſt dreadful when they receive authority, or indulgence from the ſervants of a ſtate.</p>
            <p>To be ſo ſurrounded is to be all your lifetime, through fear of death, in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bondage. Rouſe, therefore, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with your neighbours in ſeeking the means of your deliverance; and then beg the bleſſing of GOD upon the uſe of the means—that ſo the ſoul and infernal ſpirit of tyranny and bloodſhed, which hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned theſe diſorders, may be ſpeedily driven from this land, and flee before the preſence of the Lord of hoſts.</p>
