            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN theſe words is contained a Motive given unto Believers to run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the Race ſet before them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſore Trials they met with therein; as the loſs of their Goods, Shame, and the contradiction of Sinners. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 33, 34. The Motive is taken from this conſideration, that the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings they met with were ſmall, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe which other Chriſtians had endured, and which they ought willingly to undergo, if God ſhould call them thereto. In theſe words, (1.) Is implied, that in running the Race Chriſt hath ſet before us, we are to reſiſt and ſtrive againſt Sin. Here we may note.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

Some by Sin in our Text, underſtand <hi>Sinners,</hi> ſuch who diſcourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from Vertue, and encourage others into Vice. But this Term, Sin; which we are to reſiſt and ſtrive againſt as an Enemy to us, may comprehend <hi>the whole Kingdom of Sin and Satan;</hi> the Kingdom of Darkneſs, in all its <hi>parts, members, policies and ſtratagems, deſigns and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. By Sin in this Text, I incline to think, that we ought chiefly to underſtand, that which is the <hi>Prevailing Sin</hi> of the <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> in which each Believer doth live: For it is a non-compliance with, and an oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Prevailing Sins of the Time and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration wherein Believers have liv'd, that hath in all Ages occaſioned the greateſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings unto good men, in their Names, Eſtates or Lives: when Idolatry was the Sin which was moſt in faſhion in the world, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The <hi>reſiſting and ſtriving againſt</hi> this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy Sin, is expreſſed by ſuch words in the Original Tongue, as import a reſiſting of it with agony, putting forth all their force and ſtrength againſt it; and the making an <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> as well as a <hi>defenſive war</hi> againſt it.</p>

2. The words of our Text teach us this Leſſon, that Believers ſhould be encouraged to continue in the Exerciſe of patience under all the leſſer ſufferings they meet with, on account of their oppoſition to the prevailing ſins of the Age and Place wherein they live, from this conſideration, that God is as yet ſparing them from ſuch hot ſervice, which he hath in times paſt call'd ſome of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions unto, againſt this Enemy Sin, namely, to have their Blood ſhed, and to part with their very lives in this War againſt Sin.</p>

            <p>Believers ought to ſtrive againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Sins of the Times, both ſingly and joyntly, and in all Conditions, Stations and Capacities wherein they ſtand. Unto this Reſiſting of Sin, Believers are moved, and hold themſelves obliged by ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Sin is the Enemy of Mankind;</hi> their worſt Enemy, their common Enemy; and in ſome ſenſe their only Enemy. More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001348_0005_0FB2917DCD8457A8"/>
1. That <hi>each and every ſingle perſon</hi> hath no worſe Enemy then his own ſins; &amp; among all the ſins which he falls into, or is ſubject of, his worſt Enemy is that which is moſt properly his <hi>own Iniquity.</hi> The Enemy within the walls of our hearts, is more dangerous than the Enemy beſieging of us from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: Indeed we are by Nature unſenſible that we carry our worſt enemy in our own boſoms, and ſhall continue inſenſible hereof, until God by the power and efficacy of his Spirit do convince us thereof: We are naturally much concerned about, and afraid of our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed enemies without us; but ignorant of the danger we are in of the real enemy that lodgeth within us. The ſins prevailing in our hearts, as atheiſtical &amp; profane thoughts, pride, worldly-mindedneſs, hypocriſie, malice, and envy, and <hi>ſimilia,</hi> do us more hurt, and expoſe us to more danger then all the enemies real or ſuppoſed that are without us. The Temptations of Satan, and the ſnares of the World get victory over us, by reaſon of that enemy ſin dwelling in us, which takes part with thoſe enemies from without us. The folly bound up in a mans own heart doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to more danger, than all the policies of all other men can do, who ſet themſelves againſt him.</p>
            <p>Again; The ſins produced in perſons by the principle of Corruption dwelling in them, whether they be ſins of omiſſion or commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do hurt the Sinners themſelves more than they can hurt any one elſe beſides themſelves, and more than any one elſe can hurt them. It is true not only of the man who is given
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001348_0006_0FB2917EFB501118"/>
to exceſſive drinking, but of the Adulterer, Thief, diſhoneſt Gainer, the profane Swearer, Sabbath-breaker, and of him that omits the ſecret duties of Religion; ſuch a man is his own worſt enemy.</p>
            <p>Sin ſets God himſelf againſt a man; now it were better for any man to have all the world adverſaries to him, then that One Great and Glorious God who made him, and who can caſt both Body and Soul into Hell.</p>
            <p>Sin expoſes a man to the Curſes of the Law, to Death temporal, ſpiritual and eternal; and in ſhort, nothing could or would hurt any man, were it not for Sin in himſelf, and the guilt of ſin lying upon himſelf; a man ſhould have no other enemy to conflict with, were it not for Sin adhering to, and inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in which reſpect Sin may be called Mans <hi>only</hi> enemy; and it is alſo his <hi>conſtant</hi> enemy, which at no time doth him any good, but at all times is procuring miſchief &amp; miſery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>Therefore every man ought, and every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever doth, and will reſiſt and ſtrive againſt his own ſin, ſin in himſelf; againſt the whole body of ſin in himſelf, but chiefly againſt the leading, ruling, prevailing and moſt predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant ſin in himſelf; not only by exerciſing repentance and godly ſorrow for thoſe ſins that have prevailed in him, &amp; applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by faith to the Blood of Chriſt for pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy &amp; deliverance from the guilt of ſin; but by ſetting upon the work of Mortification of ſin dwelling in him with all his might; &amp; finding his own ſtrength (even that of grace received) to be of it ſelf too weak to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001348_0007_0FB2918077FB7390"/>
with and ſubdue this enemy in his heart; he doth therefore by earneſt prayer call in, &amp; by the due exerciſe of faith obtain the help of Heaven againſt the mighty ſins that riſe up againſt him.</p>
            <p>A true Believer doth alſo reſiſt and ſtrive againſt ſin in himſelf by maintaining a <hi>ſtrict watch</hi> over his heart, &amp; over his whole man, having learned not to truſt his own deceitful heart.</p>
            <p>He doth alſo daily renew the Combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin; confeſſing unto God the faults &amp; follies which he diſcerneth in himſelf, and the daily eruptions of ſin that dwelleth in him; complaining of himſelf unto God; <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death?</hi> and he maketh his complaint to the right object, the bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who came into this world to ſave his people from their ſins; unto him he is conſtantly crying, <hi>Jeſus, thou Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, have mercy on</hi> me, and deliver me from this my worſt Enemy, my ſinful ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Family Sins</hi> are the worſt enemies of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and do bring all thoſe calamities and diſtreſſes upon them which befal them. Sin deprives Families of that comfort, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining whereof, theſe firſt Societies that ever were erected in the world were appointed. All the Croſſes, Loſſes, Poverty, Sickneſſes, Deaths, Diſtractions and Diſorders that are in Families muſt be placed to the account of ſin. The reaſon why ſome Families flouriſh not in their Perſons, Eſtates, or Intereſts, is not chiefly becauſe their Neighbours do not love them, but becauſe Sin (like the worm at the

Where Family Prayer is neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and God is not owned, honoured, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in a Family, no wonder that Family falls under a blaſt. If men reſolve to be rich without aſking God leave, without begging of God that his preſence may be with them in their employments, and his bleſſing may be upon their lawful Endeavours, it is juſt with God that ſuch ſhould be diſappointed. If the Head of the Family make no conſcience daily &amp; duly to perform Family Prayer, he may thank his own ſinful omiſſion of Duty that his Inferiours prove unto him undutiful, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, unruly, and altogether diſcomforts to him. Why ſhould we expect that God ſhould I provide for our Families their daily Bread, if we refuſe to pay to God (our great Landlord) his daily Rent and Revenue due unto him from us, namely the morning and evening Sacrifice of Prayer and Praiſes? Can we expect our Inferiours ſhould ſhew unto us Reverence and Obedience, while we our ſelves are diſobedient to God, and undutiful to our Maker and Glorious Redeemer? How can we expect that the bleſſed God by his preventing goodneſs ſhould preſerve us and ours from ſickneſſes, dangers and deaths, and take a fatherly care of us from day to day, while we refuſe to acknowledge him to be our Father, and the Father of our Families, by honouring and obeying of him? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Sins prevailing in greater Societies of men, (as Towns, Churches, Provinces, Kingdoms and Empires) are the worſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of thoſe Societies or States. Whence

comes general <hi>Poverty,</hi> Scarcity, Deaths, unſeaſonable weather, Loſſes by Land &amp; Sea? Whence comes <hi>War</hi> with all the calamities that are the appendices of it? Whence comes Epidemical Diſeaſes and mortal Diſtempers? only from Sin. Sin provokes God, &amp; then he raiſes up the Heathen and other Adverſaries againſt us. Our <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> under the means of Grace provokes God to ſmite the Earth with barrenneſs, that it ſhall not yield its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe unto us. We <hi>fall ſhort</hi> of the duty that we owe unto God, therefore he cuts us ſhort of our outward comforts: We delay &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinate our repentance for Sin, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Chriſt offered to us in the Goſpel, therefore God delayes to hear our Prayers, &amp; to ſave us out of our diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>Sin is our <hi>Common</hi> Enemy; an Enemy to all our Communities and Societies; a <hi>publick and open</hi> Enemy to us, and an Enemy to the publick intereſts of a People, as well as to the intereſts of private men. Therefore we ought joyntly to reſiſt and ſtrive againſt Sin, by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting our forces and ſtrength againſt it; yea we ſhould lay by our ſmaller differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves, that with one conſent and one heart we may defend our ſelves againſt, and endeavour to ſubdue this common and implacable Enemy, which ſeeks the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of us all. The people of God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſtrive againſt ſin from a principle of <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> and from <hi>Love</hi> to the Publick; becauſe ſin reſiſts and oppoſes all their good &amp; comfort, and tends to their ruin, miſery and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>To ſuch an uniting of their forces againſt

ſin, their common Enemy, True Believers are further excited by conſidering,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Sin <hi>is Gods Enemy</hi> as well as theirs. Now all that have ſincerely given up their Souls to Chriſt, and expect Salvation by him, do take Chriſt's Friends to be their Friends, and Chriſt's Enemies to be their Enemies. A true Chriſtian is one that hath Eſpouſed the Intereſt of Chriſt to be his own Intereſt; yea, he prefers the Intereſts of Chriſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, before any other Intereſt that may be call'd his own: He hath ſworn allegiance to Chriſt, and engaged himſelf to be his true &amp; faithful Subject, and Liſted himſelf under Chriſt as his Captain General, to fight againſt all Chriſt's Enemies, &amp; to proſecute &amp; promote all the deſigns of Chriſt. Now the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſins of the Age and Place wherein he lives, are thoſe very Enemies of Chriſt which in a peculiar manner he accounts himſelf bound to reſiſt and ſtrive againſt; he that doth not moſt vigorouſly reſiſt thoſe ſins which are the prevailing ſins of the Time &amp; Generation wherein he lives, doth want one comfortable mark and character that might evidence the truth and ſincerity of Grace in him. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8.11. A Chriſtian dare do no other then reſiſt and ſtrive againſt ſin, both becauſe God (whom he ſerves) hath obliged and <hi>commanded him</hi> ſo to do; and becauſe he hath alſo deliberately and voluntarily <hi>bound and obliged</hi> himſelf by his Covenant with Chriſt to ſtrive againſt and reſiſt this grand Enemy of Chriſt. And all true Believers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one and the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> living and true God to be their God; the ſame bleſſed Lord Jeſus

Chreſt to be their 'aviour and Redeemer; therefore account themſelves bound, as they have opportunity in their ſeveral ſtations, to joyn their forces together againſt ſin, which is the great enemy of their common Lord &amp; Saviour; knowing that their Lord Jeſus Chriſt hates neutrality in this common cauſe, in this War we are to manage againſt Sin, the common Enemy of Chriſt himſelf as well as of our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They conſider, that <hi>the Sins of other men will hurt</hi> them, unleſs they do faithfully, as becomes them in their places, reſiſt and ſtrive againſt them. Believers ſee themſelves to be in danger of faring the worſe for the ſins of other men; they ſee that they are expoſed to ſuffer in thoſe common Calamities which the prevailing ſins of the times bring on the Publick; and Good men know that the leſs oppoſition they make to growing Vice and ſin, the greater ſhare they may expect in the publick Calamities, which the prevailing ſins of the Times bring down upon the World; and therefore Godly men can take no better courſe to ſecure themſelves againſt publick &amp; deſtroying Judgments, than conſtantly &amp; faithfully to reſiſt and ſtrive againſt thoſe prevailing ſins which procure the deſtroying Judgments. Thoſe who partake of other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="4">4. True Chriſtians are indued from Above with a Publick Spirit, which inclines them
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001348_0012_0FB2918EBB4E8690"/>
to reſiſt and ſtrive againſt that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the publick good, and brings publick Calamities on their People: They do not therefore content themſelves, to ſeek only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſaving of their own Souls; but do what in them lieth to weaken the Kingdom of Darkneſs, by <hi>Converting</hi> others from their Evil ways; labouring that all perſons, whom they are concerned with, and on whom they may have influence, <hi>be made ſenſible of the danger</hi> they are in of being drawn into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with, and conformiry unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Sins of the Times and Place wherein they live; giving them the <hi>beſt advice they can how to defend themſelves</hi> from that danger, by a right uſe of that Spiritual Armour which God hath provided for them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Believers are encouraged to reſiſt and ſtrive againſt Sin, eſpecially againſt the moſt publick and prevailing ſins, from this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that in ſo doing they approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto God, and do that which is <hi>well pleaſing in</hi> his fight, and ſhall be accepted of God, and graciouſly rewarded by the Lord for their fidelity in this their oppoſition unto ſin: Suppoſing that what they do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhould be ungrateful to carnal men, yet it ſuffices them to know, that every <hi>Tear</hi> they ſhed before God, becauſe Sin abounds in their times, is bottled up, as precious in Gods ſight; and every <hi>Prayer</hi> they put up to God, for the putting a ſtop to growing Vice, is entred in a Book of Remembrance before God; and <hi>every word they</hi> ſpeak for God and againſt Sin, either in a way of <hi>Lamentation</hi> and Complaint <hi>unto God,</hi> or to their <hi>Fellow

            <p>They conſider alſo, that unleſs they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves faithful Souldiers of Chriſt in this War againſt Sin, while they are in a militant ſtate here on Earth, they can't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be admitted to a triumphant eſtate of Glory in Heaven.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs that I ſhould further enlarge, concerning the Gronnds and Reaſons that oblige and excite true Believers to the Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Striving againſt Sin.</p>
            <p>But it is time to proceed to Conſider,</p>
            <p>Secondly, By what means or <hi>weapons</hi> do Good men reſiſt and ſtrive againſt the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prevailing ſins of the Generation &amp; Places wherein they live: Namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By their Good Works.</hi> By an Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation they bear a teſtimony againſt thoſe ſins which are contrary to Holineſs. A Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life doth practically reprove and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn vicious courſes. The Light of a ſober, righteous and religions Life diſcovers &amp; puts to ſhame the filthineſs and foulneſs of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, unrighteouſneſs &amp; impiety: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holy men will moſt carefully abſtain

From Vices that are moſt Predominant and ſpreading in their Age, ſeparating themſelves from Sins and Sinners, that they may have <hi>no fellowſhip with them in the unfruitful works of darkneſs,</hi> Eph. 5. 11. They chuſe rather to ſuffer Martyrdom, by loſing their eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong carnal men, than to partake with them in their immoral, diſhoneſt and profane pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ices; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſuffered Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his non-compliance with the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation laid before him by his Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By their Words.</hi> Chriſtians account it their duty to make an <hi>Open Profeſſion</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they have Eſpouſed Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that they have Liſted themſelves under Chriſt to be his Souldiers in this great and conſtant War which Chriſt hath with the whole Kingdom of Sin in the World.</p>
            <p>They eſteem their Tongues to be their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo far as they are improved in giving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary advice and reproofs with moſt pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical exhortations unto Sinners to reform their evil ways, and in warning them of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are in of eternal ruin, unleſs they ſave themſelves from the Degeneracies and Corruptions of the Times.</p>
            <p>Not only Miniſters in their Station are thus to do. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. But private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians alſo, if they cannot do it with like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet according to their abilities and opportunities in their more private Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are with zeal and gravity to argue and diſpute againſt ſin, and plead with Sinners to forſake their evil courſes; Thus did righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Lot; I pray you, brethren, do not ſo wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Gen. 19. 7. Yea, in ſome Caſes, it is a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001348_0015_0FB2919347C31F20"/>
duty incumbent on Chriſtians to inform and complain of ſuch who are habituated to any groſs Vice, that either by Church Cenſures, or by the penalty of the Law inflicted on them, their healing and reformation may be endeavoured, and the ſpreading of Vice may be prevented; which is of an infectious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious nature, unleſs curbed and reſtrained, and duly born witneſs againſt; therefore for the publick good it is needful that Paenal Laws be executed, that others <hi>may hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly,</hi> Deut. 13.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By their Tears.</hi> They mourn before God for thoſe ſins which prevail in their Land, which they ſee no way for the reformation of; all their endeavours for that end prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſucceſsful. <hi>Lots</hi> righteous ſoul was grieved every day to ſee the conſtancy, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and impudence of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> in ſinning againſt God. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>David</hi> ſhed even <hi>rivers of tears, becauſe men kept not Gods Law.</hi> Pſal. 119. 136.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By the Prayer of Faith, they wreſtle with God day and night, that the growing Vices of the Times may be reformed.</hi> This weapon of faith in Prayer they eſteem as moſt effectual for battering down the Kingdom of Sin &amp; Vice; it works wonders for the Emendation of the Time and Generation wherein they Live, &amp; procures ſucceſs to other means they make uſe of: Hereby they call in the help of God; and of Chriſt to aſſiſt and work in a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and extraordinary way of working for the ſuppreſſing of ſin; and obtain of God that the <hi>Means of Grace</hi> ſhall have more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy than uſually they have for the pulling
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001348_0016_0FB29197527C77B8"/>
down the ſtrong holds of ſin and Satan in the hearts of men; and that by the <hi>effectual and wonder-working Providence of God</hi> ſome that are Ring-leaders in ſin, and moſt inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in cauſing others to ſin, ſhall either be Converted, or be removed out of a Place, or out of the World; that ſo way may be made for the flouriſhing of Religion and Vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People; ſo that Incorrigible Sinners were in leſs danger by an Army of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men fighting againſt them, then by ten true ſincere Chriſtians praying againſt them: By faith in Prayer they obtain from their God, that Satan ſhall fall down from his throne with ſpeed, much ſooner than they expected, <hi>even like Lightning before them,</hi> Luk. 10. 18. and that the mountains of impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and obſtructions that ſtand in the way of thoſe <hi>Zorobabels,</hi> whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves for the building up of his Temple in the World, <hi>ſhall become a Plain,</hi> Zech. 4. 7. and that the Work of Chriſt ſhall flouriſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the midſt of oppoſitions. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 25.</p>
            <p>Alſo by the daily renewed exerciſe of faith in Prayer, Chriſt's Souldiers derive; from him new ſupply of <hi>Strength</hi> for their maintaining and holding out in this War againſt ſin. A true Chriſtian is ſenſible of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſufficiency, that he daily ſtands in need of new ſupplies of the Spirit to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with wiſdom, courage and grace; that he ſtands in need of new manifeſtations of the preſence of Chriſt with him every day, to uphold him, aſſiſt him, and ſucceed him in this War. He endeavours therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſtrive againſt ſin in Chriſt's ſtrength,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001348_0017_0FB2919AC2C0CDB0"/>
and not in his own: He watcheth againſt all up-riſings of ſelf-confidence, and ſelf-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, (which would expoſe him to be overpowred by this Enemy) and gets out of himſelf unto Chriſt to enable him to fight the good fight, and to withſtand and overcome this Enemy, Sin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>By their patient continuance in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Sin, notwithſtanding all the wounds and ſcars which they meet with in this War.</hi> They expect to meet with blows and ſeratches in their ſtriving againſt, and reſiſting of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vices; and arm themſelves before-hand with holy reſolution not to be diſcouraged thereby; Do they meet with the <hi>contradiction</hi> of Sinners? They conſider it is no more than Chriſt himſelf met with, and patiently endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; therefore it becomes the members and followers of Chriſt to be patient under ſuch Tryals. Do they meet with <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace?</hi> They remember Chriſt <hi>deſpiſed the ſhame;</hi> therefore Chriſt's followers ſhould not too deeply lay to heart that ſhame which is put upon them by the carnal World. Thoſe Sinners them ſelves will at the Laſt Day be filled with everlaſting ſhame and contempt, who while they were on Earth did hate to be reformed, and perſiſted in oppoſing Vertue, decrying of Religion, and practicing of Vice. If Chriſtians in this Life be accounted as the offſcouring of all things, and be trampled on as Mire in the Streets, yet they have peace in their own conſciences while on Earth, and the diſgrace which they meet with here for well-doing, ſhall in the next life be compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated with a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</p>

6. <hi>They joyn readily with others, and call upon others to joyn with them in this great work of ſtriving againſt, and reſiſting thoſe ſins of the Times, which like a Flood are ready to bear down all before them.</hi> Doctor <hi>Sibbs</hi> in his Excellent Treatiſe of the Souls conflict, <hi>p.</hi> 290. ſaith, <hi>It is a courſe which will have a bleſſing attending it, for friends to joyn in league, one to watch over another, &amp; obſerve each others ways. It is an uſual courſe for Chriſtians to joyn together in other holy duties, as Hearing, Receiving the Sacrament, Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But this fruit of holy communion, which ariſeth from a mutual obſerving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is much wanting.</hi> Let me add, for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to improve an hour or two at ſtated times in ſuch a communion, extending their thoughts and cares, ſo far as to conſider where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might in their Stations, be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to ſtop the progreſs of Vice, and to promote Vertue, might be of ſingular uſe and advantage: Nay, did Chriſtians meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes, were it only to mourn before the Lord for the prevalency of ſins which they ſee no likelihood of any reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, it would be more pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, than the meetings of carnal perſons for ſinful mirth &amp; jollity, &amp; only ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:001348_0019_0FB2919DDAC8D3A8"/>
to ſtrive againſt, and reſiſt Idolatry; God condeſcended to comfort him, by that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that there were ſome thouſands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf, that were ſtriving againſt the ſins of thoſe Times, by their prayers &amp; pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ices, tho' they had not the courage, or had not the opportunity, or had not the Office and Extraordinary Call to appear ſo openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as <hi>Elijah</hi> himſelf did. It is a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to thoſe who by Office are placed in the Front of the Battel againſt ſin, to know that there are many whoſe hearts are with them, and their prayers daily put up to God for their ſucceſs in their ſincere endeavours againſt the Kingdom of Sin: But if ſuch as they take to be their Fellow Souldiers, thro' ſcar, ſloth, or for ſome carnal intereſt will not diſcover that their hearts are with them, but rather blame them for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in oppoſing Vice, it ſinks their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and makes them ſend up ſuch a groan to Heaven as <hi>Paul</hi> did, when no man ſtood by him while he pleaded the Cauſe of Chriſt and of the Goſpel; <hi>I pray God lay it not to their charge,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 16.</p>
            <p>More particularly, That Miniſters ſhould meet at ſtated times, either in leſſer Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or more general Aſſemblies, is a thing very beneficial for the upholding Religion, preſerving the peace and purity of Churches, and propagating of Religion to other Places and Generations. The Lord by his Servants aſſembled in a Synod, <hi>Anno</hi> 1679. in this Land, ſet before us both what the prevailing Sins of <hi>New-England</hi> are (and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not needful for me to Enumerate in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001348_0020_0FB291A5EF2E6A38"/>
this Diſcourſe, being ſo fully done already) and what is to be done in order to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of them: Our thankfulneſs to God for the light at that time by thoſe our Eminent Divines held forth unto us, ſhould be expreſſed, not only by a reiterated peruſal of each Article of their Reſult; but by meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together ſometimes, to conſult how the directions therein given us may more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in every Church and Plantation be put in practice, and to watch over each other, &amp; excite each other to a more ſerious and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal attendance to the directions therein gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us from the Word of God, in order to the reforming of Evils prevailing among us, and for the Reviving of Religion in the Land.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to another Head: Namely,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To conſider, in <hi>what manner</hi> Good men ſhould reſiſt and ſtrive againſt growing Vice and Impiety. Now if we take the words of our Text to be an alluſion to thoſe Conflicts and Combats among the Heathen in old Time; which were ſeldom determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without blood, and manag'd by expert Artiſts, who Encountred each other in thoſe Conflicts before many Spectators; we may infer from this alluſion theſe following direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions for a Chriſtian to obſerve in his reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtriving againſt growing Vice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this ſtriving againſt ſin is to be managed with <hi>Holy Affections:</hi> Particularly;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>With holy zeal, earnestneſs and fervour of ſpirit, even with agony of ſoul.</hi> A Chriſtian is not to act with faint heartedneſs and fear, when God calls him to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet againſt crying Sins; but to be,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001348_0021_0FB291A757F2A550"/>
when the caſe ſo requires, like a Lyon in God's Cauſe, tho' like a Lamb in his own Cauſe; knowing that Lukewarmneſs in this caſe is as odious to God, as to ſit ſtill and do nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>With love and pity towards Sinners, and towards the Land, which by prevailing ſins are ripened for ruin, and expoſed to destruction.</hi> A true Believer foreſeeing a Storm of Divine Wrath and Vengeance coming on a People, (which he can readily and rationally infer from the growth of Vice and Profaneſs) from a compaſſionate ſpirit thruſts himſelf into the Gap (opened for Judgments to enter in at) endeavouring by his Prayers, Tears, Warnings, Counſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to keep off the Judgments which the Sins of a Land expoſe a people unto; and is ſo much the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vigorous herein, as he ſees the day of wrath approaching and haſtening towards them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This reſiſting and ſtriving againſt ſin is to be managed with <hi>holy diſcretion.</hi> As a Fencer ſhews his Skill and Art as well as Courage; ſo doth a Chriſtian Souldier in his conflicts with prevailing and growing vices. He knows that zeal without diſcretion is but wild fire, and diſſerves that good intereſt which he heartily deſires to promote. His diſcretion teaches him, while he is vigorouſly active againſt the Kingdom of Sin, carefully to avoid the ſins forbidden in the Second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; namely, damnifying his Neighbour in his Honour and Reputation, in his Eſtate or Life, or any of his lawful intereſts.</p>

the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons</hi> wherein he may ſtrike the greateſt blow againſt the Kingdom of Sin. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> There are times wherein Sinners are more capable of an inſtruction or reproof for their Emendation, than they are at other times; ſuch opportunity he waits for and improves to the beſt advantage. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when a Sinner is under outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or inward diſtreſs of mind, at ſuch a time will he endeavour to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon that may put him upon it to conſider his ways, to repent of his ſins, and to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reformation of his life. Thus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt watch and wait for opportunities and ſeaſons when they may have eaſieſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs into men, and redeem ſuch times for the doing good to the ſouls of others.</p>
            <p>Again, Diſcretion teaches him to wrap up his needful reproofs and hard arguments in ſoft words, expreſſive of his affection &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Sinner himſelf. If it be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that any Sinner be laid under puniſhment by the Civil Law, or under Cenſure in the Church for his reformation; yet tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and meekneſs, grief and pity, expreſſed towards him are moſt likely to affect him with remorſe for his ſins committed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to avoid them for the future; while <hi>(e contra)</hi> Scoffs and Diviſions do but tend to harden Sinners, and render them the more deſperately wicked.</p>
            <p>Again, Diſcretion teaches him to avoid the danger of <hi>Sinful Indulgence,</hi> of winking and conniving at ſin: the Judgments <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

matter, is a ſtanding warning to him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the like.</p>
            <p>In all theſe &amp; ſuch other like inſtances, he believes that ſaying of <hi>Solomon</hi> to hold as a truth; <hi>Diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee,</hi> Prov. 2.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho' in ſome places and times (thro' the great mercy of God) the Chriſtian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is not expoſed to ſhed his Blood (in a proper ſenſe) by his reſiſting and ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin, yet in ſome ſenſe he may ſay with the Apoſtle, that <hi>he is in deaths often,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 23. while he is managing this Combat; tho' he find the ſtrength of his body &amp; mind decaying, waſting and conſuming in the hot ſervice he is called unto, of oppoſing Vice &amp; Prophaneſs, yet perſeveres therein, and is willing to ſpend and be ſpent in this Service againſt. Chriſt's Enemies, and reſolveth by Gods help to continue fighting the good fight, till Death in a proper ſenſe, gives him a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from this War. Tho' he find that to be in good earneſt an oppoſer of ſin &amp; vice is not the way to popular Applauſe, though he meet with ſuch Tryals on that account, which are more bitter than death it ſelf unto him; <hi>yet the righteous man holds on his way, &amp; grows stronger and ſtronger (Job</hi> 17. 9.) in making reſiſtance to the growth of the Kingdom of Sin and Satan; the wounds he receiveth, make him fight with the greater courage and vigour; and ſeeing his life muſt be ſpent in this Service, be reſolveth to do as much exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as poſſibly he can upon the Enemy, before Death overtakes him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As thoſe who ſought among the Heathen openly before many Spectators, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

to fight in good earneſt, knowing the Blood of one of the Combatants muſt be ſpilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they left the Stage. So the Chriſtian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in his ſtriving againſt Sin acts with intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, and <hi>integrity of heart.</hi> Chriſt hath in every Age, had ſome ſincere Souldiers, who in the uprightneſs of their hearts have reſiſted and ſtriven againſt ſin. Indeed, many have there been in former and later Ages, who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and profeſſed themſelves to be of the number of the reformed, and to be forward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of others alſo, who have ſoon diſcovered themſelves to have acted only for their own ſelf ends; for, not obtaining their By-ends thereby, they have laid aſide their profeſſion of Religion, and have turned Enemies to, and Oppoſers of the intereſt of Religion in the power of it.</p>
            <p>As there is as much danger of the Baniſhment of Learning by ſome that have a little ſmattering of it, which only puffs them up to deſpiſe thoſe who excel themſelves therein, as there is from thoſe who are more ignorant; and as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the overthrow of the Civil State by ſuch who (tho' they are acted only by ſelf intereſt) have a little ſmattering in the Law and in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which only fills them with ſelf conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cauſes them to deſpiſe and oppoſe thoſe who are thorow-paced in thoſe Sciences, and are indued with ſincere love to the Publick Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the work of Reformation is very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the formal boaſting and ſelf-conceited Profeſſor, whoſe knowledge only tends to puff him up, and makes him contemn and oppoſe whatever is contrived or acted tho' with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of heart by any other of his Fellow-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in carrying on this Conflict againſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Sin.

The only USE I ſhall make of this Doctrine is this: It being our duty to reſiſt &amp; ſtrive againſt the whole Kingdom of Sin; it may hence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that it is a great ſin to <hi>diſcourage good men</hi> from endeavouring to ſuppreſs Vice, Immorality and Impiety. Numb. 32. 7, 8, 10. <hi>Wherefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ye the heart of the Children of </hi> Iſrael <hi>from going over; thus did your Fathers, and God's Anger was kindled againſt them.</hi> God's Anger was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both againſt thoſe who diſcouraged the hearts of their brethren from going over to fight againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and againſt thoſe who were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by them, v. 9, 10. which appears by God's threatning with an Oath, <hi>that none of thoſe who came out of</hi> Egypt <hi>ſhould ſee the promiſed Land,</hi> v. 11. which threatning was fulfilled; for thoſe men who diſcouraged their brethren dyed of the plague before the Lord. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 37. and thoſe alſo who were diſcouraged by them did bear their iniquities forty years, in that ſpace were all of them conſumed gradually. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who wholly followed the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. 12. who made an excellent ſpeech to encourage their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to go up againſt the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> Numb. 14. 6. 9. &amp; preſſed them thereunto with ſuch zeal &amp; earneſtneſs, that the multitude being provoked, bade ſtone them with ſtones, v. 10.

            <p>The ſame <hi>Methods</hi> which thoſe Spies took to diſcourage their brethren from Encountring with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> are ſtill in practice in the world, to diſcourage any brave attempt againſt the Kingdom of Sin: For inſtance.</p>

1. Thoſe Spies raiſed <hi>falſe Reports</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land: Inſtead of ſaying the truth (as did <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>) that it was a Land of <hi>Milk &amp; Honey,</hi> they gave a contrary account, namely, that it was a Land that <hi>eat up the Inhabitants thereof,</hi> Numb. 13. 32.</p>
            <p>What falſe Reports and Miſrepreſentations are there made concerning the <hi>work</hi> of Reformation, the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of it, and <hi>methods</hi> of it? True ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Godlineſs is miſrepreſented to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and burdenſome life; and that there is not ſuch need of reſtraining, curbing and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of Sin as ſome preciſe perſons imagine; what is acted by Good men with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt caution, prudence, affection and moderation is repreſented to be the effect of pride, cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pragmaticalneſs. Tho' <hi>David</hi> were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The holy Apoſtles were cryed out againſt in thoſe Terms, thoſe that have turned the world apſide down are come hither alſo, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17. 6. How di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutively will ſome ſpeak of reformation work, as if they ſaw no beauty or glory therein?</p>
            <p>And inſtead of moderating, qualifying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the zeal of good men (which thro' the remainders of Corruption in them, ſometimes vents it ſelf unſeaſonably or intemperately) men are too apt to uſe methods wholly to <hi>Extinguiſh</hi> zeal againſt ſin in them, &amp; to reduce them either to ſuch a <hi>Lukewarm</hi> frame of ſpirit as themſelves are in, or to ſuch a <hi>Timerouſneſs of Spirit,</hi> that they dare not expreſs their zeal againſt Vice any more; or ſo to <hi>prejudice others againſt them,</hi> as that they ſhall find themſelves thereby incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated from any further ſucceſsful attempts againſt the Kingdom of Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe Spies reported that there were inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001348_0027_0FB291B500AB47A8"/>
difficulties in their way; ſo that there was no hope of making a Conqueſt of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> Deut. 1.28. <hi>Whither ſhould we go up? our brethren have diſcouraged our hearts, ſaying, The people are greater and taller than we; the City is great and walled up to Heaven, and moreover we have ſeen the ſons of the Anakims there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, how apt are men to diſcourage each other from any attempts againſt the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the kingdom of ſin, and putting a ſtop to the growth of profaneſs? How many Lions are ſuppoſed to be in the way? One looks on it as a thing unattainable and impoſſible to be effected; that the Goſpel in the Miniſtry and Ordinances thereof ſhould be ſet up in ſuch places where ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Errors &amp; Profaneſs have had their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Another Good man is afraid that purging the Temple, or ſweeping ſome dirt out of it by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, will make the Temple it ſelf fall down, or at leaſt ſome of the carved work of it.</p>
            <p>But a Chriſtian Souldier ſhould conſider, that what is impoſſible to be done by men or outward means in themſelves conſidered, may with the help, preſence &amp; aſſiſtance of God be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that in the way of dependance on God for his preſence and bleſſing, according to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to us thereof, the Chriſtian Souldier may fall on and move forwards in the path of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with ſuch an encouraged ſpirit as <hi>Paul</hi> had, Phil. 4. 13. <hi>I can do all things thro' Chriſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of me.</hi> He knoweth that when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>work with</hi> mean &amp; weak inſtruments, then wonders ſhall be wrought, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.44.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe Spies diſcouraged <hi>Iſrael</hi> from going up againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> by their own <hi>backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> their bad example ſet before their brethren, diſcouraged them from their duty</p>
            <p>When thoſe who ſhould be File-leaders do fall

back, and draw off in this War againſt Vice and Profaneſs, it diſanimates others from falling on and preſſing forwards againſt this Enemy? <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. <hi>Moſes</hi> knew that if the two tribes and half abſented themſelves, the Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would not only be weakned as to <hi>number,</hi> but their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits &amp; Courage</hi> would be weakned alſo: therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> placed them in the Front of the Army, to lead on the reſt in that Expedition. When Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men abſent themſelves, and will not afford their preſence and company to their brethren, nor contribute their advice to them how they ſhould proceed in the affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom, and againſt the Kingdom of Sin, it is a very great diſcouragement unto them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe Spies who diſcouraged their brethren from going up againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> were the <hi>majority in number.</hi> There were only <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who ſtood on the Lord's ſide; theſe two were oppoſed by the other ten; ſo that theſe two were in imminent danger of being ſto<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed by the Mobile; who are ſometimes led more by number of voices, then by weight of arguments. The Kingdom of Sin and Vice is much upheld by plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of voices, by noiſe and tumults. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſet the multitude againſt Chriſt, to cry out, <hi>Let him be Crucified,</hi> which was all the anſwer <hi>Pilot</hi> could get to that pertinent queſtion, <hi>What hath he done?</hi> Mark 15. 14. It's a rare thing to hear of popular clamours againſt popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Vices and Profaneſs, but not very rare to hear tumultuous noiſe againſt thoſe who ſtrive againſt, and reſiſt ſin, whereby they are diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ready to ſay, <hi>I will ſpeak no more in the name of the Lord;</hi> I will refrain my ſelf even from that which is good, while ſuch and ſuch are before me.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, As thoſe Spies were acted by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and carnal principles (&amp; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuſpected the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001348_0029_0FB291BD784211B0"/>
two tribes and half whom he treats with, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. to be acting from like evil principles) ſo from the ſame or like principles are men ſtill acted, who diſcourage others from making a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous oppoſition to the Kingdom of Sin in the world. Take a few inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe Spies were overcome with carnal fear. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>We are not able to go up againſt this people, for they are ſtronger than we; all the people we ſaw in the land are men of great ſtature, we were in their ſight as graſhoppers, &amp;c.</hi> And being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted themſelves, they became ready inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to diſcourage their brethren: So in the Spiritual War againſt the Kingdom of Sin, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe doth great hurt. <hi>The fear of man is a ſnare,</hi> Prov. 29.25. Hence it is that many become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of other mens ſins, becauſe they are afraid to offend them by giving them a ſeaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or uſing proper means to reſtrain &amp; reform them; and by ſuch fearfulneſs and faint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs they diſcourage others, who juſtly expect that men of Eminency in Gifts, Offices, in Age, and in Grace, ſhould be moſt forward Witneſſes for Chriſt againſt growing vice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ground of that fear in thoſe Spies was this; They lookt on the work before them with an eye of carnal ſence, &amp; not with an eye of faith. The unbelieving Spies could tell what they ſaw with their bodily eyes; whereas believing <hi>Caleb</hi> &amp; <hi>Joſhua</hi> did put their brethren in mind of God's promiſe. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. that all thoſe people ſhould be bread for <hi>Iſrael, for their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us;</hi> and therefore exhorted their brethren not to fear them: The true reaſon why that Generation did not enter into the Land of Reſt, was becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.6. The Victory which the Chriſtian Souldier hath over the ſlaviſh fear of man is his faith: <hi>He that puts his truſt in the Lord, ſhall be
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001348_0030_0FB291BEB6675A58"/>
ſafe, Prov.</hi> 29. 25. When faith is weak, then the hands hang down and the knees grow feeble, &amp; men are unfit to do any great matter in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate againſt ſin; and very ready then to weaken the hands of others that would be active therein; whereas thoſe who have faith in due exerciſe in their own hearts will be ſtrengthning others in their Chriſtian Warfare, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did <hi>David;</hi> he went into the wilderneſs to him, &amp; encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, &amp; <hi>ſtrengthned his hand in God,</hi> 1Sa 23.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuſpected the two Tribes and half to be acted by a <hi>ſlothful</hi> flame of ſpirit: that they were loth to take the pains to make a further conqueſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Numb. 32. that therefore they rather choſe to content themſelves with leſs Land, being already conquered, than to undergo the difficulties of conquering more.</p>
            <p>A ſlothful frame of ſpirit, and <hi>love of eaſe</hi> makes many ſit ſtill and do nothing for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining of Vice, and curbing of it; and ſuch are apt to diſcourage others from ſuch attempts wherein they foreſee dangers and difficulties, will encounter them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuſpected the two Tribes and half that petitioned for the Land on this ſide <hi>Jordan</hi> for their Inheritance, to be acted by a <hi>covetous &amp; earthly mind;</hi> for that was ſome of the beſt Land in all <hi>Canaan</hi> which was then conquered, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made great haſte to put in their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that Land; and tho' they purged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Moſes</hi> at this time, yet ſome think their hearts might be too much ſet upon the Soil granted unto them, and that therefore they were of the firſt that were afterwards carried into Captivity.</p>
            <p>Many having obtained a good portion in this world, will not expoſe themſelves to any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in reſiſting the kingdom of ſin, not trouble themſelves which of thoſe two Kingdom; proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001348_0031_0FB291C036964DE0"/>
moſt in the world, whether the Kingdom of Heaven, or the Kingdom of Sin. Such whoſe Hearts are ſet on Earthly things, have been wont to make great oppoſition to the progreſs of the Goſpel. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 24, 29. So thoſe that love the world better than they love their Souls, are content to live without a Goſpel Miniſtry and means of Grace, on this account, becauſe they think it will ſave charges.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Poſſibly <hi>Moſes</hi> might ſuſpect thoſe two Tribes and half to act from a principle of direct <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the poſitive Command of God. <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>Thus did your Fore-fathers,</hi> faith <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> Now their Fore-fathers were guilty of plain rebellion againſt God. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 4. 9. <hi>Only rebel not ye againſt the Lord. Moſes</hi> ſuſpected the ſame rebellious frame of ſpirit to be in them he now treated with, which mightly hid under the cloak of their fair and ſpecious pretences; He was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid left there lay rooted in their hearts a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of prevailing Enmity againſt God's poſitive Commands.</p>
            <p>This is one chief cauſe why men diſcourage one another from vigorous eſſays and attempts to batter down the kingdom of ſin, becauſe there is in their hearts a ſecret enmity againſt Religion in the power of it, and againſt the ways of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and a ſecret love to the ways and works of darkneſs; when ſuch enmity appears in the viſible &amp; vileſt expreſſions and effects of it, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſuch treatment as <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Elymas,</hi> Acts 13. 8, 10. But where if lies hid and latent, we had need take pains to examine our hearts &amp; find it out and mortify it; for doubtleſs we have more ſin lurking in our hearts than we our ſelves are apt to be aware of.</p>
            <p>Let us examine our ſelves, how far each of us have been guilty of diſcouraging others from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their beſt endeavours to ſuppreſs Vice, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001348_0032_0FB291C1B4B8A4A0"/>
to reſtrain Immorality and Profaneſs, Let's mourn for our own ſlothfulneſs, backwardneſs, unbelief and earthly-mindedneſs, and the ſecret enmity in our hearts againſt ſerious Religion. Let us fear and tremble leſt we ſhould be any way guilty for time to come of diſcouraging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from a vigorous diſcharge of their duty: Let's think of that awful word which <hi>Moſes</hi> adds, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. 15. <hi>And ye ſhall deſtroy all this people. One Sinner deſtroys much good,</hi> Eccl. 9. 18. A few perſons who diſcourage others from walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ways of Obedience to God's Commands, may be juſtly charged by God as the authors of the ruin and deſtruction of the whole Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof they themſelves are a part. Tho' that whole Generation that were diſcouraged by thoſe ten Spies were themſelves deſtroyed in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. 13. yet the ten Spies were made the peculiar Monuments of Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: So were <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, who led the Congregation into rebellion againſt God. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. So the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> that were wicked, and were inſtruments of leading others into ſin, and cauſing the ways of God's Worſhip to be abhorred, they were remarkably puniſhed by the Lord. Let us fear then leſt this Indictment ſhould be drawn up againſt us; ye have deſtroyed all this people by diſcouraging them from a thorow ſerious and effectual oppoſition to the Kingdom of Sin.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with a very few words to the Honourable GENTLEMEN of the ARTILLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY COMPANY, who obliged me to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them this day.</p>

Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be Entreated to make good your Leaders ground.</hi> There have been men of the former Generation in this Land, not only Eminent in their ſkill in the Art Military, but alſo Eminent Souldiers of Chriſt; But they are removed from off the Stage, very few of the former Generation are now ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving: While they Lived, they Served not meerly their own ſelf-intereſts, but they ſerved their Generation; and did with Zeal, Courage, Wiſdom and Diſcretion endeavour, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Poſts and Stations to lead that Generation whereof they were a part) to the Heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> They were true <hi>Calebs</hi> and <hi>Joſhua's,</hi> who did wholly follow the Lord.</p>

Your ſelves are now Riſen up in their ſtead, to be leading and influencing men in the preſent Generation, May the God of Heaven, who hath the reſidue of the Spirit, pour it out abundantly on your ſelves, that you may by your Works and Words, and Tears, and Faith, and Prayers, both ſeverally and joyntly, with affection and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with patience and integrity of heart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the War of our Lord Meſſiah againſt the Kingdom of Sin: That we may ſtill have reaſon to bleſs God, that tho' the Old Generation of Chriſtian Souldiers are removed from us, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit a Crown of Glory; yet the God of our Fore-fathers is ſtill with us and among us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing the hearts of our Leading Men of all Ranks and Orders, to Lead us towards Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be Entreated to Conſider,</hi> That the Body of this People in <hi>New-England</hi> being ſo remarkably multiplied and encreaſed in number; and moſt of the aged and experienced Chriſtians being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the World, who were wont to Counſel, Exhort, Direct &amp; Steady others into the right path of Holineſs: Unleſs God be pleaſed to ſpirit ſome younger Chriſtians (and many of them too) to be forward and zealous in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting others to their duty, and in dehorting and reſtraining others from Vice; The preſent Standing and Riſing Generation of young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will be in a miſerable Condition, for want of help. The Kingdom of Sin will get head very faſt among us, and will overtop Vertue; Ignorance, Error and Vice will prevail; yea, the very form of Religion will be laid aſide, unleſs God do ſpirit ſome of the younger Chriſtians, and qualify them to ſtand in the front of the Battel againſt Vice; to march forward and put forth themſelves with their utmoſt force and influence, for the curbing and reſtraining of Vice, and encouraging of Vertue and Piety.</p>

3. Conſider that God having made a gracious promiſe that he will yet new form and reform a Degenerate People for himſelf, <hi>and they ſhall ſhew forth his praiſe,</hi> Iſa. 43. 21. It will be <hi>your Glory</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> to be any way ſubſervient to the promoting of this great and glorious work; and thoſe that approve themſelves faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt in their Stations and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhall not fail of that Crown of Glory which fadeth not away, which Chriſt hath prepared for, and promiſed to thoſe that fight the good fight, and keep the faith.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which lie in the way to weaken the Hearts, the Carriage, the force and activity of Good men in oppoſing the Kingdom of Sin; yet we may boldly ſay to them as <hi>Azariah</hi> did to <hi>Aſa,</hi> and <hi>to all Judah and Benjamin.</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15. 2, 7. <hi>The Lord is with you while you be with him;</hi> (i. e. in purſuing the work of Reformation, which they were then Enterpriſing) <hi>if ye ſeek him he will be found of you.</hi> Be you ſtrong therefore, and let not your hands be weak, for your work ſhall be rewarded.</p>
