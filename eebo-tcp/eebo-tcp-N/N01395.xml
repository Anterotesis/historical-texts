            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>

                  <p>Deſtruction from God was a Terrour to me.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the foregoing Verſes <hi>Job</hi> makes a ſolemn Proteſtation of his Innocency: And Ver. 22. utters a terrible Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation againſt himſelf in caſe he was guilty. <hi>Then let mine Arm fall from my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blade, and mine Arm be broken from the Bone.</hi> And in this Verſe he gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001651_0003_0FB4D57344EE0238"/>
why he did not carry himſelf Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. <hi>Deſtruction from God was a Terrour to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Words mind, 1. How <hi>Job</hi> was affected. <hi>Terrour</hi> notes <hi>great Fear:</hi> Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God was Terrible to him. 2. With what he was affected. <hi>Deſtruction from God:</hi> Heb. <hi>of God.</hi> The Genitive Caſe noting the <hi>Efficient,</hi> not the <hi>Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How came</hi> Job <hi>to be afraid of Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God, ſeeing he was not only a good Man, but, as appears by many Paſſages of this Book, had the aſſurance of his Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. There be Temporal Deſtructions that good Men are in danger of.</hi> The Deſtruction of their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> of their <hi>Children,</hi> and of their <hi>Lives.</hi> If they carry it Rebelliouſly, they have no ſecurity that ſuch Deſtruction ſhall not come upon them. 2. Godly Men have reaſon to be afraid of Hell. Only here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh there is a <hi>Slaviſh fear</hi> of Hell, riſing from a ſence that Men are in a ſtate of Condemnation. Thus they ſhould not fear Hell. And there is a <hi>Cautious fear</hi> of Hell: <hi>That</hi> makes them to avoid thoſe Paths that lead to Hell. <hi>This</hi> ought to be in godly Men, that conditional Propoſition is true of godly Men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If you live after the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001651_0004_0FB4D574C4FC0BF8"/>
Fleſh, you ſhall die.</hi> And therefore godly Men ſhould have an Awful fear of Hell, and a due care to avoid it. Mat. 10.28. <hi>Fear Him that can caſt both Soul and Body into Hell:</hi> It is a laudable Thing for godly Men to fear Hell.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>The fear of Hell is a powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from Sin.</hi> There are ſuch ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations in Men to Sin, and ſo many Temptations, that the World would be more wicked than the old World, were there not ſomething that had conſiderable power to reſtrain Men, and a principal Thing to reſtrain Men is the <hi>fear of Hell.</hi> There be ſeveral other Things that are of uſe to reſtrain Men, as the fear of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of <hi>Parents,</hi> of the <hi>juſtice of Rulers,</hi> of <hi>Divine Vengeance in this World,</hi> but the fear of Hell is much more powerful than theſe. The miſery of many Men is, that they do not fear Hell, they are not ſenſible of the dreadfulneſs or danger of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo they take a great liberty to Sin: But if they were afraid of Hell, they would be afraid of Sin. When their Luſts were as Spurs to ſtir them up to Sin, this fear would be as a Bridle to curb them in. Men are informed in the Scriptures of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001651_0005_0FB4D57D0523DB60"/>
Miſeries of Hell on purpoſe to debar them from Sin; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29, 30. <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee pluck it out, and caſt it from thee, for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy Members ſhould Periſh, and not that thy whole Body ſhould be caſt into Hell.</hi> And if Men be throughly afraid of Hell, it will have that effect upon them, to reſtrain them from Sin.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is the fear of Hell a powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. The fear of Hell diſcovers the dangerous Nature of Sin.</hi> Hell is threatned in the Scripture as the puniſhment of Sin; Mat. 13.41, 42. <hi>They ſhall gather out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom all things that offend, and them that do Iniquity, and caſt them into a Furnace of Fire.</hi> Sinful carriages bring Deſtruction; hence the Man is afraid of Sin, as that which will ſink him into Hell. Men are afraid of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the Plague, becauſe they think they will kill them; ſo they dread Sin, as that which will deſtroy them: Though they love it, yet they dare not practiſe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the doleful Conſequence of it. They ſay they ſhall bring a Curſe upon themſelves: They ſee Death in it; hereby they ſee an unanſwerable Argument againſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001651_0006_0FB4D58103451CC8"/>
Sin. A Man ſaith as he, <hi>If I ſhould Sin, I ſhould work falſhood againſt my own Life.</hi> 2. Sam. 18.13, This makes the Temptations to Sin to looſe their Power. Men are urged to Sin for their Profit; but they ſay, what Profit ſhall I have if I be Damned? Math. 16.26. <hi>What is a Man profited if he gain the whole World and looſe his own Soul?</hi> They are urged to Sin for their Pleaſure; but they ſay, we ſhall have Pain inſtead of Pleaſure. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Her end is bitter as Wormwood, ſharp as a two-edged Sword. Her Feet go down to Death, her ſteps take hold of Hell.</hi> They are urged to Sin for their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but they ſay, This is the way to bring our ſelves to Shame. Dan. 12.2. <hi>Some ſhall riſe to Shame and everlaſting Contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The fear of Hell helps Men to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the baſeneſs of Sin.</hi> When Men are afraid of Hell, they are thereby made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the terrible Anger of God for Sin; and may rationally conclude that Sin is an exceeding great Evil. If it were not, God would not be ſo angry as to ſend Men to Hell on that account. Would God inflict eternal Puniſhment for it, if the Evil of it were not exceeding great? There is a great deal of Light in Hell-Fire, diſcovering that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001651_0007_0FB4D583CFD91160"/>
Sin muſt needs be an abominable Thing, if we ſhould ſee Perſons burnt at a Stake under a righteous Government, we ſhould conclude that they had been guilty of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Crimes. So in this Caſe; Beſides when Men are afraid of Hell, that leads them to conſider the Nature of Sin; it brings them into a ponderous frame of Spirit, and makes them to weigh Things more Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and when they do ſo, though they have only natural Conſcience, yet they may perceive a great deal of Filthineſs in evil Carriages. They can eaſily diſcern that there is in their ſinful Carriages a great deal of Folley, much corrupt Affection and Filthineſs, and baſeneſs againſt the light of Nature, Natural Conſcience doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn many Sins, Rom. 2.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The fear of Hell helps Men to ſee what Practices are Sinful.</hi> When Men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Hell, many times they don't ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect many of their ſinful Practices; and if they be told that they are Evil, they ſtand up in the Juſtification of them, and have a great deal to plead for them. It is almoſt impoſſible to convince them, but if the terrour of Hell take hold upon them, they will eaſily fall under Conviction, that many
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001651_0008_0FB4D61FC5B76100"/>
things are amiſs, which formerly they ſaw no Evil in. Conſcience is enlightned, and they are ſenſible of their danger; <hi>Now the Word is as a ſharp two-edged Sword,</hi> Heb. 4.12. They dare not give way to a cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Spirit as before, they conſider the rule more Impartially than they did; they know that Figleaves and ſorry Pretences and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes will not ſerve their turn when God ſhall judge them, and they condemn ſuch things as they juſtified before.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>USE. See the Reaſon why there is ſo little Reformation in this Land.</hi> This Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation has been mightily clogged, and a very little Matter has been effected; the Countrey hath been proſperous in other Deſigns: There hath been an indeavour to promote Cloathing, and it hath been proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered; ſo there has been a deſign to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Learning and Merchandize, and there hath been Succeſs; but there have been great endeavours to promote Reformation; Laws have been enacted, Sermons have been preached, Covenants have been made, but all endeavours have had a miſcarrying Womb; there has not been one Sin gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reformed theſe twenty Years. Inſtead of growing better and better, the Country
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001651_0009_0FB4D622F59BFBD8"/>
grows worſe and worſe. Many ſeem to be Incorrigible and Obſtinate in their Pride and Luxury and Profaneſs: The reaſon of it is, they are not afraid of Hell; they are afraid of Poverty, and afraid of Sickneſs, but not afraid of Hell; that would reſtrain them from ſinful Practices, Deſtruction from God would be a Terrour to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Fear of Puniſhment from Men, will not make the Land Reform.</hi> The fear of Man is of conſiderable Uſe: Were it not for this, the World would be far more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than it is: They that don't love Vertue, fear Puniſhment: Rulers are a <hi>Terrour to Evil doers,</hi> Rom. 13.4. The benefit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this reſpect is very great, but will not make the Land Reform, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the Sins that bring down the Wrath of God upon the Land, don't fall under the Cognizance of Authority. There is a great deal of Pride and Murmuring and Worldlineſs, and prophaning of the Sabbath, that is not puniſhable by Law. The Laws of Men reach more groſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities; but there are many Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are breaches of the Laws of Men. Parents may fail extreamly of their Duty, ſo may Officers in the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001651_0010_0FB4D624482E2590"/>
yet no Law take hold of them; there may be abundance of Iniquity found by God among a People, who are yet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in the eye of the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Experience of publick Judgments will not make them to Reform.</hi> Publick Judgments are monitors of Obedience; God ſpeaks audibly and ſenſibly in them; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have an Efficacy on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35. <hi>When He ſlew them, then they ſought Him,</hi> &amp;c. But many times the Phyſick is not ſtrong enough for the Diſeaſe: Judgments deſtroy their outward Comforts, but don't deſtroy their Sins. <hi>Cleanneſs of Teeth won't cleanſe away their Sins.</hi> Am. 4.6. The Barrenneſs of the Land won't make them Fruitful, <hi>V.</hi> 9. The Peſtilence won't cure the Plague of their Hearts, <hi>V.</hi> 10. When they were ſcorched with Fire from Heaven, their Conſciences were ſeared, <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>Ten Plagues</hi> were not ſufficient to work upon <hi>Pharoah.</hi> Judgments won't deliver a People from their hard Hearts. Jer. 5.3. <hi>Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have refuſed to receive Inſtructions; they have made their Faces harder than a Rock, they have refuſed to Return.</hi> Sometimes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments make People worſe; many times
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001651_0011_0FB4D625C5F8D2E8"/>
Men are not convinced what Judgments come for, and when they are paſt, they are ſoon forgotten: Men had rather bear a pretty deal than part with their Sins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Fear of Shame among Men will not make them Reform.</hi> Sinful Carriages are a Shame to Men. When Men Sin, they degrade themſelves, and act beneath the dignity of their Nature. Sin is unreaſonable, and ſhews a baſeneſs of Spirit; it brings <hi>a Reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a People,</hi> Prov. 14.34. And hence ſome particular Perſons are affected with it, and ſcorn to make themſelves a Reproach. They are not willing to be as the Fools in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo avoid thoſe Sins that bring Ignominy. But when a People are become Corrupt, many ſinful Practices are not counted Shameful. Many things that are Provocations to God are vindicated; the commonneſs of a Practice makes it to be accounted Lawful. Men may practiſe things that are provoking to God, yet live in Reputation among Men; they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Saints, they may be advanced to places of Honour, yea ſometimes among a corrupt People, that which is indeed a Shame, is counted an Honour, and they glory therein. Phil. 3.19. <hi>Whoſe Glory is in their Shame.</hi>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001651_0012_0FB4D62746031FA0"/>4. <hi>Senſe of Mercies and Deliverances will not.</hi> A corrupt People are wont to have much Mercy mingled with Judgment, and ſometimes God gives great Deliverances to them: Theſe things ſhould lead Men to Repentance, and ſometimes they are much affected with the goodneſs of God. God's Mercies melt their Hearts, and they promiſe to amend their Ways; but ſuch things ſeldom make a People Reform. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while the Pang is over, and they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the goodneſs of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12, 13. <hi>They ſang his Praiſe, but ſoon forgot his Works.</hi> V. 21. <hi>They forgot God their Saviour, that had done great things for them.</hi> The thoughts of the Deliverance grow a ſtale thing after a while, and they looſe the ſenſe of God's Mercies; yea the Mercies that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon them prove a Snare to them. If God beſtows Plenty on them, they grow more Coveteous, and the more they have the more they crave; he that loveth Silver will not be ſatisfied with Silver, and they ſwell with Pride, and forget their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, and think much to be controuled. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord?</hi> And many times they grow Voluptuous, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001651_0013_0FB4D62985CA6FE8"/>
live the lives of <hi>Epicures.</hi> Am. 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>They lie upon Beds of Ivory, and ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Couches, they eat the Lambs out of the Flock, and Calves out of the midſt of the Stall; they chant to the Sound of the Viol, and invent to themſelves Inſtruments of Muſick, like David; they drink Wine in Bowls, and Anoint themſelves with the chief Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſee hence, <hi>it would be a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to many Men, if they had more of the fear of Hell.</hi> It is worthy our Obſervation, That of all the Preachers that we Read of in the Scriptures, none was ſo frequent in warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People to avoid Hell, as JESUS CHRIST; He was often telling them of their Danger, and perſwading them, if it were poſſible, to avoid Damnation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times He tells them, That <hi>the Chaffe ſhall be burnt up with unquenchable Fire;</hi> Sometimes that it is better to enter into Life with one Eye, man <hi>having two Eyes to be caſt into Hell-Fire:</hi> Sometimes of their being caſt into a <hi>Furnace of Fire, where there is Wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Sometimes he asks the <hi>Scribes</hi> how they could eſcape <hi>the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hell?</hi> Sometimes He minds His hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Sentence that ſhall be pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

on the Wicked at laſt, viz. <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> From hence we may learn, That the Conſideration of the Pains of Hell, is ſingularly Uſeful for the promoting of Holineſs, and it would be greatly beneficial to carnal Men, if they had more of the fear of Hell; it would make them more Solemn, more Prayerful, more looſe from worldly Enjoyments, and more cautious how they did behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And it would be a great benefit to godly Men, if they had more of the fear of Hell; it would help them againſt a Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and Slumbering Spirit, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Hearts againſt many Temptations that they are wont to be outbid by. Job 31.33. <hi>Deſtruction from God was a Terrour to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It would be a great benefit to Parents.</hi> One of the great Miſeries of the Land is, That <hi>Children are not well educated;</hi> they are bred up to Work, but are not well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed: Parents don't teach them, warn them, govern them, give good Examples to them: Hence many Children are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and Rude, and Prophane. This Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs brings many Parents to eternal
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001651_0015_0FB4D62EC5CED4E8"/>
Ruine, and their Indulgence is the cauſe of the Damnation of their Children. <hi>Eli's</hi> Indulgence had an influence into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas.</hi> If Parents were more careful that they might <hi>not go to Hell themſelves,</hi> they would be more La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious in teaching their Children, and in <hi>bringing them up in the Nurture and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord;</hi> and if they were more careful that their Children might not go to Hell, they would not connive at their Sins, and countenance them in their World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Pride; they would warn them more ſolemnly, reſtrain and govern them more throughly. Prov. 23.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt beat him with the Rod, and deliver his Soul from Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It would be a great benefit to Miniſters.</hi> Miniſters may fail of their Duty many ways, in not convincing Men of their Sins, not ſetting ſufficient Light before them for their Conviction; in not bearing a due Teſtimony againſt their Iniquities; in not ſearching Men throughly whether they be in Jeſus Chriſt, ſuffering them to deceive themſelves with falſe Imaginations of Peace with God, by complying with the Sins of the Land, by Preaching like the <hi>Scribes</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:001651_0016_0FB4D630459F2DB0"/>
without Authority. But if they had a ſenſe of the dreadfulneſs of Damnation, and a due care of their own Salvation, and the Salvation of their People, they would be more thorow in their Work. <hi>Paul</hi> urges <hi>Timothy</hi> by this Conſideration: 1 Tim. 4.16. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf and to thy Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them, for in ſo doing, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and thoſe that hear thee.</hi> A ſenſe of the Terrour of the Lord would be a great help to them. 2 Cor. 5.11. <hi>Knowing the Terrours of the Lord, we perſwade Men.</hi> The ſolemn Thoughts of this would make them careful of their Preaching, and their Example. 1 Cor. 9.27. <hi>Leſt by any means when I have Preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It would be a great benefit to Rulers.</hi> It is a rare thing that God is provoked with a People, but the Rulers have ſome Hand in it. Rulers may miſs it many ways: When in their private Converſation they are not good Examples, that emboldens other Men to Tranſgreſs. They may miſs it by being backward to promote Religion, when they are <hi>Gallio</hi> like, <hi>Not caring for thoſe things.</hi> When they don't ſtrengthen the Hands of Under-Officers, by not mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001651_0017_0FB4D631C7669F70"/>
uſe of their Information, ſuffering things to drop without due Examination. They may be very Faulty by not puniſhing Vice duly, having an indulgent Spirit towards thoſe that are guilty of Miſdemeaners; by not ſtating the Caſe right unto the Jury, ſpeaking in favour of thoſe whoſe Caſe is naught, by not cutting of the occaſions of Sin. Where there is much Temptation, there will be much Provocation, by being intimate with Men of vicious Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This is a diſcredit to them, a way to harden diſſolute Perſons. It is <hi>very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Rulers to have a cautious fear of Hell.</hi> They that Judge others muſt be judged: They that ſit upon the Bench muſt ſtand at the Bar; all acts of Judgment muſt be called over again, and have a ſecond Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is good for them that ſit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to remember the Day, wherein they muſt appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt: It is good for them to ask that Queſtion, Job 31.14. <hi>What ſhall I do when God riſeth up? and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It would be a great benefit to Under-Officers.</hi> The Work of ſome Under-Officers is, To inform themſelves of the breaches
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001651_0018_0FB4D6334686CAA8"/>
of Law, and to give Information to Rulers. They may fail of their Duty by neglecting to get Knowledge, leſt they ſhould be counted Buſie-bodies; and by neglecting to give Information, either from Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or from Fear, or to prevent Trouble. There be other Under-Officers who are to judge in Cauſes Civil and Criminal. Their Work is to give a <hi>Verdict;</hi> a <hi>Verdict</hi> is <hi>Verumdictum,</hi> a true Sentence: And though they are under a neceſſity to bring in a Verdict, yet they are in no Snare, to act againſt their Conſciences. If they be all of a Mind, their way is fair; if they can't be all of a Mind, they muſt in <hi>Civil</hi> Caſes bring in for the <hi>Defendant:</hi> In <hi>Criminal</hi> they muſt bring in <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> for thoſe are Negative Verdicts: The meaning is, They can't agree to give the Caſe to the <hi>Plantiff,</hi> or to <hi>Condemn the Priſoner.</hi> But theſe Men may fail much, when ſome for qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs do comply with the Judgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againſt their own Light: So likewiſe when they bring in a <hi>wrong Verdict,</hi> from <hi>Friendſhip</hi> or <hi>Bribery,</hi> or <hi>Credulity,</hi> depending on the Infallibility of the <hi>Lawyer</hi> that Pleads the Caſe, it would be very Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for theſe Men to remember the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001651_0019_0FB4D6382824EAA0"/>
of the laſt Day, and the Puniſhment that will be inflicted on ungodly Men. Under-Officers may bring a Wo upon themſelves, Iſa. 10.1. Under-Officers may prevent much Injuſtice, Joh. 7.46.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It would be a great benefit to Buyers and Sellers.</hi> There is abundance of Iniquity in <hi>Sellers;</hi> as when they put off that which is not Merchantable. Am. 8.6. <hi>They ſell the refuſe of the Wheat.</hi> So when they take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of Men, to exact unreaſonably from them, when they go beyond the bounds of Truth, in commending what they would Sell, or in telling what it ſtands them in. There is alſo abundance of Iniquity in <hi>Buyers,</hi> in running down the worth of what they would Purchaſe, in telling that they have bought much Cheaper, and that they know they ſhall looſe by it. Prov. 20.14. <hi>It is naught, it is naught, ſaith the Buyer: but when he goeth away, he Boaſteth.</hi> Some not paying faithfully: Sometimes they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe what they cannot ſee their way to perform.

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001651_0020_0FB4D639462787F0"/>
in the very act of Trading. If theſe Men were <hi>afraid of Hell,</hi> they would quickly <hi>leave off ſuch Methods:</hi> Were they ſenſible what it is to be Damned, they would not lie upon the Catch, and be ſo injurious one unto another. They ſhould remember, <hi>That their Gains will eat their Fleſh as Fire,</hi> Jam. 5.3.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It would be a great Benefit to young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> Many young Perſons take a licentious Liberty; ſome of them give way to a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Spirit; they addict themſelves to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, don't attend Family Orders, ſpend the Sabbath in a Prophane way; they are devoted to their Pride, give themſelves up to Mirth and Jollitry, and neglect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Salvation. The Counſels of Parents, and warnings of Teachers don't ſink into their Hearts; they hate to live a Moping Melancholy Life, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their Sins, and crying to God for Pardon; but if they were <hi>afraid of Hell,</hi> that would make a mighty change in their Carriage, a ſenſe of <hi>Hell-Fire</hi> would ſoon ſcare them out of thoſe Humours; they would not dare to do what now they are bold to do; they would have no Heart to proſecute their carnal Deſigns; they would
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001651_0021_0FB4D63AC5E60280"/>
be deaf to Temptations; no Arguments would prevail with them, they would as ſoon be perſwaded to handle an Iron burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, as to practiſe their former Ways: They would be ſoon weaned from the World, and take up the Practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Ecl. 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce, O young Man in thy Youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth, and walk in the ways of thy Heart, and in the ſight of thine Eyes, but know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 USE. <hi>Of Exhortation, to be afraid of Hell.</hi> Man is a frightful Creature, apt to be afraid of many little Evils, yet by reaſon of Sin, Men are ſo hard-hearted, that they are not much afraid of Hell. Chriſt Jeſus directs us to be afraid of Hell, Mat. 10.28. <hi>Fear him that can caſt both Body and Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell.</hi> Eſpecially thoſe that are in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Eſtate, have reaſon to be afraid of Hell. Iſa. 33.14. <hi>Sinners in Zion are afraid, Trembling takes hold of Hypocrites: who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us can dwell with devouring Fire? who among us can dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</hi> Some Men are much to blame, that they put away the fear of Hell; they ſhun and avoid it what they can, but conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001651_0022_0FB4D63C462EFA30"/>
whether you have not abundant cauſe to fear Hell.</p>
            <p>Conſider two Things. 1. <hi>The Miſeries of Hell will be exceeding great.</hi> The Miſeries that have been indured by ſome in this World, have been amazing: It is hard to grapple with the hearing of them, and it muſt be much harder to bear them; but the Miſeries of Hell are far greater. Heb. 10.31. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</hi> The Appoſtle ſpeaking of the Glory of Heaven, calls it, <hi>A far more Exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.17. So we may ſay of the Miſery of Hell, it is, <hi>A far more Exceeding and Eternal weight of Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mind here theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Perſons will be in Diſtreſs, they reſt not Day nor Night;</hi> their Miſery will be overbearing to them; there will be no room for any Comforts; they will have no eaſe to Comfort them; they will have no hope to Comfort them; they will have no peace of Conſcience to Comfort them; they will wiſh they had not been, they will wiſh they could ceaſe to be; their former Enjoyments will be no Refreſhment to them; their Companions in Miſery will be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001651_0023_0FB4D63E85D0D4A0"/>
they muſt endure ſutable Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for all their Rebellions, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that they have caſt upon God, they will be ſtanding Monuments of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Heaven. Rom. 2.8, 9. <hi>God will render Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh.</hi> If their Strength were the Strength of Stones, or their Fleſh of Braſs, they could not endure their Miſery. They will have <hi>Anguiſh of Spirit,</hi> not know what in the World to do; there will be dreadful Wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mat. 13.42. They will lament their Sins, they will bewail the loſs of Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; they will condemn their Folly, they will curſe themſelves, they will wiſh they had never ſeen ſuch things as now their Hearts dote upon; their cry will go up to Heaven; they will wiſh they had no Senſes; their Hearing and Seeing and Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be their Miſery, their Memory, their Underſtanding, their Conſcience will be their Torment; they will wiſh they had no Bodies, and wiſh they had no Souls, their <hi>Bodies and Souls will be Veſſels of Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe Miſeries are ſet forth by doleful Compariſons.</hi> No Compariſon can fully ſet forth the Miſeries of Hell, becauſe thoſe Miſeries do exceed all others; but ſome
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001651_0024_0FB4D64329D077C0"/>
other Miſeries may in an affecting manner repreſent to us, ſomewhat of the Miſeries of Hell. Hell is compared to a <hi>Dark Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> Mat. 8.12. The Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt <hi>into outer Darkneſs.</hi> So Jud. 13. we read, <hi>That the Blackneſs of Darkneſs is reſerved for ungodly Men. Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> the Prophet was in a ſorrowful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when caſt into the <hi>Dungeon:</hi> It was a dark miry Hole, for <hi>he ſunk in the Mire,</hi> Jer. 38.6. When Perſons are in a Dungeon, they are confined, and have no Liberty; it is always dark and black Night, they are cut of from all pleaſant Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they dwell in the ſhadow of Death. A <hi>Dungeon</hi> is next to a <hi>Grave;</hi> there the Light is as Darkneſs. Again, it is compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Sodom,</hi> when it was <hi>all on a light Fire.</hi> Rev. 21.8. <hi>They ſhall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> The People were in a miſerable Condition, when ſtreams of Fire and Brimſtone fell from Heaven upon their Houſes, and upon their Ground, and upon their Bodies, Men, Women, Children, all like <hi>light Torches,</hi> their Bodies blazed, how did they Scream out and Roar in that Extremity? So Hell is compared to the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001651_0025_0FB4D644865477D8"/>
               <hi>Valley of the Son of Hinnom,</hi> where they <hi>burnt their Children to Moleck.</hi> Hence Hell is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gehenna,</hi> the <hi>Land of Hinnom.</hi> Mat. 5.29. So it is ſet forth by <hi>Tophet,</hi> Iſa. 30.33. which was the ſame Place. There they burnt them as Sacrifices to the Devil, and made a noiſe with Trumpets and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, that they might drown the noiſe of the Cryes of the poor Children, they could not bear their Roarings. Hell is worſe than all theſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whatever the Miſeries in Hell be, they will be Eternal.</hi> Theſe Miſeries will never have an End: Life will have an End, this and that Kingdom will have an End; the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> had an End; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Jews</hi> will have an End, and the World will have an End. Mat. 25.36. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Mar. 9.44. There the <hi>Worm dyeth not,</hi> there the <hi>Fire is not quenched.</hi> The duration of their Miſery cannot be meaſured: We may meaſure the breadth of the Earth, and the circuit of the Heaven, but can't mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Eternity. Add Thouſands to Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and multiply Millions by Millions; fill Quires of Paper with Numbers, and you can't meaſure Eternity: It cannot be
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001651_0026_0FB4D64605C27CC0"/>
divided into Days, or Years, or Ages; make never ſo many Parts of it, one will be Eternal: When Men have ſuffered ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo long, there is an Eternity remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It don't grow ſhorter and ſhorter. This makes every part of their Miſery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, their Pain will be Infinite, the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Infinite. If Miſeries End, there is an opporttunity for Comfort afterwards; but Eternity cuts off opportunities for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: Men may well ſay, <hi>Who can dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>It is a difficult thing to eſcape Hell.</hi> It may be avoided, and there be a number of Men that do eſcape it, but they are but few. It is a difficult thing to bear Damnation, and a difficult thing to attain Salvation. God has made a way to eſcape, but very few will comply with it. It is very croſs to Nature; it ſuits the Glory of God, but it don't ſuit Men's Humours. Math. 7.14. <hi>Few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Many that take Pains to eſcape it do not.</hi> Many Men make attempts to eſcape it, but are not ſucceſsful. Men are like Priſoners bound with Chains and cannot make their eſcape themſelves. Many went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> that never reached <hi>Canaan.</hi> Some that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001651_0027_0FB4D64785DA2B40"/>
to eſcape, meet with Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Difficulties, and are diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they are ſcared with the <hi>Anakims</hi> and high Walls, and grow Heartleſs. Some of them get into a wrong way, they get a dead Faith and Hope, that that will ſerve their turn: They have ſamewhat like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and take it to be Converſion; it paſſes among Men, and they hope it will ſtand when they appear before God. They have got a Righteouſneſs, but it doth not exceed the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Some others there be, that after they have put away their Sins, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Lives, do return to their Vomit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſome go on ſeeking till they are ſurprized with Death. Death comes upon them before they have got through their Work: There is great odds in the number of them that ſeek, and of them that find. Luk. 13.24. <hi>Many ſeek, and are not able to enter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Many that think they have eſcaped it, will not.</hi> Many Men are Ignorant, Raſh and Fooliſh, and ſo not very capable to paſs Judgment on themſelves; their Judgment is worth very little in an hundred other Caſes: But indeed wiſe Men may eaſily be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001651_0028_0FB4D64905E47410"/>
deceived; partly becauſe of the ſimilitude that is between falſe Grace and true. I have read of a Painter, that pictured <hi>Grapes</hi> ſo exactly, that the Birds were deceived by them, and took them for real <hi>Grapes.</hi> There is indeed a great difference between true <hi>Grace</hi> and falſe; but there is alſo ſuch a ſimilitude, that wiſe Men may be miſtaken. Men are frequently miſtaken in Silver and in Jewels, ſo if they look upon Perſons at a diſtance, they are eaſily miſtaken in them; ſo eſpecially when they look upon religious Actions that have been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed formerly. One great thing that expoſes Men to judge amiſs is, That they are ſome way or other Prejudicate; partly from Pride, partly from Fear, partly from love of Eaſe, partly from a dependance on the Opinion of others, and many are deceived. Prov. 30.12. <hi>There is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, yet are not cleanſed from their Filthineſs.</hi> Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt thou art Rich, and increaſed in Goods, and haſt need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art Poor, and Miſerable, and Wretched, and Blind, and Naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Many whom the World bleſſes, as if they would eſcape it, will not.</hi> Men are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petant
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001651_0029_0FB4D64C06394300"/>
Judges of others: Men may have Foundation enough for <hi>a judgment of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> but they have no Foundation for <hi>a judgment of Certainty.</hi> Men may be very Cenſorious of real Saints, as <hi>Job's</hi> Friends were; they may judge hardly of Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Infirmities, and becauſe of their own Prejudices. So many have the Reputation of Saints, that are not Saints. Rev. 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt, and art dead.</hi> Men have nothing but Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things to judge by, which are ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Grace. Sometimes they take Gifts for Grace; but many have the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> that have not the <hi>Spirit of Prayer.</hi> Sometimes Men take <hi>Common Grace</hi> for <hi>Special.</hi> Zeal and Affection may be in Men deſtitute of Grace. Sometimes they take a Religious Converſation for an Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: All that they judge by, are but probable Signs, and twenty Probabilities will not make a thing Certain. Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities may make a thing legally Certain, but not Infallibly ſo. Where there be but Probabilities, there is a poſſibility of the contrary. Many Probabilities make a thing more Probable, but they do not amount to a Demonſtration. Some of the wiſeſt of

            <p>THIS is a Text Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preached upon at <hi>Nazereth,</hi> which was the Place of His Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It is taken from Iſai. 61.1, 2. where there is but little Variation as to the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001651_0032_0FB4D65085B51710"/>
Words, but a great agreement as to the Intendment of them. The Sermon that Chriſt preached is not upon Record; but we have the <hi>Preface,</hi> V. 21. <hi>This Day is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears,</hi> which gives us ſome Light, and ſhews us that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy doth relate unto himſelf. In theſe Words is a Prediction of the Spirit's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is meant by the Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>The Third Perſon in the Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God, Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt are one and the ſame ſpiritual Subſtance. But here the Third Perſon is underſtood. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times He is called the <hi>Spirit of the living God.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.3. Sometimes the <hi>Spirit.</hi> 1 Joh. 32. <hi>I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from Heaven.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 1.19. <hi>The ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Eph. 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Spirit of Grace.</hi> Heb. 10. <hi>And have done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to the Spirit of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why is the Spirit ſaid to be upon Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>It is all one as if the Spirit was ſaid to be in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Expreſſion we have, 2 Kin. 2.15. <hi>The Spirit of Elijah doth reſt on Eliſha.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001651_0033_0FB4D653864EA790"/>
And Iſai. 11.2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon Him.</hi> It may have a reſpect to the Spirit's viſible deſcending on Him. Math. 3.16. <hi>He ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is amplyfied by the Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe the Lord hath anointed me.</hi> The Prieſts were ſeperated to their Office by this Ceremony, Lev. 8.12. <hi>He poured of the anointing Oyl up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Aaron's Head, and anointed him to ſanctify him.</hi> So the meaning is, That God had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated and ordained him to this Office, to Preach the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>Miniſters had need have the Spirit of the Lord upon them, in order to the reviving of Religion among his People.</hi> There are ſome times of Degeneracy and Declenſion in the Church. Sometimes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths are in a languiſhing way. Sometimes the Eſtates of a People are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Decay. So, ſometimes Religion is in a withering Condition; but there are means that are ſerviceable for the reviving of it: And this is one ſpecial means, when the Miniſters have the Spirit of the Lord upon them. The Spirit of the Lord muſt be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon the People, elſe Religion will not revive. But when the Spirit is upon
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001651_0034_0FB4D65587F95DD8"/>
Miniſters, it is a very hopeful Sign. Mal. 4.5, 6. <hi>I will ſend you Elijah the Prophet, and he ſhall turn the Heart of the Fathers to the Children, and the Heart of the Children to their Fathers, leſt I come and ſmite the Earth with a Curſe.</hi> This was accompliſhed when God ſent <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who was filled with the Holy Ghoſt. So after the Apoſtles were filled with the Spirit, much was done by their Miniſtry, for the advancing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Spirit's being upon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, conduce to the reviving of Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Two Ways</hi> eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Spirit gives them a Zeal for God's Glory, and the Salvation of Souls.</hi> When the Spirit of God is upon them they will be much concerned for God's Glory. So it was with <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kin. 19.10. <hi>I have been very Zealous for the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> They will not be indifferent whether God's Kingdom flouriſh or not; their Hearts will not be upon the World, but their Hearts will be engaged for God's Honour, So for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mens Souls. They will take a great deal of Care that their Hearers do not Periſh. 1 Cor. 10.33. <hi>Not ſeeking my own Profit, but the Profit of many that they
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001651_0035_0FB4D6568580C488"/>
may be ſaved.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>I have made my ſelf a Servant to all, that I may gain the more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am made all things to all Men, that by all means I may ſave ſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby they are diſpoſed to Study and Preach ſuch things as do eſpecially tend to the reviving of Religion.</hi> There be ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Truths, that in their Seaſon muſt be ſtudied and Preached. Miniſters muſt not decline to Preach the whole Counſel of God; no part of the Word of God is in Vain. But when they are zealous for God's Honour and Mens Salvation, they will ſet themſelves to revive Religion; they will dwell upon thoſe things that do more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to the furtherance of Mens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Such things as will take with the Conſciences of Men. Ecl. 12.10. <hi>The Preacher ſought to find out acceptable Words.</hi> They will conſider the Neceſſities of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtrive to relieve them. So it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 20.21. <hi>Teſtifying both to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks, Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> The Corruptions of the Land will ſtir up their Spirit. Act. 17.16. <hi>While Paul waited for them at Athens, his Spirit was ſtirred in him, when he ſaw the City wholly given to Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:001651_0036_0FB4D65807DCAA30"/>2. <hi>Hereby they are prepared to declare the Word of God Powerfully.</hi> The Word of God is as an Hammer, and Men muſt ſmite with Strength to make the Nail Enter, or the Rock to Break. If the Word of God be preached in a dull dead Way, it is not like to have much Efficacy. Men will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to think that the Preacher himſelf don't believe it, or that he lays no great weight upon it. But when they have an holy Zeal, that makes them to be <hi>Boanerges, Sons of Thunder,</hi> they will be earneſt and fervent. That was the Commendation of <hi>Appollos, That he was fervent in Spirit.</hi> Act. 18.25. So Chriſt taught. Math. 7.29. <hi>He taught as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi> And this made his Doctrine the more Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting. <hi>V.</hi> 28. <hi>The People were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine.</hi> This was foretold of Chriſt. Mic. 5.4. <hi>He ſhall tread and feed in the ſtrength of the Lord, in the Majeſty of the Name of the Lord his God.</hi> Zeal will inflame the Heart, and make Men declare the Word of God, ſo as to awaken others, and not lull them to ſleep. Such Men will ſpeak in the heat of their Spirits. When Men are ſenſible of the breaking out of Fire, or the approach of Enemies, they will cry out
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001651_0037_0FB4D65B8F57F2B0"/>
earneſtly. So the Prophet directed, Iſai. 58.1. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew my People their Tranſgreſſion, and the Houſe of Jacob their Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hereby they are filled with Courage to diſpenſe the Word of God faithfully.</hi> There is danger that ſome Men will be provoked, if they be told plainly of their Sins, if their Confidences be ſhaken, and they be dealt plainly with. And if Miniſters have not a Spirit of Zeal, they will be in danger to neglect ſpeaking what they ſhould; be apt to ſpeak too tenderly: But if they have a Spirit of Zeal, that will make them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Jer. 20.9. <hi>His Word was in my Heart as a burning Fire, ſhut up in my Bones, I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay.</hi> They ought to ſpeak whether Men will hear or not. Ezeck. 2.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak my Words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</hi> And Zeal will make Men faithful, though others be angry. Act. 2.36. <hi>Let all the Houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made this ſame Jeſus whom ye crucified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> Zeal ſtrengthens the Heart againſt Fear. So the Prophet dealt plainly with <hi>Aſa,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> with <hi>Herod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:001651_0038_0FB4D65C85FEA718"/>2. <hi>If the Spirit be upon Miniſters, that gives them Underſtanding and Wiſdom for their Work.</hi> The Spirit of God makes them Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, buſie in Reading and Meditating, and thereby they get Underſtanding. The Spirit ſuggeſts ſuitable Thoughts to them, and thereby they get Underſtanding. The Spirit of God opens their Eyes, gives ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Diſcoveries to them, and thereby they get Underſtanding. All Wiſdom comes from God. Men are led by the Spirit into the conſideration of Providences, and ſo they get a great deal of Experience. God gave <hi>Solomon</hi> Wiſdom in a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Way; and he hath his Ways to give Wiſdom to Men for their Work that he calls them to. It was foretold concerning Chriſt, That God would give Wiſdom to Him. Iſai. 11.23. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord, and ſhall make him of quick Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the fear of the Lord.</hi> God by his Spirit, furniſhes Men with Knowledge to be Serviceable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby he makes them able to diſcover Mens Iniquities to them.</hi> Many Men practiſe
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001651_0039_0FB4D65E075B2DC0"/>
Things that are Evil, under a Notion of Liberty. Through Cuſtome, and carnal Reaſon, and their dependance upon the Judgment of others, they ſtand in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſinful Ways; they have a great deal to ſay in the Vindication of them, and ſome times don't ſuſpect them to be Evil: But God by giving Underſtanding to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, doth inable them to lay convincing Light before them, and make it plain from the Word of God, that thoſe Ways are Evil. That is required of Miniſters, that they do <hi>convince Gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. So Chriſt Jeſus lay'd abundance of Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to ſhew them their Iniquities. And <hi>Paul</hi> laid abundance of Light before the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to ſhew them their Vanity and Sin in Worſhipping of Idols. And <hi>Apollos</hi> laid Light before the <hi>Jews,</hi> to convince of their Sin in rejecting Chriſt. Act. 18.28. <hi>He mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, ſhewing by the Scriptures, that Jeſus was Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hereby they are made able to ſpeak Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the Conſciences of Sinners.</hi> If the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men be terrified, that makes way for their Converſion. Terrour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience makes way for Mens coming to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001651_0040_0FB4D65F89271FD8"/>
Chriſt. Gal. 3 24. <hi>The Law was our School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, to bring us to Chriſt.</hi> And the Spirit of God, by giving them Underſtanding, fits them for this Work, thereby they are inabled to repreſent in an affecting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the dreadful Miſeries that Sinners are in danger of. So did <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and the People of the <hi>Publicans,</hi> and the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> were much affected, and enquired what they muſt do. Luk. 2.10, 12, 14. Miniſters hereby are inabled to find out ſeveral Conſiderations to evidence to Men, the certainty of their Ruine, if they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a natural Condition; and to ſhew the truth of that, Mat. 5.18. <hi>That not one jot or tittle ſhall paſs from the Law, but all ſhall be fulfilled.</hi> And they are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men what danger there is that they will never be Converted: To lay open the wretchedneſs of the Heart, and its mighty Oppoſition to the Goſpel, the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Satan to Seduce; the many by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths that Men are wont to take; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of God's giving Repentance to them, as the Apoſtle teaches, 2 Tim. 2.25. <hi>If peradventure God will give Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:001651_0041_0FB4D661056AB800"/>3. <hi>Hereby they are able to diſcover to Men, the Deceits of their Hearts.</hi> Man's Heart is full of Deceit. Jer. 17.9. <hi>The Heart is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and deſperately Wicked, who can know it?</hi> Men are wont to make plauſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for their Sins. They have many Things to ſay in way of Apology for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, excuſing their Sins. They pretend that they are willing to know their own Hearts. They pretend that they do ſee their own Inſufficiency. They pretend Love to God, and Faith in Jeſus Chriſt: But God by his Spirit, inables Miniſters ſo to lay open the Deceitfulneſs of their Hearts, that they are brought to know themſelves. If Men could hold their Deceits, they would live and die in Hypocriſy: But God helps Miniſters to unravel their Hearts, and ſo he leads them into an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves. 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Warfare are not Carnal, but Mighty through God, to the pulling down of Strong Holds.</hi> Heb. 4.12. <hi>The Word of God is quick, and powerful, ſharper than any two-edged-Sword, dividing aſunder Soul and Spirit, Joints and Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:001651_0042_0FB4D664074DB870"/>4. <hi>Hereby they are made able to direct them in the right Way.</hi> Men that are diſtreſſed in Conſcience, are many times at an utter Loſs what to do; and are prone to run into By-paths, and take very improper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for their help. They are contriving in what way to get Pardon and Grace; and they would undo themſelves, but God by his Spirit, helps Miniſters to guide them in the right Way. Mal. 2.7. <hi>The Prieſts Lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth.</hi> Miniſters are to be their Guide. It is their Work to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, that they may not quench the Motions of the Spirit; to direct them that they may not grow Secure, that they may not ſettle on their own Righteouſneſs; that they may not get a falſe Faith; that they may not be diſcouraged; that they may have no Prejudices againſt God and his Ways, that the Work may be haſtned, and that they may be led to Chriſt. <hi>Samuel</hi> tells the People, That he will <hi>teach them the good and the right Way.</hi> 1 Sam. 12.23. So when God gives the Spirit to his Miniſters, they are fitted to lead Sinners in the right Way to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:001651_0043_0FB4D665858ECE48"/>1 Reaſon. <hi>Men are ſo Blind and Corrupt, that it is very difficult to Work upon them.</hi> Men by Nature are in Darkneſs. Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou art Blind.</hi> They have wholly loſt their ſpiritual Sight, and their natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is very defective: It is very ſlow to conceive of thoſe things that it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of. Men are ſubject to abundance of Deluſion; they are under the prevailing of carnal Reaſonings, eaſily deceived with Appearances and Shews, ſubject to flatter themſelves; they become <hi>Vain in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and their fooliſh Hearts are Darkned.</hi> Rom. 1.21. And through Heedleſſneſs and Forgetfullneſs, they are very Ignorant of what they might know. Tit. 1.15. <hi>Their Mind and Conſcience are defiled,</hi> and the Hearts of Men are very much depraved. They are violently ſet upon their carnal Intereſts. Jer. 50.38. <hi>They are mad on their Idols.</hi> They are exceedingly addicted to the Love of the World: They are ſet for Profit, and Pleaſure, and Honour: Their buſineſs is to advance their own Intereſt. They can't endure to Reform their Lives. They ſay as Jer. 2.25. <hi>They have followed after Idols, and after them they will go.</hi> They are full of Enmity to God and his Ways.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001651_0044_0FB4D6679FB5C470"/>
Rom. 8.7. <hi>The natural Mind is Enmity to God, is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Hence, if they have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Means, ordinarily they take very little Impreſſion. Men that are faſt aſleep, will not be awakened with a little Noiſe. More gentle Means will not do with naughty Children. Small Blows will not break a Rock; gentle Phyſick will not do for a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Diſeaſe. If Miniſters be Ignorant and Sluggiſh, there is little likelihood that much Good will be wrought.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reaſon. <hi>Yet Men have ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and ſelf Love, that it is difficult to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand powerful Means.</hi> Though ſinful Men are like the Beaſts that Periſh, yet they are not Beaſts. They have a Conſcience in them, and that tells them that there is a God that made Heaven and Earth; that he is to be ſerved; that his Anger is Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and that his Word muſt needs be true. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhewed, That <hi>the Work of the Law was written in their Hearts.</hi> Rom. 2.15. And they have likewiſe a principle of ſelf Love in them; they are craving Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Pſal 4.6. <hi>Who will ſhew us any Good?</hi> They dread Miſery, and abhor Deſtruction. From theſe two Principles they are capable
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001651_0045_0FB4D6688576B268"/>
to be wrought upon. When the Wrath of God is ſet before them in a lively Manner, their Conſciences will echo to it. This rouſes up thoſe ſparks of Light that are in Conſcience, and Conſcience adds its Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. Hence the Men are afraid, they Tremble leſt God ſhould execute Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them; they would fain get their Sins Pardoned. When they hear the clear Reaſonings, and powerful Diſpenſations of the Word, thay cannot but fear: And they think, What ſhall they be profited, if they ſhould get the whole World, and looſe their own Soul? So when they hear ſearching Preaching, that leads Conſcience into the Examination of their Hearts and Ways, and puts them upon it to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the power of Godlineſs. A Workman may bring rude Timber into Form. A Skilful Phyſitian may be a means to remove a ſtubborn Diſeaſe. Dull Conſciences may be frighted: Proper Means may by God's Bleſſing, revive Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1 USE. <hi>The Caſe of the Chriſtian World is very Sorrowful.</hi> A great part of the World makes a Profeſſion of Chriſt; but there is little ſincere Religion; very little of the power of Godlineſs: And it may be ſaid,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001651_0046_0FB4D66B860A6AD0"/>
not of ſome particular Perſons only, but of ſome Nations, as Rev. 3.1. <hi>They have a Name that they Live, but are Dead.</hi> There be great Pretences to Religion, but God is but little honoured, and few Souls are ſaved. Religion doth not flouriſh in many Places, for the Miniſters have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some are Heretical.</hi> There were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Hereſies in the Days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and there be many in theſe Days. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold Juſtification by Works, that it is lawful to have Images in Worſhip: That the <hi>Pope</hi> is Infallible, and has power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>bleſſed Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt, and that He bore the Curſe for us.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> hold <hi>univerſal Redemption, Election from Faith foreſeen,</hi> the <hi>Power of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> and <hi>falling from Grace.</hi> And they be Miniſters eſpecially that do propogate theſe Opinions, and beguile Ignorant Men. They pervert the Scripture, and wreſt it to their own Deſtruction, and the Deſtruction of many others. Learned Men are the great Seducers that promote damnable Hereſies. Theſe Men hinder the flouriſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>They Increaſe unto more Ungodlineſs.</hi>

2 Tim. 2.16. Men are <hi>led Captive by them.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Some are wicked Livers.</hi> They that ſhould teach others to keep the Law of God, break it themſelves. So it was with <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas.</hi> 1 Sam. 2.22. <hi>They lay with the Women that aſſembled at the Door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation.</hi> So it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Iſai. 43.27. <hi>Thy Teachers have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt me.</hi> So the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> under the pretence of <hi>long Prayers,</hi> did <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Widdows Houſes.</hi> Math. 23.14. And ſo it is at this Day, in many Places of the Chriſtian World. Many that ſhould lead Men to Heaven, are guilty of debauched Practices: They are <hi>Swearers, Drunkards, Unclean,</hi> and <hi>Prophaners of the Sabbath.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not like to flouriſh under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſuch Men. Such Teachers take a Courſe to root Religion out of the Places where they Dwell. They that teach Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs by their Practices, are like to do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good by their Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Some are Ignorant,</hi> Many that are ſet up to Teach, have knowledge to Read, and that is in a manner, all the Learning that they have. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did not matter who he made to be Prieſts. So 'tis with many
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001651_0048_0FB4D66F459F1A28"/>
others. God complained of Old, of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Teachers. Iſai. 56.10. <hi>His Watchmen are Blind, they are all Ignorant.</hi> Men need a great deal of Knowledge, to be able to Inſtruct others. But ſome Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are Ignorant of the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; are not able to vindicate them. They are not verſed in the Scriptures. Theſe Men will be poor Helps to the Souls of others. Blindneſs is a very bad Property in a Guide. <hi>If the Blind lead the Blind, both will fall into the Ditch.</hi> Math. 15.14. When Teachers are Ignorant, <hi>the People will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed for lack of Knowledge.</hi> Hoſ. 4.6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Some want Experience.</hi> Some Miniſters have good Learning, a good Converſation, and Religious Affections, and ſo they may do ſome Good: They may be means to reſtrain ſome Men from Sin. Yea, they may be Inſtruments of Converſion; but ſuch a Miniſtry is not like to revive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in a Land as have not Experiences. The Condition of ſuch a Country is very Sorrowful. Jer. 2.8. <hi>They that handle the Law, know me not.</hi> It is a great Bleſſing, when People have ſuch Miniſters as are able <hi>to Comfort others with that Comfort, wherewith they themſelves have been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001651_0049_0FB4D67309666EE0"/>
of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4. Men that have had Experience of Temptation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief under them, of their own Hearts, and of Jeſus Chriſt, are moſt likely to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the reviving of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 USE <hi>of Direction to People, what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to chuſe.</hi> It is of great Concernment to have Religion revived. God uſeth great Means in order to it: He brings great Judgments and Calamities in order to it. But a ſpecial Means to obtain this, is, To have ſuch Miniſters as have the Spirit of God upon them. In <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> time, they did not care who were <hi>Prieſts.</hi> 2 Chron. 13.9. <hi>Whoſoever cometh to Conſecrate himſelf with a young Bullock, and ſeven Rams, the ſame may be a Prieſt of them that are no Gods.</hi> But if you deſire the flouriſhing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, get ſuch Men for Miniſters, that it may be ſaid of them, as God ſaid of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Numb. 27.18. <hi>Take Joſhua the Son of Nun, a Man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thine Hand upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a <hi>double Difficulty</hi> in this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some that are to Chuſe, don't regard this.</hi> In ſome Places the care of this Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>Patron;</hi> and many times ſuch have little Regard to Preſent thoſe that are
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001651_0050_0FB4D674858D6AD0"/>
fit for the Work: And where the People have a Liberty to chuſe, they are careleſs of making a good Choice. Some are <hi>Purſe-ridden,</hi> and don't matter who they have, ſo they can have him upon <hi>eaſy Terms. Micah</hi> got one on eaſy Terms, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf that he had a <hi>Levite to be his Prieſt.</hi> Judg. 17.13. Some love one that will <hi>Propheſy ſmooth Things,</hi> and nouriſh them in their vain Hopes of eternal Life. Iſai. 30.10. <hi>They ſay to the Seers, See not? and to the Prophets, Propheſie not right Things, ſpeak unto us ſmooth Things, Propheſie Deceits.</hi> Some would have one that is a <hi>chearly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</hi> Some would have one that would <hi>pleaſe their itching Ears.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.3. <hi>After their own Luſts they ſhall heap to themſelves Teachers having itching Ears.</hi> People that have but little Religion, are in danger to take up with Miniſters that have not the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Some don't know where to find them.</hi> Some would be glad to get ſuch an one, but they know not where to ſuit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We are not come to that paſs that is ſpoken of, Am. 8.11, 12. <hi>I will ſend a Famine in the Land; not a Famine of Bread, nor a Thirſt of Water, but of hearing the Word
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001651_0051_0FB4D67605754EF0"/>
of the Lord. And they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the Word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it.</hi> But yet there is no great plenty of ſuch Men as have the Spirit of God upon them. It is a Mercy that People may find thoſe that have good Learning, and that are Orthodox in their Principles, and of a good Converſation; but there be not many that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. People muſt take up with ſuch as they can get; that that is wanting can't be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
            <p n="3">3 USE <hi>of Exhortation, to Pray for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</hi> It is the Duty of Miniſters to Pray for the People; and it is the Duty of the People to Pray for their Miniſters. The Miniſters are bound by their Office, to Pray for the People; and the People are bound by their Intereſt to Pray for their Miniſters. When they Pray for their Miniſters, they Pray for themſelves. <hi>Moſes</hi> Prays for them, Deut. 33.8. <hi>Of Levi he ſaid, Let thy Thium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim and thy Urim be with thy holy One.</hi> We find <hi>Paul</hi> ſeveral times begging the Prayers of the Church. Eph. 6.18, 19. <hi>Praying with all manner of Prayer and Supplication, for all Saints; and for me, that Utterance may be
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001651_0052_0FB4D677884C38C8"/>
given to me, that I may open my Mouth boldly, to make known the Myſtery of the Goſpel.</hi> So 2 Theſ. 3.1. <hi>Finally Brethren, Pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free Courſe, and be glorified even as it is with you.</hi> Heb. 13.18. <hi>Pray for us.</hi> This ſhould move the People of God to Pray for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, becauſe if the Spirit reſt upon them, that is a Preparation for the reviving of Religion. It is a Burden to the Spirit of all godly Men, that there are ſuch decays of Religion; that few are Converted and that Iniquity doth ſo abound: And therefore you ſhould be longing after that, that it may revive again.</p>
            <p>Conſider 1. <hi>If Religion don't revive, the Country will become more Wicked.</hi> Pride and Wantonneſs, and Worldlineſs and Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do abound in the Land. There be many bad Examples; there is a great deal of the breaking out of Sin. In many Places they have a very ill Name on the account of their Iniquities. Many People <hi>do declare their Sin at Sodom, and hide it not.</hi> And how ſhall a ſtop be put to it, unleſs Religion do revive? unleſs Men be awakned and convinced? Ezek. 36.25, 26, 27. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean Water upon you, and you ſhall
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001651_0053_0FB4D67B230F2C88"/>
be Clean; from all your Filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you. A new Heart alſo will I give unto you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take this ſtony Heart out of your Fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh. And I will put my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes.</hi> Some think Family Government may put a ſtop to Sin. Some think the Zeal of Rulers, and Faithfulneſs of Officers may put a ſtop to Sin. But how ſhall theſe things be come at, if the Spirit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do not revive among us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If Religion don't revive, Multitudes will Periſh for ever.</hi> If Religion don't revive, how ſhall Men get to Heaven? The Form of Godlineſs will not bring Men to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Coming to Meeting, going to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, joining to Churches will not ſecure Salvation. What will become of the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the People of God, if Religion don't revive? Morality will not prepare Men for Dying. Joh. 3.3. <hi>Except a Man be Born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> If <hi>Men be Converted, their Sins will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi> Act. 3.19. But if they be not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, they will not be forgiven. Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Men are very Charitable to one
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001651_0054_0FB4D67C057602A0"/>
another, but they will go to Hell, Math. 8.12. <hi>The Children of the Kingdom ſhall go into outer Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If Religion do not revive, there will be great Judgments.</hi> We have had many ſour Calamities Year ofter Year; and there has been a great deal of Conſideration how to be delivered from the Wrath of God: And ſomething has been done for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wrath, but yet God's Anger is not turned away, but his Hand is ſtretched out ſtill. One Judgment is ſcarce over, before another comes. We Pray, we Faſt, make Laws, and diſpute about Reformation, but yet we are in Affliction, and the Hand of God goes out againſt us: And ſo it will, unleſs there be a reviving of Religion. Mal. 4.5, 6. <hi>He ſhall turn the Hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the Hearts of the Children to their Fathers, leſt I come and ſmite the Earth with a Curſe.</hi> The Curſe of hardneſs of Heart will not go alone: If God leave us to an hard Heart, that will be attended with other Curſes.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN theſe and the following Words, is ſet forth the Work that Chriſt was <hi>anointed</hi> for. Firſt to <hi>Preach the Goſpel to the Poor.</hi> Here mind, 1. <hi>What he was to Preach;</hi> that is, the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> it is <hi>good Tidings.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> Word ſignifies, ſo our Word <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſignifies. It comes from two <hi>Saxon</hi> Words. <hi>God,</hi> that ſignifies <hi>Good;</hi> and <hi>Spell,</hi> that ſignifies a <hi>Word.</hi> There be other good Tidings, but the Goſpel is ſo by way of Eminency. The Goſpel brings Tidings of the love of God to Men, and of a Glorious way of Reconciliation and Salvation. They are much to blame that ſlight the Goſpel, and reject it. They carry as if the Goſpel were not good Tidings. 2. <hi>To whom he was to Preach,</hi> viz. To the <hi>Poor.</hi> There be two ſorts of Poor. 1. They that are <hi>low in the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001651_0056_0FB4D67FC56B9A90"/>
World:</hi> That are deſtitute of Riches; and the Invitations of the Goſpel are ſent to them as well as others; and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, are more generally of that ſort. 1 Cor. 1.28. <hi>God hath choſen the baſe Things of the World, and Things that are deſpiſed.</hi> Jam. 2.5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> And Chriſt Jeſus principally preached to ſuch. Math. 11.5. <hi>The Poor have the Goſpel preached unto them.</hi> 2. Thoſe that are <hi>Poor in Spirit;</hi> that are ſenſible that they have nothing to purchaſe Heaven; that are ſenſible that they have <hi>no Money nor Price</hi> for their Salvation: And they are of two ſorts. 1. Such as <hi>are legally Poor.</hi> As they, Math. 11.28. <hi>That Labour and are heavy Laden:</hi> That are convinced of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of their Hearts, and that God may juſtly Condemn them. 2. Such as are <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically Poor in Spirit.</hi> Such as have the Grace of Humility, and live upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in Chriſt. Spoken of, Math. 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Thoſe that are called <hi>Poor</hi> here, are called <hi>Meek</hi> in Iſaiah, C. 60. V. 1. Their Hearts are meekned, either by Conviction or by Grace. I don't exclude

the Later, but it ſeems to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reſpect to the Former.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>The Goſpel is eſpecially to be preached to the Poor in Spirit: They are particularly to be invited.</hi> Conſider here theſe two Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Propoſition. <hi>The Goſpel is to be preached to all.</hi> Though there be no expectation that all will receive it, yet it is to be preached to all. Miniſters are not bound to Preach it to every one in the World, for that is impoſſible: But they are to Preach to all as they have Opportunity. They may not deſignedly hide the Goſpel from any. There be many Differences among Men, in reſpect of their Eſtates, Age, Covenant, Intereſt and Sinfulneſs: But the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is to be preached to them all. Chriſt did forbid his Diſciples to go into the Way of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or to enter into any City of the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Math. 10.5. But this was a temporary Command: But now the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is to be preached unto all. Mar. 16.15. <hi>Go into all the World, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> That is, every humane Creature. Act. 20.21. <hi>Teſtifying both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001651_0058_0FB4D68470BFDBC0"/>
Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 3.28. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> All are to be inſtructed in the Goſpel, and to be invited to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Reaſon. <hi>Becauſe the Promiſe is to all.</hi> There is a conditional Promiſe made to all that believe in Chriſt. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any that do believe in Chriſt. The Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven. But the conditional Promiſe is true of them, and no Man knows that he hath committed that Sin. The offer of the Goſpel is made to Men without any Exception. It is propounded in general Terms, ſo as to comprehend all. Act. 10.13 <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins.</hi> Men are ready to except themſelves, but God makes no Exceptions. Sometimes the Promiſe is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pounded In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely. Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life.</hi> But ſometimes it is propounded Univerſally; for there is no other Condition joined to this; and not only ſo, but the Notes of Univerſality are added to the Promiſe; as <hi>whoſoever.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>So all.</hi> Act. 13.39. And <hi>any.</hi> Rev. 3.20. And therefore it muſt be preached to all.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:001651_0059_0FB4D685C66E83D0"/>2 Reaſon. <hi>They that are not Poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, may receive Benefit by the Goſpel.</hi> The Goſpel is many Ways uſeful to make Men Poor in Spirit. Preparation for Chriſt is carried on by the Law and the Goſpel in Conjunction. When Men hear that there is a way of Salvation by Chriſt, that makes them more willing to ſee their Danger, and not altogether ſo oppoſite to receive Conviction. It encourages them to Pray to God to ſhew them their Miſery. When Men hear that Chriſt died for our Sins, that makes them ſenſible that God is very angry for Sin; that he will execute Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. This is an evidence of the Juſtice and Severity of God. Men may learn from thence, that Sin is a great Offence, and muſt be puniſhed. Luk. 23.31. <hi>If they do ſuch things in a green Tree, what ſhall be done in a dry?</hi> When Men hear, that <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son to ſuffer for them,</hi> that diſcovers the vile Nature of Sin, whereby Men abuſe a God of ſuch Grace. Pſal. 130.4. <hi>There is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> When Men hear that Chriſt hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the Curſe, that may convince them that their own Works can't ſave
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001651_0060_0FB4D687FA2D14E8"/>
them. Gal. 2.21. <hi>If Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is Dead in vain.</hi> When they hear the Command to believe in Chriſt, that convinces them, that though they be Civil and Religious, yet if they believe not, they are Rebellious, and in a miſerable Eſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Reaſon. <hi>Becauſe they that are not Poor in Spirit now, may be Poor in Spirit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> If Men hear the Goſpel, and don't make a right Uſe of it now, yet they will retain the Knowledge of it, and it may do them Service afterwards, though they be not ſenſible of their loſt Condition now; but are Senceleſs, and carnally Confident, yet they may be Poor in Spirit hereafter; and then what they have heard may come to Mind, and become powerful upon their Hearts. It may be, when they have not an opportunity to hear the Goſpel, they will call to Mind what they have heard ſome Years before, and ponder on what has been preached to them formerly. It is poſſible they may be made Poor in Spirit, when they are in Captivity among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Heathens.</hi> When they have no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to hear the Goſpel, or they may be made Poor in Spirit, when they lie upon
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001651_0061_0FB4D688C8D8FBF0"/>
a ſick Bed, and cannot hear the Word preached; and then what they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly heard, may work effectually on them. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> would not hearken to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> when they ſpake to him. 2 Chron. 33.10. But afterwards when he was a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Babylon,</hi> he remembred what he had been taught, and repented. <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>When he was in Affliction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Propoſition. <hi>The Goſpel is eſpecally to be preached to the Poor in Spirit.</hi> It is fit that Miniſters ſhould make particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the calls of the Goſpel to them. It is true, they may do ſo to young Men, to ancient Men and to great Sinners: But there is peculiar Reaſon to make particular Application to them that are <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi> Theſe Perſons are in a particular Manner invited in the Scripture. Iſai. 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that Thirſteth, come ye to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat, buy Wine and Milk without Money, and without Price.</hi> They are Thirſty that are parched up for want of ſomewhat to quench their Thirſt. The like we have, Math. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001651_0062_0FB4D68CB3D33258"/>
Weary and heavy Laden, and ye ſhall find Reſt for your Souls.</hi> They are Weary and heavy Laden that are oppreſſed with the weight of God's Wrath. So, Rev. 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come. And let him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt, Come: And whoſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</hi> God is here teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters to have a particular Regard to ſuch. The Invitations are not confined to theſe, but they are to be particulary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to theſe. Some others have ſpecial need to have the Terrours of the Law preached to them: But the Invitations of the Goſpel are eſpecially to be propounded to thoſe that are <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this, is, <hi>Not from any Excellency</hi> in this <hi>poverty of Spirit.</hi> There is nothing of Spiritual Goodneſs in this. It is indeed a reaſonable Thing; it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dictates of right Reaſon, but there is nothing of Piety or love to God, or godly Sorrow in it. It is a meer forced Thing, and accordingly it is not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God. The firſt good Act that is done by the Soul, is believing in Chriſt: And accordingly there is no Promiſe made in the Scripture to this legal Poverty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. No Man is under any Promiſe of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001651_0063_0FB4D68E05DB0218"/>
till he comes to Chriſt. It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God may give Grace to all thoſe that have this Poverty of Spirit; but there is no Promiſe in the Word that he will. Indeed there is an inconſiſtancy in it, that there ſhould be any Promiſe made to it. For when a Man is Poor in Spirit, he owns that it is in God's liberty to do with him as he pleaſes: And he continues ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in this Frame, and continues to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. But if there were any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Salvation to it, then after the firſt Act of Submiſſion, it would not be in Gods liberty to do with him as he pleaſed; but he would be bound to beſtow Grace upon him, and he might challenge and lay claim to Faith,</p>
            <p>But the reaſon is, Becauſe ſuch Men are <hi>prepared</hi> to receive the Goſpel. This Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Spirit brings Men near to Chriſt; ſo that it is very hopeful that they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him. The People of the <hi>Jews</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> to prepare them to receive the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Mar. 1.2. <hi>I ſend my Meſſenger before thy Face, to prepare thy Way before thee.</hi> So particular Souls need a Work of Preparation to make way for their accepting of Chriſt. So <hi>Paul</hi> was
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001651_0064_0FB4D690D5DCF068"/>
prepared. Act. 9.6. He Trembling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> So the <hi>Jailour,</hi> Act. 16.30. He ſaid, Sirs, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> And when Men are thrown out of their own Confidences, and made Poor in Spirit, now they are in a fair Way to receive Chriſt; Now they are ſenſible that Pardon and eternal Life are the free Gifts of God, and therefore Chriſt to prepare the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> convinces him that he was <hi>Poor, and Wretched, and Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Blind, and Naked.</hi> Rev. 3.17. Yet thoſe Men don't accept of Chriſt, until they have another Work of God upon the Heart. They are not fully prepared by this legal Poverty of Spirit. There needs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Work of God, further to prepare Men before they will come to Chriſt. If a Man were Poor in Spirit ſeven Year together, that will not prevail with him to come to Chriſt; but further to prepare him, his Eyes muſt be opened to ſee the Divine Authority of the Goſpel. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>When ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the Word of Men, but as it is indeed the Word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe.</hi> Until
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001651_0065_0FB4D691CC170050"/>
they ſee the Glory of God and Chriſt, they will not believe. Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> But when they are Poor in Spirit, they are prepared to receive the Goſpel, and give Entertainment to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Now they ſee a want of Salvation.</hi> Men that are ſeeking their Felicity in the World, and have not a ſenſe of the Wrath of God, don't mind Chriſt. They take more Notice of the Market, and worldly Opportunities, than of goſpel Invitations. Math. 22.5. <hi>They made light of it, and went one to his Farme, and another to his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</hi> But when they are Poor in Spirit, they are like <hi>Thirſty Men,</hi> that are even parched up. Rev. 22.17. <hi>Let him that is athirſt come.</hi> They <hi>Tremble</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did. Act. 9.6. This is ſome Preparation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Now they ſee that they can get Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in no other Way.</hi> If Men have hope to Work out their Salvation themſelves, they will not come to Chriſt. If they can cure their own Souls, they will not come to this <hi>Phyſitian.</hi> If the Prodigal thinks that he can earn his Living, he will not return to his Father. Luk. 15.15. <hi>He went and joined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Citizen of the Country.</hi> But he that
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001651_0066_0FB4D6964E98D4E8"/>
is Poor in Spirit, has tried all Concluſions, and every thing fails him. He ſees himſelf a dead Man. Rom. 7.9. <hi>Sin revived, and I died.</hi> So he ſees greater Neceſſity. This is a farther degree of Preparation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 USE. Hence ſee, <hi>That thoſe that are not Poor in Spirit, do eſpecially need to have the Law preached to them.</hi> It is uſeful to all ſorts of Men to hear the Preaching of the Law. Saints ſtand in need of it to keep them Humble, to put them upon it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Faith in Chriſt, and to make them Thankful: But eſpecially ſuch as are not Poor in Spirit. They need to be brought to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and to hear the Thundrings, and ſee the Lightnings. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Sinners don't love to hear the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Law. They had rather be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with ſome more comfortable Doctrine; but they are in great Neceſſity to hear the Law. If there had been no Law, there would have been no Neceſſity of the Goſpel: And Men that are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Terrours of the Law, will not regard the Invitations of the Goſpel. Such as are not Poor in Spirit, need to hear the Law often, that they may be prepared to receive the Goſpel; that their Hearts may
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001651_0067_0FB4D698946E1E28"/>
be broken and humbled. Gal. 3.24. <hi>The Law was our Schoolmaſter, to bring us to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That they may be ſenſible of the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Damnation.</hi> Many Men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware what a terrible Thing it is to be Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. They have a deeper Senſe of Poverty and Reproach, than they have of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They look upon Hell as an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Place: They think if it muſt be their Portion to go to Hell, they ſhall bear it as well as others; they are not like to go thither alone: They ſeldome think of it. They look upon it as a remote Thing at a great Diſtance, and it don't terrify them; but the Law diſcovers that it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable. Pſal. 11.6. <hi>Upon the Wicked God will Rain Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and an horrible Tempeſt.</hi> Iſai. 30.33. <hi>Tophet is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of Old, he hath made it deep and large; the Pile thereof is Fire aad much Wood; the Breath of the Lord, as a ſtream of Brimſtone, doth kindle it.</hi> Math. 25.41. <hi>Depart ye Curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels.</hi> Math. 13.42. <hi>He ſhall caſt them into a Furnace of Fire, there ſhall be Weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Hence many Men are exceedingly terrified, and ſee a
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001651_0068_0FB4D69A055B98E8"/>
neceſſity of Deliverance. Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Zion are afraid, Trembling has ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Hypocrites: Who among us can dwell with devouring Fire? Who among us can dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</hi> If the ſenſe of the terribleneſs of Damnation ſinks into their Hearts, they won't regard the World, they won't ſtick at their Pains; they won't think much to part with their Sins: They had rather undergo any Sorrow than be Damned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That they may be ſenſible of the great danger of Damnation.</hi> Men are wont to ſooth up themſelves that God will not ſend them to Hell: He is Kind, and Gracious, and they Pray to him, and they are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and enjoy Priviledges: They live Orderly, and are ſorry for their Sins, and ſo they hope they are in no great danger. But the Law ſhews, that Sinners are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Sentence of Condemnation. Rom. 6.23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> That God is very Angry with ungodly Men, Pſal. 50.21, 22. <hi>I will Reprove thee, and ſet thy Sins in Order before thee. Conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you to pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> The Law ſhews, that the Threatning muſt be executed. The
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001651_0069_0FB4D69C3B104128"/>
Law muſt take Place, that the Faithfulneſs of God is engaged for the fulfilling of the Law. Math. 5.18. <hi>Not one jot nor tittle ſhall paſs from the Law, but all ſhall be fulfilled.</hi> Hence many Men are afraid they ſhall not eſcape. They ſay as Mic. 6.7. <hi>Will the Lord be pleaſed with Thouſands of Rams, or ten Thouſands of Rivers of Oyl?</hi> They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid there is no Mercy for them. They have a <hi>Fearful expectation of fiery Indignation.</hi> They have a <hi>dreadful Sound in their Ears,</hi> as Job 15.21. And their Hearts are <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Terrour.</hi> They Confeſs, they Reform, they Cry, they Plead, but yet it Rings in their Ears, <hi>Curſed is every one that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That they may be ſenſible of the danger of ſudden Deſtruction.</hi> There is an Inclination in Men to put far away the evil Day, and then they think they may have a long Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to enjoy worldly Comforts. Men ſee that God exerciſes Patience towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they flatter themſelves that he will be Patient towards them. But by the Law, they ſee that God will deſtroy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sinners ſuddenly. 1 Theſ. 5.3. <hi>When they ſay Peace and Safety, then ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001651_0070_0FB4D69D0576E148"/>
cometh upon them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> And the Law ſhews them, that God is very Angry; that he ſets their Iniquities before him, <hi>their ſecret Sins in the light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:</hi> And ſo they are afraid God will not wait upon them. In the Evening they are afraid they ſhall die before Morning. If they find any bodily Indiſpoſition, they are afraid they ſhall die. If there be a Thunder-Storm, they are afraid they ſhall be killed: Their Hearts ſhake at the report of Sickneſs that prevails: They tremble at the ſhaking of a Leaf. It is with them as Deut. 28.66, 67. <hi>Thy Life ſhall hang in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence, and thou ſhalt fear Day and Night, and ſhalt have none aſſurance of thy Life. In the Morning thou ſhalt ſay, Would God it were Evening: And at Evening thou ſhalt ſay, Would God it were Morning; for the fear of thine Heart wherewith thou ſhalt fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That they may be ſenſible of the juſtice of their Damnation.</hi> Men have abundance of Objections againſt the juſtice of God. They argue that Sins don't hurt God; he is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for ever, notwithſtanding their Sins. They object, that they could not prevent their Sins; they are according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001651_0071_0FB4D6A0A0440280"/>
of God; that the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> that they did not conſent to, was imputed to them, and ſo they were conceived in Sin, and born in Iniquity. They object, that they have done Service, and that the Pains of Hell are intolerable. But the Law ſhews that their Damnation is juſt. Rom. 3.19. <hi>Whatſoever Things the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law: That every Mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World may become Guilty before God.</hi> It is very evident from the Law, that Men have deſerved Deſtruction; that they are worthy of Death, for they have broken an holy Law, and according to the Sentence of it, which is a Rule of Juſtice, they have merited Damnation. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they are the proper Cauſes of their own Sins, and they have therein run upon the point of the Sword, and have thrown themſelves into a Gulph of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Hoſ. 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 USE. <hi>Of warning to Sinners: Be not afraid to ſee that you are Poor. There is that maketh himſelf Rich, yet hath nothing.</hi> Prov. 13.7. So it is with ſome in this Caſe. Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt thou art Rich, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in Goods, and haſt need of nothing,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001651_0072_0FB4D6A18564D818"/>
but art Poor, and Wretched,</hi> &amp;c. Men miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deceive themſelves by ſuch Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Gal. 6.3. <hi>He that thinketh himſelf ſomething when he is nothing, deceiveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> It is Awful for Men to ſee themſelves Poor: It is Frightful, but if you be Poor, it is beſt to ſee it. The Caſe of ſuch Men is Doleful, but not Deſperate. Such have no Foundation to truſt in themſelves; but they have Ground of Encouragement, for the Goſpel is eſpecially to be preached to them that are Poor in Spirit. In the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Goſpel, he hath a ſingular Regard to them. Luk. 4.18. Your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the more Dangerous, but the more Hopeful, for ſeeing your ſelves Poor.</p>
            <p>Conſider, 1. <hi>You are wholly empty of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Some of you have conſiderable ſhews of Goodneſs. There is an Appearance of good Deſires, gracious Sorrow, love to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Sabbaths, and there is care to avoid Sin; but there is nothing of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all this. It can't be ſaid of you, as of <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Son, <hi>There is ſome good thing towards the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> All that you do is in Hypocriſy. You are acted in your Religion by a Spirit of Selfe-love: Fear of Hell and hopes of Heaven are the great
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001651_0073_0FB4D6A306293D70"/>
Principles that influence you. You are acted by a Luſt of Self-love in all your Religion. Pſal. 78.36. <hi>They flattered him, and lyed to him with their Tongue. Their Heart was not right with him.</hi> You make a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Profeſſion, but God may ſay of you, as of them, Deut. 5.29. <hi>O that there were ſuch an Heart in them.</hi> All that ye do is for your ſelves. Hoſ. 10.1. If you be <hi>Swept and Garniſhed,</hi> yet you are <hi>Empty.</hi> There is ſome ſimilitude of Faith and Love, but no reality. There is not one ſpark of Goodneſs in your Heart; though Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be reſtrained, yet it Reigns; and ſo long as Corruption Reigns, there is a total want of Goodneſs. Faith is the firſt good Thing that is wrought in the Heart. You are afraid of Judgment; ſo are the Devils. Jam. 2.19. <hi>The Devils believe and Tremble.</hi> You are much in Prayer, ſo would the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils be, if they had hopes of Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You have no Power to do any Good.</hi> You have Power to do all manner of External Duties, but you have no Power to keep the Law. Rom. 8.7. <hi>The natural Mind is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> If you have the help of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of Afflictions, of Deliverances of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001651_0074_0FB4D6A54563CA90"/>
yet you cannot work up any gracious Frame in your own Heart. If there were a ſeed of Grace in your Heart, by being cheriſhed, it might grow and flouriſh, but there is none. A Man that is in a Swound, may be brought to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to Walk and Work, but a Man that is Dead cannot: Thus it is with you. You are <hi>Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> Eph. 2.1. A Watch, or a Clock, by Springs and Weights may move Briskly, but it has no Principle of Life. It is quite beyond you to do any ſpiritual Good. You can't receive the Goſpel. There is Encouragement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſet before you, and it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Profitable to you to receive it, but you cannot. You have not an Heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Joh. 6.44. <hi>No Man can come unto me, except the Father that ſent me draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God is not bound to change your Heart.</hi> God is abſolutely free, he may help you, but if he won't, he is bleſſed for ever. It is true, he may help you without any Wrong to himſelf, but that lays him under no Neceſſity. It is in his Choice, whether he will Glorify his Juſtice or his Mercy on you: He may paſs over you and take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rom. 9.16. <hi>It is not of him that Willeth,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001651_0075_0FB4D6A6C7E174C0"/>
nor of him that Runneth, but of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Mercy.</hi> God is under no Conſtraint to change your Heart; His Juſtice don't ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate him. You have deſerved Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and your Prayers and Tears lay no Bonds on the Juſtice of God. His Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs don't neceſſitate him. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Convert ſome, but there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe to any natural Man. His Mercy don't neceſſitate him. The merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nature of Man, doth many times force him to pity and help others, but God is wholly Voluntary in the Exerciſes of his Mercy. God is not of ſuch a tender Heart, that he can't bear to ſee Men in Miſery. God can take Pleaſure in the Exerciſes of Juſtice. Iſai. 1.24. <hi>Ah, I will eaſe me of mine Enemies, and avenge me of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</hi> His Henour don't neceſſitate him to Convert you. It would have been as much for his Honour to have converted <hi>Eſau</hi> as <hi>Jacob, Judas</hi> as <hi>Peter, Saul</hi> as <hi>David.</hi> If he don't Convert you, he will be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ever. You can't bring God under any Neceſſity to Convert you. If he doth not, he doth you no Wrong: You are in his Hands. He is the <hi>Potter,</hi> and you are the <hi>Clay;</hi> He may make you a Veſſel of <hi>Honour or Diſhonour.</hi> Rom. 9.21.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:001651_0076_0FB4D6A907B8BAF8"/>3 USE. <hi>Of Exhortation to them that are Poor to receive the Goſpel.</hi> If it were not offered to you, it would be Obtruſion and Preſumption, a thruſting of your ſelves upon Chriſt, it would be an impudent Thing. But God offers Mercy to you; yea in an eſpecial Manner; as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage concerning Chriſt's Reſurrection was ſent in a particular Manner to <hi>Peter.</hi> Mar. 16.7. <hi>Go tell his Deſciples, and Peter.</hi> So he charges his Miniſters to make a particular Application of the Goſpel to you. Luk. 4.18. Iſai. 55.1. Rev. 22.17.</p>
            <p>Conſider 1. <hi>It is not beyond his Mercy to Pardon you.</hi> Salvation is a great Work. If your Sins had been fewer in Number, and ſmaller in their Nature and Aggravations, it would require great Mercy to Pardon and Save you. But as great as your Sins are, it is not beyond the Grace of God. You muſt beware that you <hi>don't limit the holy One of Iſrael. God is rich in Mercy.</hi> Eph. 2.4. His Grace is like the Ocean. It is ſufficient to cover all your Sins. Eph. 3.18. <hi>To comprehend the Breadth, and Length, and Heigth, and Depth of the Love of Chriſt.</hi> There are Three Dimenſions that belong to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: Hers are Four aſcribed to Mercy.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001651_0077_0FB4D6AA8573CC38"/>
Thickneſs may be meaſured Downwards, ſo 'tis Depth; and Upwards, ſo 'tis Heigth. Mercy brings Sinners from deep Miſery, to the Pinnacle of Happineſs. God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is greater than Man's. God can find Mercy for ſuch as Men cannot find Mercy for. Hoſ. 11.9. <hi>I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim, for I am God and not Man.</hi> Iſai. 55.9. <hi>For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my Ways higher than your Ways, and my Thoughts than your Thoughts.</hi> God's Mercies are greater than your Sins. Men think if they had not ſinned ſo much, or ſo long, their Sin would not have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond God's Mercy. But God's Mercy can Conquer all their Provocations. Grace may prevail over all. Rom. 5.21. <hi>Grace reigns through Righteouſnes, to eternal Life.</hi> The Mercy of God is greater than we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of. The Underſtanding of Man is large: We can conceive how many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes there be in a thouſand Years; how many Inches it is to the Center of the Earth, but we can't comprehend the Love of Chriſt Eph. 3.19. <hi>The Love of Chriſt paſſeth Knowledge.</hi> We can't comprehend the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the Cup that he Drank for our ſakes. We can't comprehend the Duration
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001651_0078_0FB4D6AC054C3B50"/>
of his Love. We can't comprehend the great Good that he hath procured for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God has deſigned to ſave many loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> It is the purpoſe of his Heart, to bring many poor Sinners to heavenly Glory. If he had taken up a Reſolution againſt it, Men might well be diſcouraged; but he has not reſolved againſt it, neither is he at a loſs what to do; he is not loth to do it: but it is his full Determination; he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in his Way, and he purpoſes to break over all Objections, and Conquer all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. He is ſet in his Way, and will not be put out of it. 2 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>God has choſen you to Salvation.</hi> Gal. 1.5. <hi>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And he has done a great deal in order to the Salvation of ſuch Sinners. The Price of it is paid. Sin laid a Bar in the Way, but that Bar is removed by the Death of Chriſt. There is no need of any Contrivance how to ſatisfy the Law, that is done already by Chriſt. God has ſent Chriſt to ſave us. Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> And God makes a Propoſal to you, and gives you liberty to be ſaved, if you will accept of Jeſus Chriſt. He don't
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001651_0079_0FB4D6AD859D83E8"/>
tell you that his Heart is hardned againſt you; but he tells you, that you ſhall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if you will come to Chriſt. Rev. 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</hi> Yea, he doth beſeech you to come for Salvation. God is of infinite Majeſty, yet he intreates you to be ſaved. He condeſcends to your Infirmity, and ſtoops ſo low as to plead with you; He becomes as it were a Petitioner to you: He begs of you to come, and urges it as a Courteſy to come, with tender-heartedneſs prayes you to come. 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>We are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>This is a principal Way, wherein God Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies himſelf.</hi> The end of all Things is God's Glory; and he hath done many great Things for his Glory. He made the World for his Glory, that his Power and Wiſdom might be manifeſted. He preſerved the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels from Sinning, for the Glory of his Goodneſs. He gave the Law for the Glory of his Holineſs. He drowned the old World, ſaved <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,,</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Sodom,</hi> brought <hi>Judah</hi> from <hi>Babylon</hi> for his Glory. But this is a principal Way wherein
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001651_0080_0FB4D6AFA33A8630"/>
he Gloryfies himſelf, in working out the Salvation of Sinners by Chriſt. There is a great Manifeſtation of the <hi>Trinity of Perſons</hi> in the God-head. There is a Manifeſtation of the <hi>Power,</hi> of the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, and of his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Grace.</hi> In this way he is greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. Mic. 5.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning Iniquity, and paſſing by the Tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of his Heritage, becauſe he delighted in Mercy?</hi> Rev. 5.12, 13. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Honour, and Strength, and Glory, and Bleſſing. And every Creature which is in Heaven, and in the Earth, and under the Earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying, Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power be unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>

The Perſons to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited, the <hi>Broken-hearted.</hi> The Broken-hearted, that is, thoſe that are diſtreſſed becauſe of Sin. This may be either from godly Sorrow, Pſal. 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a Broken-heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a Contrite ſpirit.</hi> Or, from a ſenſe and apprehenſion of Miſery and Danger. Prov. 15.13. <hi>By Sorrow of Heart, the Spirit is Broken.</hi> Prov. 17.22. <hi>A merry Heart doth good like a Medicine, but a broken Spirit drieth the Bones.</hi> And here it ſeems to have a reſpect to thoſe that are in Diſtreſs of Conſcience. 2. The benefit
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001651_0082_0FB4D6B205C68FB8"/>
he was to bring to them, healing of them. There are two Caſes wherein Men ſtand in need of Healing. One is in Caſe of Sickneſs and Diſeaſes. Pſal. 103.3. <hi>Who healeth all thy Diſeaſes.</hi> The other is, in Caſe of Wounds. That is the Caſe here. Their Conſciences are wounded. In Iſaiah it is, <hi>To bind up the broken in Heart.</hi> That is the manner of Surgeons in order to Healing.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>There is Virtue in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to Heal wounded Conſciences.</hi> As the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Man, ſo the Conſcience of a Man may be wounded in divers Degrees; but ſometimes the Wounds of Conſcience are very Dreadful. And it is a great Service to a Man to have thoſe Wounds healed. This cannot be effected by other Means. Many Men have made tryal to little Purpoſe, but the Goſpel is powerful that way. The Law Wounds the Conſciences of Sinners. 1 Cor. 15.56. <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin; and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law.</hi> But the Goſpel Heals their Conſciences. The Goſpel is of exceeding great Uſe otherwiſe; as it ſanctifies the Hearts, and gives Men Power over Indwelling-Sin. And this way it is very uſeful; that it Heals the Conſcience,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001651_0083_0FB4D6B386331CC8"/>
it frees the Conſcience from Grief, and the Terrour of Hell, and brings inward Peace and good Hope of eternal Life. Let the Wounds of Conſcience be never ſo deep, yet by the Goſpel they may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. God is the Author of Healings. Pſal. 147.3. <hi>He healeth the broken in Heart, and bindeth up their Wounds.</hi> But the Goſpel is the Means. Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of all Hope fill you with all Peace and Joy in Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>In whom, though now you ſee him not, yet Believing, ye Rejoyce with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> Hence the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called the Goſpel of Peace. Rom. 10.15. <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of them that Preach the Goſpel of Peace, that bring glad Tydings of good Things!</hi> Eph. 6.15. <hi>And your Feet ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace.</hi> The Goſpel is a means of Peace with God, and ſo of Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Here I ſhall Premiſe two Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Between a ſtupifyed Conſcience, and an healed Conſcience.</hi> Some Sinners have no Anguiſh in their Conſciences. This riſes from a ſtupid and ſenceleſs Spirit. They are under the Power of an Atheiſtical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. They have no ſenſe of Eternal
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001651_0084_0FB4D6B625280DF0"/>
Things. Theſe Men know, that they are Corrupt, and Unregenerate; and that if the Scripture be true, they are Miſerable. But they are beſotted and benummed, and don't feel inward Pain. Rom. 11.8. <hi>God hath given them the Spirit of deep Sleep and Slumber.</hi> This Conſcience differs from a Conſcience that is healed: For a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that is healed, is very ſenſible of Judgment, and the Wrath of God againſt Sinners, and the truth of the Threatnings, and the Reaſon of its quietneſs is not from Unbelief, but becauſe his ſtate is changed, and he is brought in to a ſtate of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God. He perceives that God is at Peace with him, and ſo he Rejoyces in hope of Glory. Rom. 5.1, 2. <hi>Being juſtifyed by Faith, we have Peace with God, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. By whom alſo we have acceſs into this Grace wherein we ſtand, and Rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Between a flattering Conſcience, &amp; an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Conſcience.</hi> Some Men have quietneſs in their Conſciences, from falſe Imaginations that they are at Peace with God. They have hopes of going to Heaven, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions that Gods is reconciled to them,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001651_0085_0FB4D6B7454F92C8"/>
either from falſe Principles; So <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> they think ſuch things will bring them into a ſtate of Peace, as will not. Or from falſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that they are converted, and have Faith and Love. Prov. 30.12. <hi>There is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, yet are not cleanſed from their Filthineſs.</hi> The Wounds of their Conſciences are ſkinned over, and when they are inlightned, the Wound will open again; but when the Conſcience is healed, Men are not under a Miſtake; they have a good Foundation for their Hope. 2 Theſ. 2.16. <hi>God hath loved us, and given us everlaſting Conſolation, and good Hope through Grace.</hi> Many Men find religious Affections, and a Conſcienſcious Care to pleaſe God, and get conſiderable Victory over Temptations, and have ſome ſuperficial Joy in the hearing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and ſo they flatter themſelves that the bitterneſs of Death is paſt. But when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is healed, it is from an Application of the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What muſt be done by the Man, in order to the Application of this healing Virtue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>He muſt believe the offers of the Goſpel to be true.</hi> Multitudes hear and read the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001651_0086_0FB4D6BBC64F4F88"/>
that have no benefit of its healing Virtue, becauſe they don't believe it to be true. Heb. 4.2. <hi>The Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> If the Goſpel were not true, it would be no Foundation of true Peace, and many are at a loſs about the truth of it. Their Minds are blinded. 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> They have Objections againſt the Goſpel, and don't diſcern the truth of it, by the Teſtimony of God. But in order to the healing of their Conſciences, they muſt be convinced of the truth of the Goſpel, that Chriſt Jeſus is the Son of God, that his Sacrifice has ſatisfied Juſtice, that God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Mercy through him. The Word muſt come with a divine Authority. Men muſt hear the Voice of Chriſt. Chriſt muſt be revealed by the Father. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Ye received the Word, as the Word of God.</hi> Joh. 5.25. <hi>The Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and live.</hi> Math. 16.17. <hi>Fleſh and Bloud hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father that is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:001651_0087_0FB4D6BE80B37180"/>2. <hi>He muſt receive theſe Offers.</hi> It is the Duty of Men to receive the Invitations of the Goſpel, and that is neceſſary in order to Peace of Conſcience. For if a Man don't receive the Goſpel, the Word ſpeaks Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to him. Mar. 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Rom. 2.8, 9. <hi>To them that are Contentious, and obey not the Goſpel, but obey Unrighteouſneſs, God will render In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Wrath.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8. <hi>Chriſt will come in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If Men do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel, they are not at Peace with God. Whatever commendable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications they have, they are not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God: And if they have not Peace with God, they cannot have true Peace of Conſcience. The Office of Conſcience, is to echoe to the Voice of God. Men muſt receive Chriſt. Joh. 1.12. <hi>To them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, gave he Power to become the Sons of God.</hi> That brings them into an eſtate of Juſtification. Receiving of Chriſt is the Condition of the Goſpel Covenant. The Redemption of Chriſt brings no ſaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to them that don't receive him. Men muſt believe on him, that ſo they may have
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001651_0088_0FB4D6BF855DFA48"/>
an intereſt in his Blood. God don't force the benefits of Chriſt on any Man, they muſt come to him. Math. 11.28. <hi>Come to me all ye that are Weary, and heavy Laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Theſe two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars always go together: Thoſe that do believe the Goſpel, do always receive Chriſt: The Mind and Will act in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He muſt diſcern that he doth receive the Goſpel.</hi> Peace of Conſcience riſeth from an underſtanding of the truth of the Goſpel, and that he himſelf hath cloſed with it. Men are capable to perceive that they have received it, and Conſcience is very obſervant at ſuch a time. It is a thing that the Heart is much concerned about; and generally they do take notice of it, and obſerve the very time. Some times they can roundly ſpeak up to it. Joh. 9.38. <hi>Lord I believe.</hi> Others do perceive it, though under more Uncertainty. The Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men have a reflecting Power, and may diſcern their own Actions. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence diſcerns Unbelief, and ſo Accuſeth; and it diſcerns Faith, and ſo ſpeaks Peace. Men are afterwards ſubject to divers Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; but generally they take ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:001651_0089_0FB4D6C105A58E80"/>
of the Change that God has made in them; that they have been perſwaded, and after much Oppoſition, have yielded to the calls of God. When God hath ſaid, <hi>Return ye backſliding Children, and I will Heal your Backſlidings,</hi> they have anſwered, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> As Jer. 3.22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Q. <hi>How doth the Goſpel apply its hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Virtue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>It manifeſts, that God hath juſtified and accepted him.</hi> This is the plain Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Premiſes. The Goſpel teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that he that believes is juſtified. Act. 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets Witneſs, through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive the forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to all believers. God that has au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Pardon Sin, that is the Judge of the World, declares that he will be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to believers; and Conſcience affirms, that he doth believe in Chriſt; he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken himſelf to Chriſt for Refuge. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this is more clear to him: He can ſay as Pſal. 13.5. <hi>I have truſted in thy Mercy.</hi> And ſo he concludes that God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him. He is delivered from Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, according to that, Joh. 5.24. <hi>He
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001651_0090_0FB4D6C34867B7D8"/>
that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him that ſent him, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not enter into Condemnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life.</hi> So he concludes that God is his Father, that his Sins are caſt into the depths of the Sea; that God will beſtow heavenly Bleſſedneſs upon him; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience echoes to the Voice of God, and pronounces him an Heir of Glory; and ſo <hi>he rejoiceth in hope of the Glory of God.</hi> Rom. 5.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Goſpel manifeſts, that it is agreeable to the Law, that he doth juſtify.</hi> Formerly he he was dreadfully ſcared with the Law. 1 Cor. 15.56. The Sting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law. He conſidered that the Law muſt be fulfilled. Math. 5.18. <hi>Not one jot or tittle muſt paſs from the Law, but all muſt be fulfilled.</hi> But the Goſpel gives a clear Account that Chriſt has ſatisfied the Law. That the Law did allow a Mediatour. Gal. 3.17. <hi>The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was four Hundred and thirty Years after, cannot diſanul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none effect.</hi> That the Curſe of the Law was executed on Chriſt. Gal. 3.13. <hi>He hath redeemed us from Curſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001651_0091_0FB4D6C826AECD30"/>
made a Curſe for us.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Sins. 1 Cor. 15.1. <hi>Chriſt died for our Sins, according to the Scriptures.</hi> Iſai. 53.6. <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our Iniquities.</hi> Hereby the Soul is ſatisfied that God may ſave him without any Contradiction to the Rule of Juſtice. All the Challenges of the Law have been anſwered by Chriſt, ſo that now the Threatnings of the Law are not a Terrour to him. He ſees the Debt is paid, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is cancelled; it is according to a Rule of Righteouſneſs that he ſhould be ſaved. The Law lays no Bar in the way. Rom. 3.26. <hi>God is Juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Rom. 3.31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid: Yea, we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 USE. <hi>Hence learn the Preciouſneſs of the Goſpel.</hi> The Goſpel is called Glorious. 2 Cor. 4.4. It is called <hi>the Word of God's Grace.</hi> Act. 20.32. <hi>I commend you to God and the Word of his Grace.</hi> It is called the good Word of God. Heb. 6.5. <hi>Have taſted the good Word of God.</hi> The Promiſes of it are called, <hi>exceeding great and precious Promiſes.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. And truly on this Account, the Goſpel is precious, that it heals wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:001651_0092_0FB4D6CAB69868F0"/>
Conſciences. The <hi>Balm</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted precious, becauſe of its healing Virtue. So the Goſpel is to be prized becauſe of its ſanative Power, that it heals the Wounds that Sin has made in the Conſcience. There be a great many that hear the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that are not healed, but thouſands have been healed by it. Every Man that doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, is healed thereby, whatever their Terrours were.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Conſider. <hi>Theſe Wounds can't be healed any other way.</hi> Some other things can ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify the Conſcience, and ſkin the Wounds over, but nothing but the Goſpel can cure them. Mic 6.6.7. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? Shall I come before him with Burnt-offerings, or Calves of a Year Old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl?</hi> If a Man ſhould Weep Day and Night, that will not do. If he ſhould give all his Goods to the Poor, that will not do. If he ſhould walk in Print, that will not do. Theſe Wounds do reject all other Medicines. Rom. 3.20. <hi>By the deeds of the Law, ſhall no Fleſh living be juſtified in his Sight.</hi> If a Man ſhould with <hi>Anna,</hi> ſerve God with Faſtings and Prayers
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001651_0093_0FB4D6CB85C0FA08"/>
Night and Day; if he ſhould with <hi>Paul,</hi> go Preaching the Goſpel from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> round about unto <hi>Illyricum,</hi> if he ſhould with <hi>Elijah</hi> be very jealous for the Lord of Hoſts; if he ſhould confeſs his Sins with Tears of Blood; if he ſhould give his Body to be burned, it would not do. The biting of the fiery Serpent could not be healed, but by looking to the brazen Serpent. So there is nothing can allay the Venom of theſe Wounds, but the Goſpel. Many Men try many Concluſions, but their Wounds Stink and are Corrupt. There is no Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Fleſh, becauſe of God's Anger, nor any Reſt in their Bones, becauſe of their Sins. Their Bones wax Old through their Roaring all the Day, and their Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is turned into the drought of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, till the Virtue of the Goſpel is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto them. Joh. 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you: Not as the World giveth, give I unto you.</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf to God, purge your Conſciences from dead Works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe Wounds are full of Anguiſh.</hi> Many Men have ſuch Wounds in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001651_0094_0FB4D6CE7B56E330"/>
as are exceeding hard to bear. Their Sins are like Ghoſts, gaſhly to behold, when God ſets them in order before Men. The Wrath of God is hard to bear: It lies like a Mountain of Lead upon the Soul; and Terrours take hold of them like Waters, when the Arrows of the Almighty are within Men, the Poiſon of them drinks up their Spirits, and they have a dreadful Sound in their Ears. Job 15.21. Their Hearts are as heavy as Lead, their Sorrows pierce them as with the piercings of a Sword. The Wrath of God ſearches like Fire; they are in an amazed Condition. Other Afflictions are hard to bear, theſe are harder. Men may bear up under other Sorrows, but theſe ſink the Soul. Prov. 18.14. <hi>The Spirit of a Man can ſuſtain his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; but a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> They cry out in Diſtreſs. Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Who among us can dwell with devouring Fire?</hi> Yet the Goſpel can heal theſe Wounds, and turn their Mourning into Dancing, and turn their Sorrow into Joy, that they ſhall Sing for Joy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If theſe Wounds be not healed here, they never will be healed.</hi> There is great neceſſity that Mens Conſciences ſhould be healed
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:001651_0095_0FB4D6CF45427F20"/>
now in this World. It is a doleful Thing for theſe painful Wounds to continue ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Months; more Doleful for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as ſometimes they do, ſome Years. But there lies great neceſſity upon Men to get theſe Wounds healed quickly, for if they be not healed here, they never will be healed. If Men go with the Wounds out of this World, they will abide for ever. Their Guilt will remain for ever, and the Wrath of God will be poured out on them for ever. What can heal them in the other World? The Puniſhment that they ſuſtain, will not take away their Guilt. They will never be able to pay their Debts, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy divine Juſtice; for they deſerve ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment; for that they will be ſentenced unto. Math. 25.41. <hi>Depart ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire.</hi> And as long as their Guilt continues, their Wounds will continue. Yea, their Wounds will be fuller of Anguiſh then, Conſcience will be much more ſenſible then, than it is now. Now they have many outward Enjoyments that do help to ſtupify Conſcience. Now they have abundance of carnal Reaſonings and flattering Hopes, that give them ſome eaſe. Now their Underſtandings are more Dull;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001651_0096_0FB4D6D412F2B540"/>
but in the other World, theſe Wounds will be fuller of Anguiſh than now; they will have more Underſtanding then of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty of God; they will be ſtripped out of all their carnal Enjoyments; they will know and remember all their Sins: They will have Experience of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance; they will Drink of the Wine of God's Indignation. There will be more Revelations of his Wrath to them, &amp; they ſhall be utterly without Hope, and ſee an impoſſibility of Deliverance. Mar. 9.44. <hi>There the Worm dieth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Theſe Wounds are ſo healed by the Goſpel, that they ſhall never prove Mortal.</hi> The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth the thing effectually. It is with theſe Wounds indeed, as it is with bodily Wounds and broken Bones; after they are healed, they ſometimes Ake againſt change of Weather, but yet they ſhall not prove Mortal. A Man whoſe Conſcience is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhall never die of his Wounds. If the Wounds of Conſcience be not healed, they will iſſue in Ruine; but if the healing Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Goſpel be applyed to them, the Men are delivered from Deſtruction; they may have Pain ſometimes, but their Life is ſafe. Col. 3.3. <hi>Your Life is hid with Chriſt

in God.</hi> Joh. 5.24. <hi>They are paſſed from Death to Life.</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be healed, and acquits from their Guilt, their Sins ſhall never be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and ſhall never prove a Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them, ſo as to make them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Chriſt, nor fall into a way of Unbelief.</p>
            <p n="2">2 USE. <hi>Of Examination, whether the Wounds of your Conſciences have been healed.</hi> Some Mens Conſciences are more quiet than they were. There was a time when you were mightily terrified; you could not reſt Day nor Night; your Sins were <hi>ſet in order before you,</hi> and the Wrath of God <hi>was terrible to you;</hi> the Terrours of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſet themſelves in array againſt you, and you had amazing Fears: Some times you feared that your Day of Grace was paſt; ſometimes that the Spirit of God had left you; ſometimes that you had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the unpardonable Sin; ſometimes that you ſhould die before Morning. It was Dreadful to think of Dying, and the end of all Opportunities, of going in your Sins before the Judgment-Seat; of lying among Devils; of unquenchable Fire. You were amazed to think how you ſhould ſpend the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:001651_0098_0FB4D6D845560B08"/>
Day, and then how you ſhould wear out the Night, and how you ſhould grapple with eternal Miſery; but now the caſe is altered, and you are not under ſuch Fears; you live quietly and hope to go to Heaven. The thoughts of Death are not ſuch a Terrour to you as they were: But there may be eaſe of Conſcience where there is no Healing. Some Mens Conſciences are not healed, but ſtupified. The Wounds of ſome Mens Conſciences are only ſkinned over, not cured. You may know it by this: When they are indeed healed, they are always healed by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it were by the Goſpel, then you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that nothing elſe would Heal you.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men feel the Efficacy of the Goſpel, they muſt be beaten off from all falſe hopes. Men may ſee that their Hearts are very bad, and a great deal of Rottenneſs and Hypocriſy in themſelves, and much of the inſufficiency of their own Righteouſneſs, yet not be prepared to receive the offers of Chriſt, and depend on his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There be particular Convictions of the wretchedneſs of Mens own Hearts, for Months going. They may ſee more and more of the deſperate Wickedneſs that is
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:001651_0099_0FB523AA99424F00"/>
in their Hearts, and yet they not be brought out of themſelves. But before they come to Chriſt for healing, they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the incurableneſs of their Wounds by any other Medicine. If they can help themſelves by Prayers, Deſires, Sorrows Inlargements, they will neglect Chriſt. They will never come to Chriſt, till they are reduced to Extremity. If they can make a ſhift to eaſe their Conſciences with their Priviledges &amp; Performances, they may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Faith in Chriſt, but they will neglect him. They muſt ſee themſelves Dead. Rom. 7.9. <hi>Sin revived and I died</hi> Their ſtrong holds muſt all be thrown down. 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our Warfare are mighty, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi> Men muſt be empty of themſelves, and all Refuges muſt fail them, before they will come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If it were by the Goſpel, it was by the ſpiritual Diſcovery of the Grace of God, and the Virtue of Chriſt's Blood.</hi> There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold common Diſcovery of the Virtue of Chriſt's Blood: One is from the ſtrength of Reaſon. Men can argue from many To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks that it muſt be ſo, from the Miracles that he wrought, from his Reſurrection, from the conſent of the Old Teſtament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:001651_0100_0FB523AD54850D40"/>
And thus the generality of thoſe that are called Chriſtians, have ſome perſwaſion of it. Like them, Joh. 2.23. <hi>Many believed on his Name, when they ſaw the Miracles that he did.</hi> The other is by more than ordinary Illuminations. Some carnal Men have a ſuperficial Illumination. Heb. 6.4. <hi>Some that have been inlightned fall away.</hi> Math. 13.20. <hi>They receive the Word with Joy, but have not Root in themſelves.</hi> This Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is like a flaſh of Lightning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it affects Men at preſent, but wears off after a while: But when their Conſciences are ſealed by the Goſpel, their are indeed convinced. There is a ſpiritual Diſcovery of the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue of the Blood of Chriſt. <hi>They ſee his Glory, as the Glory of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> Joh. 1.14. So Chriſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1.16. God gives the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him. The Blindneſs of the Mind muſt be removed before Men will receive the Goſpel. Men muſt hear God calling them, before they will come to Chriſt. And ſuch Perſons have not only a ſpiritual Diſcovery of Chriſt, when their Conſciences are firſt healed, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they are wont to have further Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:001651_0101_0FB523AE81A3C8D8"/>
thereof, whereby they are helped to renew their Dependance on the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If it were by the Goſpel, then the Diſeaſes of their Hearts are healed alſo.</hi> When the Goſpel is received, it has not a great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Conſcience only, but over the Heart alſo. As it delivers the Conſcience from the guilt of Sin, ſo it delivers the Heart from the power of Sin. It doth not only Comfort, but it Purifies the Man. The Goſpel teaches us <hi>to deny Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſt;</hi> and <hi>to live Soberly, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and Godly, in this World.</hi> 2 Tit. 11.12. And wherever the Goſpel is indeed received, it has a mighty Efficacy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Heart. Thoſe that know the Grace of God, and Excellency of Chriſt, are thereby inclined to carry Holily. Some Men get a falſe Peace by common Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and that occaſions ſtrong Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Sorrow for Sin, delight in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, care of their Converſation for a time; but before it be long, their Corruptions revive like Snakes in the Spring. Luk. 8.13. <hi>For a while they believe, and in time of Temptation they fall away.</hi> But if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is healed, the Diſeaſes are cured.
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:001651_0102_0FB523B0A2B665F8"/>
The Heart is changed; the Man has a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love to God; he has ſuch a ſight of God and Chriſt, as gives Life to him. 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt Jeſus, he is a new Creature: Old things are paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and all things are become New.</hi> As the ſight of God and Chriſt inclines the Soul to truſt in him, ſo to Love and Fear him. Joh. 5.25. <hi>The Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 USE. <hi>Of Direction what Courſe to take, that your Conſciences may be healed.</hi> Some Men are diſtreſſed by reaſon of the Wounds of their Conſciences. Prov. 18.14. <hi>A wounded Conſcience who can bear?</hi> And they are willing to take a great deal of Pains in order to their healing. They would be contented to bear bodily Pains, to part with a great deal of Money, if that would effect the thing; to give <hi>Thouſands of Rams.</hi> Mic. 6.7. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> take great Pains, Torment their Bodies, are at great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: And many among our ſelves, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their ſinful Carriages that were dear to them; are very laborious in ſeeking God, and ſtriving with their own Hearts; but the way to get your Conſciences hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is to receive the Goſpel. There muſt
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:001651_0103_0FB523B494129C60"/>
be Reformations and Supplications, but the principal Thing is to receive the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and yet the Blood of Chriſt applyed to the Soul. It is the Blood of Chriſt that waſhes away Sin. 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God cleanſes us from all Sin.</hi> This is the price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; receive therefore the offers of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And in order to this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Diſpair of getting a Cure in any other way.</hi> There is a great endeavour in Men to get ſomething of their own to pacify the Anger of God. They are ſenſible that they cannot perform the Condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works: They cannot perfectly keep the Law, yet they hope to get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own to commend them to God's acceptance. They hope that their Sorrow, and their Deſires, and Affections, and Reformations will moderate the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, and contribute ſomewhat to the pacifying of his Anger. They think God can't but delight in thoſe things, and can't be ſo Angry with them as he was. They hope that their own Obedience doth take ſomething with God, and incline his Heart towards them, and render them
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:001651_0104_0FB523B7C64DA9A8"/>
more acceptable to God than they were. They go about to eſtabliſh their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; but you muſt be convinced of the Vanity of this Confidence; all their ſtrong holds muſt be thrown down, that your Tears and Affections will do nothing, that they can't incline God to pitty you; you muſt find by Experience, ſuch Defects and Corruption in all your Services, and ſuch Wretchedneſs in your Heart, as ſhall make it evident to you, that you cannot help your ſelf. Your Conſcience muſt ſpeak as God ſpeaks, that it is fair for God to caſt you off; as Righteous to reject you, as if you had never made a Prayer or ſhed a Tear for your Sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That whatever you have done, you have laid no bonds on God to ſave you. That you can do nothing to force God to ſave you; but you are after all at God's free Diſpoſal. You muſt ſee that you are <hi>without Strength,</hi> Rom. 5.6. <hi>That God is the Potter, and you are the Clay.</hi> Rom. 9.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>That it is God that offers healing to you in the Goſpel.</hi> You hear Men inviting and encouraging you to come to Jeſus Chriſt; and you are perſwaded that they are Men of Underſtanding, and that
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:001651_0105_0FB523B9C5B2C168"/>
they do judge in their Hearts that is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient way of Salvation; but you cannot depend on the Judgment of Men, that will not ſatisfy your Conſcience, that Men think there is healing Virtue in the Blood of Chriſt: But God doth teſtify to it, Dan. 9.24. <hi>Chriſt will finiſh Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and make an end of Sins, and make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for Iniquity.</hi> Rev. 5.9. <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood.</hi> And he freely offers this unto you, and is ready to pardon all your Sins through Chriſt Jeſus. Do but believe that it is God that ſpeaks in the Goſpel, and you will ſee Encouragement enough: Then you will be ſatisfied in the Mercy of God; then you will be ſatisfied in the Faithfulneſs of the Promiſe; then you will be ſatisfied in the ſufficiency of Chriſt's Redemption, and not be afraid to truſt in him. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Ye received the Word, not as the Word of Men, but (as it is indeed) the Word of God, which effectually worketh in them that believe.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>HERE is another Expreſſion of the Work that Chriſt was anointed for. Where mind, 1. The Perſons that he is to be Serviceable to. The Word <hi>Captive</hi> is from <hi>Capio,</hi> to take. They are ſuch as are taken in War. <hi>Aichmalotos</hi> is from <hi>Aichme,</hi> Spear or Sword, and <hi>Alotos,</hi> taken in War. This ſets forth the ſtate of Sinners. They are by the juſt Judgment of God, delivered into Satans Hands, &amp; they are his Captives. 2 Tim. 2.26. <hi>They are taken Captive by him at his Will.</hi> 2. What Service Chriſt was to do for them. <hi>To Preach Deliverance,</hi> to Publiſh or Proclaim it. His Office was not meerly to Condole their Captivity, but to Proclaim Deliverance to them. He doth not Proclaim that they are delivered, but he Proclaims an Offer of
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:001651_0107_0FB523BD5A2FD3B0"/>
Deliverance. He declares that there is a way of Deliverance, and makes a tender of it upon Terms.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>God offers Deliverance to thoſe that are in ſpiritual Captivity.</hi> Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to them that are in bodily Captivity is a great Priviledge; but Deliverance to them that are in ſpiritual Captivity, is a far greater Priviledge. As it is more Coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo it is more Comfortable and Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but this is freely offered by God. He doth not force their Deliverance without their Conſent, but he makes a tender of Deliverance unto them. They cannot force their Deliverance, neither can they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their own Deliverance. <hi>What ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Math. 16.26. But God doth freely offer it to them. He doth not at preſent make an offer of it to all the World. There be great Nations that have not heard of it; but where he ſends his Goſpel, he makes an offer of it. There be many in ſuch Places that are not delivered from this Captivity, and indeed never will be delivered; but it is not for want of an offer, but for want of their Acceptance. Some that are in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity are delivered, and Deliverance is offered unto others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:001651_0108_0FB523C2582B31E0"/>Q. <hi>Why are Sinners ſaid to be in ſpiritual Captivity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Becauſe their Condition is reſembled by the Condition of Captives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are made to ſerve with Rigour.</hi> Thus the <hi>Egyptians</hi> dealt with the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Exod. 1.14. <hi>They made their Lives Bitter with hard Bondage, in Morter and in Brick, and in all manner of Service in the Field.</hi> All the Service wherein they made them ſerve, was with Rigour. So Satan puts his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to a great deal of Drudgery. He keeps them continually at Work. He hurries them from Service to Service. He makes them do a great deal of baſe Work, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Dignity of Men. He makes them to Idolize the World, and to make <hi>Gods of their Bellies.</hi> Phil. 3.19. He makes them Lye, and Steal, and be Prophane. He makes many of them to be like <hi>the Beaſts that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh.</hi> He drives them ſometimes to do things that will be a Reproach to them, that they are <hi>as the Fools in Iſrael.</hi> 2 Sam. 13.13. He makes them to do ſuch things as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them in this World. Prov. 6.33. <hi>A Wound and Diſhonour ſhall he get, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſhall not be wiped away.</hi> He compels them to do ſuch things as are utterly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:001651_0109_0FB523C50E7F49D8"/>
and forces them to do things that diſpleaſe God, and bring down his Wrath. He hurries them on to do things that Wound their Conſciences. He will not allow them time, nor ſuffer them to ſerve God. Eph. 2.2, 3. <hi>Ye walked according to the Courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Diſobedience. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom we had our Converſation in times paſt, in the Luſts of the Fleſh, fulfilling the Deſires of the Fleſh, and of the Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They are miſerably provided for.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſo with Captives among Men. Deut. 28.48. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve thine Enemies, which the Lord ſhall ſend againſt thee, in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Thirſt, and Nakedneſs, and in the want of all things.</hi> So Iſai. 20.4. <hi>So the King of Aſſyria ſhall lead the Egyptians Priſoners, and the Ethiopians Captives; Young and Old, Naked and Barefoot.</hi> Thus theſe Mens Souls are in a ſtarved Condition; they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſatisfy them; they are like the Prodigal, Luk. 15.16. <hi>He would fain have filled his Belly with the Huſks that the Swine did eat, but no Man gave unto him.</hi> They have no Heavenly <hi>Manna;</hi> they don't eat of <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> ſpoken of, Rev. 2.7.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001651_0110_0FB523C6D6D517C0"/>
They have not that which is <hi>Meat indeed,</hi> and <hi>Drink indeed.</hi> They have inſatiable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after Happineſs; but they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to live upon, but that which is Courſe, and Bitter, and Unſatisfying. They have Deſires after Satisfaction, but cannot find it. They are kept in an Hungry and Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Condition. While other Men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in God's Chambers, they are kept out of Doors. They come into the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, but not into the Chambers of Communion; and their Souls are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Cloathed, while others are Cloathed with change of Raiment, and their Beauty is Perfect through that Comlineſs which God hath put upon them, and are adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Robes of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe poor Captives have nothing but rotten Rags to cover them, while their Bodies are finely adorned, their Souls are Naked and Filthy: They are <hi>Polluted in their Blood.</hi> Ezek. 16.6. All their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is as filthy Rags.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Satan is leading them to his own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</hi> That is the manner of Conquerours when they have taken Captives, to lead them away to their own Country. So <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> was dealt with. Jer. 52.11. <hi>The
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:001651_0111_0FB523C8B4891CA8"/>
King of Babylon bound him with Chains, and carryed him to Babylon.</hi> Thus Satan is deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theſe Men. The Divel himſelf is caſt into Hell. 2 Pet. 2.4. <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that Sinned, but caſt them down to Hell.</hi> And though they be ſuffered to Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about the Earth, yet Hell is their Home; and thither it is that they are lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Captives. The Divel is leading them in thoſe Paths that go down to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. 1 Joh. 3.8. <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Divel.</hi> He leads them on in the Practice of Iniquity, which is the very way to Hell. He leads ſome in the way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, others in the way of Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, others in a way of Pride and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, till he brings them down to Hell. <hi>The Divel deceives them,</hi> Rev. 20.10. <hi>He deſtroys them,</hi> Rev. 9.11. And he is buſily endeavouring to hinder them from getting out of this way. When they hear the Word, he is careful to take it away. Math. 13.19. <hi>Then cometh the wicked One, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart.</hi> He mightily oppoſeth their Converſion. He is ſhewing them the Glory of the World, and blinding their Eyes that they may nor believe the Goſpel. 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>The God of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:001651_0112_0FB523CAD963DCD8"/>
this World hath blinded the Eyes of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Q. <hi>What is it that is offered to theſe Captives?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Not a Mitigation of the Extremity of their Captivity, but Deliverance.</hi> It is a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to poor Captives, to have ſome Pity ſhewed them in their Bondage. Pſal. 106.46. <hi>He made them to be pitied of all thoſe that carried them Captive.</hi> And indeed there is ſome difference among thoſe that are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Captives. Some are made to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance more Drudgery than others: They are made to blaſt their Names, and wound their Conſciences more than others, and they go along faſter in the way to Deſtruction than others: But the thing that God offers to Men in the Goſpel, is not a Mitigation of, but Deliverance from Captivity. Chriſt Jeſus is raiſed up to be a Deliverer, to be a Saviour, and he doth deliver Men. His Work is to deliver them, who through fear of Death, were all their Life-time ſubject to Bondage <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. And this is that which is offered in the Goſpel. He offers to make them Happy
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:001651_0113_0FB523CE4A956D48"/>
that were Miſerable, to ſave them from the power of Satan. Act. 26.18 <hi>To turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> To deliver them from <hi>the power of Darkneſs,</hi> Col. 1.13. He offers to ſet at Liberty, <hi>thoſe that were in Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He doth not offer Deliverance hereafter only, but preſent Deliverance.</hi> God offers the Glory of Heaven to Sinners in the Goſpel; but this is not to be enjoyed at preſent, but they muſt go through ſeveral Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before they come thither. 1 Pet. 5.10. <hi>God has called you to his Eternal Kingdom and Glory after ye have ſuffered a while.</hi> They may have ſome fore-taſts of it now, but they muſt not enjoy it till they Die. But there is a preſent Deliverance offered, he that is effectually called, is <hi>the Lord's Free-Man.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.22. Satan's Dominion is immediately taken away. The Man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſervitude to Satan. 1 Joh. 5.18. <hi>He that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked One toucheth him not.</hi> The Divel may hurry him into ſome Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, but his Lordſhip is taken away, and the Man walks in a way of Holineſs, and has a right to the Tree of Life. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:001651_0114_0FB523D31367E158"/>
is caſt out, and the Man is made an Heir of Heaven, and God is leading him in the way to Glory. Rom. 6.22. <hi>Ye have your Fruit unto Holineſs, and the End ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He don't offer Deliverance for the preſent only, but Eternal Deliverance.</hi> Men that are delivered out of Captivity here, may after a while go into Captivity again, and be in as ſad a Condition as before; but this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance is Eternal. When once they are delivered, they are never brought into ſuch a Captivity again. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays indeed, that <hi>the Law in his Members brought him into Captivity.</hi> Rom. 7.23. The meaning is, That Sin did get ſome Advantage, and Tyrannize over him a while, that he was at times like a Captive; but not as he was before in his natural Condition. He never was a Servant to Sin any more. The Divel may try to recover his Dominion; he acts Craftily, and makes many Aſſaults, and brings the Heart into bad Frames, and leads it into actual Tranſgreſſions, but he has no power over him to make him walk in the way of Deſtruction. Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>being the Sons of God, are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</hi> Rom. 8.14. Satan is very much
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:001651_0115_0FB523D55C6E07C8"/>
reſtrained by God, and all ſuch Perſons are <hi>kept by the power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Q. <hi>On what Terms doth God offer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from this Captivity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>Not upon the Condition of their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Price of their Deliverance.</hi> We can't lay down any Price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Money will not Redeem us, if it ſhould be laid out in Works of Piety or Charity. Math. 16.26. <hi>What ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> Men have no Works to Redeem them; all the Works that they do before their Deliverance, are Sins. They run in Debt, and don't pay their Debts thereby, until they are deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered. They are by all that they do, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Damnation, and not Salvation. They are ſaid to have <hi>no Money,</hi> Iſai. 55.1. Nothing that will paſs in Heaven, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney doth upon the Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor upon Condition of their Recompencing God for it afterwards.</hi> When he delivers Men, he expects that they ſhould <hi>ſerve God in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs all the Days of their Lives.</hi> Luk. 1.74, 75. But this is not the Condition, but part of the Mercy that is offered. Men that are ſenſible of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001651_0116_0FB523D6F77887F0"/>
are ready to promiſe, That if God will deliver them, they will be very Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and ſhew forth his Praiſe: But God don't regard their Promiſes, nor deliver them becauſe they promiſe fairly. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects no Reward from them, as in that Caſe. Iſai. 45.13. <hi>He ſhall let go my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, net for Price nor Reward, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> God requires Obedience as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Debt, and likewiſe in a way of Thankfullneſs for their Deliverance, but not in a way of Recompence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>But on Condition of accepting it as a free Gift through Chriſt.</hi> Deliverance is a free Gift as to us, but Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it. Rom. 6.23. <hi>The Gift of God is Eternal Life, through Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> And we muſt accept it as ſuch. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation is, <hi>to come and take the Water of Life freely.</hi> Rev. 22.17. And we muſt take as it is offered; we muſt make no Alteration in the Terms: God will have his own way: He will not ſell Deliverance to us but he will give it; but he will not give it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without reſpect to any Price, but with reſpect to the Death and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt. And we muſt receive it as he offers it. 1 Pet. 1.21. <hi>Who by him do
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001651_0117_0FB523E05FF56968"/>
believe in God.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, who come unto God by him.</hi> We muſt depend on the Grace of God, as the moving Cauſe, but on the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as the meritorious Cauſe of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Q. <hi>To what purpoſe is this offer made to Sinners, ſeeing they have not Power to accept of it?</hi> Joh. 6.44. <hi>No Man can come unto me, except the Father that ſent me draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>It is no ways fit that Salvation ſhould be forced on them without their acceptance.</hi> In this way they put a great deal of Honour upon God: They Honour the Grace of God, and his Faithfullneſs, and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Rom. 4.20. <hi>Abraham was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi> It is a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for God, and a practical Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Attributes; and in this way they put a great deal of Honour upon Chriſt. It is a Confeſſion that he is the Son of God, and the only Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man; of the Sufficiency and ſaving Virtue of his Death and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: It manifeſts that the Man prizeth Chriſt. 1 Pet. 2.7. <hi>To them that believe Chriſt is Precious.</hi> And in this way there
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001651_0118_0FB523E1818776D8"/>
is a Foundation for a great deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. God is bound now by Covenant to beſtow Salvation, and they are ſecured from Apoſtacy: That they ſhall never fall into a ſtate of Condemnation. Joh. 5.24. <hi>He that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him that ſent him, hath Eternal Life, and ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Condemnation.</hi> The Heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe hereby have ſtrong Conſolation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They can do a great deal in order to their accepting of Deliverance.</hi> They can Pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for it. Prov. 2.3. <hi>They can cry for Wiſdom, and lift up their Voices for Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> God ſaith concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>he Prayeth.</hi> Act. 9.11. They can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Lives, and leave off the Evil Practices that they have been addicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. So they are directed <hi>to forſake their ways,</hi> Iſai. 55.7. They can addict themſelves to ways of Obedience, duties of Piety, and Charity, and Juſtice. They can reſiſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and diſcern that there is no ſufficient Foundation for them; they are able to examine their Hearts, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Falſeneſs of thoſe Pretences that they make to Godly Sorrow, Love and Faith; they are capable to diſcern their Carnal Confidence, and to find out the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001651_0119_0FB523E2E4B13810"/>
Pride and Stubbornneſs of their Hearts: They are able alſo to juſtify God, and under a ſenſe of their own Inſufficiency, wait upon God for his Mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When they do what they can, God gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally makes the offers Powerful.</hi> When they are prepared, God's manner is to open their Eyes. When they have gone as far as they can, God's manner is to put Strength in them, and he will accompany the Goſpel with a Divine Power. <hi>The Goſpel doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Power unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 1.16. He teaches them in that way, and makes them to come to Chriſt. Joh. 6.45. <hi>Every one that heareth and learneth of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> In this way God is Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſome the Breath of Life. Theſe offers of the Goſpel are not in vain, for God doth perſwade many thereby. I Cor. 4.15. <hi>I have Begotten you through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 USE. <hi>See here the great Mercy of God to many Sinners.</hi> He offers Deliverance to them from Spiritual Captivity. Bodily Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, eſpecially among barbarous People, <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> is a great Miſery; but this Spiritual Captivity is much greater. Their Wants are very great; they live a
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:001651_0120_0FB523E458B4BCD0"/>
miſerable Famiſhed Life, they are deſtitute of thoſe Spiritual Comforts that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man craves. They are very much Debaſed, they live in ſuch a way as is beneath the Dignity of Mankind. They indure abundance of Sorrows, and Wounds in their Conſciences. They are expoſed unto great Dangers: God pities them in this Condition, and offers Deliverance to them, when none elſe could do it. He is making a gracious Offer unto them. You are utterly uncapable to deliver yourſelves; you have no ſufficiency to procure your own Liberty. Some that have been Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Men, have got their Liberty by Running; ſome by being Victorious over them; ſome by promiſing Money for their Redemption, but you are under an utter Incapacity to procure your own Liberty. You muſt continue for ever in a miſerable Condition, if God do not ſet you at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: And in this Extremity God offers Deliverance to you. It would not be ſo ſtrange, if your Deliverance would be any Advantage to God, but he gains nothing by it. It is indeed for his Honour to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you; and ſo it would be for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour if he ſhould refuſe to Deliver you:
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001651_0121_0FB523EBC4D9C2A0"/>
But it is no profit to him, he is Bleſſed for ever, whatever becomes of you. Yet he is freely offering Deliverance to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This is offered to you, though you brought your ſelf into this Condition by your Rebellion.</hi> Many Men that are in Captivity, are to be pityed under that Conſideration, That it was not their fault that they are Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: It was not from any Perverſneſs or Indiſcretion of theirs, that they are in ſuch a Condition, but your Captivity is the fruit of your Rebellion. Man was made in an eſtate of Freedom, but we caſt our ſelves into this Bondage by breaking God's Law. We might have lived happily if we would have obeyed, but ventured for the ſake of the <hi>Forbidden Fruit,</hi> to go abreaſt againſt God's Law, and plunged our ſelves into this Miſery. Rom. 3.23. <hi>Man has Sinned, and fallen ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> God might have ſaid, <hi>Seeing they would be Miſerable, let them be Miſerable: They ſhould have known when they were well; their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is no more than they deſerve. Seeing they would ſerve the Divel, let them be his Bond-Men, let them find by Experience, the fruit of their own Folly.</hi> But ſuch is his Mercy, that he has overlooked the Provocation, and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001651_0122_0FB523ED5ADE8270"/>
ſays, as Hoſ. 13.9. <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Though it has coſt him much to make this Offer.</hi> The generality of the great Works of God have not been coſtly to him. When he was to make the World, he ſpake and they were Created; he Commanded and they ſtood faſt; but our Deliverance was coſtly. 1 Cor. 6.20. <hi>We are bought with a Price.</hi> Men are willing to Redeem others out of Captivity, if they can have it for a moderate Sum; but this Deliverance coſt the Blood of the Son of God. In order to it, the Son of God muſt take our Nature: That was great Condeſcention; he ſtooped very low, to take a Nature made out of the Duſt; and in this Nature he ſuffered the Curſe of the Law. It would have been a great Miſery for us to have ſuffered the Curſe of the Law; and it was a great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Son of God to ſuffer that Curſe for us. Though the Divine Nature did not ſuffer, yet it was God that ſuffered. Act. 20.28. <hi>God hath purchaſed the Church with his own Blood.</hi> If that Nature had not been taken into Union with the Son of God, it would not have been ſuch love for God to inflict Sufferings on it; but being
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:001651_0123_0FB523EEE09A5810"/>
United to the Son of God, it was unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love for God to deliver it to Death. Rom. 5.8. <hi>God commendeth his Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, in that while we were yet Sinners Chriſt died for us.</hi> God was at great Expence for our Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He offered this to you before you aſked him.</hi> Some Men would think it time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to offer Men Liberty when they are ſought to, and would make that an Objection, that Men never asked them for ſuch a Favour; but he has prevented you, he did not wait to ſee whether you would fall before him upon your Knees, and with Tears in your Eyes beg Deliverance of him; but he laid the Foundation of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance before you were Born; ſent his Son to Die for you, many Ages before you came into the World, and in early Days offered Deliverance to you, before you had any Thoughts about it. He called on you, before ever you called on him. It would have been an exceeding Mercy to have hearkned to you, and made you ſuch an Offer, after you had with Prayers and Supplications, with ſtrong Crying and Tears ſought unto him for it. But God has been beforehand with you, and before you
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001651_0124_0FB523F29C85E140"/>
ever thought of any ſuch thing, hath ſent the Goſpel to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have no Occaſion to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven (to bring Chriſt down from above) or who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the Deep? But the Word is nigh thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart.</hi> Rom. 10.6, 7, 8. God has brought the Goſpel to your Doors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He offers this to you, after many Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.</hi> You have been greatly Guilty, in blowing on the offers of the Goſpel. You have been like the Deaf Adder. God has called and ſet many Arguments before you, and after time of Conſideration, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his offers; but you have rejected them. Prov. 1.24. <hi>I have called, and they have refuſed: I ſtretched out my Hand, and they have not regarded.</hi> You have delayed him, you have denyed him, you have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted him; yet he perſiſts to make the offer ſtill. <hi>He ſtands at the Door and Knocks.</hi> Rev. 3.20. He might have ſaid, <hi>They ſhould have known when they were well offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; let them learn by their Sufferings, what it is to deſpiſe ſuch Grace. This is not a Mercy to be trampled on, ſeeing they won't have Life, let them have Death.</hi> He might have been diſcouraged from making any more offers
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:001651_0125_0FB523F78069AAC8"/>
to you. He might have ſaid, <hi>It is in vain to call upon them; they are in love with their Servitude and won't. What could I ſay more than I have ſaid? They are ſtubborn willful Creatures, I'll wait no longer on them, the Kingdom ſhall be taken from them.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Provocations, he is ſtill offering Deliverance. After ſo long a time he is ſaying, <hi>To Day while it is called to day, harden not your Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 USE. <hi>Of Reproof to thoſe that don't ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the offer of Deliverance.</hi> Accepting the offer is a ſecret Thing, and I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know who hath not accepted; but if we be not better than the <hi>Jews,</hi> few have accepted. Chriſt Complains of this, Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that you may have Life.</hi> Luk. 14.18. <hi>They all with one Conſent began to make Excuſe.</hi> And there be many Evidences againſt ſome Men, that Affront to God, that you don't accept. He might well expect that you ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it with Thankfullneſs. Chriſt makes great Complaint of them, Mat 23.37. <hi>I would have gathered thy Children together, as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:001651_0126_0FB523F96DA201C0"/>1. <hi>In ſome, it is becauſe they are not afraid of the Miſery that Satan is leading them unto.</hi> Some Men are not much afraid of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. They have cauſe to be afraid; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of ſuch as they, are gone to Hell. The Sinners of the Old World are there; they were Diſobedient in the Days of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and now <hi>their Spirits are in Priſon.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.19.20. God threatens them with Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>The Chaff ſhall be burnt up with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Fire.</hi> Math. 3.12. Many others have been afraid. Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Sinners in Zion are afraid, Trembling takes hold of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</hi> The Divels are afraid. Jam. 2.19. <hi>The Divels believe and Tremble.</hi> It is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thing to looſe Heaven, and all the Good of that, and endure the Pains of Hell. It is ſtrange that Men that can't bear the Aking of a tooth, make light of going to Hell: But many through Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and Flattery, are not afraid, and ſo they don't regard the offers of Deliverance, but are caſting horrible Contempt upon the Grace of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In ſome, it is from love to that Drudgery that Satan puts them to.</hi> They love their Sins; they love to ſerve the World; they love to indulge their Luſts: Their Luſts
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:001651_0127_0FB523FAD88C7838"/>
are like a Right Eye: They ſay as they, Jer. 2.25. <hi>I have loved Strangers, and after them I will go.</hi> They have little Reaſon to be fond of their Service; 'tis baſe and low, beneath Rational Creatures. They do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave their Souls of Comfort: It Wounds their Conſciences; it expoſes them to Wrath. They might live Pleaſantly, and Honourably, and ſo as is agreeable to Conſcience. The benefit of ſerving God is very great. Pſal. 19.11. <hi>In keeping thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is great Reward.</hi> But they don't know how to part with their Sins; they are bewitched with the World, and their Life is bound up in Carnal Enjoyments, and they are not willing to be delivered: they are naturalized to their Sins, and it is like Death to part with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In ſome, it is from their not believing that God will deliver them.</hi> Some cry for Deliverance, but don't accept the Offers. They are Fearful and Unbelieving. Rev. 21.8. They ſcare themſelves, becauſe of the Anger of God; they ſcare themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Threatnings of the Word, and becauſe of the badneſs of their Hearts. They hear that Chriſt has ſatisfied Juſtice for Sin; that God is willing to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:001651_0128_0FB524026AF0C858"/>
to Sinners, but they dare not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture themſelves on Chriſt; they think if their Hearts were better, and they could Bleed freely for their Sins, and had a more fervent Spirit of Love to God, his Heart would be mollified towards them, and he would be more inclinable to give Salvation to them: But as they are, they dare not accept, they think it would be Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without all Reaſon, they call in Queſtion the Word of God. One would think God's Word ſhould ſatisfy them. Pſal. 12.6. <hi>The Words of the Lord are pure Words.</hi> But they dare not depend upon Gods Word: They doubt that we don't underſtand the Meaning of it, and that it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with ſome Limitations that we are not aware of.</p>
            <p n="3">3 USE. <hi>Of Exhortation to thoſe that have accepted this Offer, Rejoice in this Deliverance that God has beſtowed on you.</hi> You have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and do receive the Offer, and God hath done according to what he offered, and you are delivered: Rejoice in this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You are delivered from ſervitude to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> He is Tempting of you ſtill, and leads you into a great deal of Tranſgreſſion, as he Tempted <hi>David</hi> to Number the People

of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yet you are not his Servants, his Dominion is taken away, and he is under Reſtraint, and cannot Govern you as he did. It is a dreadful Thing to be a Slave to Satan. Thus it is with all Ungodly Men; they are the Seed of the Serpent; they are the Children of the wicked One. Math 13.38. <hi>The Tares are the Children of the wicked One; they are of their Father the Divel, and his Luſts they will do.</hi> Joh. 8.44. But you have changed Maſters, and now ſerve the living God. You are now <hi>deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from the power of Darkneſs, and turned from Satan unto God.</hi> Act. 26.18. And do maintain a Warfare againſt the power of Darkneſs. Eph. 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World, againſt Spiritual Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in High Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You are well provided for.</hi> Many Men having nothing to Refreſh their Hearts but Carnal Things, they are in a ſtarved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; they are Pining for want of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; but the Caſe is altered with you. You <hi>draw Water out of the Wells of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Iſai. 12.3. You can ſit <hi>under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt with Delight, and his Fruit is

The Fleſh of Chriſt is <hi>Meat indeed,</hi> and his Blood is <hi>Drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;</hi> and you have a great deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that. And while other Men have nothing to cover them but the rotten Rags of their own Righteouſneſs, your Souls are beautified and adorned with the Robes of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; and Chriſt Jeſus ſays of you, as Cant. 4.7. <hi>Thou art all Fair my Love, there is no Spot in thee.</hi> And God ſays of you, Ezek. 16.14. <hi>Thy Beauty is perfect through my Comlineſs which I have put upon thee, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>God is leading you unto Glory.</hi> You are on this ſide Heaven, and have many Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but your Salvation is ſecured.

The Glory of Heaven is very great; it will bring Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; it exceeds all the Glory of the World, more than the Light of the Sun doth the Light of Rotten Wood: And God will not ſuffer you to fail of this. Your Expectations as to ſome Worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may fail, but God will lead you in the very way to Glory. Pſal. 73.24. <hi>Thou

Sometimes they cannot ſee from the want of Light, or from the Interpoſition of ſome Opake Body; But Blindneſs riſeth from ſome Default in the Body. 2. A Spiritual Blindneſs, when Men cannot ſee God, or any Spiritual Thing. Thus it is with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Men. 3. Epiſt. Joh. 11. <hi>He that doth Evil, hath not ſeen God.</hi> Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou art Poor, and Blind, and Naked.</hi> This Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be the greater, by reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted evil Habits, and the Temptation of Satan. 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not.</hi> 2. What he was to Preach, <hi>viz. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Sight. Adam</hi> had Spiritual Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but we have loſt it, and muſt have our Sight recovered. <hi>Q.</hi> How was he to Preach the Recovery of Sight? He was not properly to offer it to them, though he offers further degrees of Sight to his People. Rev. 3.18. <hi>I Counſel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, white Raiment, and to anoint thy Eyes with Eye-ſalve, that thou mayſt ſee.</hi> Yet he muſt ſee before he can come to Chriſt.

            <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>They that live under the Preaching of the Goſpel, have an opportunity to have their Eyes opened.</hi> It is one of the great Miſeries of Mankind, that they are Blind; and it is a great Priviledge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Sight. There is opportunity for this, by the Preaching of the Goſpel. Thoſe that live in Heatheniſh Darkneſs, have no opportunity to have their Eyes opened. They that belong to the viſible Kingdom of Darkneſs, do alſo belong to the inviſible Kingdom of Darkneſs. But they that have the Light of the Goſpel ſhining among them, have an opportunity to have their Eyes opened. All that live under the Preaching of the Goſpel, have not the like opportunity. In Chriſt's time, they had a greater opportunity than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The more clearly and powerfully it is taught, the greater is the opportunity: But where it is taught, there is an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.

There is a clear Explication of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God's Nature, of the loſt Eſtate of Man, of the Work of Redemption by Chriſt; his Perſon, his Offices, his Humiliation, and his Exaltation, and of the Covenant of Grace, and the Condition of Salvation. 1. Cor. 2.10. <hi>God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.</hi> Yea, theſe Things are not barely told, but there is a great deal of Evidence and Demonſtration of them: So that hereby Men come to have a Literal Knowledge of them, even of all things that are needful to Salvation. 2 Tim. 3.15. <hi>The Holy Scriptures are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> Yea, Men have ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of them, as makes them concerned to get a ſpiritual Underſtanding of them.

This is one great Help: The Object that they ſhould ſee, is fairly preſented before them in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They have a Conviction ſet before them, that they are Blind.</hi> In the Goſpel, there is a Declaration of Man's Blindneſs. There is a Divine Teſtimony that Men are Blind. Men naturally are Ignorant of it, but God gives Witneſs to it. Eph. 4.18. <hi>Having their Underſtandings darkned, being alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the Blindneſs of their Heart.</hi> Beſides, there they may learn how they come to be Blind, that by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> their whole Nature is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Rom. 3.23. <hi>Man has Sinned, and has fallen ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> And as the Will is depraved, ſo the Mind likewiſe. It is made Evident alſo from hence, that God has made great Proviſion that we may recover our Sight. He has made it the Office of Jeſus Chriſt, to give Light and Underſtanding to us. Iſai. 49.6. <hi>I will give thee alſo to be a Light unto the Gentiles.</hi> Joh. 9.39. <hi>For Judgment came I into the World, that they that ſee not, might ſee.</hi> He ſhews our Blindneſs by the ſorrowful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, living a Sinful and Corrupt
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:001651_0136_0FB524169854FD18"/>
Life. He teaches us, That they that know him, will truſt in him, love and obey him; and that they that do live otherwiſe, do not know him. He that ſaith, <hi>I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</hi> And hereby he ſhews us our Blindneſs, in revealing things that our Reaſon and Conſciences tell us muſt be ſo. And yet we cannot ſee nor believe them. There is ſuch Evidence, that we muſt ſay, it can't be otherwiſe: And yet we are not able to give Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to them. We are ſilenced, yet not convinced.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They are directed what to do, that they may ſee.</hi> We are taught, that we muſt Pray to God to open our Eyes. A ſeeing Eye, and an hearing Ear, the Lord is the maker of them both. Men are ready to think that they ſhall get the Knowledge of God and Chriſt, by improving their Natural Reaſon, by Study and Conſideration; that they can argue themſelves into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Spiritual Things: But it is quite beyond them, and they muſt be brought to beg it of God. Prov. 2.3. <hi>They muſt cry for Wiſdom, and lift up their Voice for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> The Goſpel ſhews that it is
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:001651_0137_0FB5241F33EFF5A0"/>
Gods Work to give Underſtanding. Eph. 1.17. <hi>That God would give you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him.</hi> Again we are directed to wait upon the Preaching of the Word, <hi>To wait at the Gates of Wiſdom.</hi> Prov. 8.34. So we are taught, Rom. 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Hearing by the Word of God.</hi> We are directed alſo to ſubmit to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God. It is plainly told us, that <hi>God hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy.</hi> Rom. 9.15. He is not bound to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon; he is at liberty either to leave them to Blindneſs, or to open their Eyes. They can bring God under no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to give Light to them: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it is their Duty to ſubmit to his ſovereign Pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They are under an Indefinite Promiſe of having their Eyes opened.</hi> After all, this is needful, that God ſhould convince Men of the certainty of Spiritual Things; and God has made Promiſes of that. He is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Engagement to particular Perſons, but he hath promiſed that Chriſt ſhall be a <hi>Light to the Gentiles.</hi> Iſa. 49.6. That is ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light. So he has promiſed it to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to encourage them in their Work. Math.

This ſhews, that he is engaged to beſtow this Mercy upon a Number, where he doth ſet up his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and accordingly it is the manner of God, to give Spiritual Light and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to ſome; and this ſhews, that they that live under the means of Grace, have an opportunity of recovering their Sight. They are under an hopeful Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to enjoy this Mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1 USE. <hi>Of Reproof to thoſe that don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Opportunity.</hi> It is great Folly, not to improve Opportunities. It is the Wiſdom of Men to watch for Opportunities. 1 Kin. 20.33. <hi>The Men did diligently obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing would come from him, and did haſtily catch it.</hi> And it is great Fooliſhneſs to neglect them. Prov. 17.16. <hi>Wherefore is there a Price in the Hand of a Fool to get Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

when he hath no Heart to it?</hi> It was <hi>Jezebel's</hi> fault that ſhe neglected it. Rev. 3.21. <hi>I gave her a ſpace to Repent, and ſhe Repented not.</hi> A Seaſon for Worldly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſhould not be loſt through Careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sloth. Opportunities for Peace, and Health, and Liberty ſhould not be loſt. So Opportunities to get Spiritual Wiſdom and Underſtanding. Thoſe that don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, are Adverſaries to themſelves. They don't conſult their own Good: They will bewail the loſs of them, and cry out of their Madneſs in not improving them. That will be one Aggravation of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Men hereafter, that they had glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opportunities, but did not improve them. Other parts of their Puniſhment will be the greater, and the Reproaches of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be the more.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They that don't cry to God to open their Eyes.</hi> Some Men for Form-ſake, put up ſuch Requeſts to God; but they don't cry Earneſtly, nor follow God with ſecret Prayer. God may ſay of ſome Men, Iſai. 43.22. <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me, O Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, thou haſt been weary of me, O Iſrael.</hi> And Complain of many as he doth, Iſai. 64.7. <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that

ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> Theſe Perſons may thank themſelves, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Darkneſs. God may well ſay, <hi>If Light be not worth Praying for in their Eſteem, let them go without it.</hi> Theſe Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their Miſery: If they were Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, they would cry Earneſtly to God, as he, Luk. 18.38. <hi>He cryed, ſaying, Jeſus, thou Son of David, have Mercy on me.</hi> Theſe Men have not only Blind Minds, but hard Hearts. They are under the power of a ſtupid and inſenſible Spirit. They have not only a great deal of Blindneſs, but they have contracted a great deal of Blindneſs. They want common Illumination. God gives many Bleſſings to Men without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but they ſhall ask for this Mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do receive it. It is a Contempt upon God, and an Undervaluing of the Bleſſing, not to ask it of him. If they hold their Tongues, God will hold his Hand. Theſe Men are Blind at preſent, and that is their Miſery; and they will continue Blind, and that is a greater Miſery</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as will not be convinced of their own Blindneſs.</hi> It may be, they do pray to God to open their Eyes; but they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced how Blind they be. They are told,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:001651_0141_0FB5242C21827DC0"/>
that they muſt <hi>become Fools, that they may be Wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.18. But they ſay as, Joh. 9.40. <hi>Are we Blind alſo?</hi> They are not convinced that they are totally Blind; they think they ſee ſomewhat of the Evil of Sin, and of the Faithfulneſs of God, and of the Divinity of Chriſt. They are not convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they cannot recover themſelves. They hope by Degrees to Work it out; and by Reading and Study to force it: But in very deed, you muſt ſee your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery before you find the Remedy. Men that are Blind, are uncapable of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conviction of it, while they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Blind; but they muſt have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Conviction of it. If you depend upon your own ſufficiency to get Sight, God will ſay, <hi>Let them do it if they can.</hi> His way is to convince ſuch Men of their Blindneſs before he helps them. Rev. 3.17. He ſays, <hi>Thou art Blind:</hi> And then V. 18. Encourages, that he <hi>will anoint their Eyes with Eye-Salve that they may ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 USE. <hi>See hence, that the Preaching of the Goſpel is a very great Bleſſing.</hi> Some Perſons have no great eſteem for it. It is Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and it doth diſquiet their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and they never got any Spiritual

Good by it: But indeed it is a very great Bleſſing. It is a Mercy to hear good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and the Goſpel is ſo, Rom. 10.15 <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of them that Preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things! David</hi> was very Thankful for the Word of God, Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He hath ſhewed his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, and as for his Judgments, they have not known them, Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> And the Apoſtle cryes up this Priviledge. Rom. 3.1, 2. <hi>What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then hath the Jew, and what profit is there of Circumciſion? Much every way: Chiefly, becauſe unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> The ſtate of many Nations is Doleful, becauſe they have not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. And it is not without Cauſe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bleſs God for the Goſpel. It is to be prized upon this Conſideration, That Men have an Opportunity thereby, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of their Sight. In this way it is very Serviceable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This is Pleaſant.</hi> 'Tis a delightful thing to have the Eyes open. Ecl. 11.7. <hi>Truly the Light is Sweet, and a pleaſant Thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> It is pleaſant
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:001651_0143_0FB5243021EBBB28"/>
to ſee Palaces, and Navies, and Cities, and Armies; it is pleaſant to an Hungry Man to ſee Bread, to the Thirſty to ſee a Fountain of Living Water, to a purſued Man to ſee a Caſtle. When Mens Eyes are opened, they ſee things that are <hi>Wonderful.</hi> Pſal. 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may ſee wondrous Things in thy Law. David</hi> longed to ſee more. Pſal. 63.2. <hi>To ſee thy Power and Glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> The Sight of Chriſt, is a Glorious Sight: So the Sight of the Mercy and Faithfullneſs of God; no Worldly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are to be compared unto them. It is worth the while to go through a great deal of Trouble, for a Sight of Jeſus Chriſt. The Angel ſends Word to the Diſciples, that <hi>Chriſt would go before them into Galilee, and there they ſhould ſee him.</hi> Math. 28.7. It is worth the while to take a great Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for a Sight of Chriſt. Phil. 3.10. <hi>Paul's</hi> Heart was in it, <hi>that he might know him, and the Power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings.</hi> When the Wiſe Men ſaw the Star that directed to Chriſt, <hi>they rejoiced with exceeding great Joy.</hi> Math. 2.10. The Sight of Jeſus Chriſt is a beautiful Viſion. The very Reaſon why
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:001651_0144_0FB52432A2F353A0"/>
Mortal Man can't <hi>ſee God and live,</hi> as it is ſaid, Exod. 33.20. is becauſe ſuch a Sight of God as Saints have in Heaven, would occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo much Joy, as would be outbidding to the Nature of Man. The greateſt Delight of Man, muſt needs lie in the Exerciſe of his ſuperiour Faculties, Underſtanding and Will, upon the moſt glorious Objects. It is a muſt pleaſant Thing, to enjoy ſpiritual Light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It Sanctifies the Heart.</hi> You complain of an hard Heart, a rebellious Heart, a worldly, and an envious and ſtubborn Heart, but the opening of your Eyes will help you. The Sight of God and Jeſus Chriſt has a great deal of power to Sanctify you. When you ſee God, you will truſt in him. Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> The reaſon that Men are ſo backward to truſt in Chriſt, is not becauſe they know themſelves to be ſo bad, but becauſe they are Ignorant of God and of Chriſt. When they ſee God and Chriſt, they ſee the Foundation of Faith; what abundant Encouragement there is to put their truſt in him. When they ſee God, they will love him. The Excellency of God has a magnetick Power to draw the Heart.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:001651_0145_0FB52433E1DD3080"/>
Before they ſee him, they can't love him, whatever Arguments are uſed with them: and when they ſee him, they will love him, whatever Temptations they have. Pſal. 91.14. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my Name.</hi> If your Sight be recovered, you will ſee the reaſon of all ſpiritual Duties. When Men ſee the hatefulneſs of Sin, they will hate it. The knowledge of God will make Men Upright. Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving Kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy Faithfullneſs to the Upright in Heart.</hi> Then Men are Upright, when they ſerve God for his own ſake, and that they will do when they ſee his Worthineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It ſecures Eternal Life.</hi> If a Man be ſecure of Eternal Life, that will make Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions eaſy; that will make Enjoyments more ſweet; that will make Duties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; that will make Death Comfortable and Profitable, and if Mens Sight be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, Eternal Life will. They will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have the Knowledge of it, but they will be in a ſafe Condition. Blind Men won't find the way to Heaven; but when their Eyes are opened, they will ſee the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:001651_0146_0FB5243B8D2FABE0"/>
way. They that have the Light of Grace, ſhall have the Light of Glory. The Light of Grace and Glory are of the ſame kind, though not in the ſame degree. Thoſe that God makes ſpiritually Wiſe, are Wiſe unto Salvation. They that have this Viſion will not Periſh. If God ſhews Men the Path of Life, they will be brought into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>where there is fullneſs of Joy, and to his right Hand, where are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Pſal. 16.11. <hi>Happy is the Man that findeth Wiſdom, and the Man that getteth Underſtanding.</hi> Joh. 17.3. <hi>This is Eternal Life to know thee the only true God, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 USE. <hi>Of Examination, whether you have received this benefit of the Goſpel.</hi> You are Thankful to God for the Goſpel, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in your Prayers bleſs God for it. And you pity thoſe that have not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but what are you the better for it? Have you recovered your Sight? You have got abundance of Knowledge by it, and are able to Diſcourſe very Underſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about it. You increaſe continually in Rational Knowledge; this may be, and yet you may remain ſpiritually Blind. There are but a few that are recovered. There

are but a few that are bodily Blind, and there be but a few but are ſpiritually Blind. It may be you have Illuminations, and yet are Blind.</p>
            <p>Signes are, 1. <hi>Common Illumination is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, but when the Eyes are opened, Men are convinced.</hi> Common Illuminations do ſometimes greatly affect. Men are glad and taken with them, and they are Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Math. 13.20. <hi>He that received the Seed into ſtony Places, is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it.</hi> Gal. 4.15. <hi>Where is then the Bleſſedneſs you ſpake of? for I bear you Record, that if it had been poſſible, you would have plucked out your own Eyes, and have given them to me.</hi> But theſe Illuminations don't convince, them of the Truth of the Goſpel, and of the ſureneſs of the Grace of God: But when Mens Eyes are opened, they are convinced: They are indeed affected, but that is not all; but God teaches and ſhews them the Path of Life. Pſal. 16.11. <hi>They are taught of God, and learn the truth of the Goſpel.</hi> Joh. 6.45. They have the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation.</hi> Eph. 1.17. <hi>The Father that is in Heaven reveals Chriſt to them.</hi> Math. 16.17.

and <hi>they receive it as it is indeed the Word of God.</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13. They don't ſee a probability, but a certainty in the Doctrines of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Common Illumination diſcovers one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Thing, but when the Eyes are opened, they ſee all the Foundations of Faith.</hi> In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illuminations, they ſee ſometimes that God is Gracious. Sometimes they have a ſenſe that Heaven is Glorious. Luk. 14.15. <hi>One that ſat at Meat, when he heard thoſe Things, ſaid, Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat Bread in the Kingdom of God.</hi> Sometimes that there is a great Saviour. Math. 13.20. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non with Joy he receiveth it.</hi> That the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Salvation are Pleaſant. Gal. 4.15. But when their Eyes are opened, it is Light all about them. Then they ſee that there is an Eternal God; that he is of free Grace, and that his Word is Faithful; that Chriſt Jeſus is the Son of God, the only Mediatour; that he hath ſatisfied Juſtice; that he is able <hi>to ſave to the uttermoſt;</hi> that he invites the Soul; that in him all Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells. The Soul is ſatisfied as to the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel. He can't think of all things at once, but he ſees that this is the very way of Salvation. <hi>He knows

God and Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 17.3. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the whole Goſpel. The Light that he has, is the <hi>Light of the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Common Illumination many times works a Confidence, that works a Dependance.</hi> When Men have common Illuminations, they don't work in that way to make them rely on the faithful Offers of God, and roll themſelves on Chriſt. But on that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they ſay, God is theirs, and Chriſt is theirs, and they promiſe themſelves Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but they don't accept the Calls and Invitations of the Goſpel, and relinquiſh all their own Righteouſneſs, and truſt in Chriſt, as offered to them, but catch at ſome Promiſe as if it were theirs. They are Thankful to God, but when the Eyes of Men are opened, they ſee an offer of Mercy and accept of it. They ſee God calling and inviting them: They ſee an open Door ſet before them, and that God is ſending a Meſſage of Mercy to them. He ſhews them the way of Life, and the propoſals of Mercy, and they conſent to the Invitation, and cloſe with God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and yield Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Goſpel. They ſee an Offer made to them, and they are required to
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:001651_0150_0FB52442A6C66058"/>
receive it, and the Will is bound to cloſe with it, as that which is Safe and Glorious. There is an Aſſent of the Underſtanding, and a Conſent of the Will. The Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on Chriſt, as a Man would venture his Life in a ſtrong Caſtle. So he makes Chriſt his Refuge. <hi>He flees for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope that is ſet before him,</hi> Heb. 6.18. After this, he reflects on what he has ſeen and done, and thence there ariſeth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. The Call of God works firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and afterwards a Confidence. Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Common Illumination ſometimes makes Men to depend in part on Chriſt; but when the Eyes are opened, they depend upon him alone.</hi> Men receive ſome common Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and they think that Chriſt is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for ſuch Penitent Humble Sinners as they, and ſo they depend partly upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and partly upon Chriſt. They truſt partly in the Law, and partly in the Goſpel. They depend partly on Works, and partly on Chriſt. The Apoſtle declares againſt that; he ſays, Rom. 11.6. <hi>If by Grace, then it is no more of Works: Otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. If of Works, it is no more
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:001651_0151_0FB52447AE9F0730"/>
Grace: Otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> Such as have only common Illuminations, take their firſt Encouragement from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hope that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt will make up their Defects. But thoſe whoſe Eyes are opened, do truſt in Chriſt alone. Phil. 3.3. <hi>We Rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no Confidence in the Fleſh.</hi> They ſee a ſufficiency in Chriſt Jeſus, and make that, together with God's Grace and Faithfulneſs, the whole Foundation of their Faith. Rom. 4.5. <hi>They believe on him that juſtifieth the Ungodly.</hi> They have no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on any thing of their own.</p>
            <p n="4">4. USE. <hi>Of Advice to thoſe whoſe Eyes are opened, to uſe this Mercy well.</hi> God hath bleſſed the Goſpel for the recovery of your Sight, and thereby has laid a Foundation of Bleſſedneſs in you. God has made you more Happy, than many Men that make a greater Figure in the World than you do. In the Day that God opened your Eyes, he opened a Door to you to ſuch Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as cannot enter into the Heart of Man to Conceive of.

               <pb n="153" facs="unknown:001651_0152_0FB52448E6937D00"/>Particularly, 1. <hi>Don't Darken your Eyes again</hi> Indeed you can't put out your own eyes. 1 Joh. 2.27. <hi>The Anointing that you have received of him, abideth in you.</hi> Yet you may much Darken your own Eyes. There be two ways wherein you may do it: One is by carnal Reaſoning. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Men become Vain in their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and ſo their fooliſh Hearts are darkned. Sometimes they argue from the greatneſs of their Sins; as if their Sins were too big or too many for God to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. They limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as if their Sins did exceed God's Mercies; as if God could not find in his Heart to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome their Provocations; or as if Chriſt's Blood were not of Value enough to expiate their Guilt. Sometimes they argue from the Juſtice of God, as if he muſt avenge himſelf upon them; as if their Sufferings would give better Satisfaction to the Law, than the Sufferings of Chriſt: As if it would be a deluding of the Law to acquit them on the account of the Death of Chriſt. Sometimes they argue from the greatneſs of Heavenly Glory, as if it were too much for God to be willing to beſtow. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they argue from the fewneſs of thoſe
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:001651_0153_0FB5244A5DE38510"/>
that are ſaved, as if there were no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that they ſhould be of that Number; and ſo they ſet their uncertain Reaſonings againſt the infallible Word of God. They ſet Appearances and Conjectures againſt the ſure Word of Prophecy. The other way wherein Men Darken their Eyes, is by Unbelief. God Encourages them to come to Chriſt, but they don't know that it is God that ſpeaks: The Word doth not come with a divine Authority upon their Heart. They are not ſenſible that the Words are the Words of a Faithful God. They don't know the certainty of what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Chriſt upbraids his Diſciples for this, Luk. 24.25. <hi>O Fools, and ſlow of Heart to believe thoſe Things that the Prophets have Written.</hi> They don't know what to make of the Encouragement of the Word. They looſe the ſenſe of the Glorious Faithfulneſs of God, who ſpeaks in his Word. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief brings a Miſt before the Eyes. You muſt maintain the exerciſe of Faith, as <hi>David</hi> when he ſays, <hi>The Words of the Lord are pure Words; like Silver tried in a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Earth, purified ſeven Times.</hi> Pſal. 12.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Get your Sight increaſed.</hi> As the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light increaſes more and more unto
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:001651_0154_0FB5244BDC36A800"/>
the perfect Day, ſo you muſt be careful to grow in ſpiritual Knowledge. 2 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And there be two ways of increaſing it, both hinted in Eph. 1.17. <hi>That God would give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him.</hi> One way is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reaſoning and Arguing. There be many Arguments whereby we may be eſtabliſhed in thoſe Truths that are the Foundation of Faith. Many things that clear it up, that the Scriptures are indeed the Word of God; that Chriſt Jeſus is the Son of God; that his Sufferings ſatisfy for our Sins; that we ſhall certainly be ſaved in a way of Beliving; by Muſing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering theſe things, we may be further eſtabliſhed in the Truth, and be confirmed in the belief of the way of Salvation by Chriſt. As carnal Reaſonings ſtrengthen Unbelief, ſo Spiritual Reaſonings do ſtrengthen Faith. The other way is by ſpecial Diſcoveries. This is called Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Not ſuch as the Prophets had, but ſometimes the Spirit of God breaths in with much Light into the Heart; the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is drawn, the Vail is laid aſide, and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:001651_0155_0FB524539E3C3048"/>
there be raiſed Acts of Faith, whereby he ſees both the Reality and Glory of Goſpel Truths. Sometimes God diſcovers, that God delights to ſave Sinners by Chriſt; that he is free to accept the Soul; that Chriſt is now in Glory at the right Hand of God; that the Promiſes of the Goſpel are True and Faithful. This <hi>David</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to, Pſal. 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine Eyes, and I ſhall behold wondrous Things in thy Law. The Sun of Righteouſneſs doth appear to them, with Healing in his Wings.</hi> Mal. 4.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Walk as Children of the Light.</hi> This is required, Eph. 5.8. <hi>You were ſometimes Darkneſs, but now are you Light in the Lord: Walk as Children of the Light.</hi> God may well expect it that you ſhould walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Light that he hath given you. If Things be indeed as you have ſeen them, what manner of Perſons ought you to be in all holy Converſation and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? If God be Glorious as you have ſeen, Powerful, Merciful, Faithful, then you ſhould truſt in him in all your Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and not give way to a diſcouraged Spirit, but be Rejoycing in the Covenant of God. If Jeſus Chriſt be an All-ſufficient
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:001651_0156_0FB5245500017ED0"/>
Saviour as you have ſeen, you ſhould not be afraid to put your truſt in him, but ſhould Rejoice in him, when you have the ſenſe of your own Unworthineſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. If God be ſuch a Glorious Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as you have ſeen, you ſhould be weaned from the World, nor have a craving, violent Spirit after outward Enjoyments, like Men that have nothing elſe; but you ſhould have an Heavenly Converſation, and be taken up in the Conſideration of the Glory of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and be thirſting after the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. If God be ſo great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as you have ſeen, you ſhould be very obedient to his Voice. If there be ſuch wonderful Grace in the Goſpel, you ſhould be quickened to all Duties of Obedience, deny Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts; and live Godly, Righteouſly and Soberly in this preſent World. It is a great Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, for Perſons whoſe Eyes have been opened, to carry as others. 1 Theſ. 4.5. <hi>Not in the Luſt of Concupiſcence, as other Gentiles that know not God.</hi> God was Angry with <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe he forſook the Lord that had appeared unto him twice. 1 Kin. 11.9. ſpiritual Knowledge leads to ſpiritul Practices. The Doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel do greatly advance Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="158" facs="unknown:001651_0157_0FB524565A6ACD58"/>4. <hi>Seek to God, that the Eyes of others may be opened.</hi> When a Man's Eyes are opened, he ſhould long that the Eyes of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould be opened upon a double Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. One is, that the Gloriouſneſs of God and Chriſt Jeſus may be ſeen. It is a ſorrowful Thing, that Men ſhould have ſuch low Thoughts of God and Jeſus Chriſt, who deſerve ſo much Eſteem. Men have diſhonourable Thoughts of them, and caſt a great deal of Contempt upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reaſon. It is greatly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that they judge aright of them. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Experience that he has had, what a miſerable Condition Men are in that are Blind. Some are Sottiſh and Senceleſs: Some are Tormented in Conſcience, and both ſorts in danger of eternal Ruine. Theſe Conſiderations ſhould make ſuch a Man to be in Pain for others, for Children and Neighbours: And there is great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be imploring of God, that he would open their Eyes. There is a great deal of Encouragement in the many Promiſes that God has made. There be Promiſes to Chriſt, and Promiſes to the Church, and Promiſes to Miniſters. Theſe Things ſhould be pleaded with God. God has done great
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:001651_0158_0FB52457D84D63C8"/>
Things in Anſwer to the Prayers of his People. It is a Thing pleaſing to God, that his People have this upon their Hearts. Let this be often remembred when you come before God, that the Preaching of the Goſpel may not be in Vain, but that many among us, Children and others, may recover their Sight; as the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> Prays for his Servant. 2 Kin. 6.17. And <hi>Eliſha</hi> prayed, and ſaid, <hi>Lord I pray thee open his Eyes that he may ſee.</hi>

Them that are Bruiſed.</hi> In <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it is them that are Bound. Men that are Bound with Fetters, are many times hurt and galled with them. Pſal. 105.18. Speaking

of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Whoſe Feet they hurt with Fetters, he was laid in Iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How he is to help them.</hi> viz. By <hi>ſetting them at Liberty.</hi> In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> it is, the <hi>opening of the Priſon.</hi> He is to free them from their Bonds; to give Liberty and Enlargement unto them. In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he is ſaid, <hi>to Preach the opening of the Priſon;</hi> but here he is ſaid <hi>to ſet at Liberty.</hi> So that he doth not only offer Liberty, but by the Goſpel effect the Liberty of them that are Bruiſed.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>The Goſpel doth ſet many at Liberty that were in the Condition of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</hi> Many Men are not the better for the Goſpel, but the worſe; but it is very Profitable unto ſome. They are naturally in a very ſorrowful Condition; they are like Priſoners: But by the Goſpel they are ſet at Liberty. Such ungodly Men as are Dead, are in Priſon. 1 Pet. 3.19. And ſuch ungodly Men as are Living, are in Priſon alſo. But God by the Goſpel, has ſet many of this latter ſort at Liberty. Some that are ſenſible that they are in ſuch a Condition, take other ways to get their Liberty, but they will miſs their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But by the Goſpel, many Priſoners have been ſet at Liberty. Iſai. 42.6. <hi>I will

give thee for a Covenant of the People, for a Light of the Gentiles; to open the blind Eyes, to bring out the Priſoners from the Priſon, and them that ſit in Darkneſs, out of the Priſon-Houſe.</hi>

            <p>Q. <hi>How are Sinners in the Condition of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>They are Guilty of many Crimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Men are ſhut up in Priſon, it is generally either for Debts or for Crimes; ſo ungodly Men are very Criminal: They are Tranſgreſſors of the Law; they came Sinners into the World. Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> And as they grow up, they become more Guilty. They are Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sins of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion:</hi> Of Sins in Thought, Word and Deed. They are Guilty of Sins by Perpetration, and by Participation with others: Sins againſt the Law, and againſt the Goſpel. They are very Guilty, and liable to the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law. They have been led away with Temptation. The Corruptions of their Hearts work very Powerfully in them. Rom. 7.5. <hi>When we were in the Fleſh, the Motions of Sins which were by the Law, did work in our Members to bring forth Fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:001651_0161_0FB524631BB9BF70"/>
Death.</hi> And tho' ſome of them are under great Reſtraints, yet their Hearts are Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Iniquity. Job 15.16. <hi>How much more Filthy and Abominable is Man, who Drinketh in Iniquity like Water?</hi> Jer. 6.7. <hi>As a Fountain caſteth out its Waters, ſo ſhe caſteth out her Wickedneſs.</hi> Mens Sins are more than the Hairs of their Heads. The moſt moral Man is far from being Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. God hath a great deal to charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. They Sin daily, and their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are infinite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They are reſerved to Judgment.</hi> The Evil Angels are reſerved in the Chains of God's Providence to the Judgment of the great Day. Jud. 6. As Priſoners are kept in Durance, that they may be forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Aſſizes, ſo theſe Men are bound over unto Judgment, and preſerved that they may appear when God calls for them. They are preſerved from Annihilation, and kept by God unto that time. They are not diſcharged from their Guilt, but God has them in hold, that they may be brought forth when he calls for them. Some of them could be glad to be turned into their firſt nothing, but that will not be allowed. They are kept by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:001651_0162_0FB52464AEC06240"/>
of God, ready to appear at God's Tribunal at the firſt Call. Men that are kept in Priſon, are ready to be brought forth at any time when the Judge calls for them. They are not ſuffered to wander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that they can't be found; ſo theſe Men are kept in a readineſs to make their Appearance. <hi>There is an appointed Time to them,</hi> Job 7.1. God calls for ſome of them in younger Days, Job 36.14. <hi>They Die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean.</hi> And ſome in elder Days, they are never to ſeek, God has them always in hold.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They are ſecured from making their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.</hi> Priſoners are wont to be in Chains, Pſal. 105.18. <hi>He was laid in Iron.</hi> So <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 12.6, 7. <hi>Peter was Sleeping between two Soldiers, bound with two Chains.— And his Chains fell off his Hands.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were ſecured, <hi>their Feet were made faſt in the Stocks,</hi> Act. 16.24. So Sinners are under ſuch Bonds, that they cannot make their Eſcape. The Law binds them over to Puniſhment. 1 Cor. 15.56. <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law.</hi> And they can't free themſelves from that Obligation. If they could ſatisfy the Law, they might be at Liberty, but they
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:001651_0163_0FB524685AE75FF8"/>
cannot. Wealth will not do it. Math. 16.26. <hi>What ſhall be given in Exchange for the Soul?</hi> Their Works will not do it. Rom. 3.20. <hi>By the Works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh living be juſtified in the ſight of God.</hi> Calamities and Sufferings will not do it. They are but the beginning of Sorrws. Rom. 6.23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> And they are fettered with their own Corruptions. There is a way to eſcape, if they could believe in Chriſt they ſhould be delivered; but they are <hi>ſhut up in Unbelief,</hi> Rom. 11.32. They are like a Man bound down, that he cannot ſtir Hand or Foot. They are not able to make uſe of their Opportunity. They are wholly under the Power of their Corruption. Joh. 5.44. <hi>How can you Believe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They are committed to a Jailor.</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are committed to the Cuſtody of the <hi>Keeper of the Priſon.</hi> Gen. 39.21. And the Jailor many times keeps the Priſoners at Work. Judg. 16.21. <hi>Samſon did Grind in the Priſon-Houſe.</hi> And many times he uſes them hardly, Act. 16.24. So ungodly Men are committed to Satan as their Jailor, and he is ſuffered to Tyrannize over them. He keeps them hard at Work, and Rules over them. He is a <hi>Prince over them.</hi> Eph. 2.2.
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:001651_0164_0FB5246BABBA1B68"/>
They are Servants to him. He makes ſome of them to walk in ways of Debauchery. They Lye, and Steal, and commit Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He makes others Drudges to the World and their Pride. He keeps them buſie at Work, and many times Afflicts them, and Frights them with Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Poverty and Diſgrace, and Loſſes, and Calamities; and if they are labouring after their Eſcape, he Torments them. Sometimes he Terrifies them that their Day is paſt; that they have committed the unpardonable Sin; that God has given them up to hardneſs; that if they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Convictions, and mind eternal Things, they will be Diſtracted, or ſo Diſtreſſed, that they will be forced to lay violent Hands on themſelves.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Goſpel ſet them at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>The Diſcoveries of the Goſpel do encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Sinners to accept of the Liberty that is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> God is offering Liberty in the Goſpel; and theſe offers by the Bleſſing of God, do prevail upon many Souls. 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>I have Begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth.</hi> Men are wont to make
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:001651_0165_0FB5246E861EB238"/>
many Objections againſt the Calls of God; but when they have the ſpiritual Diſcovery of the Goſpel, it prevails upon the Heart, and conquers all the Oppoſition of the Soul, and the Men come to Chriſt. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men are convinced of the Glory of Chriſt, and of the Truth of the Goſpel, their Will is gained, and they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to come to Chriſt. Joh. 6.45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> There is Encouragement enough in the Goſpel, and when their Eyes are opened to ſee it, they cannot tarry away from Chriſt. They will come without any delay. They ſee that they may ſafely come. The Goſpel baniſhes the Fears that they were under. When they ſee the Goſpel, they prize Chriſt; they love to come; it pleaſeth them to depend upon him. Then they are afraid to ſtay away, and neglect their Opportunity any longer, they ſhould be Enemies to their own Souls if they ſhould. Rom. 1.16. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sentence of the Goſpel doth diſcharge them from their Bonds.</hi> When the Sinner has accepted the offer, he hath performed
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:001651_0166_0FB5246FD86F91C8"/>
the Terms of the Covenant, and now the Sentence of Condemnation is taken off. Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Debt is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, and all his Sins are pardoned. Act. 10.43. <hi>And to him give all the Prophets Witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> The Law looks on him as Innocent; the Man is brought into an eſtate of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Adoption. Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, we have Peace who God.</hi> Joh. 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> They are declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heirs of Life, Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the Son, hath everlaſting Life.</hi> Now the Man has Security under God's Hand, that he ſhall be ſaved. His Obligation to ſuffer the Wrath of God is taken off. The Word of God gives Judgment for him, that he is not Guilty. God don't deny to Pardon him. God don't leave the Matter in Suſpence whether he ſhall be pardoned or not. He don't defer to do it, but in the ſame Minute gives him an Acquittance from all his Guilt. Act. 13.39. <hi>All that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified from all things, from which
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:001651_0167_0FB52474550CC758"/>
they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> And then God delivers them from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan, they are no longer under his Cuſtody; he is not their Jailor; he Tempts them ſtill, but they are not in his power as they were. Satan is laid under greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints than formerly, and not ſuffered to Tyrannize as he did. They are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Guardianſhip of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Hebr. 1.14. <hi>Are they not all Miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to Miniſter to them that ſhall be Heirs of Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 USE. <hi>Of Reproof to thoſe that don't make this Uſe of the Goſpel, that they may be ſet at Liberty.</hi> Some take Notice of their Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and are beſtirring of themſelves that they may be ſet at Liberty. They are not diſcouraged, though they find Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the way, and are ſenſible of the uncertainty of the Event, but take a great deal of Pains. If they ſhould obtain it, they will be happy Men; but this is not the Caſe with all: Some don't regard to make Improvement of their Time: They are very much to blame. It is a great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg to be ſet at Liberty. This was Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with a great Price, as he ſays, Act. 22.28. <hi>With a great Sum obtained I this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:001651_0168_0FB524774DDF3D30"/>
Chriſt Jeſus was <hi>Anointed of God to Preach this.</hi> Iſai. 61.1. But ſome Men don't make Uſe of the Goſpel to get Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but make a very contrary Uſe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some make Uſe of it only to get Notional Knowledge.</hi> Some read the Scriptures, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Preaching of the Goſpel, ſtudy the Controverſies that are in the World about Matters of Religion, that they may get Notional Knowledge; and they are puffed up with that. 1 Cor. 8.1. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up.</hi> They take delight to know what Men ſay, to be able to Diſcourſe about thoſe Things, and to diſpute againſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. They love to be able to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what one Party and the other has to ſay for their Opinions. They are like the <hi>Greeks that ſought after Wiſdom.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.22. They are not willing to be Ignorant of the Scriptures: They are willing to ſee the Reaſon of what is taught, and to be able to vindicate their Profeſſion, but don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to get this Liberty. They neglect the great deſign of the Goſpel: They don't anſwer God's end in ſending the Goſpel. Can they imagine that God's deſign was to fill the Heads of Men with Notions, and to gratify an inquiſitive Humour?
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:001651_0169_0FB5247B223BA430"/>
Surely God's deſign was to deliver Men from Miſery. Theſe Men neglect that which makes the Goſpel Profitable: They caſt off the care of the Wellfare of their Souls, and neglect bleſſed Advantages to be Happy. It is juſt as if a ſick Man ſhould diſpute about the Compoſition of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that will Cure him, and neglect to take it and ſo die. Or as if a Man ſhould Labour to ſatisfy his Curioſity about the Dimenſions and Materials of a Caſtle, and neglect to put himſelf into it, and ſo Periſh. All thoſe that dont receive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel will ſurely Periſh. Heb. 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Some make Uſe of it to harden their Hearts in Sin.</hi> This is the way of many Men; they hear that God hath a deſign of Grace; that he hath ſent Chriſt to ſuffer for our Sins; that great Sinners may be pardoned; that the Threatnings are only Conditional in caſe of final Impenitency; and they take occaſion to harden their Hearts in Sin, Jud. 4. <hi>They turn the Grace of God into Laſciviouſneſs.</hi> They think there is no great danger; they are not afraid of the Juſtice and Jealouſy of God, becauſe
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:001651_0170_0FB5247D8C5B1218"/>
he offers Pardon to them; they think that he loves them, becauſe he freely offers Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to them; they think there is not much Evil in Sin, becauſe God offers Pardon, they think he will continue ſo to do, and he will wait upon them, and ſo they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their Hearts, and are bold to indulge themſelves in Sin, and in no haſt to turn to God. This is unreaſonable. <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with God, that he may be feared.</hi> Pſal. 130.4. But theſe Men ſay, <hi>There is forgivneſs with God, therefore he is not to be feared.</hi> But though there is a way of Salvation, yet many that hear it, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for it. Multitudes go from under the Light of the Goſpel to the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs. 2 Cor. 4.3. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi> It is a <hi>Savour of Death unto Death to many Men.</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. The Mercy of God will not Affront his Juſtice. Men ſhall have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Reproach that, Exod. 34.7. Though he is Gracious and Merciful, yet <hi>he will by no means clear the Guilty.</hi> Theſe Men turn the Goſpel into Poyſon to them; and if they continue to harden their Hearts in Sin, they will as ſurely Periſh, as if there were no Goſpel, as if Chriſt had
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:001651_0171_0FB5247F148C1220"/>
never come into the World. What will the Goſpel ſignify to them that reject it? The Blood of Chriſt will not Heal, where it is not applied.</p>
            <p n="2">2 USE. <hi>See how great a benefit the Goſpel is to many Men.</hi> Indeed there be a great many Men that are not the better for it; they have bought Bibles, and have Read often in them, and heard the Goſpel preached, but they are not the better, but the worſe for it. It had been better for them, if they had never heard a Sermon, never ſeen one Leaf of the Bible, if they had lived in <hi>Turkey.</hi> Math. 11.22. <hi>It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment, than for them.</hi> But it is very beneficial to others: It is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them, than all the Wealth of the World would be. They are ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty thereby. Luk. 4.18. <hi>It ſets at Liberty thoſe that were Bruiſed.</hi> Such as were in the Condition of Priſoners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are delivered from the danger of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> Wo to thoſe Men that ſhall be condemned at the laſt Day. They ſhall be curſed with a Witneſs. You have the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Math. 25.41. <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:001651_0172_0FB5248299195AA0"/>
his Angels.</hi> But theſe Men are out of the reach of that Curſe. They are in danger of ſome ſmaller Calamities, Pains, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Reproaches, Loſſes, but not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. The Day of Judgment will be a Glorious and Comfortable Day to them. That is a time of Refreſhing from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord. There ſhall not be one Hair of their Head ſinged, nor the ſmell of Fire paſs upon them. There is abundant Security that they ſhall not be Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They are made meet for Heaven; they are become the Children of God: They are intereſted in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: They have the Covenant of Grace to ſecure them: Death will do them no hurt; they ſhall be abſolved in the Day of Judgment. Joh. 5.24. <hi>They ſhall not enter into Condemnation, but are paſſed from Death to Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Expectation of Condemnation.</hi> Many Men are in a dreadful Condition, becauſe of the Expectation of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are a Terrour to themſelves. Job 15.21. <hi>A dreadful Sound is in their Ears.</hi> They are under an Expectation to hear Chriſt ſaying, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> They are afraid by Day and by Night;
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:001651_0173_0FB5248602C6D0C0"/>
afraid when they Work and when they Eat. This takes away the ſweetneſs of all their Enjoyments: Nothing that they have is any great Comfort to them. But thoſe Men that are ſet at Liberty by the Goſpel, are delivered from theſe Expectations: They have their Hours of Temptation, and long for more Aſſurance, but their Conſciences are healed. Rom. 5.1, 2. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: By whom alſo we have acceſs by Faith into this Grace wherein we ſtand, and Rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God.</hi> They have a great deal of Comfort under their Afflictions, under this Conſideration, that God hath delivered them from Wrath to come. And ſometimes they can ſay as <hi>Job,</hi> Job 19.25, 26, 27. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that though Worms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh I ſhall ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine Eyes ſhall behold,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They are delivered from Satan's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He is permitted to Afflict them, and Tempt them, and caſt in fiery Darts, yet his Government is taken away, he is caſt out. They are reſcued out of his Hands, <hi>turned from the power of Satan,</hi> Act. 26.18.
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:001651_0174_0FB5248A833292B0"/>
They are delivered out of the <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs,</hi> that is Satan's Kingdom. Col. 1.13. And God will tread Satan under their Feet ſhortly. Satan is under greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints than he was, and they are forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt his Temptations more than they were; and they are committed to the care of the holy Angels, who are doing many good Offices for them. Heb. 1.14. <hi>They are miniſtring Spirits to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 USE. <hi>Of Examination, whether you be ſet at Liberty by the Goſpel.</hi> Some Men need not trouble themſelves to make any nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſearch, for it is a plain Caſe that they are not ſet at Liberty; but there are two ſorts that need to examine this Matter. Some Men have ſome Fears and Jealouſies of themſelves, yet have preponderating Hopes: And ſome Men are not without Hopes, yet have preponderating Fears. It concerns both theſe ſorts accurately to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Thing. Men may hear the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yet not be ſet at Liberty by it. Many that hear the Word deceive themſelves. They may have a large underſtanding of the Goſpel, yet not be ſet at Liberty by it. Men may be affected with it, yet not be ſet at Liberty by it. Men may be ſtirred up
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:001651_0175_0FB5248C962CF0E0"/>
to reform their Lives, yet not be ſet at Liberty. There be but a few comparatively that are ſet at Liberty by it, therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
            <p>Signs, 1. <hi>Have you ſeen the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Goſpel?</hi> God is ſaid to be the Authour of the Goſpel, and therefore it is called the Goſpel of God. Rom. 1.1. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated unto the Goſpel of God.</hi> It is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Faithfulneſs of God. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of it are Gods, and the Promiſes of it are Gods; and you are able to evince it by ſeveral Arguments that God is the Authour of it; but have you ſeen the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of it? Men never ſee it to be infallibly true and certain, until they ſee the Divine Authority of it. They can't indeed believe it, whatever Perſwaſion they have of it, till they hear the Voice of God in it; then they ſee the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it, when they receive it not as the Judgment of Wiſe and Good Men, but as it is <hi>indeed the Word of God;</hi> and they are convinced that it is the Word of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Ye received it as it is indeed the Word of God, which worketh effectually in you that believe.</hi> Joh. 5.25. <hi>The Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God and
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:001651_0176_0FB5248E5C146290"/>
Live.</hi> When the Authority of God in the Goſpel is ſeen, then Chriſt appears Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and promiſes Certain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Have you felt a divine Power with the Goſpel?</hi> There is a divine Power going with the Goſpel to ſome Men. 1 Cor. 1.23. <hi>Chirſt is the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God.</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation.</hi> The Goſpel where it ſets Men at Liberty, has a Power to draw Men to Chriſt. Some Men complain that they are not able to come to Chriſt; they would do it but they have not Liberty; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is a Power to draw the Heart: It has a prevailing Power over all Fears and Objections. Joh. 6.45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> If the Arm of the Lord be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men will believe. Iſai. 53.1. When Men's Eyes are opened to underſtand Chriſt and his Death and Reſurrection, thoſe Doctrines come with Power upon the Heart. Phil. 3.10. <hi>That I may know him, and the Power of his Reſurrection.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>He hath begotten us to a lively Hope, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead.</hi> So there is a regenerating Power in the Goſpel, it
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:001651_0177_0FB5249071BB6648"/>
doth powerfully diſpoſe their Hearts to love and fear God; and they will hate their Sins, and caſt off the Works of Darkneſs, and live all their Days in a way of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p n="4">4 USE <hi>Of Exhortation. Labour in it, that you may be ſet at Liberty by the Goſpel.</hi> If there were no Hope of being ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it would be a vain Thing to ſtrive in it; but though it be Hopeleſs for Men that are damned, yet it is not Hopeleſs for you. It is uncertain whether you will ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Liberty, but yet there is Hope of it. Sometimes the Thing appears very Dark to you; but whatever Difficulty there be in it, yet it is poſſible. You have taken ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Methods that you might be ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but hitherto you have been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and indeed you muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it by any other Means but only by the Goſpel. Labour therefore that you may be ſet at Liberty by that. You ſay your preſent Condition is Doleful, and you dread to continue in it, but there is Hope of Deliverance by the Goſpel. Chriſt Jeſus has purchaſed Deliverance; he has paid a ſufficient Price for your Redemption. He gave his Life a Ranſom for many. 1 Cor.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:001651_0178_0FB52492CF3D4E60"/>
6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a Price.</hi> And God offers Deliverance to you through him. Iſai. 61.1. He Proclaims the <hi>opening of the Priſon to them that are Bound.</hi> And God has promiſed that ſome ſhall be ſet at Liberty by him. His Work is, <hi>To bring out the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners from Priſon, and them that ſit in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of the Priſon-Houſe.</hi> Iſai. 42.7. Yea, many Perſons have been ſet at Liberty Formerly and Laterly by the Goſpel. There has been a great deal or Experience of the Efficacy of the Goſpel this way. Col. 1.13. <hi>He hath delivered us from the power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> Let then this be your Care, that you may be ſet at Liberty by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>DIRECTIONS, 1. <hi>Don't ſeek ſlightily.</hi> This is the fault of many Perſons, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, Luk. 13.24. <hi>Many ſeek, and are not able to enter.</hi> That is complained of, Iſai. 64.7. <hi>There is none that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> Some Men ſeek, but it is with too much indifferency of Spirit. <hi>The Violent take the Kingdom of Heaven by force.</hi> Math. 11.12. But many Men are dull in their Prayers; they are not Earneſt and Importunate with God; they are not
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:001651_0179_0FB52497923898B8"/>
Diligent in Reading and Hearing, that they may learn Advantages and take them; that they learn their Diſadvantages and avoid them. They don't watch againſt Temptations; they comply with ſome Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices that are an hindrance to them: They excuſe themſelves many times from that which might promote their Converſion. Though they deſire Converſion, yet their Hearts are much upon the World; they lay too much weight on worldly Things; their Hearts are divided between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon.</hi> It is no great Wonder that ſuch Men don't obtain; lazy Seekings iſſue in Diſappointments: Lazy Seeking will not conquer Difficulties. Yea, when they ſeek ſlightly, they provoke God to deny them. God may ſay, <hi>It will not break their Hearts if they be denied.</hi> The Reaſon why many People ſeek after a ſlight Manner, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not much afraid of going to Hell. Either they want a ſenſe of the Dreadfullneſs of Damnation, or flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as if they were in no eminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it. If they were thoroughly ſcared, they would be more earneſt in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; Senſeleſſneſs begets Slightlineſs. If their Conſciences were ſo wounded that
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:001651_0180_0FB52499E0128E58"/>
they could not bear it, they would be more violent in their Endeavours. The Pretence that thay make for their Dullneſs, is, that they are afraid there is no Hope for them; they fear their Caſe is deſparate, and that weakens their Hearts, and makes them to be diſpirited; but the true Reaſon is not that they want Hope, but they want Fears. If the <hi>Terrours of Death did compaſs them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the Pains of Hell get hold upon them,</hi> they would not ſay, <hi>There was a Lyon in the Way,</hi> but would be forcing their Way through all Diſcouragements and dark Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Don't imagine that you muſt get ſome Excellency to prepare you for Chriſt.</hi> Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us are principled in that, that Faith is the Condition of Salvation, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, is the meritorious Cauſe of it: But they imagine that they muſt get ſome Excellency to prepare them for Chriſt. They think they may not come to him till they have make their Hearts better. They muſt love God, and be ſorry for their Sins, and make the Glory of God their End. They muſt delight in Sabbaths, and ſo they are ſtriving to make their Hearts better, and if that were attained,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:001651_0181_0FB5249BC3AC71E8"/>
they hope that God would not be ſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them; he would be more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pity them, and ſave them through Chriſt; and they labour to dreſs up their Hearts, and to get lovely Qualifications to draw God's Heart towards them. They think it would be a preſumptious Thing for them to thruſt themſelves on Chriſt, and on the Grace of God until they be better, and ſo they ſtrive to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better. They hear that there muſt be Preparation for Chriſt, and that there muſt be a Work of Humiliation before Faith, and they ſtrive after ſuch an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation as has an Excellency in it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to God. They quite miſtake Humiliation; but if ever you would obtain Chriſt, you muſt ſee the badneſs of your own Hearts. As long as you are reaching after any Excellency in your ſelves, you will reject Chriſt. You muſt ſee your ſelf <hi>Poor,</hi> Rev. 3.17. Before ever <hi>Paul</hi> came to Chriſt, <hi>Sin revived and he died.</hi> Rom. 7.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Don't give way to an objecting Spirit againſt the Goſpel.</hi> We Read of ſome that the Goſpel was hid unto: <hi>That the God of this World had blinded their Minds.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:001651_0182_0FB524A2507B0A38"/>
3, 4. And we Read, that <hi>Chriſt Crucified, was to the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks Fooliſhneſs.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.22. One great Thing that keeps Men from Chriſt is, that Satan and their own Hearts are filling of them with Objections againſt the Goſpel. Sometimes they argue as if God had not Mercy enough to Pardon their Sins. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are arguing as if it were uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether the Scriptures were the Word of God. Sometimes they argue from the differing Opinions that are in the World about the way of Salvation. Sometimes they are ſtumbled at the Afflictions of thoſe that believe on Chriſt. Sometimes from the Falls of thoſe that make a great Profeſſion. Sometimes from the outward Meaneſs and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt. Such Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Heart, are a great hindrance to Mens receiving of the Goſpel. While Men entertain ſuch Objections, they ſtrengthen their Unbelief, and keep themſelves from a preparedneſs to entertain the Goſpel. Men that do indulge themſelves in a Luſt of objecting againſt the Goſpel, do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves from receiving it. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes Unbelievers, that <hi>they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and obey not the Truth.</hi> Rom. 2.8.
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:001651_0183_0FB524A46DAEFDF8"/>
Unbelief is naturally Blindneſs, but if Men give way to an objecting Spirit, they thereby contract further degrees of Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are more oppoſite to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Goſpel.</p>

            <p>HERE is another Expreſſion of the Service of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to give No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the acceptable Year of the Lord. This ſeems to be an Alluſion to the Proclaiming of the <hi>Year of Jubilee,</hi> ſpoken of, Lev. 25.9. <hi>Then thou ſhalt cauſe the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Jubilee to Sound on the tenth Day of the ſeventh Month.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is to be underſtood by a Year?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Sometimes a Year is taken properly for that time wherein the Sun is fullfilling its Courſe,</hi> 365 <hi>Days.</hi> But ſometimes it is taken
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:001651_0184_0FB524A5D8C33BC0"/>
for an indefinite Time, be it longer or ſhorter. Iſai. 34.8. <hi>For it is the Day of the Lords Vengeance, and the Year of Vengeance for the Controverſie of Zion.</hi> So a Day is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for an indifinite Time. Iſai. 2.12. <hi>For the Day of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is Proud and Lofty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why is it ſaid to be the acceptable Year of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Epiphanius takes it to be a Year wherein the Lord was acceptable unto Men, and ſaith, That the firſt Year of Chriſts Miniſtry was pleaſing, but afterwards they took Offence.</hi> But this is a Miſtake; for they took Offence this very Day. Luk. 4.28, 29. <hi>All that were in the Synagogue when they heard theſe things, were filled with Wrath, and and roſe up and thruſt him out of the City, and led him unto the brow of the Hill whereon their City was Built, that they might caſt him down Headlong.</hi> But the Meaning is, The Year of God's good Pleaſure and Favour, with the reſpect to the Preaching the Goſpel <hi>to the Poor, the healing the Broken-hearted,</hi> &amp;c. the clear Preaching of the Goſpel, and the ſaving Efficacy of it.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>There are ſome ſpecial Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherein God doth in a remarkable Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:001651_0185_0FB524A788DF02E8"/>
revive Religion among his People.</hi> God doth not always carry on his Work in the Church in the ſame Proportion. As it is in Nature, there be great Viciſſitudes; there is Day and Night, Summer and Winter; the Moon Waxes and Wanes, the Sea Flows and Ebbs, and as it is in the civil State, there is a time of War and a time of Peace, times of Plenty and times of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, times of Health and times of Sickneſs, ſo it is in the Church. There are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the Hearts of Men are made hard. Iſai. 63.17. <hi>Why haſt thou hardned our Hearts from thy Fear, and made us to Err from thy ways?</hi> So there be times wherein there is a plentiful Effuſion of the Spirit of God, and Religion is in a more flouriſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Math. 11.12. <hi>From the Days of John the Baptiſt, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by force.</hi> Iſai. 44.3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, &amp; my Bleſſing on thy Offſpring.</hi> Ezek. 11.19. <hi>And I will give them one Heart, and I will put a new Spirit within you, and will take the Heart of Stone out of your Fleſh, and will give you an Heart of Fleſh.</hi> The like we have, Ezek. 36.26.</p>

               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:001651_0186_0FB524ACD00E84F8"/>Q. <hi>How is it with a People when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is revived?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>Saints are quickned.</hi> It contributes much to the flouriſhing of Religion, when Righteous Men flouriſh in Holineſs, as it is foretold, Pſal. 92.12. <hi>The Righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palm-tree, they ſhall grow like the Cedar in Lebanon.</hi> There be times of Temptation, when godly Men are in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Condition. Math 25.5. <hi>While the Bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbered and ſlept.</hi> They grow Worldly, and Proud, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and don't maintain much of the Life of Godlineſs. And there be times when their Hearts are lifted up in the ways of God, as is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.6. <hi>When the Weak are as David.</hi> When their Souls are in a proſperous Condition, and they are in gracious Frames of Spirit, going on from <hi>Strength to Strength.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they run the ways of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, becauſe God enlarges their Hearts. Pſal. 119.32. It is as with them, 2 Theſ. <hi>Your Faith groweth exceedingly, and the Charity of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth.</hi> This mightily increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Holineſs among a People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sinners are Converted.</hi> God makes the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:001651_0187_0FB524AEAFC6F8E8"/>
Goſpel at times to be very Powerful. So it was in the Primitive times, Rom. 15.29. <hi>I am ſure when I come unto you, I ſhall come in the fullneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel was written for the End <hi>that Men might believe and be ſaved.</hi> Joh. 20.21. And it is preached for that End; and ſometimes God gives great Succeſs to it. Act. 26.18. <hi>I ſend thee to open the blind Eyes, to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> So <hi>John's</hi> Preaching was very much bleſſed. Mal. 4.6. <hi>He ſhall turn the Heart of the Fathers to the Children, and the Heart of the Children to their Fathers.</hi> This is Old and Young. There is a mighty Change wrought in a little Time: They that were Dead, are made Alive, and they that were Loſt are Found. The Goſpel is made a <hi>ſavour of Life to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Sometimes there is great Complaint for want of this. Pſal. 12.1. <hi>Help Lord, for the godly Man ceaſeth; the Righteous fail from among the Children of Men.</hi> So Iſai. 53.1. <hi>Lord, who hath believed our Report? and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> At other times the Number of Saints is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multiplyed. Act. 9.31. <hi>The Churches were edified, and walking in the fear of the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:001651_0188_0FB524B173038648"/>
Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt were multiplyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Many that are not Converted, do become more Religious.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> there was a mixt Multitude that went with them. So when God is pleaſed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a Number, there be many others that have a common Work of the Spirit on their Hearts; they are affected with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Reform their evil Manners, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in Religious Duties, and attain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Zeal, and are full of Religious Affections. So it was in Chriſt's time; there was great flocking about him. So by the Preaching of <hi>John</hi> many were affected. Luk. 3.10, 12, 14. <hi>The People ſaid, What ſhall we do? And the Publicans what ſhall we do? And the Soldiers what ſhall we do?</hi> When God works ſavingly upon ſome, it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that others have common Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, whereby great Reformation is wrought, and the Reputation of Religion advanced, and People are diſpoſed to keep the external Covenant; and ſo much Wrath is prevented.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Work of God in reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, you may obſerve theſe Four Things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:001651_0189_0FB524B362B95BC8"/>1. Obſervation. <hi>This reviving is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more General and ſometimes more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> It is more General, when it is throughout a Country, when in all Parts of a Land there is a turning to God. That was propheſied of, Ezek. 36.25, 26, 27. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean Water upon you, &amp; ye ſhall be clean from all your Filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you,</hi> &amp;c. So it was about <hi>Luther's</hi> time, when ſome Nations broke off from <hi>Popery,</hi> and imbraced the Goſpel. Sometimes the Country doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Decline. Gal. 3.1. <hi>O Fooliſh Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi> But ſometimes this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving is more Particular, when in ſome particular Towns Religion doth revive and flouriſh. So 2 Theſ. 1.3. <hi>Their Faith grew exceedingly.</hi> Rev. 3.8. <hi>Thou haſt a little Strength, and haſt kept my Word, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied my Name.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> were in a declining Way: As ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it Rains upon one City, and doth not Rain upon another. Am. 4.7. So it is with God's Raining Righteouſneſs. There is many times a great difference in the ſame Country; There is a Blaſt upon Corn in one part of a Land, when it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in another: So it is in this Caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:001651_0190_0FB524B4E1B349F0"/>2. Obſervation. <hi>This reviving is ſometimes of longer, and ſometimes of ſhorter Continuance.</hi> Sometimes Religion flouriſhes in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for a great many Years together. So it did for twenty nine Years in the Days of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> 2 Chron. 29.1. So when God pours out his Spirit, ſometimes the Work continues many Years. It began in <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt's</hi> time, and continued ſeveral Years after the Death of Chriſt. Math. 11.12. <hi>From the Days of John the Baptiſt until now, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> Compare this with Joh. 5.25. <hi>The time is coming, and now is, when the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God and live.</hi> But ſometimes it is for a leſs ſpace. We have reaſon to think that there was much of the converting Preſence of God in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> for the ſpace of a Year and half. Act. 18.9, 10. Sometimes it is not ſo long. There is a great ſtirring for a little time, and then it fails. Though the ſame out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means continue, yet there is not that Bleſſing going along with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſervation. <hi>God is very Arbitrary in this Matter.</hi> The People of God are Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Waiting for this Mercy Hab. 3.2. <hi>O Lord, revive thy Work in the midſt of the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:001651_0191_0FB524B746436C90"/>
Years, in the midſt of Years make known; in Wrath remember Mercy.</hi> Pſal. 85.6. <hi>Wilt not thou revive us again, that thy People may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thee?</hi> But God will take his own time for this Mercy. As the Angel ſtirred the Waters of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> at ſome certain Seaſons, and they waited for that time, Joh. 5.4. ſo it is in this Caſe. There is a ſtated time for the riſing of the Sun, and for the ſetting of the ſame, and ſo for the return of the Spring; but the returns of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are very Arbitrary. Sometimes God puts his People to wait longer for them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not ſo long: It is in this Caſe, as it is with the inward Conſolations of godly Men. God takes his own time to Refreſh their Hearts, and Seal them up to the Day of Redemption. No Man can tell before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand when the Work of God ſhall Proſper in this or that Place. Act. 1.6, 7. <hi>It is not for you to know the Times and the Seaſons that the Father has put in his own Power.</hi> When God hardens a People, none can tell how long that ſhall be. Iſai. 6.11. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lord, how long? And he anſwered, Until the Cities be waſted without Inhabitant, and the Houſes without Man, and the Land be utterly deſolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="193" facs="unknown:001651_0192_0FB524BC20204228"/>4. <hi>It is beyond us to determine what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deſign God hath in it at this or that time.</hi> When God Converts a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber among a People, we know that the deſign is to prepare them for Salvation. Act. 3.19. <hi>Repent and be Converted, that your Sins may be blotted out, when the times of Refreſhing ſhall come from the Preſence of the Lord.</hi> But what his particular Deſign is in that Work we cannot tell. It may poſſibly be to prepare the Place for ſome great Temptation, that they may ſtand in a time of great Tryal that he may bring upon them; that they may be ſtrengthned and not deny his Name: Or it may be to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for ſome Affliction that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to bring upon them, that they may carry the better under it: Or it may be to lay a Foundation for Mercy for the next Generation, that there may be a Number that may uphold the power of Godlineſs in time to come. Or it may be to gather in his Elect, before he removes the Means of Grace, and takes away his Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="1">1 USE. <hi>Learn from hence, that the Church of God is ſubject to great Changes.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Religion flouriſhes, and ſometimes it languiſhes. It is indeed ſo with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:001651_0193_0FB524BEC52F83C0"/>
Souls: Sometimes they go on from Strength to Strength, and their Hearts are lifted up in the ways of God. They are like <hi>Green Olive-Trees in the Houſe of the Lord, they flouriſh like the Palm-Tree, they grow like the Cedar in Lebanon.</hi> And at other times they are in a ſlumbering Condition; they are like ſick Men that are unfit for Service, like Trees in Winter. So it is with the Church of God; there is but little of the preſence of God among them; there is a great ſcarcity of Godly Men; Iniquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, and the Love of many waxes Cold. At other Times Religion is the great thing that is minded; Men are <hi>taking the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven with Violence:</hi> They honour their Profeſſion, and their Light ſhines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, ſo that they <hi>Glorify their Father that is in Heaven.</hi> Religion is in great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and there goes a great Bleſſing with the Ordinances of God. It is as Cant. 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>The Winter is paſt, the Rain is over and gone, the Flowers appear on the Earth, the time of the ſinging of Birds is come, and the Voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land; the Fig-tree putteth forth her Green Figs, and the Vines with the tender Grape give a good Smell: Ariſe my Love, my fair one &amp; come away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="195" facs="unknown:001651_0194_0FB524C06B0A43C8"/>1. <hi>When the Church is in a flouriſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, we muſt not lot upon it that they will always be ſo.</hi> If it be a time of Plenty in a Land, yet the Caſe may be much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after a while, as it was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 41.53, 54. If it be a time of Health, there may be after a while a ſickly Time. So if Religion flouriſheth, it doth not follow that it will always do ſo. There may come a Time of Hardning: God may withdraw his Spirit: Many Temptations may ariſe: There may be a Change of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Religion may be buried in the Graves of old Men. A Field that was wont to flouriſh with Corn, may come to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown with Thorns. <hi>A fruitful Land may be turned into Barrenneſs.</hi> Pſal. 107.34. Religion flouriſhed in the time of <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> but it withered in the time of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</hi> It flouriſhed in the time of <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> but it withered in the time of <hi>Menaſſeh.</hi> Many times there riſes up another Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>that know not the Lord.</hi> Judg. 2.10. The People embrace corrupt Principles, &amp; addict themſelves to bad Practices, and the Spirit of Religion is much loſt in a little Time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When the Church is in a withering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:001651_0195_0FB524C26291E638"/>
we muſt not conclude that it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo.</hi> If Iniquity prevails much among a People, and they don't regard the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God's Word, don't make Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Judgments, but <hi>go on every one in his own way, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battle,</hi> the Goſpel is made light of, and Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and other Wickedneſs increaſe in the Land, and the <hi>whole Head is Sick, and the whole Heart Faint,</hi> yet it doth not follow that it will be always thus, and that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will be loſt, and the Kingdom of God be taken from them. Sometimes it is ſo, but it doth not from thence appear that it will be ſo: All that are Sick dont Die; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may recover; Holineſs may get up again; there may be a flouriſhing Summer after an hard Winter. Religion revived in the Time of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and in the Time of <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> There may in a little time be another Face of Things; God may raiſe up Inſtruments, and bleſs their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the recovery of Religion. Hoſ. 14.5, 6, 7. <hi>I will be as the Dew unto Iſrael; he ſhall grow as the Lilie, and caſt forth his Roots as Lebanon. His Branches ſhall ſpread, and his Beauty ſhall be as the Olive-Tree, and his Smell as Lebanon. They that dwell under his Shadow
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:001651_0196_0FB524C635A2CDF0"/>
ſhall return, they ſhall revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine; the Scent thereof ſhall be as the Wine of Lebanon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 USE. <hi>We ſhould beg of God, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may revive in this Land.</hi> We have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to go before God for many Things: We have need to beg Peace, and Health, and Plenty; but eſpecially we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be earneſt with God for this Mercy. This is a Thing of greateſt Conſequence. When God pours out his Spirit on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are Days of great Mercy. Iſai. 54.11, 12, 13. <hi>Oh thou aflicted and toſſed with Tempeſt, and not comforted, I will lay thy Stones with fair Colours, and lay thy Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Sapphires. I will make, thy Windows of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbuncles, and all thy Borders of pleaſant Stones. And all thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Land is ſecured from Degeneracy. Many are fitted hereby to keep God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Hereby a Way is made for outward Bleſſings: Hereby a Foundation is laid for Salvation. Men ſhould not Pray for this in a formal Way, but with <hi>Groanings that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered.</hi> Pſal. 90.16, 17. <hi>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants, and thy Glory unto
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:001651_0197_0FB524C8A2BC2A88"/>
their Children. And let the Beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and eſtabliſh thou the Work of our Hands, yea, the Work of our Hands eſtabliſh thou it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider, 1. <hi>There is great need of this.</hi> For want of this, the Land is mightily Corrupted, and Sin prevails greatly in all Places, and the Profeſſion that Men make is diſhonoured. Strangers are ready to ſay, <hi>Is this the City that Men call the Perfection of Beauty, the Joy of the whole Earth?</hi> As Lam. 2.15. For the want of this, there is ſo much Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, many are like Birds and Beaſts of Prey. For the want of this, there is ſo much Luxury and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs. For want of this, there is ſo much breach of Promiſe, Sabbath-breaking and Prophaneſs. If Men fear God, it would not be ſo. Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my Fear in their Hearts, that they ſhall not depart away from me.</hi> For want of this, there are ſo many Judgments. Judg. 2.10. <hi>And there aroſe a Generation that knew not the Lord.</hi> And <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>And the Anger of the Lord was hot againſt Iſrael.</hi> And for want of this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lie in a periſhing Condition. Joh. 3.3. <hi>Except a Man be Born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="199" facs="unknown:001651_0198_0FB524CB28A50F50"/>2. <hi>This is very acceptable to God.</hi> God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to hear ſuch Prayers. When Men Pray for that that is more directly for his Glory, and for the good of Mens Souls, God is pleaſed with it. When <hi>Solomon</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for himſelf, <hi>That he might have a Wiſe and Underſtanding Heart to Govern his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to the Will of God,</hi> the Saying pleaſed the Lord. So when Men Pray that God's Will may be done in the Land, God is pleaſed therewith. This has been the Spirit of holy Men. Many times People are earneſtly crying for outward Mercies, and God diſpiſes their Prayers. Hoſ. 7.14. <hi>They have not cried unto me with their Hearts, when they howled upon their Beds: They aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves for Corn and Wine, and they Rebel againſt me.</hi> But 'tis very acceptable to God, when his People are ſeeking to him for this Mercy. This is the main Thing that he hath taught us to Pray for. Math. 6.9, 10. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name. Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come. Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven. Paul</hi> begs Prayers on this Account, 2 Theſ. 3.1. <hi>Brethren Pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free Courſe and be glorified, even as it is with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is Encouragement to beg this.</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="unknown:001651_0199_0FB4E36E44155D48"/>
There be Encouragements in the Word of God. We have Promiſes, <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſave many.</hi> Iſai. 49.6. And Religion had need to be revived, elſe few will be ſaved: But <hi>the Children of the Kingdom will go into outer Darkneſs.</hi> Yea, there are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>That the Spirit ſhall go with the Word.</hi> Iſai. 59.1. And then the Word will Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. And though theſe Promiſes don't ſpeak particularly of this Land, and this Time, yet they are Ground of Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They ſhew that God will do ſuch Things many times for his Church, and that he would have them to plead for this Mercy. There is Encouragement alſo in the Providence of God. He hath many times revived his Work in <hi>Iſrael</hi> formerly, and we ſhould take Notice of God's Mercy to our ſelves, once and again, and now a third Time.</p>
            <p n="3">3 USE. <hi>It is very Doleful, when Perſons at ſuch Times are overlooked.</hi> There are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Times, when in particular Towns there is a Noiſe among the dry Bones, and many are made ſenſible of their natural Condition, and are labouring after a part in Chriſt; when one and another are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what they muſt do to be ſaved,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:001651_0200_0FB4E36FC63E01D8"/>
and ſome have obtained Mercy; and at ſuch times there be a Number of ſenſeleſs Sinners, that are not concerned about their Souls, that mind nothing elſe but the World and their carnal Delights, while ſome are crying out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved.</hi> They are enquiring <hi>what they ſhall Eat, and what they ſhall Drink, and wherewithal they ſhall be Cloathed.</hi> Such a Spirit is Doleful at any time, much more at ſuch a time when then there be a cloud of Witneſſes, a great many good Examples. They have as much need to ſeek as others; they have provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God as much as others; they are as near the Grave as others. For Men to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at ſuch a time, is a great Sin, and a black Sign. When Men are like the <hi>Barren Heath in the Wilderneſs, that ſeeth not Good when Good cometh,</hi> it is much to be feared they will <hi>ſleep the ſleep of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eſpecially 1. <hi>When they are of ſuitable Years.</hi> It is not ſo much wonder, if young Boys and Girls that are Giddy and Inconſiderate, don't mind the ſtate of their Souls; Such Perſons have little Knowledge and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; though they have need to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creatour, yet Childhood &amp; Youth are Vanity, and they are not come to the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:001651_0201_0FB4E371543B69B0"/>
Maturity of their Judgment. But it looks more Darkly, when at ſuch a time, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are grown to Mens and Womens Eſtates, are not thoughtful of their eternal Condition, when many of their Standing are going towards Heaven. For them to be going towards Hell, it looks Awfully upon them, as if God did deſign to caſt them off. When God makes the Arrows of his Word pierce the Hearts of others, and ſuffers them to flie over their Heads, it has a look as if God had no deſign of Mercy to them. Math. 24.40. <hi>Then ſhall two be in the Field, one ſhall be taken and the other left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When they have been overlooked formerly at ſuch a time.</hi> Some of theſe Men have ſeen ſuch Days formerly over and again. When others have been flowing to the goodneſs of God, God has made many to preſs into the Kingdom of Heaven, but they have not partook of that Mercy. The Prophet told him, 2 Kin. 7.2. <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt ſee it with thine Eyes, but thou ſhalt not Eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> So it hath been with theſe Men; the Opportunities have paſſed over, others have ſtepped in and been healed when the Waters were troubled; but theſe have not been healed. If it ſhould be ſo again,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:001651_0202_0FB4E3731075A368"/>
there would appear very little hopes of them. If all the Arrows are ſuffered to flie over their Heads, their Condition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Dangerous. It is not very often that there is a great ſtirring of the Spirit in one particular Town, and if Men have been overlooked twice or thrice at ſuch times, it is much to be feared what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them. There is conſiderable Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they will be Dead before there is ſuch another Opportunity. Or if not, yet paſt that Age wherein God uſually Works ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly on Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When Men are left to a contrary Spirit.</hi> It is bad, that when ſome are taking Pains for Salvation, that others are Idle. That when ſome are taking the Kingdom of Heaven by Force, others are not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their Souls whether they Sink or Swim. But it may be, there be ſome that are like <hi>Iſmael,</hi> that are Scoffing at the Work of God; that make a Deriſion of the Convictions of the Spirit. Theſe Men are in the very high Way to Hell, and it would be no Wonder if God ſhould bring ſuch Judgments on them, <hi>that all Iſrael might Fear and Tremble.</hi> Such prophane People are far from the Kingdom of God. They Laugh
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:001651_0203_0FB4E375D98AAE58"/>
now, but the time will come, that they ſhall Mourn for Sorrow of Heart, and Howl for Vexation of Spirit. They have Cauſe to fear that it will be with them as it was with <hi>Eſau,</hi> Heb. 12.17. <hi>Afterwards, when he would have inherited the Bleſſing, he found no Place for Repentance, though he ſought it carefully with Tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 USE. <hi>Perſons ſhould be very careful at ſuch a time, that they do nothing to quench the Spirit.</hi> As we muſt be careful that we don't provoke God to take away his Spirit, ſo we muſt be careful that we don't quench the Spirit. 1 Theſ. 5.19. <hi>Quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> As we may not quench it in our ſelves, ſo we may not quench it in others. It is a ſingular Mercy that the Spirit of God is ſtriving among us, and it is the fruit of Prayer. Many Souls may have occaſion for ever to bleſs God on that Account; and we ſhould make it our great Care that we do nothing to drive away the Spirit. Cant. 2.7. <hi>I charge you, O ye Daughters of Jeruſalem, by the Roes and by the Hinds of the Field, that ye ſtir not up, nor awake my Love till he pleaſe.</hi> If we would quench the Spirit, it may be long before he will return.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By ſlighting this Work.</hi> Some Men out
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:001651_0204_0FB4E378703508B0"/>
of an irreligious and prophane Spirit, are Deriding thoſe that are in trouble of Mind; as if the Perſons were over-run with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and were more afraid than they have any reaſon to be, as if they were full of Fancies, and ſcared themſelves needleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And ſome are apt to throw it upon them as if they counterfeited Trouble, and would have the World believe that they were more Religious than they are; as if they had a mind to get Reputation by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recourſe to Miniſters, and to be thought better than they were. This ſometimes has an ill Effect, and diſcourages Perſons. It was foretold of Chriſt, That he would En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and Nouriſh the leaſt Beginnings. Iſai. 42.3. <hi>A Bruiſed Reed ſhall he not break, and the ſmoaking Flax ſhall he not quench, till he bring forth Judgment unto Victory.</hi> But theſe Perſons that ſlight this Work, do quench the Spirit; they tempt others to ſmother Fears and Convictions that are in their Hearts; and they prejudice other Men that they don't conſider their dangerous Condition as otherwiſe they might. Such Troubles are looked on as Rediculous, and ſo are Oppoſite.</p>

Worldly Diſcourſes have a worldly Savour upon Mens Hearts; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their time is taken up, and the World drinks up their Spirits. Hence they grow Heartleſs in Duties of Religion. The World is a great Enemy to Religion: They can't ſerve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon.</hi> This is like caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Water on the ſmoaking Flax.</hi> Jam. 4.4. <hi>The Friendſhip of this World is Enmity unto God: He that will be a Friend of the World, will be an Enemy to God.</hi>

with thoſe that ſide with them, and their Diſcourſes with them that ſide againſt them take up a great deal of Time. They ſpend Hours together in ſuch talk, and their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are raiſed, and they reflect one upon another, and Reproach one another. This eats out the power of Godlineſs. They will be ſo engaged in Contention, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be but a Thing by the by. When their Spirits are raiſed, Fear is driven away. Their Thoughts are ſo ſwallowed up, that there is little room for Religion. They will be likewiſe great Temptations one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. They will be more inclined to do that which will be a Provocation to God, than to do that which will bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of Reconciliation. Men that are at Strife with their Corruptions, had need have no other Strife. A Contentious Town is not like to thrive in their Religion. Jam. 3.16. <hi>Where Envying and Strife is, there is Confuſion, and every evil Work.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention puts the Spirits of Men out of Frame. They that are engaged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, have too much Work; they have not leaſure to follow Religion to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

a Matter of Joy, to hear that others are Convicted, but much more to be Convicted your ſelf. And it may well be expected, that you ſhould be crying out, <hi>Bleſs me alſo.</hi> You ſhould Pray <hi>David's</hi> Prayer, Pſal. 106.4, 5. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that thou beareſt to thy People: O viſit me with thy Salvation: That I may ſee the good of thy Choſen, that I may Rejoyce in the Gladneſs of thy Nation, that I may Glory with thine Inheritance.</hi>

There is a great deal of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in the Providence of God. If God be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Convert many, there is hope he may pity you among the reſt. And you are under ſpecial Advantage by the Example of others, that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you to Emulation. There be not ſuch bad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to be a Snare to you.
