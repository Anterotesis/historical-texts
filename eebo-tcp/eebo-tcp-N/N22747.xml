            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS valuable fragment from the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ords of ancient wiſdom, comprehends this uſeful truth, that from experience are all our ſafe concluſions, reſpecting the character of ſociety, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be attained in it. The reſolution formed upon this maxim, has been more celebrated, than the maxim itſelf. It is experience which recommends moderation in our deſires, and in our expectations, but facts, in all ages, are more eaſily communicated by words, than the maxims, which juſtify the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our higheſt wiſdom. The writer affirms, that independent of every advantage from genius and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030058_0004_0FE41C4B83065E48"/>
this truth of our text is eſtabliſhed. The whole paragraph contains an appeal<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a different preface in the Vulgate.</note> of a man to his neighbours, or an inquiry which may be thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Indeed, ſhould I have no uncommon natural powers; or ſhould I not have cultivated my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſhould I not have been a man of deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, or ſhould I not have the ſecrets of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; tell me, whence could I get wiſdom? Am I firſt to comprehend all creation? Who hath done this? Who hath aſcended into heaven, or who hath deſcended? Who hath gathered the winds in his hand, or confined the waters in his garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all parts of the earth? What is the name of this man, or what is his ſon's name? Can any man tell? Is not every truth of God approved, when it has been ſafe to thoſe who truſt in it? Add thou not then raſhly to his words; affirm only from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; leſt thy folly be expoſed, and thou lead other men into errour. He then proceeds to his concluſion. He had conſidered affluence, and poverty, and had devoutly obſerved how far they contribute uſually to happineſs, and he tells us, that experience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation had reconciled his mind to the nature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, and had taught him to acquieſce in thoſe moderate deſires, which are much more adapted to health, and contentment, and have their objects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly within every man's reach. Experience has continued to decide in favour of this choice, and to render it happy. Our text then aſſures us that the laws of God are known from experience, and from the ſafety and happineſs men find in them; that every advantage beyond paſt experience, ſhould be purſued with the greateſt caution; that attempts at higher
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030058_0005_0FE41C1CE5F63F18"/>
happineſs have been made with frequent diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that reformations have been urged, but not accompliſhed; and that the many diſappointments ſhould be leſſons of the higheſt wiſdom to mankind.</p>
            <p>This ſentiment accommodates itſelf to the preſent ſolemnities. The horrours of war are to be depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Benevolence teaches us to avoid them; ſound policy to prevent them by all reaſonable meaſures; and religion to abhor the occaſions of them. But the world is not in our power. Paſſions exiſt every where, beyond control from principles within, and from fears without. General happineſs is the beſt object of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical economy, and ſhould be regarded in all laws and in every community. But it is not what exiſts, but what is to be purſued. It is to the mind, an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of all thoſe bleſſings, which have been reported among men, but which have never exiſted together, or in perfection. The picture is bold. It may fill the mind, and inſpire ſublime hopes. But ſteadily viewed, and without fair compariſon with nature, it may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the imagination, make men forget the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature, and leave them diſſatisfied with the real objects before them, and with that happineſs, which is their beſt, becauſe their higheſt attainment. But even this happineſs is unequal in different nations, and in different ages. Its progreſs in ſociety reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the progreſs of all our knowledge from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is gained by ſlow degrees and calm inquiry, and it is accompanied with unavoidable prejudices. Nations like men have a reſemblance in their general character, but their manners may be diſtinct. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of any police has been found to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, becauſe the habits, which formed it, are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030058_0006_0FE41C2836FB68B0"/>
unattainable. Nations may profit by the reſemblance, becauſe they knew from it the object of government and the character of mankind. But no hopes from experience will riſe above the condition of human nature. From the wiſdom of preceding ages,<note n="*" place="bottom">Spencer.</note> Moſes ſupplied the principles of his government, and the leſſons of morality which accompany his laws. He did not inſtitute wars, but he found them in the order of our world. He did not reaſon about their nature, but their coincidence with his political hopes. The polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical exiſtence of his nation began, when they were in arms. The principles upon which they were taken at firſt, were never unneceſſary, nor was their influence upon the national character ever loſt. They reduced moral life below the ſtandard of an happy government, but the people had not the ſpirit of ſuch a government. There are in times of peace, inſtitutions of as active virtue, and of as high ſpirit of honour, as can exiſt in war. There may exiſt a generous emulation in the arts, and of civil honours, which may command all the reſources of human genius. And there are the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing manners of domeſtic life to ſweeten the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and to conciliate the affections. It was not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon fair compariſon, war could be preferred, but becauſe war was more congenial with the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent character of mankind. The ſpirit of war ſpeaks in the devotion of David. But his ſublime thoughts could not inſpire thoſe emotions, which compoſe the deſcription of wiſdom by his ſucceſſour. It was in the quiet of a peaceful eſtabliſhment, that the age became enlightened, as well as great. But in our world, we have not been able to provide the events, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030058_0007_0FE41C52AE25F318"/>
empires, and preſerve their exiſtence, otherwiſe than by the active and contending paſſions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Theſe events have not only given being to all great nations, but they have aided the triumph of every religious eſtabliſhment. Even religious wars have ever been worſe than thoſe of princes for civil cauſes, or political fame, becauſe they have more paſſion, and it is determined from the origin and nature of the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, conſequent upon them, that they cannot be the foundation for the hopes of a perpetual peace. The difference of motives profeſſed in them, has made no difference in the enormities, they have occaſioned. It then remains a queſtion, ſince ſuch a ſtate of the paſſions has ever exiſted, as is a ſelf-exciting cauſe of war, and therefore as its incentives cannot fail from the preſent conſtitution of the human mind, whether a ſtate of conſtant preparation, be not the only ſtate of ſafety, to nations, and to mankind.</p>
            <p>To examine a ſubject of this intereſting nature, we muſt not propoſe a favourite theory of the paſſions, but ſome example of the moſt happy conduct of them. If we cannot find a ſucceſsful experiment, we ſhould produce the beſt effects in circumſtances, moſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to our hopes. We ſhould examine the minds of men, when moſt detached from the political views of their age, ſimple in their manners, elevated beyond the love of fame, or wealth, and in their maxims pure, peaceable, and ſubmiſſive. Too humble to hope for preferment in the ſtate, and too devout to refuſe the moſt ſevere reſtraints upon their paſſions. From the conduct of ſuch men, we may judge of the influence of condition, of the progreſs of ſociety, of the motives of proſperity, and of the nature of a religious or civil
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030058_0008_0FE41C548B191850"/>
eſtabliſhment. And our concluſions from ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, may be as ſafe, as the nature of human knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge will admit.</p>
            <p>And what hiſtory can be better adapted to a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian aſſembly, than the hiſtory of their own religion? Chriſtians being in civil ſociety, did not refuſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the laws. The right of war was not denied, or maintained. The manners they aſſociated with their religious profeſſion, were governed by the love of peace. From the abſence of power, and the full ſtrength of mutual dependence, their habits were more ſocial and more pure. The moſt offenſive part of their lives was obliged by perſecution, and their unkind opinions of mankind; but this aſſiſted them in their reſiſtance to the habits of civil ſociety, and for a long time preſerved them from the compliances, which gradually obtained from pretended regard to conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and to duty, and the ſuppoſed obligations of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent circumſtances, but really from the aſſimilation of their manners and character to that of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the order of our world. This expediency was diſcloſed in a letter, or in ſome guarded expreſſion; was betrayed in confidence, and employed with fear; was adopted with caution, and confeſſed with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; was oppoſed by reſtraints and qualifications; before it was eſtabliſhed in belief, boaſted of as juſt, and maintained by violence. Chriſtians, after long depreſſion, voluntary mortifications, and arbitrary rules upon the paſſions, and even under the belief of a ſpeedy and a miraculous change of condition in our world, at laſt claimed and exerciſed all the rights of war. They borrowed in their earlieſt proſperity from every inſtitution, which could unite with the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030058_0009_0FE41C5687E90640"/>
of their converts. We look not then at their primitive morals, but at the character of man: not at profeſſions, but at actions. Mahomed adopted war, but the Chriſtians had practiſed it. Chriſtians yielded to its expediency, but Mahomedans profiting by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, entered upon the world in triumph.</p>
            <p>To trace this hiſtory may not be without inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Author of our religion has reported by his diſciples, his own convictions of the right of war. Jeſus diſcovered to his friends, before his entrance upon the garden, in which he was apprehended, that he was determined to reſiſt. But the prudence of a diſciple could not be as eaſily under the command of his maſter, as his zeal. The reproof aſſures him, that his reſiſtance was unſeaſonable, not unlawful; becauſe he went armed by his authority, and with his knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge. His followers were thus taught to employ pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the lawfulneſs of war: And as the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country was impending, they were not taught to contend in its battles. This ingenuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was not loſt in the primitive ages. To our own times, the records of men, who were governed by their religion, rather than education, have been carefully tranſmitted. A work attributed to one<note n="*" place="bottom">Clement.</note> of the firſt Chriſtians, diſſuades from ſedition and ſchiſm, from moral motives, rather than from expreſs and religious prohibition. And from military arrangements, he happily illuſtrates the common intereſt, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends what is uſeful to the ſtrength and defence of their cauſe. A care for perſonal ſafety induces an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note n="†" place="bottom">Ignatius.</note> to adviſe to appeaſe the people, from a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of their paſſions, which precipitate human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030058_0010_0FE41C5BB5385808"/>
While a third<note n="*" place="bottom">Polycarp.</note> qualifies his obedience to civil authority by the protection, he receives; and from the indignation which riſes againſt inſult and oppreſſion, he claims the right to queſtion their power, who do public wrongs. The character and the juſtice of theſe feelings, in our free government, it is not neceſſary to vindicate, or deſcribe. They belong to the beſt part of human nature.</p>
            <p>In the next period we ſee leſs ſimplicity of heart, and leſs ingenuous ſentiments. When Chriſtianity had a public form, and a riſing intereſt, it ſpeaks in flattering apologies, from its more learned friends, the language of the laws, and the ſubordination of the empire. Thus while one<note n="†" place="bottom">Athenagoras.</note> acquieſces in the laws of ſlavery, and the full authority of reaſon, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the concerns of life, another<note n="‡" place="bottom">Juſtin.</note> to quiet the ſtate, aſcribes falſe honours to his religion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to prefer prayers to arms, and in the apparent piety, though errour of his addreſs, he oppoſes active duty to devotion, and the order of civil ſociety, to the hopes of a divine religion. While a third,<note n="§" place="bottom">Irenaeus.</note> more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, than diſcerning, dares to anticipate a triumph over the laws of nature, from an authority not eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in theſe laws, but formed in a religion too pure to exiſt in the preſent order of our world. But the patrons of the Chriſtian cauſe, were not all of this character. They had refined their taſte by the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Rome, and had imbibed the manners of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety with the beſt knowledge of its laws. They were not ſo ignorant as to plead for war from virtue, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor ſo ſuperſtitious, as to ſubvert ſociety, by refuſing it the neceſſary defence. To the paſſions of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030058_0011_0FE41C5DA6726840"/>
life, and to the habits of civil ſociety, they imputed the convulſions of empires, and the defence of the ſword. To meliorate human condition, it was taught,<note n="*" place="bottom">Lactantius.</note> that the paſſions muſt be governed. That from their nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural character, human genius was diſplayed in the arts of military defence, as well as in the maxims of virtue. The diſputes of the age<note n="†" place="bottom">Tertullian.</note> for power, and the vile ſervices of faction were ſtigmatized, as unlawful to Chriſtians from a regard to reputation and the public peace, while Roman eloquence in the ſchool of Chriſt, taught the philoſophy of reaſon and religion. "Nor do I refuſe," ſays an enlightened Chriſtian,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Minutius Felix.</note> "to confeſs, that it is the duty of man to know himſelf in all the relations of his being. What he is, whence he is, and why he exiſts. This duty he cannot perform, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into all things around him, for they are ſo aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, connected, and united, that an ignorance of them involves an ignorance of himſelf, and diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him for every civil obligation. Where is ſociety formed on virtue," he appeals, "or diſſolved without blood? Wars throughout the world, diſunite the deareſt kindred, and the greateſt empires report not the ſame hiſtory of their fate!"</p>
            <p>A cauſe, which could admit ſuch rational views of ſociety, muſt have already riſen into reputation, and its friends muſt have had an acquaintance with the world. We may then ſoon expect to find its power and its influence employed in public affairs. When Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity had thus prevailed, its friends had intereſt at court, and in the armies. It had a command among parties in the ſtate. Experience has told us, what to expect. Let us hear, how the Fathers reaſon, what
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030058_0012_0FE41C5F53378A58"/>
the councils publiſh, and the civil laws ordain. Let us liſten to Chryſoſtom, who exalted the glory of a Chriſtian prince, and to a Gregory who pleaded with bold imagination and genius againſt an apoſtate. We may find perpetuated the proſperity of an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by all the means of civil power, till a Bernard diſplays to us the full force of proſperity upon a long continued ſuperſtition, which had eſtabliſhed itſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pureſt religion ever profeſſed among men. We behold at length a war which armed Europe, and was the boldeſt effort of paſſion in religion. Conqueſt was authoriſed in the cauſe of religion, and the power of war, the conduct of armies, and the control of the civil government were ſurrendered to its claims.</p>
            <p>At firſt, to engage Chriſtians in war, the croſs was diſplayed in their banners. This was not ſo great a ſtruggle with former prejudices as we might imagine. No ſect had prevailed, which had been under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of making war unlawful. All reports leave reaſonable fears of miſconſtruction upon their opinion. The myſtic ſects in their infancy might favour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to it. Chriſtians ſought, at an early period, promotion to civil and military honours, and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acquired their influence in the empire. Even the dignities in the church did not extinguiſh all claims, or prove ſufficient to gratify their ambition, and the exceſs of panegyric, was the reward of the civil Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for diſtinctions, which they readily beſtowed. A canon early impoſed a reſtraint upon this ambition. From the modeſt vindication of ſelf defence in former apologies, the eloquence of Chryſoſtom proceeds to compare the mind under its paſſions, to a body in a fever, in which ſafety directs the remedy. To a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030058_0013_0FE41C61553AEFC0"/>
teacher he not only inſinuates, but recommends an addreſs devoid of Chriſtian ſimplicity. The power of princes was an emblem of ſpiritual dominion, too flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering not to be indulged. The Chriſtians had fought too many battles, and with too great ſucceſs, to doubt of the divine right of power, or the lawfulneſs of war. And, though Chriſtian teachers were profeſſed friends of peace, they had profited enough from affairs of ſtate, to know what the Biſhop aſſured them was true, that excellence in political knowledge was a commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able qualification. An emperour averſe from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and name of a Chriſtian ſoon found the reluctance with which honours were abandoned. Panegyric was converted into the moſt bitter invective. The praiſes of Conſtantine from Chryſoſtom may be oppoſed to the talents of Gregory againſt Julian. Whatever could irritate by compariſon, or be hateful in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or injurious to reputation was pronounced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve. A ſpirit ſo freely encouraged in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of any order, cannot be reſtrained by any inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Neither the habit of a recluſe, nor his vows will confine his ambition. The pride of opinion is not obſtinate againſt the temptations of power. Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are more eaſily ſilenced by authority, than argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The great Auguſtin encouraged the temper. In defiance of his firſt maxims, he paſſed from a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of war, to the command of God in it. He pronounced that the general, or the ſoldier were not ſo much authors of war, as the miniſters of God, and that they might exult, Bleſſed be the Lord, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our hands to war, and our fingers to fight.</p>
            <p>Thus at laſt orders eſtabliſhed to exhibit the virtues of retirement and ſilence, became powerful aſſociations
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030058_0014_0FE41C29E0087C38"/>
in the church, and were transformed into ſtanding armies, to inſtigate reſentment, and to interfere in the political concerns of princes. When the church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came eſtabliſhed, there were few fears entertained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject of war, among the ruling eccleſiaſtics. The former doubts aroſe in private condition, in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſects, and in times of perſecution, but they diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among even good men, when they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the neceſſity impoſed upon our world, whatever peaceful diſpoſitions they wiſhed to cultivate in it. They found it vain to ſtruggle againſt the order of events, and that their prudence and their ſtrength conſiſted in that conſtant preparation, which could render them formidable to their enemies. The ſame extenſive views of life, which exalt the hopes of virtue, obliged thoſe guards againſt the paſſions, which appear as clearly in the laws, the polity and education of every country, as they do in their military arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>We may then conſider the experiment upon the Chriſtian world as fairly made, and believe that no means have been found, to render its true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo general and active, as to render our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for war unneceſſary. And no ſucceſs will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our expectations of univerſal peace till public order, is public ſentiment, rather than law, which at preſent appears to be a period, as remote from this, as any former age. Nor is the Chriſtian a ſolitary experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The military is the beſt defined part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Moſes. The equeſtrian order of Rome is better underſtood than the Senate; and the abuſe of the military power, is the moſt notorious errour of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030058_0015_0FE41C684AC67BE0"/>
feudal ſyſtem. An order of patriots<note n="*" place="bottom">Cincinnati.</note> aroſe out of our late revolution, whom our national honour and ſafety teach us to reverence. And the inſtitution we hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our this day, reminds us of a more early military aſſociation. And ſuch parts of our excellent federal conſtitution have proved to be the moſt ſound, which have wiſely regarded principles, it was obliged to admit and indulge, more from the wiſdom and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of nations, than from our own immediate preference or choice.</p>
            <p>But leſt we ſhould diſtruſt the zeal of ancient times, and preſume upon modern wiſdom, we have before us in our own country, the moſt bold experiment, ever made in favour of perpetual peace, and it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted upon the Chriſtian motives of piety and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.</p>
            <p>A ſect eſtabliſhed upon the lovely plea, that it was practicable to live without war, originated a ſtate of civil ſociety in a new country. The power of the magiſtrate, it did admit, and did attempt to define. Says the moſt able apologiſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Barclay.</note> of the ſect, "Let it be admitted that the magiſtrate may lawfully uſe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to preſerve moral and perpetual ſtatutes." He then preſumes that every thing is granted, which ought to be required. But if laws may require the virtues of obedience, they muſt defend the obedient. And the means of defence muſt be as extenſive as the evils of oppoſition. The means muſt be adequate. But in what does any penalty differ eſſentially from a war? To find the point at which men may deſiſt, ſhort of the extent of their power, is difficult. If the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030058_0016_0FE41C2BE1CFF5C8"/>
individual may be defended, the ſtate muſt be, which unites its ſafety with the multitude of the people. Civil ſociety involves then the right of war. But when we obſerve the expedients to promote this falſe ſecurity of ſociety; when we ſee its abject depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when we behold the character of intereſt in it; the limited power, or rather equivocal nature of its government, depending on private manners; the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ſtrength of private will; the diſcouragement of knowledge to preſerve it, the dangers of ambition; and the reluctant acquieſcence in this ſtate, the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did intereſts it creates in multiplied private views, and when we add an impartial<note n="*" place="bottom">Smith's Letters on Pennſylvania.</note> view of facts, which are of the greateſt conſequence, the experiment appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, to civil government, and to perſonal ſafety.</p>
            <p>But while we confeſs the neceſſity of war, and of a ſtate of defence, we ought to be cautious not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe too freely political advantages from war, or to encourage a diſpoſition to provoke it, without a ſacred regard to all the motives of an honourable peace. There is an ambition, which may be awakened in great revolutions, but it ſhould have urgent and noble occaſions. Dangers may provoke raſhneſs, rather than courage. Wars are eaſily converted into real evils. Conqueſts have been faithfully reported, and hiſtory dwells upon them, but ambition for war has been often fatal. If wars can raiſe the fame of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they can as powerfully concur with the means of their deſtruction. The conſequences of the Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſian war upon the Grecian ſtates, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and deplored. The ſtate in which Grecian arts flouriſhed, was of peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030058_0017_0FE41C6BEDAE36C0"/>The ambition of Rome under a military government employed a rivalſhip, which had glory, but not victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſhews how powerfully the ſelf inſpiration of liberty unites with excellence in the arts beyond the love of the arts, when aided only by power. A more generous emulation and friendſhip of the arts in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope prevented the recurrence of the ſame events. Independent nations produced a principle more active than any motives of government, and genius employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt ſplendid advantages, and was triumphant. And we ought on this occaſion, to pay a juſt tribute of reſpect to that patriot,<note n="*" place="bottom">JOHN ADAMS.</note> who juſtly holds a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed office in our federal government, for that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable work, in which he has placed before us, the political experience of our world. Could the higheſt wiſdom have choſen a ſubject, could it have choſen a better for the inſtruction and glory of our country? It affords a review of the difficulties of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the endleſs expedients to maintain the proſperity of ſtates. Convinced of the nature of war, men in all ages, have imagined, that they could act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſober convictions: They have attempted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an higher order of things, and to create an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of opinion over the paſſions of the world.</p>
            <p>But they who conſider the preſent ſtate of our world, and our conſtant experience in it, may find the neceſſity of that ſublime religion, which inſtructs our prudence in this world, but eſtabliſhes our beſt hopes upon our qualifications for a better life, and they may increaſe their eſteem of that revelation upon which all our hopes of happineſs muſt reſt. Our higheſt duty is to guard againſt impending evils, while we endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

our to preſerve from a love of the public happineſs, for our own times, the ſweet intervals of peace, in tho wiſdom of our laws, and in our conſtant preparation for a moſt active defence.</p>
            <p>To correct the vanity of our expectations from the greater wiſdom to prevail in our world from any cauſes, which now exiſt in it, let us only recollect the cauſes, which have already proved inſufficient to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a more happy order of things. Genius has in every country had its opportunities, to aſſiſt a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age, and to plead with mankind, in favour of the bleſſings of peace. When princes have contributed to the lovely purpoſe, the public ſentiment of joy has been addreſſed to them in the boldeſt panegyric. But the ambition of ſtateſmen, the corrupt manners, and turbulent paſſions of men have interrupted and fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated every generous deſign to eſtabliſh, what men have profeſſed to believe to be the dignity of life and the end of government. Religion alſo has given its friendly aſſiſtance. But violence has been nurſed even at the altars, and they who for one age aſſociated religion with peace, have reſigned it to thoſe, who have made it the incentive of war. The human fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties continue to develop unequally. Ambition is not leſs ſtrong, as the advantages of education are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Natural and untutored paſſions with all their incentives, every where exiſt. War has yet all its cauſes. The paſſions which excite it, it can inflame. Little durable happineſs then can we hope from the enthuſiaſm of mankind in the moſt ardent love of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. They feel their native claims on liberty, but command not for a long time, the wiſdom to preſerve
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030058_0019_0FE41C73174BC690"/>
it. In the means of bold reſiſtance nations become formidable, and reſtrain their enemies.</p>
            <p>With ſincerity then, we congratulate the Members of this ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE ARTIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LERY COMPANY aſſembled this day, in the ſpirit of our anceſtors, who were urged by a love of liberty and religion to eſtabliſh themſelves in theſe remote, and uncultivated regions. The rigour of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners formed by perſecution, and confirmed by habits of ſuffering, and danger, did not inſtruct them, with an ingenious modern,<note n="*" place="bottom">Soame Jenyns.</note> that the hiſtory of the Jews was not an example to them, or that local manners were the true principles of Chriſtian morality. They conceived that their future hopes did not refuſe them the beſt means to ſecure their preſent ſafety, and they aſſociated the uſe of arms, with their pureſt doctrines. Like Moſes, they ſupplied laws from experience, and like the great teacher of their religion, they provided principles of active virtue in the moſt humble condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this inſtitution and ſchool of arms, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the hiſtory of their beſt families, as well as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the names of the officers lead us to the recollection of men, who have been conſpicuous in the ſucceſſive generations from the plantation of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to the preſent flouriſhing ſtate of our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. It tranſmits the character and the ſentiments of Maſſachuſetts. As a very early inſtitution it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our veneration. In its freedom from innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is a memorial of the ſtability of the public opinion regarding the uſe of arms; and even with its interruptions, it records its intimate connexion with the liberties of the people. During the laſt efforts
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030058_0020_0FE41C74C1FB2FD8"/>
of the Houſe of Stuarts to perpetuate their power, it ceaſed to enjoy its privileges, and in our late war with the parent country, it gave place to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an army. Its members ſaw at theſe memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble periods, the boldeſt attempts for freedom. In the firſt, the ſpirit of revolution was directed by an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion devoid of principle, and by an enthuſiaſm which could command, but not enjoy victory. Its ſtrength proved the terrour of a government, it was not able to reform, and fear qualified a power, which was not abſolutely withdrawn. But in the other we beheld, the mild virtues inſpired by the love of liberty and mankind, and guarded by prudence and fortitude, conducted to victory by the laws of a free people. Our General became immortal, and our cauſe yet tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs in the federal conſtitution, and in the peace and proſperity of our country. Thus have the abſent years of the hiſtory of this inſtitution been ſupplied from the records of our nation, as ſacred to courage, and to a glorious defence of arms in the hands of a free people. Its preſent worthy members, and officers<note n="*" place="bottom">Q. M. Gen. AMASA DAVIS, Commander of the Company. J. EATON, Lieutenant. JER. KAHLER, Enſign.</note> its active patriots, and the commanders of our late army perpetuate its ſame. The names of a HULL, a BROOKS, and a LINCOLN will be reverenced in future ages. May our national defence be as perfect, as it is neceſſary, and juſt.</p>
            <p>But mankind are yet in a ſtate of war. How terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble has been the havoc among the moſt enlightened nations of Europe! We confeſs the melancholy truth. And we will not fall a willing ſacrifice to the paſſions of angry nations. We love peace, but we will render
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030058_0021_0FE41C4D2A086428"/>
it ſafe and honourable. We deſire to poſſeſs the beſt bleſſings of civil government, but we will be able to defend it. To reſtrain the paſſions of men, we muſt be a terrour to them. We will love peace, but we will defy ambition, hate oppreſſion, and die for our laws and our liberty. Pure religion will teach us to love peace, and experience will teach us, how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. But we will never forget that the good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen is a good ſoldier. Able to defend, as well as ſure to deſerve his liberty. He hates faction, but he is not afraid of war in defence of his country. He loves peace, becauſe it preſerves the higheſt value of freedom. He riſes to conquer perverſe paſſions, not to employ them in his own cauſe. He appears to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the laws, not to triumph over them. His victory is for good government, and to God, with a pure conſcience, he can commit his cauſe.</p>
