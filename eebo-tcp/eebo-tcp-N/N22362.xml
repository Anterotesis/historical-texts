            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I rejoice in the proſpect of your increaſing reſpectability.</p>
            <p>Since, probably, it cannot be practicable for me, much longer, to perform the agreeable ſervices, which my preſent relation, as your paſtor and public teacher, requires, it gives relief to my anxiety for your happineſs, that you may ſoon enjoy the labors of a miniſter, who will be able to devote his time, without interruption, to inſtruct and edify you.</p>
            <p>That GOD may continue to bleſs you with proſperity in this world; and finally grant you an inheritance among thoſe, who are ſanctified, is the ſincere deſire of your affectionate friend.</p>

            <p>We know, that JEHOVAH is every where preſent, to hear the prayers of thoſe, who with ſincerity and Godly fear invoke his name. He is however more eſpecially preſent, in the worſhipping aſſemblies of the faithful.</p>
            <p>Why is the Lord ſaid to give his bleſſing out of Zion? becauſe there was his houſe, where his name was recorded. Of ſuch ſolemn importance is a houſe devoted to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of public worſhip.</p>
            <p>When GOD would expreſs his love and kindneſs to his ancient profeſſing people, he informed them, that he would ſet his tabernacle in the midſt of them. By this he intended, that he would be near them, to hear their petitions, and grant them his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And, when his people apoſtatized, and provoked him to manifeſt his great diſpleaſure, he deprived them of this privilege, which was, indeed, an awful puniſhment.</p>
            <p>To worſhip and adore the Creator is our reaſonable ſervice. To contemplate his perfections, praiſe his name, and celebrate the wonders of his love to the human kind, are employments grateful to the pious.</p>
            <p>The public worſhip of GOD is our indiſpenſable duty, both with regard to his glory, and our own intereſt. By this we profeſs that we are his ſervants, and that we ought to obey and glorify him.</p>
            <p>As we depend upon GOD's bleſſing for our lives, and all the happineſs we either enjoy in this world, or hope for in the future, it is his will, that we implore his favor in places where his name is recorded, and which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to his honor.</p>
            <p>Our Savior has promiſed, that where two or three are
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029528_0005_0FE1D98563D946D0"/>
gathered together in his name, he will grant them his presence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xviii. 20.</note> Will he not then (to apply the words of the Psalmist) give a gracious ear to the prayers, which are made "in the great congregation?<note n="†" place="bottom">Psalm xxii. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We should come to GOD's house, to unite with sincere hearts in prayer and praise, and to hear the instructions of his word.</p>
            <p>HERE, in the name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and with humble reliance on his grace and merits, we ſhould pray our heavenly Father to pardon our ſins, which, if not forgiven, will plunge us in everlaſting ruin.</p>
            <p>We ſhould devoutly implore the quickening and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying influences of his ſpirit, without which we cannot pleaſe GOD, nor be prepared for heaven. Here, we ſhould render thanks to our adorable and merciful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for thoſe bleſſings, which we have no reaſon to expect will be continued, when we are ſo ungrateful as not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them.</p>
            <p>"If there be dearth in the land, if there be peſtilence, if there be blaſting or mildew,—whatſoever ſore, or whatſoever ſickneſs there be: then what prayer, or what ſupplication ſoever ſhall be made of any man, or of all thy people Iſrael, when every one ſhall know his own ſore, and his own grief, and ſhall ſpread forth his hands in this place: then hear thou from heaven, thy dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place." 2 Chron. vi. 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>In the following chapter we are informed, "that GOD appeared to Solomon by night, and ſaid unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have choſen this place to myſelf. Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Verſes 12 and 15.</note>"</p>
            <p>This is the place, where his miniſters are to inſtruct the ignorant, alarm the careleſs, and conſole the contrite in heart.</p>
            <p>All, who deſire and hope for the bleſſing of GOD, ſhould, as they have opportunity, wait upon him in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip. And they ſhould behave with decency and reverence, conſidering they are in the preſence of their Creator and final Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:029528_0006_0FE1D98703887AE0"/>
Were we to appear before a chief Magiſtrate, we ſhould fear to inſult him.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we ſhould wiſh to behave reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in his preſence, and obtain his approbation. Were we to implore his forgiveneſs of an offence, we ſhould act with humility. Did we requeſt a favor of him, we ſhould addreſs him with ſubmiſſion to his good pleaſure. Were we to preſent him our thanks for a favor received, we ſhould behave ſo as to appear ſenſible of our obligation.</p>
            <p>GOD requires an outward as well as inward worſhip. He is diſpleaſed with all indecent behavior in ſo ſolemn an exerciſe.</p>
            <p>"A ſon,', ſays GOD, "honoreth his father, and a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant his maſter; if then I be a Father, where is my hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or? and if I be a maſter, where is my fear? And if ye offer the blind for ſacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and ſick, is it not evil? Offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleaſed with thee?<note n="*" place="bottom">Mal i. 6. and 8.</note>"</p>
            <p>Thus, the Great GOD is very jealous of his honor, and diſpleaſed with ſuch as do not behave with reverence in his worſhip.</p>
            <p>If we trifle, or behave indecently, he is diſpleaſed, as a father with the diſreſpect of a ſon, or a maſter with the ill behavior of a ſervant.</p>
            <p>We may alſo obſerve, that a decent and reverent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, in the public worſhip of GOD, tends to ſolemnize the mind, and impreſs an idea of our obligation to ſerve and adore him. Thus the prieſts were commanded to weep between the porch and the altar, that they might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in a manner ſuitable to the offices they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.<note n="†" place="bottom">Joel ii. 17.</note> Our bodies as well as ſouls are GOD's; and we are commanded to worſhip and glorify him with both.</p>
            <p>We ſhould, however, remember, that no outward acts are pleaſing to GOD, in his worſhip, any further than they are expreſſions of holy exerciſes of heart, or means to impreſs us with a ſenſe of our dependance upon his grace and kind providence.</p>
            <p>In the houſe of GOD, we ſhould attend, not only to the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029528_0007_0FE1D9889E9D8640"/>
precepts and inſtructions contained in his holy word, but alſo to his wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, diſplayed in the creation and government of the world.</p>
            <p>"The heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſheweth his handy work. There is no ſpeech nor language, where their voice is not heard.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xix. 1. and 3.</note>"</p>
            <p>The Great GOD is from everlaſting to everlaſting. To him pertains every poſſible perfection. He walks in the circuit of heaven; his eyes run to and fro through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the earth. Hell itſelf is open before him, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction has no covering. The clouds are his chariots, and the winds his meſſengers. All the elements fulfil his commands. Darkneſs is his pavilion. The earth is his footſtool; and in the deep waters his wonders are ſeen.</p>
            <p>All nature is his temple, and all ſpace is his abode. Every creature is the workmanſhip of his hands; and over all his gracious providence extends.</p>
            <p>Creation is full of GOD. He has his way in the whirlwind; he ſends abroad his lightnings; he gives ſnow like wool, and ſcatters the hoarfroſt like aſhes. If we aſcend into heaven, he is there; if we go down into hell, he is alſo there. In the former reigns his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the latter his everlaſting juſtice.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, behave with reverence and godly fear, when in ſolemn worſhip, we preſent ourſelves before the omniſcient Creator.</p>
            <p>Great and important advantages ariſe from the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of public worſhip, when rightly performed. Were piety and devotion baniſhed from the earth, juſtice and fidelity would not long remain. Wickedneſs, could it eſcape human obſervation, would prevail and triumph. Were men releaſed from all apprehenſions of a ſupreme Being, to whom they are accountable, oaths would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, and confidence amongſt men entirely deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In that caſe, a man could not ſafely truſt a friend; he would every where be in danger of injuries from his fellow creatures. Thus, if the fear of GOD were removed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029528_0008_0FE1D98A47696A48"/>
from men's minds, human life would be thrown into the greateſt confuſion, and the bonds of ſociety unhappily diſſolved.</p>
            <p>By what means can a ſuitable ſenſe of GOD and his divine providence be ſo effectually diffuſed, as by meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and joining in the exerciſes of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? ſince ſociety could not ſubſiſt without religion, and this could not be maintained without the public worſhip of GOD, it is incumbent on every friend to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to encourage it by his influence and example. Such then as habitually abſent themſelves from public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, cannot anſwer, for the neglect, to GOD, nor their neighbor. And they injure themſelves; for ſincere and rational worſhip is both agreeable, and improving to the mind.</p>
            <p>Do you wiſh to become wiſer and better? do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to obtain the pardon of your ſins, through JESUS CHRIST? Would you increaſe in piety, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſource of peace in life, hope in death, and happineſs eternal? "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD."</p>
            <p>Although neither the hearing of GOD's word, nor any means, of themſelves, can effect our ſalvation, yet, while we wilfully neglect them, we harden our hearts in ſin, and go far from GOD. The Holy Ghoſt is the efficient of the new creation; he operates, however, on the minds of men, in the uſe of means.</p>
            <p>To adore our Creator, as the univerſal Parent, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind us of our near relation to all mankind, and, thus, ſtrengthen in our breaſts the nobleſt ſentiments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. By reflecting on his adorable perfections, if we worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, our minds will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with becoming reverence.</p>
            <p>If, with true hearts, and in full aſſurance of faith, we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs him in prayer, we ſhall improve in that reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his providence, and truſt in his power and goodneſs, which will ſupport and animate us through the changing ſcenes of life, and afford us conſolation, when fleſh and heart ſhall fail.</p>

Frequently to repeat theſe exerciſes will tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with ſuch a ſenſe of the divine preſence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, as will, at all times, be a happy guard to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and virtue. Indeed, every part of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is adapted to meliorate the heart, and, conſequently, to exalt human nature.</p>
            <p>Although we have reaſon to lament the profaneneſs and impiety of the preſent age, yet there are many men of learning and influence, who labor to promote the cauſe of piety and virtue. Religion has many friends of whom ſhe is not aſhamed. Theſe are the wiſe, the humane, and the virtuous.</p>
            <p>Who are her enemies? they are the enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; the idle and the vicious.</p>
            <p>If you engage in the worſhip of GOD with ſincere hearts, in the exerciſe of faith and love, with your minds free from guilt and ſuperſtition,—if you believe in GOD, as the merciful Father of all,—if, with humble dependance on the atonement and interceſſion of CHRIST, you adore him with pious affections, experience will teach you, that devotion affords the moſt exalted pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The human mind is never ſo much pleaſed, as when employed in viewing and admiring great and ſublime objects. What object is ſo great and ſublime as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal GOD? In contemplating him, we are preſented with a view of the moſt perfect glory and excellence.</p>
            <p>And do we not experience ſatiſfaction ariſing from a grateful ſenſe of our obligations to that Almighty and Merciful Being, on whom we ever depend?</p>
            <p>Thus to adore our common Parent, the Parent of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as well as men, the governor of the univerſe, who will graciouſly reward his faithful ſervants, muſt be a pleaſing employment, and afford the moſt ſublime enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to pious and generous minds.</p>
            <p>Thus exalted are the pleaſures of devotion.</p>
            <p>Society heightens every rational delight. The melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſounds, the fair proſpects of nature, and our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with each other, become more agreeable, when
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029528_0010_0FE1D99516F43C68"/>
the pleaſure they afford is communicated from breaſt to breaſt.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the pleaſure of devotion, although highly ſatisfactory to one, who adores GOD in private, may, however, be increaſed and more elevated, in a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping aſſembly.</p>
            <p>It is the character of an unſocial and ſullen ſpirit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the places of public worſhip. A man of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence enjoys peculiar pleaſure in ſuch aſſemblies, in beholding a number of his ſpecies engaged in the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their common Creator and Redeemer, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their minds.</p>
            <p>A man of undiſſembled piety, worſhipping with thoſe of the ſame character, gathers joy from every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>To join, therefore, in public worſhip with the pious conduces to kindle and enhance our own devotion. If here we experience not a divine ſatiſfaction, we have reaſon to fear, that our ſouls are devoid of piety.</p>
            <p>I add, that devoutly to worſhip GOD in the aſſemblies of his people has a happy tendency to fit us for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and pleaſures of the world of glory. When the ſoul ſhall forſake its preſent habitation, the pleaſures which depend upon the body will all vaniſh. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the heavenly ſtate depends on ſpiritual entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It conſiſts in the love and exerciſe of virtue, and in the love, praiſe, and adoration of the ſource of felicity. May we, therefore, purifying ourſelves from ſin, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by devotion, and all the means, which infinite wiſdom has appointed, for the exalted ſtate and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſaints in light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Impreſſed with theſe ideas let us attend to our ſituation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twenty five years ago the College was eſtabliſhed, and meaſures were taken to form a ſettlement, in this part of the town of Hanover. The firſt ſettlers were few, and ſubjected to many inconveniences and difficulties, as this part of the country was an uncultivated wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:029528_0011_0FE1D996B0568300"/>
The twenty third day of January next will complete the term of twenty five years, ſince this church was imbodied.</p>
            <p>The public worſhip of GOD has been, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, attended in this vicinity, from the time of its firſt ſettlement.</p>
            <p>During the late war, the progreſs of improvement was greatly retarded. From the concluſion of that war, to the preſent time, by the bleſſing of GOD its increaſe has been conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Although we are not a large ſociety, yet the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of public occaſions frequently occurring early led the minds of the ſettlers to view the expediency, that a houſe for the accommodation of large numbers be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and convenient.</p>
            <p>This conſideration, together with that of the ſmallneſs of the number of inhabitants, occaſioned the delay of meaſures for erecting a houſe for the purpoſe of public worſhip, and to be uſed for thoſe other public purpoſes, until the laſt year.</p>
            <p>When we conſider how few have aſſociated for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of building this houſe, which was begun but a little more than a year ago, and which is now, at their requeſt, and in their behalf, to be dedicated to the worſhip and honor of GOD, we have reaſon to acknowledge his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in granting ſucceſs to the undertaking.</p>
            <p>As public, ſocial worſhip is due from mankind to their Creator, it is ſuitable, that houſes erected for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be conſecrated to his ſervice. In them he has been pleaſed to record his name, and to honor them with the appellation of his dwelling places.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, my beloved brethren and friends, with united hearts, and one accord, beſeech the LORD GOD, who gives his bleſſing out of Zion, to be graciouſly pleaſed to accept this our offering, WHICH WE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICATE TO HIS NAME.</p>
            <p>Here, may a divine bleſſing attend his word, and the adminiſtration of his ordinances, to his glory, and the ſalvation of the ſouls of multitudes, who may, in this houſe, hear the joyful ſound of the goſpel, even glad tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029528_0012_0FE1D9984F87E038"/>
from heaven for ſinful men, who will accept of mercy through the Mediator, and, "by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well doing, ſeek for glory, and honor, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality."</p>
            <p>The LORD, that made heaven and earth, bleſs you out of Zion.</p>
            <closer>AMEN.</closer>
