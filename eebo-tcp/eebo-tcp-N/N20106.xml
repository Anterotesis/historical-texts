            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ACCORDING</hi> to the pleaſure of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, expreſſed in their reſolution of February <hi>23, 1791,</hi> I now lay before them, a <hi>REPORT</hi> on the <hi>PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILEGES</hi> and <hi>RESTRICTIONS</hi> on the <hi>COMMERCE</hi> of the United States in Foreign Countries. In order to keep the ſubject within thoſe bounds, which I ſuppoſed to be under the contemplation of the Houſe, I have reſtrained my ſtatements to thoſe countries only, with which we carry on a commerce of ſome importance, and to thoſe articles alſo of our produce, which are of ſenſible weight in the ſcale of our exports; and even theſe articles are ſometimes grouped together, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of favor or reſtriction, with which they are received in each country, and that degree expreſſed in general terms, without detailing the exact duty levied on each article.</p>
            <p>To have gone fully into theſe minutiae, would have been to copy the tariffs and books of rates of the different countries, and to have hidden under a maſs of detail, thoſe general and important truths, the extraction of which in a ſimple form, I conceived, would beſt anſwer the enquiries of the Houſe, by condenſing material information within thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of time and attention, which this portion of their duties may juſtly claim. The plan, indeed, of minute details, would have been impracticable with ſome countries, for want of information.</p>
            <p>Since preparing this Report, which was put into its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent form, in time to have been given in to the laſt ſeſſion of Congreſs, alterations of the conditions of our commerce with ſome foreign nations have taken place, ſome of them inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the war, ſome ariſing out of it. France has
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:026339_0003_0FCF9CEA1E3F6C68"/>
propoſed to enter into a new treaty of commerce with us, on liberal principles; and has, in the mean time, relaxed ſome of the reſtraints mentioned in the report.—Spain has, by an ordinance of June laſt, eſtabliſhed New-Orleans, Penſacola, and Saint Auguſtine into free ports, for the veſſels of friendly nations <hi>having treaties of commerce</hi> with her, provided they touch for a permit, at Corcubion in Gallicia, or at Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; and our rice is by the ſame ordinance, excluded from that country.—The circumſtances of the war have neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily given us freer acceſs to the Weſt-Indian iſlands, whilſt they have alſo drawn on our navigation, vexations and depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the moſt ſerious nature.</p>
            <p>To have endeavored to deſcribe all theſe, would have been as impracticable as uſeleſs, ſince the ſcenes would have been ſhifting, while under deſcription. I, therefore, think it beſt to leave the report, as it was formed, being adapted to a particular point of time, when things were in their ſettled order, that is to ſay, to the ſummer of <hi>1792.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:026339_0006_0FCF85E511CC51F8"/>Of our commercial objects, SPAIN receives favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, our bread ſtuff, ſalted fiſh, wood, ſhips, tar, pitch, and turpentine. On our meals, however, as well as on thoſe of other foreign countries, when re-exported to their colonies, they have lately impoſed duties, of from half a dollar, to two dollars the barrel, the duties being ſo proportioned to the current price of their own flour, as that both together, are to make the conſtant ſum of nine dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>They do not diſcourage our rice, pot and pearl aſh, ſalted proviſions, or whale oil: but theſe articles, being in ſmall demand at their markets, are carried thither but in a ſmall degree. Their demand for rice, however, is increaſing. Neither tobacco, nor indigo are received there. Our commerce is permitted with their Canary Iſlands, under the ſame conditions.</p>
            <p>Themſelves, and their colonies are the actual conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of what they receive from us.</p>
            <p>Our navigation is free with the kingdom of Spain; foreign goods being received there in our ſhips, on the ſame conditions as if carried in their own, or in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the country of which ſuch goods are the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture or produce.</p>
            <p>PORTUGAL receives favourably our grain, and bread, ſalted fiſh and other ſalted proviſions, wood, tar, pitch, and turpentine.</p>
            <p>For flaxſeed, pot, and pearl aſh, though not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there is little demand.</p>
            <p>Our ſhips pay twenty per cent. on being ſold to their ſubjects, and are then free bottoms.</p>
            <p>Foreign goods (except thoſe of the Eaſt-Indies) are received on the ſame footing in our veſſels, as in their own, or any others; that is to ſay, on general duties of from twenty to twenty-eight per cent. and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our navigation is unobſtructed by them. Tobacco, rice and meals, are prohibited.</p>
            <p>Themſelves and their colonies conſume what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026339_0007_0FCF9CF1F4FE4CA8"/>Theſe regulations extend to the Azores, Madeira, and the Cape de Verd Iſlands, except, that in theſe, meals and rice are received freely.</p>
            <p>FRANCE receives favourably our bread-ſtuff, rice, wood, pot and pearl aſhes.</p>
            <p>A duty of five ſous the kental, or nearly four and an half cents, is paid on our tar, pitch and turpentine. Our whale-oils pay ſix livres the kental, and are the only fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign whale-oils admitted. Our indigo pays five livres the kental; their own two and an half: but a difference of quality, ſtill more than a difference of duty, prevents its ſeeking that market.</p>
            <p>Salted beef is received freely for re-exportation; but if for home-conſumption, it pays five livres the kental. Other ſalted proviſions pay that duty in all caſes, and ſalted fiſh is made lately to pay the prohibitory one of twenty livres the kental.</p>
            <p>Our ſhips are free to carry thither all foreign goods, which may be carried in their own, or any other veſſels, except tobaccoes not of our own growth: and they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with theirs the excluſive carriage of our whale-oils, and tobaccoes.</p>
            <p>During their former government, our tobacco was under a monopoly, but paid no duties; and our ſhips were freely ſold in their ports, and converted into nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal bottoms. The firſt national aſſembly took from our ſhips this privilege. They emancipated tobacco from its monopoly, but ſubjected it to duties of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen livres fifteen ſous the kental, carried in their own veſſels, and twenty-five livres, carried in ours; a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference more than equal to the freight of the article.</p>
            <p>They and their colonies conſume what they receive from us.</p>
            <p>GREAT-BRITAIN receives our pot and pearl aſhes, free, while thoſe of other nations pay a duty of two ſhillings and three pence the kental. There is an equal diſtinction in favour of our bar-iron; of which article
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026339_0008_0FCF9CF337D00E30"/>
however we do not produce enough for our own uſe. Woods are free, from us, whilſt they pay ſome ſmall duty from other countries. Indigo and flax-ſeed, are free from all countries. Our tar and pitch pay eleven-pence ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the barrel. From other alien countries, they pay about a penny and a third more.</p>
            <p>Our tobacco, for their own conſumption, pays 1<hi>ſ</hi>3 ſterling the pound, cuſtom and exciſe, beſides heavy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of collection. And rice, in the ſame caſe, pays 7<hi>ſ</hi>4 ſterling the hundred weight; which, rendering it too dear, as an article of common food, it is conſequently, uſed in very ſmall quantity.</p>
            <p>Our ſalted fiſh, and other ſalted proviſions, except bacon, are prohibited. Bacon and whale-oils are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prohibitory duties: ſo are our grains, meals, and bread, as to internal conſumption; unleſs in times of ſuch ſcarcity as may raiſe the price of wheat to 50<hi>ſ.</hi> ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the quarter, and other grains and meals in proportion.</p>
            <p>Our ſhips, though purchaſed and navigated by their own ſubjects, are not permitted to be uſed, even in their trade with us.</p>
            <p>While the veſſels of other nations are ſecured by ſtanding laws, which cannot be altered, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current will of the three branches of the Britiſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in carrying thither any produce or manufacture of the country to which they belong, which may be lawfully carried in any veſſels, ours, with the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of what is foreign, are further prohibited by a ſtanding law (12. Car. 2.18. §. 3.) from carrying thither all and any of our own domeſtic productions and manufactures. A ſubſequent act, indeed, has authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed their executive to permit the carriage of our own productions in our own bottoms, at its ſole diſcretion: and the permiſſion has been given from year to year by proclamation; but ſubject every moment to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn on that ſingle will, in which event, our veſſels having any thing on board, ſtand interdicted from the entry of all Britiſh ports. The diſadvantage of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026339_0009_0FCF85ED0C323910"/>
which may be ſo ſuddenly diſcontinued, was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by our merchants on a late occaſion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>April</hi> 12. 1792.</note>, when an official notification that this law would be ſtrictly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, gave them juſt apprehenſions for the fate of their veſſels and cargoes diſpatched or deſtined to the ports of Great-Britain. The miniſter of that court indeed frankly expreſſed his perſonal conviction that the words of the order went farther than was intended, and ſo he afterwards officially informed us: but the embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moment were real and great, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of their renewal, lays our commerce to that country, under the ſame ſpecies of diſcouragement as to other countries, where it is regulated by a ſingle legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the diſtinction is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of fixed laws, while that ſecurity is given to the navigation of others.</p>
            <p>Our veſſels pay in their ports 1<hi>ſ</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſterling per ton, light and trinity dues, more than is paid by Britiſh ſhips, except in the port of London, where they pay the ſame as Britiſh.</p>
            <p>The greater part of what they receive from us is re-exported to other countries, under the uſeleſs charges of an intermediate depoſite, and double voyage. From tables publiſhed in England; and compoſed as is ſaid, from the books of their cuſtom-houſes, it appears that of the indigo imported there in the years 1773,—4,—5, one third was re-exported; and from a document of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, we learn, that, of the rice and tobacco imported there, before the war, four fifths were re-exported. We are aſſured indeed, that the quantities ſent thither for re-exportation ſince the war, are conſiderably diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet leſs ſo than reaſon and national intereſt would dictate. The whole of our grain is re-exported when wheat is below 50<hi>ſ.</hi> the quarter, and other grains in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>The UNITED NETHERLANDS prohibit our pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led beef and pork, meals and bread of all ſorts, and lay a prohibitary duty on ſpirits diſtilled from grain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:026339_0010_0FCF9CF4A9F13690"/>All other of our productions are received on varied duties, which may be reckoned, on a medium at about three per cent.</p>
            <p>They conſume but a ſmall proportion of what they receive. The reſidue is partly forwarded for conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the inland parts of Europe, and partly re-ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to other maritime countries. On the latter portion they intercept, between us and the conſumer ſo much of the value as is abſorbed by the charges attending an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate depoſite.</p>
            <p>Foreign goods, except ſome Eaſt-India articles, are received in veſſels of any nation.</p>
            <p>Our ſhips may be ſold and naturalized there, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of one or two privileges, which ſomewhat leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their value.</p>
            <p>DENMARK lays conſiderable duties on our tobacco and rice, carried in their own veſſels, and half as much more, if carried in ours; but the exact amount of theſe duties is not perfectly known here. They lay ſuch as amount to prohibitions on our indigo and corn.</p>
            <p>SWEDEN receives favourably our grains and meals, ſalted proviſions, indigo, and whale-oil.</p>
            <p>They ſubject our rice to duties of ſixteen mills the pound weight, carried in their own veſſels, and of forty per cent additional on that, or 22 4/10 mills, carried in ours, or any others. Being thus rendered too dear as an article of common food, little of it is conſumed with them. They conſume ſome of our tobaccoes, which they take circuitouſly through Great-Britain; levying hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy duties on them alſo; their duties of entry, town du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and exciſe, being 4.34 dollars, the hundred weight, if carried in their own veſſels, and of forty per cent on that additional, if earned in our own or any other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
            <p>They prohibit altogether our bread, fiſh, pot and pearl aſhes, flax-ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tar, pitch, and turpentine, wood, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept oak timber and maſts) and all foreign manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026339_0011_0FCF9CF61868AC28"/>Under ſo many reſtrictions and prohibitions, our navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation with them is reduced almoſt to nothing.</p>
            <p>With our neighbours, an order of things much harder preſents itſelf.</p>
            <p>SPAIN and PORTUGAL refuſe, to thoſe parts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica which they govern, all direct intercourſe with any people but themſelves. The commodities in mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, between them and their neighbours, muſt be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to be exchanged in ſome port of the dominant country; and the tranſportation between that and the ſubject-ſtate muſt be in a domeſtic bottom.</p>
            <p>FRANCE by a ſtanding law, permits her Weſt-India poſſeſſion<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to receive directly our vegetables, live-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, horſes, wood, tar, pitch, and turpentine, rice, and maize, and prohibits our other bread-ſtuff: but a ſuſpenſion of this prohibition having been left to the colonial legiſlatures, in times of ſcarcity, it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpended occaſionally, but latterly without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>Our fiſh and ſalted proviſions (except pork) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their iſlands under a duty of three colonial livre the kental, and our veſſels are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither, and to bring away rum and molaſſes.</p>
            <p>GREAT-BRITAIN admits in her iſlands, our vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, live-proviſions, horſes, wood, tar, pitch, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, rice, and bread-ſtuff, by a proclamation of her executive, limited always to the term of a year, but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto renewed from year to year. She prohibits our ſalted fiſh, and other ſalted proviſions. She does not permit our veſſels to carry thither our own produce.— Her veſſels alone, may take it from us, and bring in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, rum, molaſſes, ſugar, coffee, cocoa-nuts, ginger, and pimento. There are, indeed, ſome freedoms in the iſland of Dominica, but, under ſuch circumſtances, as to be little uſed by us. In the Britiſh continental colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and in Newfoundland, all our productions are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026339_0012_0FCF9CF7A29AE300"/>
and our veſſels forbidden to enter their ports. Their governors, however, in times of diſtreſs, have power to permit a temporary importation of certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, in their own bottoms, but not in ours.</p>
            <p>Our citizens cannot reſide as merchants or factors within any of the Britiſh plantations, this being expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited by the ſame ſtatute of 12. Car. 2. C. 18, commonly called the navigation act.</p>
            <p>In the DANISH-AMERICAN poſſeſſions, a duty of five per cent. is levied on our corn, corn-meal, rice, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, wood, ſalted fiſh, indigo, horſes, mules, and live ſtock; and of ten per cent. on our flour, ſalted pork, and beef, tar, pitch, and turpentine.</p>
            <p>In the AMERICAN iſlands of the UNITED NETHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANDS and SWEDEN, our veſſels and produce are received, ſubject to duties, not ſo heavy as to have been complained of: but they are heavier in the Dutch poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions on the continent.</p>
            <p>To ſum up theſe RESTRICTIONS, ſo far as they are important:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. IN EUROPE—</p>
            <p>Our bread-ſtuff is at moſt times under prohibitory duties in England, and conſiderably dutied on re-expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from Spain to her colonies.</p>
            <p>Our tobaccoes are heavily dutied in England, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and France, and prohibited in Spain, and Portugal.</p>
            <p>Our rice is heavily dutied in England and Sweden, and prohibited in Portugal.</p>
            <p>Our fiſh and ſalted proviſions are prohibited in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and under prohibitory duties in France.</p>
            <p>Our whale-oils are prohibited in England and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</p>
            <p>And our veſſels are denied naturalization in England, and of late in France.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. IN THE WEST-INDIES.</p>
            <p>All intercourſe is prohibited with the poſſeſſions of Spain, and Portugal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:026339_0013_0FCF9CF9275C5EC8"/>Our ſalted proviſions and fiſh are prohibited by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>Our ſalted pork, and bread-ſtuff (except maize) are received under temporary laws only, in the dominions of France, and our ſalted fiſh pays there a weighty duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. IN THE ARTICLE OF NAVIGATION.</p>
            <p>Our own carriage of our own tobacco, is heavily du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied in Sweden, and lately in France.</p>
            <p>We can carry no article, not of our own production, to the Britiſh ports in Europe.</p>
            <p>Nor even our own produce to her American poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Such being the reſtrictions on the commerce and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the United States, the queſtion is, in what way they may beſt be removed, modified, or counteracted?</p>
            <p>As to commerce, two methods occur, 1. By friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrangements with the ſeveral nations with whom theſe reſtrictions exiſt: Or, 2. By the ſeparate act of our own legiſlatures for countervailing their effects.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt, but that of theſe two, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrangement is the moſt eligible. Inſtead of embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing commerce under piles of regulating laws, duties, and prohibitions, could it be relieved from all its ſhackles in all parts of the world—could every country be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in producing that which nature has beſt fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with others mutual ſurpluſſes, for mutual wants, the greateſt maſs poſſible would then be produced of thoſe things which contribute to human life, and human happineſs; the numbers of mankind would be increaſed, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition bettered.</p>
            <p>Would even a ſingle nation begin with the United States this ſyſtem of free commerce, it would be adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to begin it with that nation; ſince it is one by one only, that it can be extended to all. Where the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of either party render it expedient to levy a revenue, by way of impoſt, on commerce, its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom might be modified, in that particular, by mutual and equivalent meaſures, preſerving it entire in all others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:026339_0014_0FCF9CFAE6913AE0"/>Some nations, not yet ripe for free commerce, in all its extent, might ſtill be willing to mollify its reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and regulations for us in proportion to the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which an intercourſe with us might offer. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly they may concur with us in reciprocating the duties to be levied on each ſide, or in compenſating any exceſs of duty, by equivalent advantages of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Our commerce is certainly of a character to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title it to favour in moſt countries. The commodities we offer, are either neceſſaries of life; or materials for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture; or convenient ſubjects of revenue: and we take in exchange, either manufactures, when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the laſt finiſh of art and induſtry; or mere luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Such cuſtomers may reaſonably expect welcome, and friendly treatment at every market: cuſtomers too, whoſe demands, increaſing with their wealth, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, muſt very ſhortly give full employment to the whole induſtry of any nation whatever, in any line of ſupply they may get into the habit of calling for, from it.</p>
            <p>But ſhould any nation, contrary to our wiſhes, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it may better find its advantage by continuing its ſyſtem of prohibitions, duties, and regulations, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to protect our citizens, their commerce and navigation, by counter-prohibitions, duties, and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo. Free commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for reſtrictions, and vexations; nor are they likely to produce a relaxation of them.</p>
            <p>Our navigation involves ſtill higher conſiderations. As a branch of induſtry, it is valuable; but, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource of defence, eſſential.</p>
            <p>Its value, as a branch of induſtry, is inhanced by the dependence of ſo many other branches on it. In times of general peace it multiplies competitors for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in tranſportation, and ſo keeps that at its proper level; and in times of war, that is to ſay, when thoſe nations who may be our principal carriers, ſhall be at war with each other, if we have not within ourſelves the means of tranſportation, our produce muſt be export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026339_0015_0FCF9CFC8B6A8FC8"/>
in belligerent veſſels at the increaſed expenſe of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freight and inſurance, and the articles which will not bear that, muſt periſh on our hands.</p>
            <p>But it is as a reſource for defence that our navigation will admit neither neglect nor forbearance. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and circumſtances of the United States leave them nothing to fear on their land-board, and nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire beyond their preſent rights. But, on their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, they are open to injury, and they have there too, a commerce which muſt be protected. This can only be done by poſſeſſing a reſpectable body of citizen-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of artiſts and eſtabliſhments in readineſs for ſhip building.</p>
            <p>Were the ocean, which is the common property of all, open to the induſtry of all, ſo that every perſon and veſſel ſhould be free to take employment wherever it could be found, the United States would certainly not ſet the example of appropriating to themſelves, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, any portion of the common ſtock of occupation. They would rely on the enterprize and activity of their citizens for a due participation of the benefits of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring buſineſs, and for keeping the marine claſs of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens equal to their object. But if particular nations graſp at undue ſhares, and more eſpecially, if they ſeize on the means of the United States to convert them into aliment for their own ſtrength, and withdraw them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from the ſupport of thoſe to whom they belong, defenſive and protecting meaſures become neceſſary on the part of the nation whoſe marine reſources are thus invaded, or it will be diſarmed of its defence; its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions will lie at the mercy of the nation which has poſſeſſed itſelf excluſively of the means of carrying them, and its politics may be influenced by thoſe who command its commerce. The carriage of our own commodities, if once eſtabliſhed in an other channel, cannot be reſumed in the moment we may deſire. If we loſe the ſeamen and artiſts, whom it now occupies, we loſe the preſent means of marine defence, and time will be requiſite to raiſe up others, when diſgrace or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026339_0016_0FCF9CFF2540A2E8"/>
loſſes ſhall bring home to our feelings the error of having abandoned them. The materials for maintaining our due ſhare of navigation, are ours in abundance; and, as to the mode of uſing them, we have only to adopt the principles of thoſe who thus put us on the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, or others, equivalent and better fitted to our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>The following principles, being founded in recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, appear perfectly juſt, and to offer no cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to any nation.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Where a nation impoſes high duties on our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for us to do the ſame by theirs, firſt burthening or excluding thoſe productions which they bring here, in competition with our own of the ſame kind; ſelecting next ſuch manufactures as we take from them in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt quantity, and which at the ſame time we could the ſooneſt furniſh to ourſelves, or obtain from other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; impoſing on them duties, lighter at firſt; but heavier and heavier afterwards, as other channels of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply open. Such duties having the effect of indirect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to domeſtic manufactures of the ſame kind, may induce the manufacturer to come himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe ſtates, where cheaper ſubſiſtence, equal laws, and a vent of his wares, free of duty, may enſure him the higheſt profits from his ſkill and induſtry. And here it would be in the power of the ſtate governments to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate eſſentially, by opening the reſources of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement which are under their controul, extending them liberally to artiſts in thoſe particular branches of manufacture, for which their ſoil, climate, population, and other circumſtances, have matured them, and foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the precious efforts and progreſs of <hi>houſehold</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture by ſome patronage ſuited to the nature of its objects, guided by the local informations they poſſeſs and guarded againſt abuſe by their preſence and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The oppreſſions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occaſion of relieving it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026339_0017_0FCF85F5190C8D48"/>
from a dependence on the councils and conduct of others, and of promoting arts, manufactures, and population at home.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Where a nation refuſes permiſſion to our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and factors to reſide within certain parts of their dominions, we may, if it ſhould be thought expedient, refuſe reſidence to theirs in any and every part of ours, or modify their tranſactions.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Where a nation refuſes to receive in our veſſels any productions but our own, we may refuſe to receive, in theirs, any but their own productions. The firſt and ſecond clauſes of the bill reported by the committee, are well formed to effect this object.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Where a nation refuſes to conſider any veſſel as ours, which has not been built within our territories, we ſhould refuſe to conſider as theirs, any veſſel not built within their territories.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. Where a nation refuſes to our veſſels the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage even of our own productions, to certain countries under their domination, we might refuſe to theirs, of every deſcription, the carriage of the ſame productions to the ſame countries. But as juſtice and good neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood would dictate, that thoſe who have no part in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the reſtriction on us, ſhould not be the victims of meaſures adopted to defeat its effect, it may be proper to confine the reſtriction to veſſels owned or navigated by any ſubjects of the ſame dominant power, other than the inhabitants of the country to which the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions are to be carried. And to prevent all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the ſaid inhabitants, and to our own, by too ſudden a check on the means of tranſportation, we may continue to admit the veſſels marked for future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, on an advanced tonnage, and for ſuch length of time only, as may be ſuppoſed neceſſary to provide againſt that inconvenience.</p>
            <p>The eſtabliſhment of ſome of theſe principles by Great-Britain, alone, has already loſt us in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with that country and its poſſeſſions, between
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026339_0018_0FCF9D00A00E3CE0"/>
eight and nine hundred veſſels of near 40,000 tons bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, according to ſtatements from official materials, in which they have confidence. This involves a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional loſs of ſeamen, ſhip-wrights, and ſhip-building, and is too ſerious a loſs to admit forbearance of ſome effectual remedy.</p>
            <p>It is true we muſt expect ſome inconvenience in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, from the eſtabliſhment of diſcriminating duties.— But in this, as in ſo many other caſes, we are left to chuſe between two evils. Theſe inconveniencies are nothing, when weighed againſt the loſs of wealth, and loſs of force, which will follow our perſeverance in the plan of indiſcrimination. When once it ſhall be perceived that we are either in the ſyſtem, or the habit, of giving equal advantages to thoſe who extinguiſh our commerce and navigation, by duties and prohibitions, as to thoſe who treat both with liberality and juſtice, liberality and juſtice will be converted by all into duties and prohibitions. It is not to the moderation and juſtice of others, we are to truſt for fair and equal acceſs to market with our produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or for our due ſhare in the tranſportation of them; but to our own means of independence, and the firm will to uſe them. Nor do the inconveniences of diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination merit conſideration. Not one of the nations before mentioned; perhaps, not a commercial nation on earth, is without them. In our caſe, one diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone will ſuffice, that is to ſay, between nations who favor our productions and navigation, and thoſe who do not favour them. One ſet of moderate duties, ſay the preſent duties, for the firſt, and a fixed advance on theſe, as to ſome articles, and prohibitions as to others, for the laſt.</p>
            <p>Still it muſt be repeated that friendly arrangements are preferable with all who will come into them; and that we ſhould carry into ſuch arrangements all the liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſpirit of accommodation, which the nature of the caſe will admit.</p>
            <p>France has, of her own accord, propoſed negotiati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons for improving, by a new treaty on fair and equal
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026339_0019_0FCF9D06C09DCA88"/>
principles, the commercial relations of the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. But her internal diſturbances have hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the proſecution of them to effect, though we have had repeated aſſurances of a continuance of the diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Propoſals of friendly arrangement have been made on our part, by the preſent government, to that of Great Britain, as the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtates: but being already on as good a footing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and a better in fact, than the moſt favoured nation, they have not, as yet, diſcovered any diſpoſition to have it meddled with.</p>
            <p>We have no reaſon to conclude that friendly arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be declined by the other nations, with whom we have ſuch commercial intercourſe as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them important. In the mean while, it would reſt with the wiſdom of Congreſs to determine whether, as to thoſe nations, they will not ſurceaſe exparte regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on the reaſonable preſumption that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in doing whatever juſtice and moderation, dictate ſhould be done.</p>
