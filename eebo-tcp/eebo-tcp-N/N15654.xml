         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON Wedneſday the Twenty-Ninth Day of June, 1785, late in the Evening, a large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of armed Men paſſed the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019979_0008_0FAD4837042FDA88"/>
Houſe, on their Way to <hi>Kentucky</hi>; ſome Part of whom incamped within two Miles. Mr. <hi>Scott</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Frontier Part, generally made the Family watchful; but on this calamitous Day, after ſo large a Body of Men had paſſed, ſhortly after Night, he lay down in his Bed, and imprudently left one of the Doors of his Houſe open; the Children were alſo in Bed and aſleep. Mrs. <hi>Scott</hi> was nearly undreſſed, when, to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable Aſtoniſhment and Horror, ſhe ſaw ruſhing in through the Door that was left open, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Savages with preſented Arms, raiſing a hideous Shriek;—Mr. <hi>Scott</hi> being awake, inſtantly jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of his Bed, but was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fired at: He forced his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019979_0009_0FAD483826D4BC20"/>
Way through the Middle of the Enemy and got out of the Door, but fell a few Paces from thence. An Indian ſeized Mrs. <hi>Scott</hi> and ordered her to a particular Spot and not to move; others ſtabbed and cut the Throats of the three youngeſt Children in their Bed, and afterwards lifted them up and daſhed them down on the Floor, near the Mother; the eldeſt, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Girl of eight Years old, awoke and eſcaped out of the Bed, and ran to her Parent, and, with the moſt plaintive Accents, cried, 'O Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma! Mamma! ſave me!' The Mother, in the deepeſt Anguiſh of Spirit and with a Flood of Tears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Savages to ſpare her Child; but with a brutal Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they tomahawked and ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her in the Mother's Arms. Adjacent to Mr. <hi>Scott</hi>'s Dwelling-Houſe,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019979_0010_0FAD4838F93DA7F0"/>
another Family lived, of the name of <hi>Ball.</hi> The Indians alſo attacked them at the ſame Inſtant they did Mr. <hi>Scott</hi>'s; but the Door being ſhut, the Enemy fired into the Houſe thro' an Opening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Logs, and killed a young Lad, and then eſſayed to force the Door open; but a ſurviving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fired through the Door, and the Enemy deſiſted and went off: The remaining Part of the Family ran out of the Houſe and eſcaped. In Mr. <hi>Scott</hi>'s Houſe were four good Rifles well loaded, and a great Quantity of Cloathing and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Part of which belonged to People that had left it on their Way to <hi>Kentucky.</hi> The Indians loaded themſelves with the Plunder, being thirteen in Number, then ſpeedily made off, and continued travelling all Night; next Morning their

            <p>The Eleventh Day after Mrs. <hi>Scott</hi>'s Captivity, the four Indians that had her in Charge ſtopped at a Place of Rendezvous, and to hunt, being now in great want of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Three went out, and the Chief, being an old Man, was left to take Care of the Priſoner, who, by this Time expreſſed a Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to proceed to the Indian Towns, which ſeemed to have the deſired Effect of leſſening her Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's Vigilance. In the Day-Time, as the old Man was graining a Deer Skin, the Captive, pondering on her Situation, and anxiouſly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an Opportunity to make her Eſcape, took the Reſolution, and

Liberty to go a ſmall Diſtance to a Stream of Water, to waſh the Blood off her Apron, that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained beſmeared ſince the fatal Night of the Murder of her little Daughter. He ſaid to her in the Engliſh Tongue, "Go along;" ſhe then paſſed by him, his Face being in a contrary Direction from that ſhe was going, and he very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. She, after getting to the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019979_0013_0FAD483AD92A5260"/>
Water, proceeded on without Delay, made to a high barren Mountain, and travelled until late in the Evening, when ſhe came down to the Valley, in ſearch of the Track ſhe had been taken along; hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to find the Way back, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Riſque of being loſt, and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Hunger in uninhabited Parts.</p>
            <p>On coming acroſs the Valley to the River-Side, ſuppoſed to be the Eaſterly Branch of <hi>Kentucky-River,</hi> ſhe obſerved in the Sand, Tracks of two Men, that had gone up the River, and had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.—She concluded theſe to have been her Purſuers, which excited Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gratitude and Thankfulneſs to Divine Providence for ſo timeous a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. Being without any Proviſions, having no kind of Weapon or Tool to aſſiſt her in getting any, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſtitute of Cloathing, alſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a vaſt Tract of rugged high Mountains intervened, between where where ſhe was and the Inhabitants Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; and the Diſtance of the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky</hi> Settlements unknown, and ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ignorant as a Child of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſteering through the Woods, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited

painful Senſations.—But certain Death, either by Hunger or by wild Beaſts, ſeemed preferrable, rather than to be in the Power of Beings who had excited in her Mind ſuch Horrour. She addreſſed Heaven for Protection, and taking Courage, proceeded onward. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter travelling three Days ſhe had nearly met with the Indians, as ſhe ſuppoſed, that had been ſent to <hi>Clinch</hi> to ſteal Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but providentially hearing their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, concealed herſelf among the Cane, until the Enemy had paſſed. This giving a freſh Alarm, and her Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with Conſternation, ſhe got loſt, proceeding backwards and forwards for ſeveral Days: At length ſhe came to a River, that ſeemed to come from the Eaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concluding it was <hi>Sandy-River,</hi> ſhe reſolved to trace it to its Source, which is adjacent to the <hi>Clinch</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After proceeding up the River ſeveral Days, ſhe came to where the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver runs through the <hi>Great Laurel Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> where is a prodigious Water-Fall, and numerous high craggy Clifts along the Water-Edge; that Way ſeemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable, the Mountain ſteep and difficult: However, our mournful Traveller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019979_0015_0FAD483C49150AF0"/>
that the latter Way was the beſt. She therefore aſcended for ſome Time, but coming to a Range of inacceſſible Rocks, ſhe turned her Courſe towards the Mountain and the River-Side; after getting into a deep Gulley, and paſſing over ſeveral high ſteep Rocks, ſhe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the River-Side, where to her inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Affliction, ſhe found that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Rock, or rather one that hung over, of Fifteen or Twenty Feet high, formed the Bank. Here a ſolemn Pauſe took Place; ſhe eſſayed to return, but the Height of the ſteep Rocks ſhe had deſcended over prevented her. She then returned to the Edge of the Precipice, and viewed the Bottom of it as the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Place to end all her Troubles, or remain on the Top to pine away with Hunger, or be devoured by wild Beaſts. After ſerious Meditation, and devout Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, ſhe determined on leaping from the Height, and accordingly jumped off. Although the Place ſhe had to alight on, was covered with uneven Rocks, not a Bone was broken; but being exceeding-ſtunned with the Fall, ſhe remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to proceed for ſome Space of Time.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019979_0016_0FAD483D24C23B88"/>
The dry Seaſon cauſed the River to be ſhallow—ſhe travelled in it, where ſhe could, by its Edge, until ſhe got through the Mountain, which, ſhe concluded was ſeveral Miles. After this, as ſhe was travelling along the Bank of the River, a venomous Snake bit her on the Ankle: She had Strength to kill it, and knowing its Kind, concluded that Death muſt ſoon, overtake her. By this time Mrs. <hi>Scott</hi> was reduced to a mere Skeleton, with Fatigue, Hunger and Grief; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably this State of her Body was the Means of preſerving her from the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Poiſon; be that as it may, ſo it was, that very little Pain ſuceeeded the Bite, and what little Swelling there was fell into her Feet.</p>
            <p>Our Wanderer now left the River, and after proceeding a good Diſtance, ſhe came to where the Valley parted into two, each leading a different Courſe. Here a painful Suſpenſe again took Place: A forlorn Creature almoſt exhauſted and certain, if ſhe was far led out of the Way, ſhe ſhould never ſee a human Creature. During this Soliloquy, a

beautiful Bird paſſed cloſe by her, flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the Ground, and went out of Sight up one of the Vallies. This drew her Attention, and whilſt conſidering what it might mean, another Bird of the ſame Appearance, flattered paſt her, and took the ſame Valley the other had done. This determined her Choice of the Way; and, in two Days, which was on the Eleventh Day of Auguſt, ſhe reached that Settlement on <hi>Clinch</hi> called <hi>New-Garden</hi>: Whereas (ſhe has ſince been informed by Woods-Men) had ſhe taken the other Valley, it would have led her back to the <hi>Ohio.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Scott</hi> relates, that the Indians told her, that the Party was compoſed of four different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, two of whom ſhe thinks they nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Mingoes.</hi>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:019979_0018_0FAD483EABB15D20"/>She further relates, that, wandering from the Tenth of July to the Eleventh of Auguſt, ſhe had no other Subſiſtence but chewing and ſwallowing the Juice of young Cane-Stalks, Saſſafras-Leaves, and ſome other Plants ſhe did not know the Name of; that, on her Journey, ſhe ſaw Buffaloes, Serpents, Elks, Deers, and frequently Bears and Wolves; not one of which offered her the leaſt Harm. One Day a Bear came near her, with a young Fawn in his Mouth, and, on diſcovering her, he dropped his Prey and run off. Hunger prompted her to go and take the Fleſh and eat it; but, on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, ſhe deſiſted, thinking the Bear might return and devour her: Beſides, ſhe had an Averſion to taſte raw Fleſh.— Mrs. <hi>Scott</hi> continues in a low State of Health, and remains inconſolable for the Loſs of her Family, particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the cruel Death of her little Daughter.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:019979_0020_0FAD4840066C3DC8"/>I Was taken Priſoner about fifty Miles to the Weſtward of <hi>Fort-Pitt,</hi> about Eighteen Years ago, by the Indians, and carried away by them to the <hi>Wabaſh,</hi> with many more White Men, who were execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Circumſtances of horrid Barbarity; it was my good Fortune to call forth the Sympathy of what is called the Good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Town, who was permitted to redeem me from the Flames, by giving, as my Ranſom, a Horſe.</p>
            <p>After remaining two Years in Bondage amongſt the Indians, a <hi>Spaniard</hi> came to the Nation, having been ſent from <hi>Mexico</hi> on Diſcoveries. He made Application to the Chiefs for redeeming me, and another White Man who was in a like Situation, a Native of <hi>Wales,</hi> named <hi>John Davey</hi>; which they complied with, and we took our Departure in Company with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and travelled to the Weſtward, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> near the <hi>River-Rouge,</hi> or <hi>Red-River,</hi> up which we travelled ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Hundred Miles, when we came to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Indians remarkable white, and whoſe Hair was of a rediſh Colour, at leaſt moſtly ſo; they lived on the Banks of a ſmall River that empties itſelf into the <hi>Red River,</hi> which is called the <hi>River-Poſt.</hi> In the Morning of the Day after our Arrival among theſe Indians, the <hi>Welchman</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

me that he determined to tarry with them, giving as a Reaſon that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their Language, it being very little different from the <hi>Welch.</hi> My Curioſity was excited very much by this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I went with my Companion to the Chief Men of the Town, who inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him (in a Language that I had no Knowledge of, and which had no Affinity to that of any other Indian Tongue that I ever heard) that the Forefathers of this Nation came from a Foreign Country, and landed on the Eaſt-Side of the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> deſcribing particularly the Country now called <hi>Weſt-Florida,</hi> and that on the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> taking Poſſeſſion of <hi>Mexico,</hi> they fled to their then abode; and, as a Proof of the Truth of what they advanced, they bro't forth Rolls of Parchment carefully tied up in Otter-Skins, on which were large Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters written with blue Ink; the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I did not underſtand, and the <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> being unacquained with Letters, even of his own Language, I was not able to know the Meaning of the Writing. They were a bold, hardy, intrepid People, very warlike, and the Women beautiful, when compared with other Indians.</p>
            <p>We left this Nation, after being kindly treated, and requeſted to remain amongſt them, being only two in Number, the

               <hi>Spaniard</hi> and myſelf, and we continued our Courſe up the Waters of the <hi>Red-River,</hi> until we came to a Nation of Indians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Windots,</hi> that had never ſeen a White Man before, and who were unacquainted with the Uſe of Fire-Arms. On our Way we came to a tranſparent Stream, which we, to our great Surpriſe, found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the Earth, and, at the Foot of a Ridge of Mountains, diſappeared; it was remarkable clear, and near to it we found the Bones of two Animals, of ſuch a Size that a Man might walk under the Ribs, and the Teeth were very heavy.</p>
            <p>The Nation of Indians that had never ſeen a White Man, lived near the Source of the <hi>Red-River,</hi> and there the <hi>Spaniard</hi> diſcovered to his great Joy, Gold-Duſt in the Brooks and Rivulets, and being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Indians that a Nation lived further Weſt, who were very rich, and whoſe Arrows were pointed with Gold, we ſet out in hope of reaching their Country, and we travelled about five Hundred Miles until we came to a Ridge of Mountains, which we croſſed, and from which the Streams run due Weſt, and at the Foot of the Mountains the <hi>Spaniard</hi> gave Proofs of Joy and great Satisfaction, having found Gold in great Abundance. I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Nature of the Ore, but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019979_0023_0FAD4842448E9488"/>
I lifted up what he called Gold-Duſt from the Bottom of the little Rivulets iſſuing from the Cavities of the Rocks, and it had a yellowiſh caſt, and was remarkable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; but ſo much was the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he relinquiſhed his Plan of a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, convinced he had found a gold Country.</p>
            <p>On our return we took a different Rout and when we reached the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> we went in a Canoe to the Mouth of <hi>Miſſouri,</hi> where we found a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Poſt; there I was diſcharged by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> went to the Country of the <hi>Chickeſaws,</hi> from thence to the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> and ſoon reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ninety-Six,</hi> in <hi>South-Carolina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for me to give an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Deſcription of the Country on the South-Weſt Side of the <hi>Miſſiſippi</hi>; I was charmed with the Richneſs of the Land on the North-Eaſt Side of that noble River, until I beheld the other Country; the Luxuriance of the Soil, the Richneſs of the Herbage, the Majeſty of the Foreſts, and the Fertility of the Meadows, which in many Places are of amazing extent, and covered with rich Graſs and Clover, in Height at leaſt three Feet; the Woods are full of Deer, Elk, Buffalo, &amp;c. and, in the Autumn, Grapes and Apples are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to be found; in ſhort, every other
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019979_0024_0FAD4844F977DE48"/>
that Country known in <hi>Europe</hi> by the Name of <hi>Louiſiana</hi>; the air is pure and ſerene, and the Climate as healthy as any in the World; Nature has been wonderfully bountiful in furniſhing Water in the greateſt Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and in many Places Acres of ground are covered with Salt-Rock, where Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals go at certain Seaſons, and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pleaſing to obſerve the Marks of the Tongues of various wild Beaſts on the Surface of the Salt-Rocks.</p>
            <p>No Country in the World is better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the culture of Rice, Indigo and Tobacco, when it is conſidered that, on the Banks of the <hi>Miſſouri</hi> and the <hi>Red River</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, a Quantity of theſe Articles might be made ſufficient to ſupply all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>; and, for 1000 Miles from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of each River, Ships could be built, and for 3 Months of the Year, the current runs with ſuch Rapidity that they could go down the Stream 100 Miles in 24 Hours.
