            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Perſon ſpoken of, is the renowned <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> A Perſon of an illuſtrious Houſe, of the Lyon-like Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> tho' the firſt of his Family that came to the Throne.</p>
            <p>HIS Anceſtor of the third aſcent was BOAZ; who is ſaid to have been a mighty Man of wealth in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ruth II. 1—4.</note>. And the ſecond above <hi>Him</hi> was NAHSHON; who is ſaid to be the head of the Houſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea a renowned Perſon of the Congregation, a Prince of the Tribe of his Father, and one of the Heads of the Thouſands in Iſrael, <hi>Numb.</hi> I. 4, 7, 16. And in the following Chapter, we find him at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002949_0006_0FE6A0E974E52340"/>Appointment pitching by his own Standard, with the Enſign of his Father's Houſe, on the Eaſtern ſide of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> as Captain of the Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> and Head of his Hoſt of above 70 Thouſand Men: to defend that Sacred and Divine Pavilion, as it march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thro' the Wilderneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. II. 1,—4.</note>. And on the ſame day that <hi>Moſes</hi> had fully ſet up the Tabernacle, this great Captain was the very firſt of the twelve Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Heads of the Houſe of their Fathers, who were the Princes of the Tribes, and were over them that were numbered; who brought their rich and liberal Offerings before the Altar: and he made his Offering the firſt day as the Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. VII. 1, 2, 10,— 17. &amp; 1 Chron. II. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>THIS was <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe's</hi> nearer and illuſtrious Pedigree. He was one of the moſt Princely Families in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> not to mention <hi>Three</hi> of his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Brethren, whom we find as Voluntiers in King <hi>Saul's</hi> Armies, Fighting againſt the <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Enemies, thoſe implacable haters of their Nation and pure Religion.</p>
            <p>As for his own <hi>Perſonal</hi> Indowments—He was of a beautiful and ruddy Countenance and goodly to look to: a comely Perſon, prudent in matters, a Man of War, a mighty valiant Man, and the <hi>Lord</hi> was with him <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Sam. XVI. 12, 18. &amp; Ch. XVII. 42.</note>. This is the Character we have of <hi>David,</hi> even when he was a Youth, while he dwelt at his Father's Houſe, and before he came into any proſpect of the Crown of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He was every way accompliſhed to defend and rule ſo great a People, and to make them happy.</p>
            <p>BUT how came the Son of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> to aſcend the Throne of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR he was neither the eldeſt Branch of <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor of <hi>Judah,</hi> nor of his Grandſon <hi>Hezron,</hi> nor yet of his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002949_0007_0FE6A114996FEAC8"/>own, Father <hi>Jeſſe;</hi> and there were great numbers of <hi>prior</hi> Lines by Birth Surviving: So that if the <hi>Senior</hi> Branch were to be indefeaſably prefer'd, he could never have had a Right or Hope of aſcending to ſo much as the Principality of his own ſingle <hi>Tribe:</hi> And yet the Text obſerves that he came to Reign over <hi>all Iſrael</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REUBEN was the firſt born of <hi>Jacob:</hi> And ſo the Birthright was by Nature his, &amp; would have deſcended ſo to his eldeſt offspring. But for his ſignal wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he both forfeited the Priviledge for Himſelf and the Intail for his Poſterity. His Father <hi>Jacob</hi> therefore by Divine direction juſtly cut him off: Declaring that tho' <hi>Reuben</hi> was his firſt born, his might and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his ſtrength, the excellence of Dignity and the excellence of Power; yet for his great unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſhould be as unſtable as water, he ſhould not excell: And then the <hi>Patriarch</hi> gave away the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of Inheritance to <hi>Joſeph</hi> &amp; the Power to <hi>Judah,</hi> his younger Children <note n="‖" place="bottom">Gen. XLIX.</note>. Agreeable to this, the Writer of this Book obſerves, in the 5th Chap. at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; That tho' REUBEN <hi>was the firſt born, yet his Birthright was given to the ſons of</hi> JOSEPH, <hi>the ſon of</hi> ISRAEL: <hi>And the Genealogy is not to be reckoned after the Birthright: For</hi> JUDAH <hi>prevailed above his Brethren, and of him came the chief Ruler, but the Birthright was</hi> JOSEPHS.</p>
            <p>THIS no doubt was a ſpecial work of GOD: with whom it is as equal to raiſe thoſe Children he brings forth later into the World, to an higher Power and Dignity, as to bring forth others into the World before them. But who is there that does not admire the Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs &amp; Goodneſs of his Conduct in this matter? And is not this <hi>Divine Example</hi> written for our Admonition alſo, on whom the ends of the World are come? And wherefore ſhould it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, but to teach us; That in Imitation of the like Perfections, Parents, and much more Kings &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002949_0008_0FE6A0E9ACFB1B30"/>for a greater and more neceſſary Good, may ſet aſide thoſe elder Branches that have rendered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves utterly unworthy to excell, and beſtow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance &amp; Rule on younger? That ſo the <hi>Senior</hi> Branches, eſpecially of more Publick Families, may be more careful of their Principles &amp; Conduct, and may not forfeit their Succeſſion: And in caſe they ſhould— that the <hi>Junior</hi> Ones may by the ſame means ſecure their own Reverſion to the forfeited Inheritance.</p>
            <p>BUT to return —</p>
            <p>As the moſt wiſe and righteous GOD was pleas'd to chooſe the younger Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> for the Principal Seat of Power in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo he likewiſe choſe his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>David</hi> a younger Branch of the Princely line to be Ruler of his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam VII. 8 Pſal. LXXVIII 68, — 71.</note>. Agreably to this he afterwards declar'd in a Great Aſſembly of all the Princes of the Tribes, with the Captains, Officers and mighty Men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Chron.

            <p>GOD had indeed, before, inſtated <hi>Saul</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Family in this Royal Dignity. But upon his great Folly, Raſhneſs, Prevarication and Rebellion againſt the LORD, who had ſo highly exalted him; it is ſaid, The LORD repented that He had ſet him up to be <hi>King</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. XV. 11, 35.</note>: And becauſe that <hi>Saul</hi> had rejected the word of the LORD, therefore the LORD had rejected <hi>him</hi> from Reigning over <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ver. 23, 26 and Chap. XVI. 1.</note>. Yea the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> plainly tells him, 1 Sam.

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002949_0009_0FE6A1215EFBB788"/>had left behind him both a legitimate Female and Male Poſterity; yet they were entirely excluded with Him, and their entail to the Crown cut off for ever.

            <p>BUT this <hi>better Neighbour</hi> was the excellent young DAVID the Son of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> For now the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree breaks forth concerning Him: And <hi>Samuel</hi> is quickly ſent, even while <hi>Saul</hi> was yet alive, to the Houſe of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> to anoint his Son and ſignify his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deſignation to the Kingly Dignity.</p>
            <p>BUT his Aſcent to this was Gradual, and thro' a great variety of ſurprizing Turns and ſtrenuous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
            <p>HE was quickly called forth by Providence, into Publick Service. And then he gave a fair &amp; charming <hi>Specimen</hi> of the Glory &amp; Felicity of his future Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>HE began with a moſt Heroick Act of Zeal and Courage in the Cauſe of GOD &amp; <hi>Iſrael</hi>

Being ſet over the Men of War, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the ſight of all the People, and even alſo in the ſight of <hi>Sauls</hi> Servants, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XVIII. 5. At the 13th Verſe, we read, that being made a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over an Army, He went out and came in before the People, He behaved himſel wifely in all his ways, and the LORD was with him.

SAUL indeed for this grew very jealous &amp; fearful of him; and became his inveterate and perpetual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam.

He ſtiles them, <hi>The Floods of ungodly Men;</hi> or the Floods of <hi>Belial,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Margin</hi> have it. <hi>But all Iſrael and Judah loved</hi> DAVID <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Sam. XVIII. 16</note>. The Generality of the Nation loved him, and had their Eyes upon him, even when they dare hardly ſhow it thro' the Violence and Rancour of his reigning Enemies. And what is uſual in ſuch a caſe, their Enmity and Fear excited them to ſuch a Train of violent Proceedings, as extreamly weakned their own Eſteem and Intereſt, increaſed his, and even helpt to pave the way for that Succeſſion, which they did their utmoſt to prevent for ever.</p>
            <p>IN the mean while, his Conduct was ſo exact and perfect, that even <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf acknowledg'd that DAVID was more Righteous than he <note n="‖" place="bottom">Chap XXIV. 17.</note>. <hi>Abigail</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that evil had not been found in him all his days <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap.

Yea ſo great a Love had many, even of the very <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi> for him; that in the moſt dangerous conjuncture which threatned his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; Succeſſion, they ventur'd to go over to him; proteſting as in 1 Chron.

            </p>
            <p>Now all this was during the Life of <hi>Saul.</hi> And then afterwards—for many Years before his Acceſſion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002949_0011_0FE6480BCCA90720"/>to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the Reign of <hi>Saul's Succeſſor,</hi> he gave a bright Example of an happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, while he ruled over his own <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> only.

            <p>BY this Hiſtorical Expreſſion at the Cloſe of His Royal Life, there ſeems to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſhort Review of the Manner of it. <hi>Thus he reigned, i. e.</hi> Thus as we have above deſcribed; thus Couragiouſly &amp; Wifely, thus Righteouſly &amp; Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; thus kindly, gently, ſucceſsfully and happily.</p>
            <p>THIS Illuſtrious Perſon did not then change the Tenour of his happy Government, or diſappoint the raiſed Expectations of the Tribes of the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when they had unanimouſly called him to the Head of Empire.

            <p>BY the Books of <hi>Samuel, Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> as alſo by the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> it appears he had many Enemies both Foreign and Domeſtick; and not only before but alſo after his Acceſſion to the Throne.

            <p>KING DAVID had a moſt hopeful Son appointed to ſucceed Him in the Kingdom: and this was SOLOMON.</p>
            <p>FOR the Crown of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not only ſetled on DAVID, but alſo on his POSTERITY after Him; and this on certain Conditions for ever, 2 Sam.

            <p>THE excellent Bleſſing &amp; Charge of <hi>his Father</hi> is in theſe remarkable words, 2 Chron.

Only the Lord give thee wiſdom and underſtanding, and give thee charge concerning Iſrael, that thou mayſt keep the law of the Lord thy God. Then ſhalt thou proſper, if thou takeſt heed to fulfil the ſtatutes and judgments, which the Lord charged Moſes with, concerning Iſrael: Be ſtrong and of good courage, dread not, nor be diſmayed.</hi>

            <p>AND the Hiſtory of his pious Petition is in the Chapter immediately ſucceeding our Text, from the 7th to the 12th verſe— <hi>In that night did God appear to</hi> SOLOMON, <hi>and ſaid unto him, ask what I ſhall give thee. And</hi> SOLOMON <hi>ſaid to God, Thou haſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great mercy to</hi> DAVID <hi>my Father, and haſt made me to reign in his ſtead. Now, O Lord God, let thy promiſe to</hi> DAVID <hi>my Father be eſtabliſhed: for thou haſt made me King over a People, like the duſt of the earth in multitude. Give me now Wiſdom and Knowledge, that I may go out and come in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this People: for who can judge this thy People that is ſo great? And God ſaid to</hi> SOLOMON, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was in thine heart and thou haſt not asked riches, wealth or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet haſt asked long life; but haſt asked Wiſdom and Knowledge for thy ſelf, that thou mayſt judge my People, over whom I have made thee King: Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge is granted to thee, and I will give thee Riches and Wealth, and Honour, ſuch as
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002949_0019_0FE6A12D1741D798"/>none of the Kings have had that have been before thee, neither ſhall there any after thee have the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS was SOLOMON the Son of DAVID, that Reigned in his ſtead. And the Kingdom quickly <hi>ſaw that the Wiſdom of GOD was in him to do Judgment</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Kings III. 28.</note>. And alſo <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who was ever a Lover of his Father DAVID, and his firm and faithful Allie, <hi>Rejoyced greatly and ſaid, Becauſe the Lord hath loved his People, he hath made Thee King over them: And Bleſſed be the Lord this Day, which hath given to</hi> DAVID <hi>a wiſe Son over this Great People.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>AND thus have we conſidered the words in their <hi>Firſt Importance;</hi> as they reſpected the Reign and Death of DAVID, and the Happy Succeſſion of his Son SOLOMON.</p>
            <p>WE now Proceed in the II. Place, <hi>TO Apply them to the Great Event of Providence before us; in the late Reign and Death of our moſt Gracious Sovereign</hi> KING GEORGE <hi>the</hi> I, <hi>of ever Glorious Memory, and the Happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his Son</hi> KING GEORGE <hi>the</hi> II, <hi>our preſent rightful Sovereign, to his Fathers Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT you are doubtleſs very ſenſible, that I have in a great Meaſure prevented my ſelf from inlarging much on this paralell and illuſtrious Argument. And ſurely you could not but think, that I have been all this while treating in a figurative ſort of manner; not of DAVID and SOLOMON alone, but of <hi>Theſe Two Great Britiſh Kings,</hi> who fill our Hearts with the mingling Paſſions of Grief &amp; Joy, this Day.</p>
            <p>AND I muſt confeſs my ſelf both uncapable, and unprovided of Materials alſo, to pretend to draw with
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002949_0020_0FE6A0FD43C6A4F0"/>any Accuracy their tranſcendant Characters. Since I had the Happineſs to ſee them, which was about 10 Years agoe, I have not been able to procure any other than broken and interrupted hints of their Royal Hiſtory. I muſt therefore wholly rely on theſe, with what I have learnt concerning them before my returning Hither, together with that happy Influence of theirs which has reached theſe far diſtant Shoars ſince my Arrival. And tis but a very ſmall part of theſe, that I have either Time to recollect or lay before you. Something in Gratitude and Honour to them, we may briefly touch, under thoſe <hi>Three</hi> conſentaneous Heads we have been Diſcourſing on.</p>

               <item>2. HIS Deceaſe, and the Circumſtances of it.</item>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Character and Reign of our late Bleſſed Sovereign</hi> KING GEORGE <hi>the</hi> I.</p>
            <p>WE all doubtleſs know, that he was the Son of Nobles. He by Both his Parents deſcended of a Race of Ancient Princes, both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi> His immediate Father was one of the moſt Powerful Princes of the Empire: And his immediate Mother, was in the latter part of her Life, the neareſt of any Proteſtant Royal Blood, to the Crown of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE was of a comely, florid Countenance, like DAVID. Of great Wiſdom, Courage, Reſolution, Steadineſs, Integrity and Clemency. Well vers'd in the Art of War; but naturally of Peaceful inclinations: which mixture of Qualities, is agreed, as one obſerves, by the Experience of all Ages, to make the beſt and moſt glorious Princes. So remarkable for a ſtrict Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Juſtice; that agreable to his own Judgment
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002949_0021_0FE6A12EC3B93B58"/>and Diſpoſition, his MOTTO was — That <hi>The Glory of a Prince conſiſts in doing Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Perſon that appeared always to have a mighty Senſe of the <hi>Publick Intereſt;</hi> and of the great Duty incumbent on him, in his High Station, to promote the Welfare of the World. His Eyes were always fix'd on the Affairs of his own Dominions, and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about him. — Cloſe and Indefatigable in his Application to Publick Buſineſs — Steady to his Friends and Allies — Reſolute to maintain the Faith of Treaties — Frugal of the Publick Monies — Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate and Sober — and in all his Oeconomy exactly Regular.</p>
            <p>FOR <hi>Religion</hi> — a thorow Proteſtant — Full of Chriſtian Charity &amp; Genoroſity — An utter Enemy Chriſtian Charity &amp; Genoroſity — An utter Enemy to Slavery and Perſecution — Zealous for the true Religion, and the Cauſe of Civil &amp; Religious Liberty. In this Noble Cauſe he oft expos'd his Perſon, at the Head of Armies, and in his Earlier Days, in diverſe Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE he ruled in his own <hi>Electorate;</hi> He ſhow'd the Excellence of his Political Spirit, Principles and Conduct; in the Shining Prudence, Equity &amp; Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Adminiſtration: That he was tho't to be the moſt beloved by his Subjects, of any Prince in the whole World. He looked on their Wealth &amp; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as the Source and Baſis of his own. There were no Diviſions or Factions among them, by reaſon of his Impartial Deſtinction of Merit: And inſtead of Murmuring againſt him, they would be always telling Inſtances of his exemplary Juſtice and Moderation.</p>
            <p>HE was even then accounted without a Rival, the Wiſeſt Prince of <hi>Germany.</hi> And ſeemed to be the Perſon ordain'd &amp; prepar'd by Heaven, for the raiſing <hi>Great Britain</hi> to that high Rank &amp; Dignity, which it ſhou'd always have in the World: Which is to be the Tutelar Head of the Reformed Intereſt every where, and to hold the Ballance of Power in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002949_0022_0FE6A102B2009538"/>
IN Short, HE was every way accompliſhed for the Government of this Great &amp; Mighty Kingdom. And both before, and after the Deceaſe eſpecially, of his moſt Excellent MOTHER; To HIM were the Eyes of the better part of the Nation turned, for the Security of their Precious Liberties &amp; pure Religion; And in theſe of all that is dear to them both as Men &amp; Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>THRO' a great variety of Revolutions, the Crown came to be, in a moſt Firm and Solemn manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on him, and on his Proteſtant Poſterity for ever. And thro' many Violent and Mighty Oppoſitions, He came at laſt, by a Surprizing Turn of Providence, to take the Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>IN that <hi>Gloomy part of the preceeding Reign;</hi> when the Foundations of the Earth ſeemed to be out of Courſe, and the Enemies of his Succeſſion to prevail &amp; triumph over all Oppoſition: We were ready then to ſay with the <hi>Mournful Prophet</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Lam. Ill. &amp; IV.</note> 
               <q>The LORD has led and bro't us into Darkneſs, and not into Light. He hath builded againſt us, and compaſſed us with Gall and Travel. He hath ſet us in dark places as they that are Dead of old. He hath hedged us about, that we cannot get out. He has made our chain heavy. He has incloſed our ways with hewen Stone: He hath made our Paths crooked. He has filled us with Bitterneſs: And we ſaid, our Strength and our Hope is periſhed from the LORD. Thou haſt made us the Off-ſcouring and Refuſe in the midſt of the People. All our Enemies have opened their Mouths againſt us. Fear and a Snare is come upon us; Deſolation and Deſtruction. The Light of our Eyes, the Breath of our Noſtrils, the anointed of the LORD is taken in their Pits; of whom we ſaid, under his Shadow we ſhall live among the Heathen!</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEN the LORD turned again the Captivity of <hi>Zion;</hi> and we were like them that dreamed. Our Mouth was filled with Laughter, and our Tongue with Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002949_0023_0FE6A12EE3B05E28"/>Then ſaid they among the Heathen, <hi>The Lord has done great things for them.</hi> — The LORD has done Great things for us, whereof we are Glad. <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. XXVI. 1.-3</note>.</p>
            <p>AND for my Part — I ſhall never forget the Joy that ſwell'd my Heart; when in the Splendid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at his <hi>Coronation,</hi> preceeded by all the Nobles of the Kingdom, and then his Son &amp; Heir apparent, our other Hope, with their Ermine Robes &amp; Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets — That <hi>Royal Face</hi> at length appear'd, which Heaven had in that Moment ſent to Save theſe Great Nations from the Brink of Ruin. Nor do I ſpeak it as my caſe alone, but as what appear'd to be the equal Tranſport of the Multitudes round about me. The Tears of Joy ſeem'd to riſe and ſwim in every' Eye: And we were hardly able to give a Shout, thro' the labouring Paſſions that were ſwelling in us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND how did he Begin and carry on his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Reign?</hi> — With the ſame ſteady, wiſe &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Tenour, as he us'd to Rule in his other Empire.</p>
            <p>HE began with an open <hi>Declaration</hi> of his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to maintain our Religion, Properties, Laws and Liberties: And as He was never known to deceive; He has all along made Good his Royal Word.</p>
            <p>BY induſtrious Applications and wiſe Treaties, He ſoon retrieved the Nation's <hi>Commerce,</hi> which is it's very Strength and Soul; and that had been miſerably given away by Articles, at the Cloſe of the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reign. He brake the Chains of his diſtreſſed loyal Subjects. He appeared conſtantly to be their affectionate &amp; common Father. He ever choſe the wiſeſt &amp; moſt approv'd <hi>Counſellors:</hi> ſuch as He knew had ſhown themſelves the Nation's ſteady Friends in the darkeſt &amp; moſt trying Times: And He ever carefully improved their Advices for the Publick Welfare. He never acted againſt the known Laws or Cuſtoms, but ever ſtrictly made them the Rule of Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002949_0024_0FE6A102D8D58370"/>
FIRM and reſolute to aſſert the Rights &amp; Honours of the Kingdom; He was neither ambitious of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Empire Abroad, nor of greater Power at Home. He ask'd no more of his People's Treaſures, than what they themſelves ſhou'd think were needful for their own Advantage &amp; Preſervation. And what is one of the diſtinguiſhing Glories of his Reign; He never dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from or diſpleaſed his <hi>Parliament.</hi> He accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them his greateſt Council: And it was wonderful to ſee the conſtant mutual Affection and Harmony between them. I don't remember that He ever made any Propoſal to them which they did not chearfully comply with, excepting one, which was to leſſen his own Prerogative. And yet never had a <hi>Britiſh King</hi> a greater Power among his Subjects. As an Argument of their higheſt Value for Him, and their moſt perfect Confidence in his Equity &amp; Goodneſs; they deſired and enacted that, for a certain Time, when the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety requir'd it, He ſhou'd have a greater Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over them than any of the <hi>Kings</hi> before him. His Reign is an illuſtrious Inſtance; That the moſt Indulgent Princes are the moſt Powerful; while the Ambitious raiſe their People's Jealouſies, deſtroy their Confidence, and grow weak &amp; impotent.</p>
            <p>HE moſt wiſely improv'd the <hi>Naval Power</hi> of the Kingdom: and has carried it to an higher Pitch of Glory than the Seas have ever ſeen. By this has He ſpread a Terror thro' the World: with a ſingle Blow prevented bloody &amp; expenſive Wars, and put a Period to them in the very Moment, and by the very Action that began them. Hereby has He encouraged, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and ſtrengthned his Allies; diſappointed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of invading Enemies; broken pernicious Leagues; held the Ballance among the Nations; and preſerved them in Order &amp; Tranquillity.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, HE was in ſome reſpects a Father to the Kings of the Earth; or at leaſt a powerful &amp; deciſive Moderator and Umpire among them. The Eyes of the greateſt Princes were turned to Him: To Him
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002949_0025_0FE6A13679F96E40"/>they gave Ear, and waited: they kept ſilence at his Councils: And their publick Reſolutions were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon his Determinations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND as for us in theſe far diſtant Ends of his Dominions</hi>—We have in a great meaſure felt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his happy Reign.</p>
            <p>THRO' his ſafe Protection we ſtill enjoy thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Charter-Privileges,</hi> which our Fore-Fathers left their Native pleaſant Land, and came over hither into a miſerable Thicket to procure; which were So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly confirmed to us by the Glorious KING WILLIAM and QUEEN MARY of Eternal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. CXII. 6.</note>; and are comprehenſive of every thing on Earth that is Dear and Valuable to us.</p>
            <p>WHEN we contended in the dark, even about what was tho't his own Prerogative — while he knew we did it out of no Diſaffection to Him, but from a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Judgment only; He like a Tender Father gently overlooked our Infirmities: He confirm'd our Liberties, and diſappointed the earneſt Expectations of our envious Enemies. And tho' they daily miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Actions, and exaggerate every petty Fault among us; they could never make any Impreſſions on Him to our Diſadvantage. He had been well inform'd that there is not a ſingle Perſon of our Denomination Here, who did not earneſtly deſire His Acceſſion to the Throne and the Continuance of it in his Serene Houſe for ever.</p>
            <p>THUS Liv'd &amp; Reign'd this Greateſt &amp; moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired of Princes in his Day: The Darling &amp; Protection of his People: The great Support of the Reformed Intereſt: And the Arbiter of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus does it become a grateful People, at the Sorrowful Concluſion of the Reign of ſo Great and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002949_0026_0FE6A1074E737A68"/>Good a KING, to reflect upon the ſignal Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Happy Influence of his Royal Care and Government: That they may mention. Him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Honour and preſerve a dear &amp; precious Memory of his Happy Reign. But in all theſe Great Vircues and Actions, we muſt behold that SUPERIOUR BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, by whom Kings Reign &amp; Princes decree Juſtice; and aſcribe to HIM the Praiſe &amp; Honour of all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence that appeared in our late incomparable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and of all the Great and Happy things that were performed by him for his People.</p>
            <p>AND we muſt now come to conſider</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>HIS Deceaſe, and the Circumſtances of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THO' Kings are as <hi>Gods</hi> on Earth; yet even the Greateſt &amp; Beſt muſt Die like <hi>Men,</hi> and fall to the Duſt as Humane Princes. And how hath the LORD covered the Daughter of our <hi>Zion</hi> with a Cloud in his Anger! How has he caſt down from Heaven to the Earth the Beauty of <hi>Iſrael!</hi> He has made our Strength to f! In the midſt of all his proſperous Deſigns and Labours for the Publick Peace &amp; Wellfare; His Breath goes forth at once: He returneth to his Earth: In that very Day his Tho'ts periſh.</p>
            <p>AND yet he Died, like <hi>King</hi> DAVID, <hi>In a Good old Age,</hi> but <hi>Two</hi> Years ſhort of His; and both <hi>full of Days, Riches and Honour.</hi> He died in the Hight of Wiſdom, Strength and Uſefulneſs. What a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Flouriſhing &amp; Wealthy Kingdom has he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him? And their unmeaſurable Riches were as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to him as if they were all his own. In fine, How full of Honour? — How freſh was his Glory in him? In the Perfection of his Reign, and in the full Reſpect and Honours of his People, and of all the Nations round about; He goes off the Stage of Life before he fades, and leaves them to bewail his Loſs with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Fullneſs of Regret &amp; Sorrow.</p>
