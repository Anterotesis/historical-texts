         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Publiſher makes no apology for the delay of the account of this trial. His object was not to gratify the tranſient curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the preſent day, but to preſent to his countrymen the faithful record of a tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which implicates ſome of their moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial intereſts. Truth and accuracy were what he chiefly ſtudied. He wiſhes that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his cotemporaries, who have likewiſe exhibited an account of this trial, had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the ſame principles.</p>
            <p>He is greatly indebted to ſeveral gentlemen, who liberally furniſhed him with notes of the evidence. In particular, he begs leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027633_0004_0FD556251F152B28"/>
his warmeſt acknowledgements to Mr. Moffat, the friend of Mr. Muir, who attended him in the court. From the peculiar ſituation of the Publiſher, it would be improper in him to ſpeak of Mr. Muir himſelf. It is ſufficient to ſay, that at his requeſt he took the trouble to look over the notes which were taken of the ſpeech delivered to the Jury, and he has the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that gentleman, for declaring, that he believes that the account given of that ſpeech, is as accurate as could poſſibly be preſented, of what was, to all, evidently delivered without previous preparation, and entirely regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the circumſtances which occurred in the courſe of the trial, and which came out in the evidence.</p>

An heritable crown, or an heritable throne or by whatever fanciful name ſuch things may be called, have no other ſignificant explanation, than that mankind are heritable property.

                              <hi>P.</hi> 1. We take the liberty of addreſſing you in the ſpirit of civic-union, in the fellowſhip of a juſt and common cauſe. We greatly rejoice that the ſpirit of freedom moves over the ſurface of Scotland, that light ſeems to break from the chaos of her internal government, and that a country ſo reſpectable for her attainments in ſcience, in arts, and in arms, for men of literary eminence, for the intelligence and morality of her people, now acts from a conviction of the union between virtue, letters, and liberty; and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027633_0015_0FD618D91D98C070"/>
now riſes to diſtinction, not by a <hi>calm, contented, ſecret</hi> wiſh for a reform in Parliament, but by openly, actively, and urgently <hi>willing</hi> it, with the unity and energy of an embodied nation. We rejoice that you do not conſider yourſelves as merged and melted down into another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but that in this great national queſtion you are ſtill Scotland.—Alſo,</p>
                           <p>We will lay open to you our hearts: Our cauſe is your cauſe. If there is to be a ſtruggle between us, let it be, which nation ſhall be foremoſt in the race of mind. Let this be the noble animoſity kindled between us, who ſhall firſt attain that free conſtitution from which both are equi-diſtant, Who ſhall firſt be the ſaviour of the empire. The ſenſe of both countries, with reſpect to the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable abuſes of the conſtitution, has been clearly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proves that our political ſituations are not diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar, that our rights and wrongs are the ſame.—Alſo,</p>
                           <p>We will not be the dupes of ſuch ignoble artifices. We ſee this ſcheme, of ſtrengthening political perſecution and ſtate inquiſition, by a freſh infuſion of religious fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm. But we will unite, and we will be free. Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal emancipation, with repreſentative legiſlature, is the polar principle which guides our Society, and ſhall guide it, through all the tumult of factions, and fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of parties. It is not upon a coalition of Oppoſition with Miniſtry that we depend, but upon a coalition of Iriſhmen with Iriſhmen; and in that coalition alone we find an object worthy of reform, and, at the ſame time, the ſtrength and ſinew both to attain and ſecure it. It is not upon external circumſtances, upon the pledge of man or miniſter, we depend, but upon the internal energy of the Iriſh nation.—We will not buy or borrow liberty from America or from France, but manufacture it for ourſelves, and work it up with thoſe materials which the hearts of Iriſhmen furniſh them with at home.—We do not worſhip the Britiſh, far leſs the Iriſh conſtitution, as ſent down from heaven; but we conſider it as human workmanſhip, which man has made, and man can mend. An unalterable conſtitution, whatever be its nature, muſt be deſpotiſm. It is not the conſtitution, but the people,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027633_0016_0FD556381B117568"/>
which ought to be inviolable; and it is time to recogniſe and renovate the rights of the Engliſh, the Scotch, and the Iriſh nations.—Alſo,</p>

Let this check the raſhneſs that ruſhes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly into the Committee, of national character; or, if <hi>that be already made,</hi> let the ſame conſideration impel us with active, not paſſive perſeverance, with manly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and calm determination, ſmiling with equal ſcorn at the bluſter of official arrogance, and the whiſpers of private malevolence, until we have planted the flag of freedom on the ſummit, and are at once victorious and ſecure.</p>

               <p>To this indictment, Mr. Muir pleaded, Not Guilty. He was then aſked by the Lord Juſtice Clerk, if he had any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the relevancy of the charges which it contained. Mr. Muir replied that he had uniformly conſidered the Jury
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027633_0022_0FD618E39414FDC0"/>
as the only judges of the law and of the fact; and that, in this stage of the trial, he would plead upon no point, which might preclude the determination of the Jury, by a previous deciſion of the Court.</p>
               <p>IN point of form, it is required in Scotland, that the perſon accuſed ſhould communicate upon the evening pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the trial, in writing the ſubſtance of his defence with a liſt of the witneſſes intended to be adduced in excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. Mr. Muir had complied with this rule, and the Clerk of Court read the following defences:</p>

                  <head>DEFENCES.</head>
                  <p>THE Criminal Libel is falſe and injurious; ſo far from exciting the people to riot and inſurrection, it can eaſily be proved, by a numerous liſt of witneſſes, that, upon every occaſion, the pannel exhorted them to purſue meaſures mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, legal, peaceable, and conſtitutional. The charge of diſtributing ſeditious publications, and of adviſing the people to read them, is equally falſe and calumnious. The pannel admits, that on the great national queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an equal repreſentation of the People in the Houſe of commons, he exerted every effort to procure in that Houſe, a full, fair, and equal repreſentation of the people, as he conſidered it to be a meaſure, (and ſtill does,) the moſt ſalutary for the intereſt of his Country. But the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel offers to prove, that as he conſidered the information of the People to be the chief thing requiſite to accompliſh this great object, he uniformly adviſed them to read every pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, upon either ſide, which the important queſtion of Parliamentary Reform had occaſioned.</p>

               <p>Immediately afterwards the Lord Juſtice Clerk, aſked Mr. Muir, if he had any thing further to ſtate, in ſupport of theſe defences, as in the further courſe of the trial, he would be precluded from adducing any thing extraneous.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir then roſe up and ſaid, according to the rule of court, I have the evening before this day, communicated to the public proſecutor the ſubſtance of my defence in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The truth of every word in that defence, I ſhall ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove before I leave this bar. I admit that I exerted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very effort, to procure a more equal repreſentation of the People in the Houſe of Commons. If that be a crime, I plead guilty to the charge. I acknowledge that I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of Parliamentary Reform to be eſſential to the ſalvation of my Country: But I deny that I ever adviſed the People to attempt to accompliſh that great object, by any means which the conſtitution did not ſanction. I grant that I adviſed the people, to read different publications upon both ſides, which this great national queſtion had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and I am not aſhamed to aſſign my motives. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ignorance of the people, on the one hand, to be the ſource from which deſpotiſm flows. I conſider, upon the other hand, an ignorant people, impreſſed with a ſenſe of grievances, and wiſhing to have theſe grievances redreſſed, to be expoſed to certain miſery and to complete ruin.

muſt always precede REFORMATION, and who ſhall DARE to ſay that the PEOPLE ſhould be debarred from INFORMATION, where it concerns them ſo materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally? I am accuſed of ſedition; and yet, I can prove by thouſands of witneſſes, that I warned the people of the <hi>danger</hi> of that crime, exhorted them to adopt none but mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which were conſtitutional, and intreated them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect <hi>liberty</hi> with knowledge, and both with morality. This is what I can prove. If theſe are crimes, I am guilty.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN INGLIS, before being ſworn, mentioned that he was a ſervant of Government; that he underſtood Mr. Muir was accuſed of a crime againſt Government; and that he did not conſider it as proper, that Mr. Muir ſhould be tried by a Jury compoſed of ſervants of Government; that his mind felt ſcrupulous, laboured under much anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he begged leave to decline being a Juryman. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Inglis was informed by the Court, that there was no impropriety in his being a Juryman, although belonging to the ſervice of Government.</p>
               <p>The Lord Juſtice Clerk, in the uſual form, aſked Mr. Muir, if he had any objections to ſtate to the firſt five gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whoſe names he had ſelected from the liſt of aſſize.</p>
               <p>Mr. MUIR ſaid: Of theſe gentlemen I have no perſonal knowledge. Their ſituations in life are reſpectable, and I believe them to be men of truth, and of honour; yet my ſituation and theirs is ſo peculiar, that I am obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them being upon this Jury. The queſtion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Reform has agitated deeply, in proportion to its magnitude, the minds of men in this country; different opinions have been adopted, and different parties have been formed. Theſe gentlemen belong to an aſſociation which aſſembled in Goldſmith's Hall, calling themſelves the Friends of the Conſtitution, united to ſupport it againſt Republicans and Levellers, and expreſſing their zeal to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs tumult and ſedition. I belong to the aſſociation of the Friends of the People. Viewing a reform in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the people as a meaſure the moſt conducive to the ſtability of the conſtitution, and to the felicity of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027633_0027_0FD5564DDC0D5DB0"/>
people we united our common exertions, by legal meaſures, to accompliſh that object.</p>
               <p>To the conſtitution, in its genuine principles, we have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly pledged ourſelves—Never have we profeſſed to be its enemies, yet the aſſociation in Goldſmith's Hall, by a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and public act of their's, have declared, that we were the enemies of the conſtitution. Equally zealous in our declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the world—in our reprobating riot and ſedition; and ſincere in our hearts, that aſſociation has denounced us to this country, as attempting to kindle the torch of civil war, and to lay it in blood and in deſtruction. The fact upon which I found this charge is notorious, and cannot be denied. A Convention of Delegates, from all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of the Friends of the People in Scotland, aſſembled in this city, upon the 11th day of December laſt. Of this Convention I had the honour of being a member. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention accorded with the aſſociation in Goldſmith's Hall, in their zeal to ſupport the conſtitution, in their abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſedition, and in their determination to concur with good citizens in their ſuppreſſion of riot and of tumult. To teſtify then to this aſſociation, their principles and their object, the Convention ordered a number of its members to repair to their Hall, and to ſubſcribe the book which they had opened, of adherence to the conſtitution. In this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I was included. We did ſo. And, What were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences? The aſſociation erazed our names, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the papers of the day their proceeding. Was not this an act of public proſcription againſt us all? Accuſed this day of ſedition, of an attempt to overthrow the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall thoſe men be my Jurymen? who have not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed me, but likewiſe judged and condemned me without knowing me, without leaving me the poſſibility of the power of vindication. This trial is no trivial matter. It affects me, but it affects the country more. The noiſe of it will pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A reſpectable gentleman of the five to whom I now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, has felt the delicacy of his ſituation, and has honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably avowed his ſcruples. Such ſentiments, ſo reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in themſelves, I truſt are common to all his colleagues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:027633_0028_0FD618E8EAE46090"/>This is not the only objection I ſtate to the Gentlemen of Goldſmith's Hall being of my Jury. I am accuſed of circulating the works of Mr. Paine. That aſſociation has publicly advertiſed their horrors at the doctrines contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe books. Nay, more, they have offered a reward of five guineas, to any who will diſcover a perſon who may have circulated them! If this is not prejudicating my cauſe, I demand to know what prejudication is?</p>
               <p>Upon theſe two objections, I ſhall make no further obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. To ſuppoſe them not well founded, would be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the common ſenſe and the common feelings of mankind.</p>
               <p>I demand juſtice. Let me be tried fairly, not by a Jury of the aſſociation of Goldſmith's Hall, not by a Jury of the Aſſociation of the Friends of the People, but by men uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with either, whoſe minds cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed warped with prejudices. I THEREFORE SOLEMNLY PROTEST, that no perſon who is a member of the Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Goldſmith's Hall, ſhould, or can, be of the Jury in my trial.</p>
               <p>Solicitor-General BLAIR replied, That he conſidered this objection to be of the moſt extraordinary nature. The pannel is accuſed of forming aſſociations, contrary to the Conſtitution, and he preſumes to object to thoſe Gentlemen, who formed aſſociations in its defence. With equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety might the pannel object to their Lordſhips on the Bench, to be his judges in this trial: their Lordſhips had ſworn to defend their Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Mr. MUIR. This day, I will not deſcend into the quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of a Lawyer. I object to theſe gentlemen, not becauſe they aſſociated in defence of the conſtitution. I too, as well as they, have aſſociated in defence of the conſtitution. But my objection is, that they, by an act of theirs, have publicly accuſed me of being an enemy to the conſtitution, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pronounced the ſentence of condemnation, and have impoſed upon my name the ſeal of proſcription.</p>
               <p>LORD JUSTICE CLERK.—If the objections of the pannel were relevant, it would extend far indeed; it would go to every perſon who had taken the oaths to government. I can ſee nothing in the objection, and I am clear for repelling it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:027633_0029_0FD55651A4485480"/>LORD HENDERLAND.—I can ſee nothing in the objection; theſe gentlemen entered into a ſociety for a particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and had the right of judging of the qualification of their members; they did not think Mr. Muir or his friends proper members. In no trial whatever could this be a good objection.</p>
               <p>The objection was repelled. Mr. Muir, however, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to repeat it, as every five were ſworn.</p>
               <p>When the liſt of the five laſt was preſented, he ſaid it was not ſufficient to ſay that theſe gentlemen were free to form a ſociety, this is a fact which no man in his ſound ſenſes will diſpute. But, this ſociety when formed, had opened, in a public place, a book for public ſubſcription. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated advertiſements they had called upon every friend to the conſtitution, every enemy to ſedition and tumult, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon inimical to a public diviſion of property by a levelling ſyſtem, to come and ſubſcribe their names in that book, as expreſſive of their attachment to the conſtitution, to property, and to peace. Every porter, every chairman from the ſtreets, was allowed to inſert his ſubſcription. Why were the names of the pannel and his friends expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? Was it not a public denunciation of their being the ſupporters of that ſyſtem of plunder and of diſorder, which that aſſociation was to oppoſe?</p>
               <p>When the Jury were ſworn in, Mr. Muir again ſtated, that he believed them to be men of truth and integrity, but never would ceaſe recalling to their attention the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of their ſituation. They had already determined his fate. They had already judged his cauſe; and, as they valued their reputation, their own internal peace, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated—Here Mr. Muir was interrupted by the Court, who concurred in opinion, that his conduct was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly improper, in taking up their time, as the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been repelled!</p>

               <p>Mr. MUIR objected to this witneſs. He ſaid he did not

know him. He did not remember if ever he had ſeen him, but he could clearly prove, by reſpectable witneſſes, that this perſon had ſaid, upon hearing of his arrival in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he would do every thing in his power to have him hanged.</p>
               <p>Mr. MUIR was aſked if he could condeſcend upon any particular circumſtances of malice, which this witneſs entertained againſt him. He replied that he did not know him, therefore could ſpecify no circumſtances from which the propoſed witneſs might have entertained malice againſt him; but the fact that he had ſo expreſſed himſelf was certain and true, and if permitted, he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſubſtantiate what he had aſſerted, by the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof.</p>
               <p>The objection was repelled. The Court obſerved, that witneſſes might be averſe to bear teſtimony.

               <p>Depones, That he was preſent at a meeting in Kirkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilloch, ſometime in the month of November laſt, but does not remember the day. That the meeting had then no name, but has been ſince known by the name of a Reform Meeting. Mr. Muir was preſent who harangued the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As far as he recollect, Mr. Muir addreſſed the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident; ſtated the diſadvantages in the Repreſentation, ſome Boroughs being rotten, others having no vote. He ſtated the population of England, and Scotland, and mentioned, that from the ſmallneſs of the number who voted, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not fully repreſented. Mr. Muir ſaid, that if a man paid £. 20,000 for a ſeat in Parliament, he behoved to derive ſome intereſt from his ſeat, and he referred to the people, whether it was reaſonable that a man ſhould pay ſo much for a ſeat in Parliament, without deriving ſome emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument

in return. That the Duke of Richmond, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of this, and had £. 30,000.—He was ſilent.—That Mr. Muir compared our Conſtitution with the French, and ſaid, that beyond a doubt they would be ſucceſsful. That they were more equally repreſented, and their taxes much leſs. That two thirds of the French national debt was already paid. That a manufacturer in this country could not bring his goods to market with the ſame advantage as the French Manufacturers; of courſe, we ſhould loſe our trade. Mr. Muir ſaid, the Society ought to be acquainted with the principles of thoſe members they admitted. That the ſole intention of theſe Societies, was to procure a more equal and a ſhorter duration of Parliament. That the means theſe Societies were to uſe, for theſe ends, was to petition Parliament, and to communicate their reſolutions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their knowledge, by publiſhing and circulating uſeful publications. That in order to obtain that knowledge, they ought to get <hi>all</hi> political pamphlets from a neighbouring Bookſeller? but he did not mention any pamphlet in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Upon the interrogatory of the Solicitor-General. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, That nothing was ſaid about a King, but that the Conſtitution ought to conſiſt of King, Lords, and Commons. There was mention made of Paine's Rights of Man, but not by Mr. Muir. One man in the Society, not in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic manner, but to his neighbour privately, ſaid, he had read that work. The moſt of the members were young wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, from eighteen to twenty years of age. He knew of no previous meeting at Kirkintilloch, this one being the conſtituting one. Mr. Muir did not come into the meeting till after it was conſtituted, but had promiſed in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be there. He ſeemed to be the principal man in that Society, and ſaid, he belonged to other Societies, of the ſame ſort: He recommended a timeous accompliſhment of the buſineſs, in order, that when the different meetings had communicated with each other, they might lay it before Parliament. At the time he recommended the above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſome of the members wiſhed to form meetings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrogated by Mr. Muir, he deponed, That Mr. Muir did recommend peace and regularity to the meeting, and

obſerved that any tumult or diſorder would ruin their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe. He told the meeting, that there was no other mode of procuring redreſs, but by applying to Parliament, and he recommended to the meeting to be ware of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting immoral characters as members.</p>

That Mr. Muir was at this meeting, which was the conſtituting meeting—came in after the meeting began, and made a ſpeech in which he adviſed regularity in their proceedings; and mentioned that they ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in a conſtitutional manner, as the law now is, by King, Lords, and Commons. He ſaid nothing about the expence of a King, nor the burden of taxes, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative expence of the French Government, nor did he mention the ſucceſs of their arms. He ſpoke about ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. After the meeting broke up, the witneſs met Mr. Muir with ſome others, in Mr. Wallace's, Baker in Kirkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilloch, where the converſation was about the politics of the country—there were about eight preſent in Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace's, or one fourth of the number that was at the meeting. The witneſs was Vice-Preſident of the meeting, Mr. Freeland was Preſident, and James Baird was Secretary, there were no other officers, and all theſe were with Mr. Muir in Wallace's. He does not remember the particulars of the converſation, but Flower on the French Conſtitution was mentioned, which he never before had heard of. He thinks it was Mr. Muir that mentioned this book, in ſpeaking of new publications, and he remembers books being ſpoken of. Depones, That at the meeting, one Boyd aſked Mr. Muir's opinion about Paine's Works, when Mr. Muir ſaid, that it was foreign to their purpoſe.

I plead upon a great principle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural juſtice: I look forward to other times, and I tremble for the precedent. If this were nor the caſe. I would not ſay that I merely approved of that book of Mr. Flower's, but, in this great audience, I would recommend its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in general, to every man who valued the intereſts of his country, and whoſe feelings intereſt him in the happineſs of human kind.</p>
               <p>LORD ADVOCATE.—The charge againſt the Pannel is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and it is branched out under various heads. One of theſe was, adviſing people to purchaſe ſeditious books; and he was entitled to examine as to ſuch facts, though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular book or fact was not condeſcended on in the libel.</p>
               <p>Mr. MUIR.—Neither in juſtice not in law has the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Proſecutor a right to bring againſt me a general charge. Every criminal charge, upon the facts, muſt be ſpecial, in order that the pannel may know the crime that is alledged againſt him, and accordingly prepare the ſpecial matter of his defence.</p>
               <p>LORD JUSTICE CLERK.—By the Statute of James VI. wherever art and part is libelled, there can be no objection to the generality. This is a proper queſtion; and it has a tendency to eſtabliſh the major propoſition, and it ought to be ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>The Lord Advocate gave up the queſtion.</p>
               <p>The witneſs was again calledin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deponeed, That he knows of no books having been recommended to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed in conſequence of this meeting, except Henry's Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of England. The books purchaſed by the witneſs for the Society or others, were three or four copies of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical progreſs,—three or four copies of the Paiſley Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, one copy for his own uſe and one for the Society: That he was not ordered by the meeting to buy them, but bought them for his own uſe, and to ſhow his neighbours.

He never purchaſed any of Paine's Pamphlets, but he got a copy of that pamphlet, he does not know from whom, and which happened ſometime before the meeting.

Upon Mr. Muir's interrogatory, depones, that Mr. Muir recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid riot, and ſaid, that tumult would ruin the cauſe; he alſo adviſed them to take care of the moral character of the members whom they admitted.

Gentlemen has to act as an agent for the Crown; but this I offer to prove, that he aſſiſted the Meſſengers of the Law, in exploring and citing witneſſes againſt me; that he attended the ſheriffs in their different viſits to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes of Campſie and Kirkintilloch, that previouſly to the precognition, he converted with the witneſſes of the Crown, that he attended their precognition, put queſtions to them and took down notes; nay, more, that, without being cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Proſecutor, he offered himſelf ultroneouſly againſt me, and inſiſted that his declaration ſhould be taken in the unuſual form, with his oath attending it, to atteſt its truth. Upon other matters I ſhall not dwell; it is ſufficient for me ſay, that this witneſs attended the precognition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witneſſes.

               <p>The LORD ADVOCATE ſaid, that he knew the Court had ſuſtained the objection in many late caſes.

That when Mr. Honeyman examined him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout how often Mr. Muir had been at Kirkintilloch meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Mr. Lapſlie alſo aſked him if Mr. Muir had been

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027633_0037_0FD5565E59ED8AF0"/>
The general purport of the ſpeech was about ſhortening the duration of Parliament, and a more equal repreſentation. He thought the taxes might be leſſened by theſe means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Reform was not to take effect as to the King and Houſe of Lords, but only of the Commons. He mentioned the ſucceſs of the French arms, and that liberty would be eſtabliſhed in France.

The books this witneſs remembers to have ſeen, are the Proceedings of the Weſtminſter Aſſociation, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, and Paiſley Declaration. It had been ſuggeſted by one Boyd to purchaſe Paine, but Mr. Muir ſhook his head, and ſaid it was foreign to the purpoſe: That the witneſs ſome time before this ſpoke to Mr. Muir about Paine's book, and aſked it as a favour to get the loan of it, and Mr. Muir bid him ſearch his great coat pocket, and he would get it, and that he got it accordingly: That this was on the Tueſday; eight days before the meeting, at which time Mr. Muir had ſent for him to Mr. Wallace's, and told him that he had heard of the intended ſociety, and that the witneſs was to be a member; and that Mr. Muir and the witneſs afterwards talked of ſocieties in general: That the witneſs took Paine home with him, and read it, and gave it to his ſiſter: That he gave it to one Scott, and alſo to one Stewart, who had ſought it ſeveral times, and was angry he had not got it ſooner: That Mr. Muir ſaid, when the witneſs firſt aſked the book from him, that he thought it had a tendency to miſlead the people, and that nothing further paſſed in reſpect to it; and that he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed nothing: That he was ſurpriſed Mr. Muir did not recommend it, becauſe every body elſe ſpoke well of it, and was ſurpriſed that Mr. Muir ſaid it had a bad tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: That Mr. Muir did not approve of the book, but on the contrary, ſaid it had a bad tendency: That he knows no particular reaſon for his being ſent for: That he knows books were bought for the ſociety; and that he wrote to Mr. Muir, ſaying that the books then in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave ſatisfaction: That he received a letter from Mr. Muir, telling that Mr. Provan's cauſe had been

               <p>When the oath was propoſed to be adminiſtered to this witneſs, he refuſed to ſwear, as being contrary to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles.

               <p>The Court obſerved to him, that if he would not ſwear, no other alternative remained to them, but to commit him to priſon; that there was no way by which he could ever obtain his liberation, and that his impriſonment would be

               <p>The Judges aſked him, if he believed in the Bible; to which he anſwered, he did. He was then interrogated, if he could point out any particular paſſage which taught him the unlawfulneſs of taking an oath. In order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his ſcruples they quoted ſeveral paſſages from the Bible, but he ſtill adhered to his firſt declaration, ſaying, that he could not take the oath without deſerting his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which he was determined never to do.</p>

               <p>Mr. MUIR—I believe this perſon to be a good and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious man.

               <p>The Court obſerved, that neither they, nor the jury could liſten to any evidence but what was given upon oath. The law expreſsly required it, and it could not be diſpenſed with, and that the Proſecutor and public juſtice was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this matter alſo.</p>

The indictment charges nothing more, there is not a ſingle letter within its four corners which points out to me the charge of ſpeaking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectfully of Courts of Juſtice, tending, in any manner, to excite the people againſt the adminiſtration of the law. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a crime of this nature, the giving away to ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, ſingle copies of books and pamphlets, which may be eſteemed ſeditious, is a trifle, light as air. If the public Proſecutor had evidence that I was guilty of this crime, he was deficient in his duty to the public, in not making it an article of accuſation. He ſhould have manfully, in the light, brought it forward againſt me, joined a fair iſſue betwixt us, and then I would have defended myſelf the bed way I could. But to attempt to ſteal in as evidence in this way, to prove a crime which he durſt not openly libel, becauſe he knew it could not be ſupported, merits the ſevereſt repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. But what is the tendency of this little art? this domeſtic and well tutored ſpy, is brought to prove words which may irritate your minds againſt me,—Yes, this is the artifice, this is its object, but your juſtice will render it ineffectual. You will feel the ſame contempt which I do. Let us paſs from that—I contend upon the great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of natural juſtice, upon the conſtitutional law of this country, that no perſon can be tried for a crime of which he has not been previouſly accuſed. What is the purpoſe of an indictment, but to ſpecify the crimes which are to be proved, in order that the Pannel may have an opportunity to prepare his defence? Why is the indictment ſerved upon him fifteen days before the trial, but to enable him to accomplish this purpoſe? It is vain to ſay, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general charge of ſedition, every thing tending to prove it can be adduced, although not ſpecially mentioned.

What has been called the criminal law of this country, its forms, its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, and its principles, are for ever gone. It is vain to ſay that the ſtatute of James VI. allows this proceeding. That ſtatute is now obſolete. By the law of Scotland it has gone into diſuetude. It was enacted under a deſpotic reign, when the freedom of Scotland was trampled under the foot of power. It oppoſes every principle of juſtice; and will you, after the lapſe of ſo many years, deſcend into the grave, drag the peſtilential carcaſe, in order that it may poiſon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical atmoſphere?—One word more upon this ſubject: The charge againſt me is ſedition. That crime, from its very nature, ſuppoſes, and, in fact, it has often happened, that it may be attended by rapine, and by murder. If, therefore, under the generality, you allow a charge of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the Courts of Juſtice, which I never heard of before, you muſt, by the ſame parity of reaſoning, allow a charge of plunder, equally unheard of, to be adduced as an agrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the general crime of ſedition.</p>
               <p>This queſtion is of little importance to the individual, who is now ſtruggling for the liberties of his country. But the eyes of your children will be fixed upon this trial, and they will tremble and ſhudder at the precedent. I feel for the country,—I feel for poſterity,—I will not ſanction the procedure which is to produce to both, a ſyſtem of injuſtice, of ruin, and of murder.</p>

If it had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſpecify, in the indictment, all the facts againſt the Pannel, that indictment would have covered, by its magnitude, the walls of that Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. MUIR.—This is not the time to entertain your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips with frothy declamation, with ſounding, but unmeaning periods. I pleaded upon juſt principles; every perſon here muſt ſee their ſtrength, and muſt admit their truth.—If theſe are given up, if theſe are violated, PROPERTY, and LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, and LIFE are inſecure. Once more; can the Lord Advocate himſelf ſay, that if he was to bring the general charge of murder againſt me, and ſhould ſpecify that I had murdered James, would he be allowed to prove, under the generality, that I had murdered John? Can there be any thing more plain more juſt, and which requires leſs argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the ſimple propoſition which I ſupport? That if you accuſe a man of a crime, you muſt tell him what that crime is, in order that he may be able to defend himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the accuſation. Particular acts muſt be ſpecified, in order that the Pannel may be able to prove, that either theſe acts in themſelves were innocent, or that he was not acceſſary to them. If you deſtroy this propoſition, if you ſanction the reverſe, what remains to this country, but the melancholy proſpect of ruin and of deſpair?</p>
               <p>LORD SWINTON was of opinion, that reflecting on Courts of Juſtice was included under the general charge of ſedition, and that the objection was groundleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:027633_0045_0FD5566C9B93A588"/>LORD DUNSINNAN, concurred with Lord Swinton, and declared, that the various circumſtances which may come out in evidence need not be ſpecified.</p>
               <p>LORD ABERCROMBY could not entertain the ſmalleſt doubt of their being a neceſſity for ſpecifying in the libel, every ſeditious expreſſion that might have been uſed.</p>
               <p>LORD JUSTICE CLERK was clearly of opinion, that when one crime is charged, another, and a different one cannot be proved under that libel. This none could diſpute. But was that the caſe here? The Pannel is accuſed of ſedition; and will any perſon ſay, that it is not a circumſtance of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the Pannel to have inflamed the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt Courts of Juſtice, ſo important, and ſo material a branch of the Conſtitution. Under the Statute of King James wherever art and part is libelled, the Proſecutor can prove every fact and circumſtance, and no objection of generality is admitted.</p>
               <p>The objection was over-ruled. The witneſs was called back, who deponed: That ſhe had heard Mr. Muir ſay, that a monarchical government would be the beſt in this country, under proper reſtrictions; but that republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments were the beſt: That ſhe has been ſent by Mr. Muir to an organiſt in the ſtreets of Glaſgow, and deſired him to play <hi>ca ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Muir was aſked, if he had any queſtions to put to this witneſs. He replied; I diſdain to put a queſtion to a witneſs of this deſcription. The witneſs turned round to Mr. Muir, and ſaid ſhe wiſhed to aſk him one queſtion. This the Lord Juſtice Clerk would nor permit, as he would ſuffer no altercation of that kind. The Court expreſſed their ſtrongeſt diſapprobation of the terms which Mr. Muir had uſed; and Lord Henderland ſaid, that if Mr. Muir had been acting as a counſel at the bar, inſtead of being in that ſituation, he would immediately have ſent him to priſon for it! The conduct and the accuracy of this witneſs, was much applauded by the Court.</p>
               <p>As the witneſs was withdrawing, a Juryman called her back, and aſked her, if ſhe had had any quarrel in Mr. Muir's father's family, to which ſhe replied, that ſo far from that, her miſtreſs had given her 5<abbr>

               <p>Depones, That the witneſs was in uſe to dreſs Mr. Muir, and dreſſed him in Autumn laſt: That Mr. Muir having aſked the witneſs if he had bought Paine's Works; on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told that he had not, he adviſed him to get a copy, as a barber's ſhop was a good place to read, out he did not buy it. That he bought a copy of the Addreſs to the Addreſſors, and kept it a day or two, but this was not by Mr. Muir's advice. That he remembers an old man from the country coming to Mr. Muir, when he was dreſſing him, and Mr. Muir told the witneſs, that the old man was a great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Upon which the old man replied, that Mr. Muir was only taunting upon him.</p>
               <p>Upon being interrogated by Mr. Muir, depones, that he has heard Mr. Muir ſay, that he would maintain the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: That he wiſhed for peace and good order, and good morals among the people; and that he never heard him ſay any thing againſt the King: That he has ſeen; Mr. Muir's Library in the country, which is a large room open to all the family.</p>
               <p>The LORD ADVOCATE ſtated to the Court, that he was informed that William Muir, the perſon committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was a pariſhioner of the Rev. Mr. Dunn's, miniſter of Kirkintilloch, one of the witneſſes incloſed againſt the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. That if Mr. Dunn was allowed to converſe with him, he might remove his error, and preſerve him from ſuffering the dreadful puniſhment due to his obſtinacy. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moved their Lordſhips to allow Mr. Dunn to converſe with William Muir for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. MUIR oppoſed the motion.—He ſaid, he had already conſented, and would ſtill conſent to admit the declaration of William Muir againſt him to be true, although not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by an oath. To prevent the witneſs from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any puniſhment, he would ſurrender the right which the law gave him; but, that he certainly would object to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027633_0047_0FD556712AE819B0"/>
converſation betwixt that witneſs and Mr. Dunn: Not that he ſuſpected any thing improper to take place in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but that this was a great and important cauſe; a trial that might create precedents dangerous to thoſe who might come after. By the law of Scotland all witneſſes muſt be examined apart from each other. The law is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their converſation: The law dreads their colluſion, in framing together a conſiſtent ſtory. If, in this caſe, you allow Mr. Dunn and the witneſs, of both of whom I have no ſuſpicion, to converſe together, you cannot refuſe it to others. It will be ſufficient for two witneſſes, who may have an intereſt in a trial, to play the ſame concerted game, in order to tell the ſame concerted ſtory with more accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and with greater ſafety.</p>
               <p>The LORD ADVOCATE declared, that he would depart from Mr. Dunn as a witneſs, and that the converſation ſhould proceed in the preſence of an officer of the court, or of ſome perſon on the part of Mr. Muir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dunn was called in. He was ordered to converſe with the witneſs in preſence of one of the macers; enjoined not to ſpeak on the ſubject of the trial, but ſolely about the witneſs's ſcruples to take the oath.</p>

               <p>Being interrogated by Mr. Muir; depones, That he does not remember to have heard him ſpeak againſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that Mr. Muir did not adviſe unconſtitutional mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; that he heard him ſpeak about the government; that he heard him tell how Sarum was repreſented.</p>
               <p>The Lord Advocate cauſed the ſentence of fugitation againſt Mr. Muir to be read, [which is annexed in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix] and afterwards propoſed to prove the Declarations before the Sheriff, and the papers that were found upon Mr. Muir when before the magiſtrate at Stranraer. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſave time and trouble, Mr. Muir agreed to admit them without proof, but under this expreſs condition, that none of theſe papers ſhould be uſed in evidence againſt him of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny criminality.</p>
               <p>If theſe papers, ſaid Mr. Muir, had afforded any weighty diſcoveries of my guilt, the Indictment ſhould have ſo ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>
                  <q>AT LEAST, times and places above mentioned, the ſaid ſeditious ſpeeches and harangues were uttered, the ſaid ſeditious books or pamphlets recommended to be purchaſed and peruſed, the ſaid ſeditious books or pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets circulated and diſtributed, as aforeſaid, and the ſaid wicked and inflammatory addreſs produced, read, recommended, and approved of, in manner above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and the ſaid Thomas Muir is guilty actor, or art and part, of all and each, or one or other of the foreſaid crimes. ALL WHICH, or part thereof, being found proven, by the verdict of an aſſize, before our Lord Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice General, Lord Juſtice Clerk, and Lords Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Juſticiary, in a Court of Juſticiary to be holden by them within the Criminal Court-houſe of Edinburgh, the ſaid Thomas Muir OUGHT to be puniſhed with the pains of law, to deter others from committing the like crimes in all time coming.</q>

               </p>
               <p>When the Clerk of Court proceeded to read the letter ſigned J.

               <p>The LORD ADVOCATE ſtated, that his conduct proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from no idle curioſity, that the letters found upon Mr. Muir would completely do away the aſſertion of his anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to return home, and prove the guilt attending his flight.</p>

               <p>It is my duty, now, to require your moſt attentive and deliberate conſideration of what you have heard. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is come, when the truth or falſhood of what is laid to the charge of the Pannel at the bar, is to be aſcertained. He is a man, who, under the pretext of a reform, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew you, has been ſowing miſchief and ſedition: he appears here before you, after being a fugitive from his country; and it is now that by your verdict, a verdict which is uncontroulable, and from which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, his guilt muſt be eſtabliſhed, or the imputation thrown out againſt him, completely wiped away. It is a moment which I have long wiſhed to ſee; for during the circumſtances which occurred laſt winter, among the numerous liſt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027633_0061_0FD61906F3E268E0"/>
ſpirit againſt the Conſtitution, and all under the veil of Parliamentary Reform.</p>
               <p>This country has ſeen many inſtances of pernicious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſeditious writings and conduct, but I am perſuaded a wider range of diabolical miſchief will appear in this man, than ever was ſeen in England, or any where elſe.—Who could believe that a man of a liberal education, an Advocate at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his bar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could be found among villagers, and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, poor and ignorant, for the purpoſe of ſowing ſedition and diſcontent?</p>
               <p>The charges againſt the Pannel are divided into three heads, all centering however, in the general charge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing ſedition and diſcontent, by various ſteps of conduct. He has circulated Paine's works, a book which one of his witneſſe ſays he declared to be dangerous to weak minds, with an obſtinacy and pertinacity, which plainly indicated that his wiſh was to alter or overturn the Conſtitution. He went to Kirkintilloch and Campſie, carrying Mr. Paine with him, and adviſed the conſtituting of meetings, which, without him, would never have been eſtabliſhed; he came like the daemon of ſedition recommending that club govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has produced all the anarchy we ſee in France, and which cannot be ſupported in any well eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>He has been in a convention of people, calling themſelves Reformers; but the ſpirit of the people ſhewed itſelf, and it no longer exiſts: he in that meeting endeavoured to ſupport and defend a paper coming from our ſiſter kingdom: It came from the Society of United Iriſhmen, highly ſeditious, if not treaſonable; and yet he was the ringleader to produce, to read, and approve.</p>
               <p>Theſe three charges, then, Gentlemen, which unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in one, that of exciting diſcontent againſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have been brought with deliberation; and, it is now my duty to ſhew you, have been eſtablſhed by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>I wiſh to have the opinion of a reſpectable Jury on the ſubject. Whether ſedition is a crime of the deteſtable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I repreſent it? I bring forward the arm of Juſtice to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027633_0062_0FD619089458FC00"/>
ſuppreſs it; and it is in your power to invigorate it, or palſy it in a moment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, as the charges are threefold, the evidence muſt be of three kinds. I ſhall ſpeak of each in their order, and I muſt ſay, that if ever a ſtrong body of evidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a difficult caſe, it is to be ſeen here.</p>
               <p>The firſt charge is, making ſeditious ſpeeches and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, and encouraging improper meetings. To ſupport this, we find that he went to Kirkintilloch and Campſie, and recommended improper publications to enlighten their minds; but in this he does not appear to have been very ſucceſsful, if we take the Vice Preſident as an example of their in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uence. The evidence here re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s chiefly on <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> and <hi>Freeland,</hi> particularly <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the mode in which he gave his evidence; he was calm, accurate, and clear. <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Freeland</hi> agree that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſpoke of the ſucceſs of the French a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms: With what motive could he diſcourſe on ſuch a ſubject to weak, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, illiterate people, but to fulfil his ſeditious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? He talked of the weight of taxes Gentlemen, we may ſee theſe burdens lightened; but if this gentleman's mode of doing it were to go on, what ſort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f relief we ſhould have by the diminution of our taxes and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our debt, are topics of which you will judge as you ought to do. He ſaid that their taxes would be leſs, if they were more equally repreſented, and that from the flouriſhing ſtate of France, they could not bring their goods to market ſo cheap as Frenchmen. What could poſſibly be more calculated to produce diſcontent and ſedition? Had ſuch ſocieties previouſly exiſted, the caſe would have been different; but he appears as the ringleader, he was there on the Tueſday preceding, converſing about it; he came to the meeting and harangued them; he adjourned with them afterwards to Wallace's: Can any evidence be more connected or more clear that he was the main inſtrument?</p>
               <p>The ſecond charge is the circulating ſeditious books, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the paſſages libelled in the indictment, which you may read. <hi>Freeland</hi> is again an evidence here; and I muſt obſerve, that it appears to be doubtful, whether he told all he knew; from his face he plainly prevaricated; and,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:027633_0063_0FD5568E03B1EC40"/>
when cloſely queſtioned, the ſweat broke upon it. He told you the ſtory of getting Paine's book out of Muir's poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. I may here obſerve, that ſuch a mode of circulating a book is that which a man in his ſituation will naturally adopt; he will not go on openly, but privately, and under various pretexts; by his fruits muſt you know him; you muſt compare his actions with his profeſſions, and then judge.</p>
               <p>We have evidence of his recommending and buying the Paiſley Declaration and other books, which go to prove he is tainted from head to foot, and is as unworthy to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of the law as the meaneſt felon.</p>
               <p>You would obſerve his conduct, Gentlemen, on Anne Fiſher leaving the foot of the table. What can be laid to her charge? her evidence was clear and correct, and was founded on the beſt baſis, her's being confirmed by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of others. But what was his conduct? the only thing, indeed, which he could do,—an endeavour to ſhake her teſtimony by an illiberal and unfounded in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>uation, that we procured our information only from domeſtics.</p>
               <p>To what then amounts her teſtimony, which ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a doubt: That ſhe was ſent repeatedly from her maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's houſe, the Pannel's father, who I underſtand is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable man; far be it from me to attach any criminality to him; the Pannel ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the miſerable reflection that the diſtreſſes which have embittered the lives of his parents have been brought on by himſelf;—that ſhe was ſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly to buy Paine and other works for country people that came to the ſhop, who by this man's perſuaſion mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> out with their miſerable ſixpence to purchaſe <hi>Paine's Rights of Man;</hi> that he uſed conſtantly to be reading ſeditious publications in the back ſhop.—It was there, in that cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral of ſedition, he ſat like a ſpider, weaving his filthy web to catch the unwary.</p>
               <p>The witneſs ſpecifies the people to whom he procured Paine's book—his own uncle, John Muir the hatter, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay the elder, and, Wilſon the barber. I have produced all of them in ſupport of the girl, except the uncle, whom I declined making an evidence againſt his nephew. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Wilſon, who completely ſupported the girl in this,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:027633_0064_0FD5568F1B9153C8"/>
to keep a copy in his ſhop to enlighten his cuſtomers minds; for that it confuted Burke entirely,—Mr. Burke, a man whoſe wonderful talents and genius have lately been ſo much exerted in the ſervice of his country.</p>
               <p>From theſe circumſtances I have only to deſire you to look at Paine's book, at the paſſages in the indictment; and if you are loyal to your king, if you are loyal to your country, and would preſerve it, you will find this man guilty, who has given ſo decided an opinion in favour of that wretched outcaſt. His works I never read till my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial duty compelled me to it; I need not give my opinion of it; the determinations of courts of law, and the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opinion of the country, have marked the deteſtation in which they are held.</p>
               <p>[His Lordſhip here read ſome of the paſſages in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.]</p>
               <p>What avails then, Gentlemen, all this evidence of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the king and conſtitution, when he unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally approves ſentiments ſuch as theſe? We are told, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by one of his witneſſes, that he adviſed him not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell Paine; but unfortunately the anſwer given to the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion put to him upon his croſs examination, proves that they were not his real ſentiments, but for fear of danger, as the book began to be taken notice of.</p>
               <p>We find from the evidence of the girl Fiſher, that the very organiſt could not paſs the houſe of this oracle of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, without being deſired to play <hi>ça ira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He uſed to ſay, too, that if every man had a vote, he would be member for Calder, and members would have thirty or forty ſhillings a-day. All theſe circumſtances go to prove inconteſtibly, that France and French principles were continually in his view, and that he aimed at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the preſent government; with reſpect to which, however, I hope his prophecies will be as falſe, as they have already been, in regard to the ſucceſs of the French.</p>
               <p>I may here remark, that the evidence of Fiſher appears in a trifling inſtance to be contradicted by the elder Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay; but you ſhould remember the ſalvo with which that old gentleman choſe to premiſe his evidence.</p>
               <p>I come now to the third charge, which relates to Mr.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:027633_0065_0FD55690CFEB2A30"/>
Muir's conduct in the Convention. It is here inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proved, that he read, approved, and defended, the Iriſh Addreſs. Will you approve this paper? Will you diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this convincing proof of his guilt? Be his ſtudies ever ſo great, be his views ever ſo expenſive, will you permit him arrogantly to ſet up his ſeditious opinions in oppoſition to the government and conſtitution? His conduct in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would almoſt appear to be marked with inſanity, were we not finding him the determined ringleader in an uniform ſcheme of ſedition.</p>
               <p>This, Gentlemen, finiſhes my remarks upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; upon the evidence which I think is invincible; but there are two topics on which I muſt beg to make ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir told us, that he was carried out of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by buſineſs of importance, and that he was detained in France; and that he always wiſhed to have a trial, I could have no objections to his proving this: It would have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued ſome degree of honour. But his profeſſions are falſe and confuted. He left this country under an impreſſion of guilt; and lately returned, the peſt of Scotland, with the ſame intention as before.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of his going to France, it ſeems, was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence he might poſſibly have in ſaving the life of the King of France; and he was ſent there by the Friends of the People. Never was I more aſtoniſhed than at the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this evidence. Did Skirving know or recollect, that he was almoſt accuſing him of high treaſon? But why was he intereſted in this event? It was an event, as his witneſſes tell you, that would hurt the common cauſe.—What cauſe? their intention of effecting a change in the government of this country: There then he ſtands a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary from a ſociety in this country to France,—a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which greatly confirms his guilt.</p>
               <p>When the trial was coming on, I poſtponed it longer than I ought to have done, to give him every chance; and I inſerted it in the papers, which might perhaps reach him roaming in ſome part of the world.</p>
               <p>The ſhipmaſter's receipt bears date the 16th May. What became of him from this date to the 31ſt July when he was
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:027633_0066_0FD6190C12A94860"/>
apprehended. He informed nobody of his coming home. How wonderful that no letter was driven by the winds or impelled by the waves, to give notice of what he ſays was his earneſt wiſh. The reverſe in fact appears to have been the caſe. By the letter of J. Muir, his father, we find him in Ireland, doing we know not what; except what we learn from the diploma of the worthy ſociety of United Iriſhmen. He is at laſt apprehended returning into this country, with all the inſignia of ſedition about him.</p>
               <p>I have but one remark more. You may in ſome degree judge of a man, by the company he keeps: amongſt Muir's papers we find a letter here in my hand addreſſed to the Rev. <hi>Fiſche Palmer,</hi> a man who is indicted to ſtand trial at Perth, in the courſe of a few days, and whom moſt of you muſt know.

               <p>I hope, Gentlemen, this caſe will be viewed by you in a light ſuch as this, that you will protect your King from the attacks of his enemies, that you will protect this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of freedom from the attempts of the factious, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly againſt that man at the bar, who has been ſowing ſedition with ſo liberal a hand. You now, however, may ſeize him in his career, and by your verdict do juſtice to your country, and honour to yourſelves.</p>

Let faction rage;—let the ſpirit of party, in the preſent hour, proudly domineer.—The illuſion will ſoon vaniſh away. In ſolitude the power of recollection will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its influence; and then, it will be material to you, whether or not you have acted uprightly, or ſinned againſt your own eternal conſcience, in my acquittal, or in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation!</p>
               <p>Before I enter into a particular vindication of myſelf, let me take notice of two circumſtances, ſtrongly inſiſted upon by the Public Proſecutor, which have little relation to the general nature of the evidence which has been adduced.—Long, indeed, has he harangued upon them; and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his ſpeech by exhibiting them in every ſhape which his imagination could invent. He maintains, that a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of guilt obliged me to leave this country after an information had been filed againſt me, and after I had been examined by a magiſtrate. I will admit the fact of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.—In theſe days—in theſe circumſtances—is that to be aſcribed to conſcious guilt alone? If the whole ſtrength of arbitrary power is extended againſt an Individual, is
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027633_0068_0FD5569600E92F50"/>
there merit in expoſing himſelf as a ſacrafice which cannot be uſeful to the country, and which may only preſent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity with a new addition to the immenſe catalogue of the victims of deſpotiſm.—If two motives had only exiſted to which you could aſſign my departure, you are bound to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it to the moſt charitable. But what were the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending my departure? Did they bear any reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a flight? Did I not publicly anounce it the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding evening in a numerous meeting of citizens? Did I not cauſe it to be publiſhed in a public paper? Did I affect the garb and diſguiſe of concealment? In London did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in obſcurity? Did I not appear in a diſtinguiſhed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, the Society of the Friends of the People? And did not that Society publiſh afterwards a reſolution, announcing in its preamble my preſence among them?</p>
               <p>But I went immediately afterwards to France. Mr. Skirving, who was examined with regard to a letter he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from me, before my departure from London, has ſaid, in his evidence (and his words I have accurately in my notes,) that I propoſed to go to Paris, as it was the advice <hi>OF SOME FRIENDS,</hi> and might be of ſome ſervice in mitigating the fate of the late King.</p>
               <p>The words of Mr. Shirving, "SOME FRIENDS," have been <hi>curiouſly</hi> repreſented.—It is ſtated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </q> muſt have been the members of that truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Society; and it is boldly argued, that I went to France as a Miſſionary from that body. Nothing can be more ridiculous.—Nothing can be more injurious.—Mr. Skirving never ſaid ſo!—No perſon can, or <hi>dare,</hi> ſay that I ever went as a miſſionary, delegated from individuals, or by Societies, to any foreign power. Building then upon this unſubſtantial baſis of words, never uttered in evidence by Mr. Skirving, nor which ever could poſſibly be uttered. I am accuſed of a ſpecies of high treaſon, in correſponding with a foreign power without any legal authority from home. The charge of correſponding with foreign power is equally ridiculous with the miſrepreſentation upon which it is founded; but let it be conſidered as ſerious, I <hi>dare</hi> the proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:027633_0069_0FD55699A28EE898"/>I challenge the Proſecutor to adduce the ſmalleſt veſtige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of evidence.</p>
               <p>Yes; I will admit, I wrote to Mr. Skirving my intention of going to France; nor will I deny the motive. I ſaw, in the execution of the late King, a ſpecious pretext to plunge the country in war, and to extend the effuſion of <hi>human blood</hi> to every corner of the world! I may have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I may have acted from enthuſiaſm; but it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm in the cauſe of man. If, at the period when it was free to every perſon to publiſh their ſentiments upon that awful queſtion. I wiſhed likewiſe to publiſh mine, can that be imputed to me as a crime? Can the intention of pleading the cauſe of mercy, of individual and of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral humanity, be conſtrued into guilt? If it can, I am then guilty. Has not the Proſecutor lamented that diſaſtrous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? And will he accuſe a man who wiſhed to prevent it? Who, with many friends to humanity, of every nation, and of every party, in private, in public, in converſation, and from the Preſs, exerted their abilities to ward off an event which they foreſaw was to introduce years of blood and of ſorrow! But allow, that at firſt glance, my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Scotland; my journey to Paris, afforded a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of guilt; that preſumption is obviated by my RETURN.</p>
               <p>The Proſecutor has boaſted of his humanity, in granting me the delay of a few weeks, by poſtponing my trial, in order that I might return from Paris.—But was <hi>he</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that hoſtilities at <hi>that time</hi> were commencing—that the communication was cloſed; that it was tedious and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to procure paſſports. Of that difficulty no perſon here can poſſibly have any doubt.</p>
               <p>Do not all my private letters, which have this day been read, prove my uneaſineſs upon account of the delay, and my anxiety to return? But, at the period when I procured my paſſport, the flames of war were blazing over moſt of Europe—I knew only two ways by which I could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly return home. The firſt, by the way of Hamburgh; the ſecond by the longer, but the more certain circuit of America.—I adopt the latter, as more ſafe, and leſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to interruption.—I left Paris.—I went down to the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:027633_0070_0FD61911EE7BA498"/>
port of Havre-de-Grace. I found a veſſel which was to ſail for New York—The receipt found in my pocket book, when I was ſtopped upon my landing in Scotland, from the maſter of that veſſel for the payment of my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, proves that I had actually taken my paſſage in that ſhip. That veſſel, in taking in her freight, and by an embargo, was detained for near three months.—In this interval, another American ſhip, the Hope, of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore, arrived. The Captain was to touch in at Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, in Ireland, for part of his cargo, on his return to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.— This I conſidered to be a fortunate accident.—I immediately embraced this opportunity of returning by the way of Ireland to my country, not to implore favour, not to aſk protection, but to DEMAND juſtice. To paſs from France, to any of the dominions of Britain, I had no paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,—my paſſport was to America. I braved every dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. After a ſhort paſſage I was landed in Ireland. There I remained no longer than nine days. I concealed not my name, I appeared publicly, and in the places of moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic reſort. To all I announced my ſituation and intention. The Proſecutor has either deſignedly, or ignorantly, laid hold of the circumſtance of the indorſation of the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers of Havre-de-Grace, upon my paſſport. The Deparment of Paris granted me a paſſport in the end of the month of April, and I arrived at Havre on the 3d or 4th of May. The firſt ſtep which a ſtranger is obliged to take, upon arriving at the place of his deſtination in France, is to proceed to the Municipality, to ſhew to them the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from whence he came, to have it reviſed and atteſted by them, in order to enjoy ſecurity within their juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The indorſation, as I have ſtated, of my Pariſian paſſport, by the municipal officers at Havre, is of the 3d or 4th of May laſt. From this circumſtance the Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate infers, that I muſt immediately have found a veſſel to carry me home. He makes no allowance for the ſtate of the two nations; he makes no allowance for the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which neutral veſſels have, in paſſing betwixt both; and he knows nothing of the embargoes which theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels muſt conſtantly experience, in the different belligerent ports. Well, then, ſometime in the month of May I
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:027633_0071_0FD5569EDA9B3FB0"/>
muſt have landed in Ireland! Public report has ſaid, that inſurrections have been in that country. The Proſecutor has cried out, That I was the daemon of ſedition! And he inſinuates, that there is a probability that I was the cauſe of theſe inſurrections. I ſmile at the accuſation; which he himſelf in his own mind muſt deride. It could have been eaſy for me, by the teſtimonies of my friends in Ireland, whom I love, and whom I honour, to prove how I paſſed my time. But for me to dwell upon this is unneceſſary. You, of the Jury, muſt have experienced the ſame emotions, and at preſent indulge the ſame feelings as I do.</p>
               <p>From Ireland, the Proſecutor ſays, I attempted to land in Scotland in a clandeſtine manner; and ſo ſays (his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) the Indictment.</p>
               <p>In the liſt of witneſſes adduced againſt me, I ſaw the names of Carmichael, the perſon who firſt recognized me at my landing at Portpatrick, and of Mr. Roſs the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at Stranraer, before whom I firſt appeared. The Lord Advocate charges me with coming to Scotland in a clandeſtine manner. He ſerves upon me, in the liſt of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the only witneſſes who could prove the fact; Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, the cuſtom-houſe officer, and Mr. Roſs the magiſtrate, to whom I ſurrendered. I expected Carmichael and that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would have been incloſed with the other witneſſes of the Crown. I would have adduced them as witneſſes to prove that ſo far from concealing myſelf, I announced myſelf pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly, and without diſguiſe; ſo far from attempting evaſion, my only anxiety was to put myſelf in the hands of the Law; and under the protection of its magiſtrates. The conduct of the Public Proſecutor, is in every reſpect uniform. He is guilty of another piece of diſingenuity, by ſerving upon me in the liſt of the witneſſes of the Crown, the names of Carmichael and Roſs. I could not entertain the leaſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible doubt, but that they were to be adduced. This was an art to prevent me citing them at my own inſtance. It has ſucceeded. I am deprived of their teſtimony. But why did not the Proſecutor, at leaſt, produce the declaration which I made before the Magiſtrate at Stranraer: That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, freely and voluntarily emitted, would have proved that I came into the country in no unbecoming manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:027633_0072_0FD61912E374A130"/>Much of the invective of the Proſecutor was founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my coming into this country in concealment. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, the Indictment charges as an aggravation of the crime Judge then, Gentlemen, of the rectitude of the Proſecutor's conduct; when he declaims upon a fact which he ſhrinks from proving, and which by his art in ſerving the liſt of witneſſes upon me, he has prevented me from confuting.</p>
               <p>I truſt, now you will be convinced, that no conſciouſneſs of guilt led me from Scotland, no improper motive carried me from England to France; and that no deep, and ſecret intention, induced me to return in diſguiſe to my country. The object of that return was to demand juſtice, to wipe away the imputation of that crime of which I now ſtand charged. And what is that crime? Sedition.—Is there a term ſo vague and ſo undefined, ſo familiar to power, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to corruption. All who ever dared to oppoſe AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BITRARY POWER, and who in the hour of danger came forward to ſave their country, have been branded by the epithet of ſeditious. The term is therefore no longer a term of opprobrium. In one age, it has been applied to men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by ſociety, whoſe names were honoured by after times, and upon whoſe virtues, and upon whoſe ſufferings, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding age reared the majeſtic pillar of the conſtitution. I am then accuſed of ſedition, and I aſk you of the Jury, to point out the corner of this land where ſedition has exiſted. And tell me truly where the ſmalleſt veſtige of this crime has appeared. Upon you the eyes of the people are now placed. Upon your conſciences the oath of God is binding. Point out then to us, where the ſhadow of ſedition has been deſcried. Have the ſacred rights of property been any where invaded? Has the blood of the citizens flowed by the hands of the Friends of the People? O! No.—But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor has talked of the danger the People of this country were in laſt winter, of deep-laid plots, and of tremendous conſpiracies! and I am the man, whom he charges as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the whole, whom he repreſents ſimilar in malignity to the daemon of miſchief! and whom he honours with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>peſt of Scotland!</hi> Well then, let it be ſuppoſed that an attempt was formed to overthrow the Conſtitution, to
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:027633_0073_0FD556A3643E9468"/>
kindle the torch of civil war, to lead rapine and murder along the land; Where has the proof of this deſign been found? Has it been diſcovered in the meetings of the Friends of the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, conſcious of the purity of their intentions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected no concealment, aſſembled with doors open to all; and who hatched their helliſh deſigns, (if ſuch they were) in no midnight cavern. Could in the crouds, that were admitted to attend the deliberations of theſe ſocieties, be found no ruſſian, who could at leaſt give a bold and manly teſtimony againſt them, and againſt me? But to ſupport the accuſation, the walls of a private houſe muſt be invaded; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſecrets muſt be explored, and the teſtimony of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſcullion girl, and a hair-dreſſer, muſt be brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with regard to words, ſpoken where ſuſpicion the moſt vigilant muſt have been aſleep, under the guardianſhip of a paternal roof. And are theſe the witneſſes, who are to prove againſt me this mighty crime, which, ſuppoſing <hi>them</hi> to have been honoured by my confidence, would have requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the co-operation of thouſands of bearded men in arms.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Let us this night throw away vain pretext: Let us act fairly and candidly. I ſmile at the charge of ſedition.

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027633_0074_0FD556A4D9270A88"/>
held up by the great and the venerable names of the living and of the dead. I contended for an equal repreſentation of the people, in what I ſhall ever call the Houſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe I conſidered it a meaſure eſſentially neceſſary to the ſalvation of the State, and to the ſtability of your boaſted conſtitution. Wherein then conſiſts the excellency of that time-tried fabric, cemented by the blood of your fathers, flowing from the field and from the ſcaffold. I will tell you: It conſiſts in the due balance of its three im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling powers, KING, LORDS, and COMMONS; If one of theſe powers loſes its vigour, the conſtitution in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion loſes its vigour; If one of theſe powers becomes only a ſhadow of what it ought to be, if it becomes merged and abſorbed into any of the other two, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution then alſo becomes a ſhadow, and it is annihilated. And do you not know, and does all the world not know, and if any were the proud ſtructure of the conſtitution has ſuffered the ravages of time or of corruption, it is in its popular branch. Is it not a fact indiſputable, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the people is not ſuch as it once was, and is not ſuch, as I truſt in God, one day it ſhall be. The man then who ſounds the alarm, when he diſcovers the aproach of danger, who ſummons all who may be concerned in its reparation, is ſurely no enemy to the country, no foe to the conſtitution, becauſe he labours in its preſervation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection<note n="*" place="bottom">And, as it is eſſential to the very being of Parliament, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections ſhould be abſolutely free, therefore all undue influences up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the electors are illegal, and ſtrongly prohibited. For Mr. LOCKE (on Gov. p. 2. § 222.) ranks it among thoſe breaches of truſt in the executive magiſtrate, which, according to his nations, amount to a diſſolution of the government.—<q>If he employs the force, treaſure, and offices of the ſociety, to corrupt the repreſentatives, or openly to pre-engage the electors, and preſcribe what manner of perſons ſhall be choſen: For thus to regulate candidates and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it, ſays he, but to cut up the government by the 100ts, and poiſon the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, is there a man ignorant of the illuſtrious Locke, and was not this ſage in philoſophy, this advanced champion the cauſe of liberty, and of man; this friend to the Britiſh conſtitution, who wrote his Treatiſe on Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its defence; in defence of the laſt glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, by the deſire of the Prince; who was the leader of the men who planned it;—was not he an advocate for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in Parliament, for a more equal repreſentation of the Commons in the Houſe of Commons? Will you venture to tear the records of <hi>his</hi> ſame, to ſtigmatize <hi>his</hi> memory, and to brand <hi>him</hi> with the epithet of ſeditious?</p>
               <p>Let us rapidly proceed down to more modern times. Let us paſs over in ſilence many illuſtrious names, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with that of the Conſtitution will periſh together. Let us come to your own days. Are ye ignorant of Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; —the man who firſt collected the laws of his country, from the deformed chaos into which they had been thrown, who arranged them with elegancy, and who adorned them with every flower which the claſſic field could produce? Are not the volumes of this reverend judge in the hands of all? Should they not be familiar, at leaſt to thoſe who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to decide concerning the conſtitution? And has not Blackſtone, not with the levity of ill-pondered words, not in the private hour of relaxation, not in the heat of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar debate, but in the calmneſs and ſolitude of ſtudy, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame propoſitions which I maintain, been guilty of the ſame ſedition of which I am guilty, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that the Conſtitution was imperfect, in its popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branch, and if any where ALTERATION was neceſſary, it was there to be deſired. I entreat you to liſten. I will read you, what this beſt expounder of the conſtitution has ſaid. Let the words be engraved on the tablet of your hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And this conſtitution of ſuffrages is framed upon a wiſer principle, with us, than either of the methods of voting, by centuries or by tribes, among the Romans. In the method by centuries, inſtiuted by Servious Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027633_0076_0FD556A8A5BE3B40"/>
it was principally PROPERTY, and not numbers, that turned the ſcale: in the method by tribes, gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the tribunes of the people, NUMBERS only were regarded, and property was entirely overlooked. Hence the laws paſſed by the former method had uſually too great a tendency to aggrandize the patricians or rich nobles; and thoſe by the latter had too much of a level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling principle. Our conſtitution ſteers between the two extremes. Only ſuch are entirely excluded, as can have no will of their own: there is hardly a free agent to be found, who is not entitled to a vote in ſome place or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the kingdom. Nor is comparative wealth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty entirely diſregarded in elections, for though the richeſt man has only one vote at one place, yet, if his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty be at all diffuſed, he has probably a right to vote at more places than one, and therefore has many repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives. <hi>This is the SPIRIT OF OUR CONSTITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION: not that I aſſert it is in fact quite ſo perfect as I have here endeavoured to deſcribe it; for, if any ALTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATION might be wiſhed or ſuggeſted in the preſent frame of parliament,</hi> it ſhould be <hi>in favour of a MORE COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLETE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If Blackſtone then wiſhed for a more equal repreſentation of the people, if he dared to publiſh and to enforce his wiſh; and if I have merely done the ſame, where is the difference in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> guilt? But there is a difference, and that difference is great. A learned profeſſor of the laws of England, in the Univerſity of Cambridge, a grave writer, in the ſolitude of his retirement, a ſolemn judge, upon the tribunal of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, proclaiming that a reform in the repreſentation of the people was juſt, and eſſential to the true ſpirit of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; how ſuperlatively criminal muſt his conduct be when compared with mine?</p>
               <p>But vengeance ceaſes at the verge of the grave. There factions and parties rage in vain. If I have been guilty of an atrocious crime, I ſhall not demand the protection of the dead, I ſhall not wonder among the tombs, and cry for the ſupport and the aſſiſtance of thoſe who cannot hear me, but I ſhall loudly demand the protection of the living, of men high in rank, exalted in power, and who enjoy the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027633_0077_0FD556AA4795E500"/>
of their king. Can it ever be forgotten, that in the year 1782, Mr. Pitt was ſtained with the ſame guilt? Did not he preach up the neceſſity of a reform in the repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the people? Did not he adviſe the people to form ſocieties; and did not he countenance theſe ſocieties, by his preſence? I appeal to the reſolutions which he ſubſcribed, in the Thatched Houſe Tavern. I atteſt the motions which he made for Reform, in the Houſe of Commons. Beware how you condemn me. Beware how you brand me with the opprobrium of being ſeditious. At the ſame time you condemn the confidential Miniſter of the King. Nay more Sir, in bringing this charge againſt me you accuſe your Sovereign; for can it be ſuppoſed that he would permit a man to enjoy his confidence, who in the year 1782 by being a reformer, as I am in the year 1793, wiſhed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate this country into anarchy, deſolation, and, into all the horrors which you have deſcribed.</p>
               <p>But if the attempt to procure a Reform in Parliament be criminal, your accuſation muſt extend far and wide. It muſt implicate the Miniſters of the Crown and the loweſt ſubjects. Have you forgotten that in the year 1782, the Duke of Richmond, the preſent Commander of the forces, was a flaming advocate for the univerſal right of ſuffrage? Do you not know, that he preſided in ſocieties, and like Mr. Pitt, adviſed an univerſal formation of ſuch ſocieties all over the kingdom? Have you never read his famous letter to Colonel S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is guilt the paſſing unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial faſhion of the day? Does it vary according to times and to ſeaſons, and to circumſtances? Shall what was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm in 1782, be criminal in 1793? You have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me this night, by the title of the peſt of Scotland. And if the ſame offences merit the ſame appellations, you muſt likewiſe liberally beſtow this epithet upon the firſt Lord of the treaſury, and upon the Commander of the forces. But what term of ſuper-eminent diſtinction will not you, the Public Proſecutor; you the Lord Advocate for Scotland, appropriate to yourſelf? Were not you, not many months ago, likewiſe a reformer? Did you not contend and act
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:027633_0078_0FD61915E2B26A70"/>
for a more equal repreſentation of the people in the Houſe of Commons? Were not you one of thoſe men, who, for that purpoſe, aſſembled lately in this city, in what they called a Convention, and aſſumed to themſelves the title of Delegates from the Counties? Were not you, yourſelf, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in framing a bill for the extention of the elective franchiſe? Every charge in your indictment againſt me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils upon yourſelf; in accuſing me, you charge yourſelf with ſedition. If it was lawful for you and your friends to meet in ſocieties, and in conventions, for the purpoſe of a Reform in Parliament, unleſs the ſtandard of guilt ſhrinks and extends as caprice or power may order, it ſurely muſt have been permitted to me and my friends alſo to meet, and to act on the ſame principle.</p>
               <p>But I advance in this tract no farther, although my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions and my arguments are juſt, yet the ſubject of them is ſo connected with ridicule, as to render them not ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this ſolemn trial.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, If the real cauſe of my ſtanding as a Pannel at your bar, is for having actively engaged in the cauſe of a Parliamentary Reform, I plead guilty. My conſcience, however, will whiſper conſolation to me under my condemnation. I engaged in that cauſe, for I thought the meaſure was to ſave the country; that a more equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation would dry up the ſources of corruption, would diminiſh our taxes, and ſtop the effuſion of our blood. That ſuch were my motives, appears from every part of the evidence againſt me. The Public Proſecutor ſhrunk from the examination, even of the teſtimony of his own witneſſes. He averted his eyes from the proof, in order to indulge himſelf in vain declamation and unbecoming invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. I will not, however, imitate his conduct. I will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine minutely every branch of the proof which he has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt me; and you will be convinced that after eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word and action of mine has been ſcrutinized; after even the levity of the moſt unguarded hour has been explored, and while inſtructed ſpies have watched every book, had marked every word, not the veſtige of ſedition can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>The firſt charge againſt me is, That at meetings of the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027633_0079_0FD556AE9F62B6B8"/>
people which I myſelf had convocated, I made ſeditious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues; vilified the King and conſtitution; repreſented the monarchical part of our government as cumberſome and expenſive; inſtituted a compariſon betwixt our ſyſtem and that of France, and did every thing to inflame the minds of the people to inſurrection and rebellion. It is particularly alledged that I was guilty of theſe crimes at two meetings, the one at Campſie, and the other at Kirkintilloch.</p>
               <p>To prove this charge, Alexander Johnſtone is adduced. You will remember, that I offered to prove that this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had expreſſed himſelf in the moſt rancorous terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; that he would do all in his power to get me hanged. By reſpectable witneſſes, I could eaſily have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this averment; but I was not allowed by the Court, as I could not ſpecify the particular cauſe which had excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the malice of a man I did not know, and whom I do not remember to have ever ſeen. But what does even Johnſtone ſay? I will read you from my notes the whole of his evidence. Correct me if I have erred in taking down any thing differently from what has been ſtated. I believe that my notes are accurate, but miſtakes are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Here Mr. Muir read over the whole of the evidence.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What does this witneſs then ſay? He ſays, that I ſtated, in the meeting at Campſie, the diſadvantages in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, from boroughs being rotten, and from others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no vote, the population of England and Scotland, the ſmall number of electors in both; and that the people were not fully repreſented. And is this ſedition? Is not the fact notoriouſly true? Has it not been reſounded innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable times within the walls of the Houſe of Commons itſelf? Has not the table of that Houſe been covered with petitions, expreſſing it in language infinitely ſtronger than mine? If to ſtate truth be ſedition, why did our legiſlature ſlumber? Why ſlumbered the law; and why was not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic vengeance armed with the ſword of juſtice, when this crime dared to pollute the ſanctuary of the legiſlature, by its appearance within it?</p>
               <p>Johnſtone depones, that I ſaid, If a man gave 20,000<abbr>l.</abbr> for a ſeat in parliament, he behoved to derive ſome intereſt from
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027633_0080_0FD556B01A0D76D0"/>
it. Is not the fact true? Do not we daily know of ſums of money being given for ſeats in that houſe, and can there be a concluſion in Euclid, more certain than the inference which I draw from the fact? It may be ſaid, that the Houſe may be pure and uncorrupted, even although ſuch ſums of money are given for admiſſion into it; that men may do ſo in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſerve their country, or to diſplay their abilities.— Grant all this; but have we not ſeen much greater ſums thrown away at conteſted elections, by men who never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their mouths within the walls of St Stephen's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; whoſe patriotiſm never ſhone forth; and whoſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were never diſcovered? The witneſs depones, that I ſaid the Duke of Richmond had been bribed into ſilence by 20 or 30,000<abbr>l.</abbr> And ſuppoſing I had ſaid ſo, that this was the ſalutary opiate, which calmed and cooled the fever of his brain, and probably ſaved him the mortification of ſtanding his trial, alſo, for the crime of ſedition; what has this to do with the preſent matter? It is not the Duke of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, but it is the king himſelf that I am accuſed of vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. This aſſertion of Johnſtone's is indeed too ludicrous for ſerious argument.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, before I proceed farther, let me make one remark. I am to be tried by the law of Scotland; and, by that law, two witneſſes are neceſſary to prove a crime.— This is a rule full of humanity; but, at the ſame time, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off proof, it may, and has upon ſome occaſions defeated the ends of public juſtice. If, however, the concurrence of two witneſſes were to be rigorouſly inſiſted upon, it muſt be in a caſe ſimilar to mine, where their teſtimony is to go to words, <hi>volantia verba,</hi> neither engraved in marble, nor recorded in braſs. You know the infinite variety of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances depending upon the ſpeaker, the occaſion, the manner, the perſon to whom they were uttered, and his ſituation; by which, the meaning of the ſame words, can be diverſified and modified, tortured into guilt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained into innocence. By the law of England, which is likewiſe the ſame with ours in the caſe of treaſon, the bare uttering of words, without any overt act, cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us evidence to prove the crime.</p>
               <p>Johnſtone depones, that I compared our conſtitution with
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027633_0081_0FD6191CF4D91D20"/>
the French, and ſaid that their arms would be ſucceſsful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that their repreſentation was more equal; two thirds of their debt paid, and that their manufacturers, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petion with ours, would have the advantage. Whoever heard before, that it was unlawful to compare the Britiſh conſtitution with that of another country? If the Britiſh conſtitution is the boaſt of ages, the pride and glory of the world, Can it ſuffer by any compariſon? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; will not its ſplendour brighten by the foil? But does Johnſtone ſay, that I gave the ſuperiority to the French conſtitution over the Britiſh? No.—Does he aſſert, that I exhorted the meeting to reject the Britiſh conſtitution, to adopt the French, and to adopt the French as the better model? No; not a word. What then ſays he? That I merely compared the two together. Is this ſedition?— Alas! we are all ſeditious. Is there a man here, or in this country, who has not, in his own mind, and who has not in words, made a ſimilar compariſon?</p>
               <p>Johnſtone next obſerves, That I mentioned, that two thirds of the French national debt was already paid; that their taxes were leſs, and that I aſcribed this to the people being more equally repreſented in their legiſlator. I may have ſaid ſo, or I may have not ſaid ſo. My remembrance does not carry me. Whether the fact was true at that time that I ſpoke in the meeting, of two thirds of their national debt being paid, and of their taxes being leſs, I know not. Certain it is, before and ſince, I have often heard it to be ſo, in word and in writing; but I will ſay this to you, and I will ſay it to all Scotland, that an equal repreſentation of the people is the moſt direct and ſalutary method to diminiſh and pay off the national debt; to alleviate the weight of taxes, and to remove the clogs of induſtry. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be truer than the inference which Johnſtone ſays I drew, that a people equally induſtrious, muſt have the advantage over another, who pay greater taxes, and who groan under the burden of a greater debt. If I were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with this laſt nation, I certainly would adviſe them to take every conſtitutional ſtep to procure a diminution of their debt and of their taxes. And what does Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ſay? That I adviſed the ſociety to petition Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:027633_0082_0FD556B31B36C048"/>
and that the ſole intention of theſe ſocieties was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a more equal repreſentation and a ſhorter duration of Parliaments. Do you ſay then that the object of theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties is unconſtitutional? Or do you ſay, that theſe ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the means which I adviſed them to make uſe of in order to accompliſh that object, were to act unconſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally? You can do neither. Under the free government of Britain, every man has a right to look after thoſe whom he is ſuppoſed to delegate to the Houſe of Commons, to be the arbiters of his liberty, his fortune, his life. He has a right to come and ſtate to them his wrongs and his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; and the mode which the conſtitution has pointed out is by petition.</p>
               <p>Johnſtone depones, that I adviſed the people to conſult together to communicate and diffuſe their knowledge: The advice was a good advice; and ſuch an advice as I would give were I ſtill in the ſame ſituation. What! Is the time now come when the mind muſt be locked up; when fetters muſt be impoſed upon the underſtanding, and when the people, the great maſs of human being, muſt be prohibited to receive information, and to communicate among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the information which they may have received. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable people.—Country to be deplored!—Ignorance is the ſource from which deſpotiſm flows. The remembrance of former liberties will make you only more wretched. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh then (if poſſible) the light of heaven, and let us grope, and let us ſearch for conſolation, if it can be found, under the darkneſs which ſhall ſoon cover us. But the proſpect before us is not ſo diſmal.—We live, and we act under the Britiſh conſtitution. A conſtitution which, in its genuine principles, has for ages conſecrated freedom. We live, and we remember the glorious revolution of 1688, which baniſhed deſpotiſm, and placed the family of Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon the throne. We remember the Bill of Rights; nor ſhall we forget one of its moſt ſacred clauſes, which declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſtabliſhed, and ſanctioned the unalienable claim of the citizen to petition Parliament. Now, as members of the Britiſh conſtitution, acting under the Bill of Rights, how ſhould our Conduct be ſhaped? Do we complain of general grievances, ſuch as, an unequal repreſentation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027633_0083_0FD6191E3108B048"/>
It would be arrogance in a part to ſpeak the language of the whole. Let thoſe, then, who feel moſt ſenſibly the preſſure of this general grievance, not preſume to complain for the nation, but conſult the nation. And how are they then to conſult the nation, but by bringing the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſocieties, to deliberate and to reſolve? Would you wiſh the people to act unadviſedly. Would you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they ſhould carry petitions to the doors of the Houſe of Commons, without knowing the real ſignification of the import of theſe petitions? Let us apply to our political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct a rule ſure and unerring in private life.—Think; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate before you act. An unequal repreſentation is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral grievance.—Before we ſeek to obtain its redreſs, let us enquire, in the firſt place, if it is generally felt; and in the ſecond, if redreſs is generally wiſhed for. In applying for a general remedy, let us firſt be convinced of the general diſeaſe. Without this, a few factious may preſume to ſpeak for the nation; may impoſe upon the weak, and may plunge the <hi>many</hi> into inextricable confuſion and miſery. The great propoſition, then, which I maintained is, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould conſult together; that they ſhould form themſelves into ſocieties; for it is only by ſo doing that they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct themſelves with wiſdom, and hope for ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The Bill of Rights declared the unalienable, impreſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible right of the people to petition Parliament, and if you condemn me for adviſing the people to petition with reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with united and general deliberation, for redreſs of general grievances, ye tear the record of our liberties, and ſcatter the fragments where they never can be collected.</p>
               <p>In adviſing then, even according to Johnſtone's evidence, the people to inform themſelves, reciprocally to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their information, and then wiſely and deliberately to petition Parliament, you do not condemn me, but you tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon their liberties, and you proſcribe the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I declared, at the meeting of Campſie, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould adopt every mean to inſtruct themſelves with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their political rights, I declare and I inculcate the ſame now before you, and before this great audience.</p>
               <p>Hear farther what Mr. Johnſtone ſays. I have his words accurately in my notes. I adviſed the ſociety to get ALL
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027633_0084_0FD556B79B3B7368"/>
the political pamphlets from a neighbouring bookſeller.—The advice was a right advice. I did not liſt myſelf under the banners of faction. I combated neither for miniſtry nor for oppoſition, for the ins nor for the outs; I fought in the cauſe of truth, and how is that cauſe to be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but by general, complete, and impartial information <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the different arguments, advanced upon either ſide of the great queſtion of Parliamentary Reform? Gentlemen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member who the witneſs is, who brings forward this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth in my favour. It is Alexander Johnſtone, the firſt witneſs adduced by the Proſecutor, againſt whom I objected on account of the expreſſions which he had uſed indicating his intention to ruin me, which by reſpectable witneſſes I offered, inſtantly, to prove, but which proof was not allowed by the Court. When this man ſpeaks what is ſtrongly in my favour, you cannot ſuſpect him; nay more, what he has ſaid, affords a clue to my conduct. Fond of reading myſelf, purchaſing, for information, almoſt every new publication, was it not natural and juſt for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a ſimilar lin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of conduct to men, who, from their union, were enabled to defray the expence? If I had been the tool of party and of factions; if truth had not been my object, I would have ſaid to this ſociety, 'purchaſe not the books which are written againſt Parliamentary Reform; they are merely the productions of penſioned hirelings; but read every treatiſe written in its defence.—Theſe are the productions of enlightened, and of philanthropic men, and they are ſtamped by the ſignature of genius.' You will remember what the witneſs has ſaid upon the interrogatory of the Solicitor General, relative to what I mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King, Lords, and Commons; What was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the witneſs? It was this, that I ſaid, the conſtitution ought to conſiſt of King, Lords, and Commons. Is this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the Monarchy? Is this repreſenting that part of the government as expenſive and cumberſome, as the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſets forth? Is this inflaming the minds of the people, and exciting them to inſurrection and rebellion?</p>
               <p>This witneſs has likewiſe deponed to a remarkable fact. I will ſtate you his words accurately. If I am in error, you will correct me from your notes. <q>In that meeting there
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027633_0085_0FD556B931B9C838"/>
was mention made of Paine's Rights of Man, but not by Mr. Muir. One man in the ſociety, not in a public man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but to his neighbour privately, ſaid; that he had read Paine's Works.</q> What was that to me? And ſuppoſing I had overheard this man uſe theſe words; could I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> blamed for merely poſſeſſing the faculty of hearing? Does Johnſtone ſay, that I participated in this private converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He ſays no ſuch thing. Does he ſwear that I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Paine's Works, or introduced the mention of them in the meeting? No. How then is the other charge in the indictment ſupported by the teſtimony of this witneſs?— of my adviſing the people to read ſeditious books, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating ſuch among them.</p>
               <p>Johnſtone has told you, that moſt of thoſe who compoſed this meeting were weavers, moſtly young men from eighteen to twenty years of age. What is the inference which the Lord Advocate has deduced from this? I bluſh to mention it,— That people, in that ſituation, and at that time of life, have no right to interfere in public affairs! People, in that ſituation! What ſituation? Who compoſe the great maſs of ſociety? Who ſupport the State? Who contribute to its wealth? Who muſt fight in its defence? People at that period of life!—What period? When the heart is uncorrupted; when the ſoil is beſt prepared to receive good ſeed, and when the feelings of the mind can be moſt eaſily led over to the ſide of virtue and humanity. Becauſe the majority of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that ſociety might be weavers, they muſt be held up in deriſion! Becauſe the majority of them might be young men, they muſt be cenſured for preſuming to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt themſelves in the happineſs of that country in which they were to ſpend their future days, and whoſe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to operate upon their future lives! But you have ſeen ſeveral of the members of that ſociety, and thoſe too adduced by the Proſecutor, (Mr. Johnſtone in the number) and did you think them ſo young, ſo frivolous, and ſo ill-taught as he repreſented? This is a matter which regards you, as you were the witneſſes, and you muſt judge for yourſelves. Finally, hear the concluſion of the depoſition of this witneſs, which ſtates, <q>That I recommended peace and regularity to the meeting, and obſerved that any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:027633_0086_0FD556BA98FD4338"/>
or diſorder would ruin their common cauſe;</q> and that I told them, <q>there was no other mode of procuring redreſs, but by applying to parliament;</q> and that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them <q>to beware of admitting any immoral characters as members.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next witneſs adduced for the Proſecutor, is Robert Waddell, vice preſident of the ſociety at Kirkintilloch, who ſwears to the particulars which occurred at the ſame meeting, in which the preceding witneſs was preſent.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In what reſpect does this witneſs criminate me? Does he not agree preciſely with Johnſtone, concerning my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct. I am accuſed of vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ifying the king and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and what does this witneſs ſay? That I made a ſpeech, in which I adviſed regularity in their proceedings; and that they ought to proceed in a conſtitutional manner, as the law now is, by King, Lords, and Commons. The indictment alledges, that I ſpoke and reprobated the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical branch of the conſtitution. But the witneſs ſwears, that I ſaid nothing about the expence of the King, nor the comparitive expence of the French conſtitution, nor the ſucceſs of their arms. Gentlemen, I ſpeak with candour; it is not in my remembrance, that I ſpoke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the comparative excellency of the French or Britiſh constitutions. You hear one witneſs declaring, that I mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared them together; you hear this witneſs declare, that I made no mention of either conſtitution; both of them may have ſpoken truth according to the impreſſion which was on their minds, but they ſhew you the danger of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the memory of witneſſes, when it relates to words ſpoken in the warmth of a public diſcuſſion, and attempted to be recollected after the lapſe of many months. But give whatſoever degree of ſtrength you chuſe to Johnſtone's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, draw from the compariſon, which I inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the French and Britiſh conſtitutions, an inference as highly criminal as you poſſibly can; the teſtimony of that man is completely overthrown by this witneſs. Mr. Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell has ſtated to you what paſſed after the meeting was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in private company, in the unguarded hour, when
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027633_0087_0FD6191FE0EBD370"/>

The converſation related to politics, and to new publications; and ſurely materials of that kind are infinitely more noble in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than thoſe which deform convivial ſociety, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the man. He remembers me ſpeaking of Mr. Flower's boook upon the French conſtitution; a book which the Lord Advocate, although not ſpecified in the libel, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Of the truly reſpectable author of this book, I know nothing; but if, from writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a true idea may be formed of the heart which guides the pen, there is no man that I would more fondly call my friend. It is true, I recommended Mr. Flower there, becauſe I recommended his principles every where. I will do ſo ſtill; I will do ſo in your preſence, in the preſence of the Court, and to this great audience. You, who wiſh for a Reform in Parliament, read and weigh well the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which this good man has given and inculcated. Let perſonal reformation precede public; let the torch, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge lighten the path of liberty; but above all, let ſound morality, and genuine Chriſtianity be the goals from which you commence your political career. A people ignorant— never can enjoy freedom; a people immoral—are unworthy of the bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The witneſs next mentions, that the only book which I recommended to be purchaſed, was Dr. Henry's Hiſtory of England. I am an enemy to the conſtitution,—and yet I recommended to the people the book beſt calculated to inſtruct them in its principles, and in its progreſs; a book, applauded in private and in public by the Earl of Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and upon whoſe application, the author received an honourable penſion from the King; honourable to the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the receiver, and to him who firſt noticed the modeſt merit of the writer.</p>
               <p>The witneſs next proceeds to mention, that at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a perſon of the name of Boyd propoſed, that Paine's Works ſhould be purchaſed and recommended. What was my conduct upon the occaſion? I ſaid, it was foreign to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027633_0088_0FD556BDA32D3BD8"/>
their purpose; and foreign, ſurely, indeed it was. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out approving of Mr. Paine's principles, without condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, I ſhall afterwards more fully ſhew you, that the advice was ſuch as became them and me, in our ſituation at the time.</p>
               <p>The witneſs mentions, that he purchaſed for the Society three or four copies of the Political Progreſs. Does he ſay, that it was at my deſire, or on my recommendation? No.—That he purchaſed for his own uſe, and that of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, three or four copies of the Paiſley Declaration of Rights; that he got a copy of Paine's pamphlet, but knows not from whom; that he never ſaw the Dialogue betwixt the Governors and the Governed, one of the charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in the libel; and that a Mr. William Muir ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a number of the Patriot. In the name of common ſenſe, what connection have I with this extraneous matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How does it tend towards my crimination? The witneſs ſwears poſitively, that the only book which I recommended to be purchaſed by the Society, was Henry's Hiſtory of Britain.</p>
               <p>The witneſs declared, that a more equal repreſentatiion of the people was the object of the Society. Being aſked by the Solicitor General, what he meant by a more equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. He ſtopt for a moment to conſider. O! what matter of triumph was this! Then burſt the contemptuous ſneer; and then with affected ridicule was pointed out, the abſurdity of men ſo ignorant, embarking in the cauſe of reformation, when even their Vice Preſident, the witneſs who from his ſtation, if any had known, he ſhould have been the man. But by all, excepting by Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Richmond, who contended for reformation, no ſpecific plan has yet been propoſed. In all that was ſaid in the late debate in the Houſe of Commons, no ſpecific plan was brought forward. Is it then a matter of ſurpriſe that the witneſs ſtopt for a moment to conſider his anſwer to the queſtion? His anſwer was ſuch as did honour to the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind, and to the foundneſs of his underſtanding, Two opinions, replied he, divided the Society. One was, for confining the right of election to landed property; the other, for extending it to the body of the people; that he;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:027633_0089_0FD556BF389058C0"/>
for his own part, had not yet made up his mind upon either. Being aſked my opinion, he ſwears, I gave none.</p>
               <p>The witneſs depones to my expreſs language, that I ſaid to the meeting, that they would be the more ſucceſsful, the more they were conſtitutional. Is this preaching up ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Is this inflaming the minds of the multitude to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion? With every witneſs adduced againſt me this day, this witneſs likewiſe corroborates my earneſt advices to the people to be regular, to be moderate, and to be moral.</p>
               <p>The next witneſs propoſed to be adduced againſt me was, the Reverend James Lapſlie. My objections to his admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility were ſuſtained, before I advanced upon the threſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of my proof, by the Lord Advocate's giving him up. Sorry am I indeed for the Proſecutor's timely precaution; proof was thickening faſt againſt this gentleman; proof of practices, proof of crimes, which—but I go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the day will come, when this gentlemen and myſelf ſhall exchange ſituations at this bar. I truſt that by your verdict I ſhall be acquitted, and the moment after, I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly pledge myſelf to this nation, to exhibit againſt him a criminal accuſation of the moſt ſerious kind. To ſay more would not be right, as tending to excite a prejudice againſt him in the day of his own trial. It is ſufficient for me, that, even in this ſtage of the buſineſs, after the proof I was leading, my moſt rancorous enemy, would have bluſhed to have brought forward this man's teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The next witneſs was, Henry Freeland, preſident of the ſociety, at Kirkintilloch. The indictment charges me with having convocated the ſocieties at Campſie and at Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intilloch. The witneſs depones, that there was an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having a ſociety at Kirkintilloch, long before ever he ſaw me. Does this witneſs, the firſt preſident of that ſociety who, if any man could, muſt have been well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the circumſtances leading to its formation, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the charge of the libel? Quite the reverſe. I ſhall poſtpone the moſt material part of his depoſition to the laſt. In my ſpeech, he mentions, that I ſpoke about ſhortening the duration of Parliaments and a more equal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that I ſaid, that I thought taxes might be leſſened by theſe means, and that the reform was not to take place as
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:027633_0090_0FD556C0A2783418"/>
to the King and Houſe of Lords, but only of the Commons. Call you this ſedition! Does not every thing brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by theſe witneſſes of the Crown, confute the falſe, the injurious, and the ſcandalous charge in the libel, of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the Conſtitution, and of exciting the people to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the King?</p>
               <p>Mr. Freeland ſaid, that I mentioned the ſucceſs of the French arms, and that liberty would be eſtabliſhed in France. Call you this likewiſe a crime? At the time when I ſpoke was it not true? Were not the armies of France in every part victorious? and could I, not poſſeſſed of the power of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration into the future, be ſure that they were not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their object? Are not opinions, after all that has happened during the laſt months, as much divided as they were then? Can you go into private or into public com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, where this topic forms not the moſt material part of their converſation? If merely to ſpeak upon this ſubject be ſedition, you are all contaminated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Freeland concurs with the other witneſſes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, that I recommended no other book to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than Henry's Hiſtory. That I told them all riot would be ruin to the cauſe; exhorted them to be conſtitutional and regular, and told them, that they were to petition Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that there was no other way of getting a reform.</p>
               <p>I now come to the moſt material part of Mr. Freeland's evidence, which relates to my lending him a copy of Paine's Works. Now let us take his evidence in the connection of time. He tells you, that, having heard that a proclamation was againſt that book, he was upon that account curious to ſee it, and that he <hi>firſt</hi> ſpoke of it to me; that upon Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, eight days before the ſociety met, when I happened to be at Kirkintilloch, in the houſe of Wallace, to which I had ſent for him, that I bid him ſearch in my great coat pocket, and he would find the book; but that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, for the reaſon which he had mentioned, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loan of it from me. He further tells you, that when he firſt ſpoke of that book to me, I ſaid, I thought it had a tendency to miſlead the people; that he was ſurpriſed I did not recommend it, becauſe every body elſe ſpoke well of it, and that I did not approve of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:027633_0091_0FD523C4A41E8178"/>This is Mr. Freeland's depoſition as to what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me, when he received Mr. Paine's Works. But his teſtimony goes farther, and corroborates that in which all the witneſſes are unanimous, concerning what paſſed in the ſociety when that book was mentioned; of its being ſuggeſted by one Boyd, to purchaſe it; but that I ſhook my head, and ſaid it was foreign to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This is the moſt material evidence which the Proſecutor has been able to produce. A wide field is now before us, and that I may deviate as little as poſſible from preciſion, I ſhall arrange what I have to ſay, under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct heads.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, the indictment charges me of feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and wickedly circulating and diſtributing this book, in order to inflame the minds of men againſt the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You are the judges of the law and of the fact. Your deciſion will not ſeparate them from each other, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine them both together. It is neceſſary for me to inform you, that, without a criminal intention, there can be no crime; and has not the indictment itſelf ſet forth, that I did not circulate theſe books merely, but that the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation proceeded from ſuch intention. Now, I aſk you to lay your hands upon your breaſts, and to ſay, where, in the circumſtances of this caſe, is the ſhadow of felonious deſign. The Works of Mr. Paine had been publiſhed and ſold every where. The papers of the day teemed with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive advertiſements, announcing where they were to be procured. What excited this curioſity in the public mind, without uttering a ſingle ſyllable upon the intrinſic merit or demerit of theſe works, is eaſy to tell. The ſituation of France rouſed the attention of Europe. To that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try every eye was turned, and every man who could wield a pen, was employed in diſcuſſing the principles which the Revolution had brought forward. Mr. Burke entered the field of controverſy. The name of that gentleman would give ſale and diffuſion to any production. Mr. Burke fought upon one ſide of the queſtion. He was encountered upon the oppoſite by Thomas Paine. Both of them cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of approved vigour, and of undoubted proweſs. —Could public curioſity not be awakened to the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:027633_0092_0FD556C3E738AA28"/>
of ſuch men? It was ſo moſt completely: and, the Works of Mr. Burke and of Thomas Paine, flew with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity to every corner of the land, hitherto unexampled in the hiſtory of political ſcience. Is there a ſingle man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, who has not read the Works either of Paine or of Burke? Is there a perſon upon the bench, upon the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or in this audience, who has either not purchaſed or lent the Treatiſe upon the Rights of Man! Now, if one of you lent to a friend or relation, who might participate in the common curioſity, a ſingle pamphlet of Mr. Paine's, you are as guilty as I am; but why ſhould I uſe the term guilty? NONE of us are guilty in lending that book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we harboured no evil deſign.</p>
               <p>If there had been a public law of the Kingdom condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that book, the preſumption of ignorance, could not be admitted by its rigid rule. And the mere act of giving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a ſingle copy, would have been conſidered as a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its letter. But, at the period when I lent Mr. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Paine's Works, was the ſentence of reprobation than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered againſt them? No—I then was guilty of offending no exiſting Law. I was not certified of my danger. I was not put upon my guard. Was there a judgment of any court in England or in Scotland againſt this book at that time? No—Then I had no cauſe for alarm; but ſome months before, a proclamation againſt ſeditious writings had been iſſued. A proclamation, gentlemen, is not law. It can declare and it can enforce what the law has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enacted, but it has no legiſlative authority. But was there any mention of Mr. Paine's Works in that procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? None.—What were the conſequences of this proclamation? You know them well.—If there had been a demand before for political books, that demand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in a tenfold proportion. Concerning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular books to which the proclamation might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to allude, curioſity was more highly excited, and converſation became more keenly intereſted. Now, mark the circumſtances, in which Mr. Freeland applied to me for the loan of that book. Here, take notice of his expreſs words, "that having heard a proclamation of the King was uſed againſt it, he was, upon that account, curious to
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:027633_0093_0FD61926292B94D0"/>
ſee it, and firſt ſpoke of it to Mr. Muir." Now I aſk you if any thing like felonious intention in Freeland can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in applying for it to me; a proclamation had been iſſued againſt ſeditious books, and a natural curioſity was excited in him to ſee what theſe books were, which he had heard reported to be ſeditious; a curioſity which, at the time, was common to all. I aſk, if you could ſuppoſe there was a felonious intention in my lending it? Did I introduce the converſation by ſpeaking of it. Did I adviſe him to read it, to adopt its principles, and to contribute his exertions to carry them into practice? No.—He expreſsly tells you, that I did not approve of the book; that I ſaid it had a tendency to miſlead the people, at which he was ſurpriſed, as it was otherwiſe approved by all. To what then reduces itſelf this mighty crime of ſedition for which I ſtand here? To gratify the natural curioſity for a perſon who tells you, he lives in my neighbourhood, and is a diſtant re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ion; I lent a book, which was in univerſal circulation, unnoticed by Courts of Juſtice, uncondemned by law.</p>
               <p>If you have come here this day with an intention to bring me in guilty, whether right or wrong, ſay ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, openly, and let me add, honeſtly. Reſort not to wretched pretexts and expedients to juſtify a ſtretch of power. Theſe pretexts are ſoon ſeen through by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating eye of mankind, and to the guilt attending the determination, will be added the contempt which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text will juſtify.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, I would direct your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to what Mr. Paine's writings are, and to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner in which they are preſented in accuſation, in my trial. I will allow that any writing which calls upon the people to riſe in arms, to reſiſt the law, and to ſubvert the conſtitution is ſomething worſe than ſeditious, that it is treaſonable, but do the writings of Mr. Paine ſtand in that predicament? Can you point me cut a ſingle ſentence where he provokes inſurrection? Mr. Paine's writings are indiſputably of a ſpeculative nature. He inveſtigates the firſt principles of ſociety; he compares different forms of government together; and where he gives the preference, he aſſigns his reaſons for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:027633_0094_0FD556C759E50B28"/>I have neither time, nor inclination to entertain you by diſſertations upon the Liberty of the Preſs. If that liberty is ſickly, the Conſtitution is likewiſe diſeaſed If that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is extinguiſhed, the conſtitution expires. You will aſk, What is the preciſe notion which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffix to the term: Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Preſs? I will tell you honeſtly, and without diſguiſe.—By the Liberty of the Preſs, I mean not the power of aſſaſſinating the reputation, of torturing the feelings of individuals. No crime in my eſtimation can be more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.—By the Liberty of the Preſs, I mean not the power of degrading, and of contaminating the public mind by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of public morals.—By the Liberty of the Preſs, I underſtand not the power of inflaming the minds of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conſtitution, of ſtimulating the people to inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and of tearing down the barriers of public property, and of public ſecurity. Where government is eſtabliſhed, that government muſt be reſpected. And the trueſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, which ever yet exiſted, never could tolerate the internal foe, who, within its own precincts, founded the charge to civil war.—BY THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, I underſtand the INALIENABLE RIGHT OF PUBLISHING TRUTH; of preſenting to the world, whatever may tend to public good, and may not hurt the feelings of individuals, morals, nor eſtabliſhed laws.</p>
               <p>Conſtitutions of government are the workmanſhip of men; that conſtitution is the moſt perfect, which can be moſt eaſily amended. There are conſtitutions, which, ſtep by ſtep, without convulſion, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut blood, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to ſuperior degrees of perfection; which, by their own internal energy, have effected their own reformation, and avoided the calamities of a revolution. Theſe progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive conſtitutions, if I may uſe the expreſſion, muſt always cheriſh and ſupport the liberty of the preſs, as the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of their preſervation. Look back, I beſeech you, to the ancient ſyſtem in France. To you the obſervation may be ſingular, but I am confident in my own mind it is juſt. If, while the veſtiges of their ancient conſtitution ſtill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emained, while the remembrance of the States General was not yet forgotten, the freedom of the preſs had not been annihilated, their conſtitution would have become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive;
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:027633_0095_0FD556C8DA4CF4B8"/>
its reformation would gradually have been ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and by the exertions of good men and of patriotic writers, all the calamities which we now deplore in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution would have been averted. How grateful ſhould we be to eternal providence, that our Conſtitution poſſeſſes in itſelf the power of amendment, that, without a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it can rectify its abuſes; and that, ſilently and without diſorder, it can advance towards that chaſtened liberty, which conſtitutes human felicity. You have read the hiſtory of the Britiſh Conſtitution; and what is it but the hiſtory of a continual progreſs? You will next aſk what has been the impelling cauſe of this progreſs? I anſwer, the right of the univerſal diffuſion of information, by means of the Liberty of the Preſs. If you deſtroy that liberty, you accompliſh one of two things.—The people will be buried in ignorance; the iron throne of deſpotiſm will be erected, and the ſilent—I cannot, will not contemplate the picture. If you deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the Liberty of the Preſs, you may perchance do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, which is horrible to think upon. This high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited and generous people will not ſoon forget their loſt rights. You have removed what led to progreſſive perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Evil will proceed to evil. What originated ſolely from corrupted men, will be imputed to the conſtitution it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. By undermining its beſt prop, its moſt ſolid and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy pillar, I repeat it, and never ſhall ceaſe to repeat it, the liberty of the Preſs, you expoſe this holy fabric to a blow, which will ſhake it from its foundations. Let us then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this argument to the caſe of Mr. Paine. This work is merely of a ſpeculative nature, upon the principles of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If Mr. Paine's Work is, inconſiſtent with the Britiſh Conſtitution, what is the conſequence? If the book is written with ingenuity, it will acquire readers. No man in his ſound ſenſes, the keeneſt advocate for a Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Reform, but will avert his eyes, bathed in tears, and in horror of ſoul, from a revolution. He will compare the principles of Mr. Paine with the Conſtitution. If Mr. Paine has pointed out any thing defective in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will contribute his humble efforts to have that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect repaired. If, upon the other hand, he ſhall imagine, that Mr. Paine has taken an erroneous view of this ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:027633_0096_0FD556CD0A4643A8"/>
has miſrepreſented its properties, he will become more and more ſenſible, from his inquiry, of the ſecurity which he enjoys under its protecting roof. The ſenſe of danger will be removed, and his mind, undiſturbed by gloomy appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, will enjoy tranquility. O! how little do ye deem the Britiſh Conſtitution, who think that it is built upon the ſand, which when the rain deſcendeth, and the floods cometh, and the winds blow, and beat upon it, that it ſhall fail. No—when the rains deſcend, when the floods come, when the winds blow, it ſhall not fall, for it is founded upon a rock. I then maintain, although not in accents ſweet to the ear of corruption, grateful to courtly pride, nor acceptable to ill-got power, that thoſe ſpeculative wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who inveſtigate the principles of our Conſtitution, who compare that Conſtitution with thoſe of other countries, perform a meritorious ſervice to this nation: theſe writers either impel us to rectify that which is wrong, or more ſtrongly confirm us in our love and in our attachment to that which is right. Let Mr. Paine then be conſidered as the bittereſt enemy to our Conſtitution, yet as long as he confines himſelf to ſpeculation, we ſhould be grateful. Our beſt intereſts are involved in the Conſtitution, and like thoſe ſtill of a higher claſs, ſuperior to time, and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to eternity, are too apt to be forgotten, and to make little impreſſion. If Mr. Paine then has called our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Conſtitution, he has performed to us an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſervice, he has led us to contemplate all its perfection, and rouſed us from our lethargy to rectify wherever, by time and by corruption, it may have ſuffered decay.</p>
               <p>Shall the lending of a ſingle copy of the works of this writer be held criminal? When was there ever ſuch a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the rights of Britons? Mr. Paine has compoſed no model of a perfect commonwealth, as Mr. Hume has done; yet, the political works of Mr. Hume, you have all read, and you have all applauded. If you condemn a man for lending Mr. Paine's Works, you do what even was not attempted to be done in the reign of Henry the VIII, when the Conſtitution lay expiring on the rack of deſpotiſm, making exertions, which only could diſcover re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining life, but at the ſame time the privation of ſtrength.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:027633_0097_0FD556CE19B826F8"/>
Along with equality of political rights, has Mr. Paine preached equality of property? a chimera which may enter into the brains of thoſe, who may dream of a golden age, but who know not human nature. Yet, under that arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reign, did not Sir Thomas M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re, enjoying the confidence of the King, and placed at the head of the law, publiſh his Utopia, the plan of his republic, of which an equal divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of property, an Agrarian law, an univerſal community, formed the baſis. In this enlightened age, when, after ſo many fiery trials, our conſtitution, in its pure and genuine principles, ſtands unveiled to our view, will you condemn a man for lending a work, equally ſpeculative, and if ſuch a thing exiſted, as a well founded panic againſt levellers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more dangerous.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be the laſt man to propoſe to your imitation, the conduct of deſpots; but I call upon you to ponder well the words of a man, who rendered the terms republic and pure and undefined deſpotiſm the ſame; Cromwell. Under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorſhip, when Harrington publiſhed his Oceana; inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers denounced the work. "My cauſe is too ſtrong." ſaid Cromwell, "to be hurt by paper ſhot;" and if you ſay that, by any publication, the Britiſh conſtitution can be injured, you yourſelves are guilty of the crime of libelling its ſtrength.</p>
               <p>To conclude upon this head, I maintain, that to ſuppreſs works purely ſpeculative, provoking not the people to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the laws, nor to rebellion, however much theſe works may differ from the conſtitution, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Liberty of the Preſs, to trample upon the beſt and the ſureſt bulwark, which defends the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to that reſpected building. If, to lend the Works of Thomas Paine to-day be ſedition, to lend a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the republic of Plato to-morrow will be treaſon. Gentlemen, the Works of Mr. Paine are lying before me. I could read to you many paſſages to prove, that they are merely of a ſpeculative nature. You are exhauſted; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſo am I. And yet, we have ſome length of field before we conlude to travel over. For theſe paſſages I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="unknown:027633_0098_0FD556CFE34B7238"/>
truſt that you will now be perſuaded, that neither the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing nor the lending of a ſpeculative political book is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But I now call your attention to another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the manner in which criminality is attached to that book and to myſelf. Various detached paſſages are quoted from it in the indictment. They are called wicked, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory and ſeditious. In the ſacred name of juſtice, will you condemn any book for detached paſſages, ſeparated from the whole connection, cut off from reciprocal explanation, and from which neither its general tenor nor ſcope can be diſcovered. If you do this, where is the book in which you cannot diſcover ſedition, by diſſecting its ſeparate ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and paragraphs. For my part, if you proceed on in this manner, I do not know a more dangerous collection than the books of holy inſpiration. Separate verſe from verſe, and then combine them, according to your pleaſure, and you may make the Bible one of the moſt ſeditious and treaſonable books which ever was written. But you are neither to condemn that book, nor me, for thoſe detached paſſages exhibited in the indictment. You muſt carry along with you the whole works of Mr. Paine, you muſt ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize line by line, and you muſt pronounce upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral context. If you find it provoking the people to reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, calling them forth to arms, to ſubvert the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then, no doubt, it is ſeditious. But, if you find the author indulging himſelf in nothing but philoſophical and political ſpeculation, however much your principles and his may differ, you cannot condemn him for compoſing it, or me, after it was compoſed and publiſhed, for lending it to a relation.</p>
               <p>If you condemn books for being ſeditious, upon account of paſſages culled from this page and from that page, and artfully combined together, you have it in your power to award a proſcription againſt books and univerſal literature. As I have already mentioned, there is not a ſingle book, in which, by diſſecting it in this manner, ſentence by ſentence, and paſſage by paſſage, you may not diſcover immorality, blaſphemy, and treaſon. Indeed, if the ſad objects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection which preſent themſelves to my mind, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the ſtate of my country, could permit me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge

If the Proſecutor has a right to preſume, that it was upon account of theſe paſſages I lent theſe writings, I too have a right to draw a contrary preſumption in my favour. If there are ſentiments in the Works of Mr. Paine, (and many ſuch there are) fraught with univerſal benevolence, inculcating univerſal amity and brotherhood, and of a tendency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thoſe paſſions and thoſe prejudices, which animate and impel nation againſt nation into the field of blood and of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, I am entitled to plead upon theſe paſſages: I have a right to ſay, that it was the antidote and not the poiſon I recommended; And you muſt know, that the law of this country obliges you, where oppoſing preſumptions are of equal ſtrength, to let the balance preponderate on the ſide of mercy.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall conclude upon the ſubject of Mr. Paine's Works by obſerving, That all the witneſſes have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly ſworn, that I refuſed to recommend them; that when the matter was propoſed, I ſaid, the principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them might miſlead the people, as they were fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the object of the ſociety, and might miſguide weak minds. There is not a witneſs adduced by the Proſecutor, who ſays the contrary of this; and will you agree in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the charge in my indictment of circulating and recommending theſe books, has the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lighteſt ſhadow of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? I will tell you the reaſon why I did not recommend Mr. Paine's books to the ſocieties Scotland, and why I declared them foreign to their purpoſe—Mr. Paine is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican, and the ſpirit of republicanis;m breathes through
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:027633_0100_0FD55707DB9EF410"/>
all his writings. This is his darling ſyſtem. The object of theſe ſocieties was, by conſtitutional means, to procure a reformation in the conſtitution, and not a revolution, which implied its deſtruction; to have their long loſt rights reſtored, but not the aſſumption of new rights derived from a different ſyſtem. The people of Scotland were rapidly advancing to a true ſenſe of their conſtitutional liberties: They demanded an application to them of the conſtitution, in its genuine principles, in which they beheld their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity confirmed, and their happineſs eſtabliſhed. That they might advance with more ardour in this cauſe, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould know the conſtitution; what it had been in its vigour, and what it now is in its decay, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the corruption of men and of ages. What did I do to effectuate this legal and peaceable object? I did not preſent to them the ſplendid fabrics of ancient or of modern republics; I wiſhed them to keep their eyes confined at home, to repair their own manſion rather than pull it down, and expoſe themſelves to the inconveniencies and to the dangers of building upon new plans, the advantages or diſadvantages of which could be only known by the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain experience of future ages. All the witneſſes who ſpeak of my conduct in the ſocieties tell you, that I recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none but cunſtitutional meaſures; and that the only book which I recommended to them was Henry's Hiſtory of England, as the beſt calculated, by its accuracy and plainneſs, to give them inſight into the nature and progreſs of their conſtitution.</p>
               <p>If, in my library, in converſation upon the ſubject of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the plans adopted by different political writers had been diſcuſſed, doubtleſs, I might have given opinions different from thoſe which I conſidered it my duty to advance when acting under an eſtabliſhed conſtitution, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe meaſures, which it pointed out, to effectuate a redreſs of grievances. When Mr. Hume publiſhed his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay upon a Perfect Commonwealth, did not he, as ſtrongly as he poſſibly could, declare that he thought this model preferable to the Britiſh conſtitution, even in its pureſt and beſt principles? But ſuppoſing Mr. Hume to have been a member of the Society of the Friends of the People, what
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:027633_0101_0FD523CE371ACBD8"/>
would have been his conduct in it? Would he have ſaid to men who were aſſembled to renovate conſtitutional rights only, You muſt give up the conſtitution entirely; it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and imperfect when compared to the offspring of my fancy; it is this laſt which you muſt adopt, and reject the former. But Mr. Hume would have held forth no ſuch language; he would have ſaid to them, 'The grievances of which you complain can be redreſſed by the energy of our own conſtitution; the redreſs of theſe grievances is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object of your aſſociation. If then reformation is your object, and not revolution, however much you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of my ſpeculative ſyſtem, it muſt not operate upon you for a moment in practice.'</p>
               <p>It was upon this principle that I refuſed to recommend the Works of Mr. Paine; that I ſaid, that they were foreign to the purpoſe, and might miſlead weak minds. But was it ever before held criminal in an author, to publiſh what ſpeculative ſyſtems of government he pleaſed, provided he confined himſelf in the retirement of ſpeculation, and did not advance forth to the field of action? Was it a crime of Plato, under the Athenian republic, to compoſe his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſyſtem, of one more perfect? Was it high treaſon in Cicero, under the Roman Commonwealth, to write thoſe applauded works, which have been loſt in the darkneſs of the Gothic night, and of which, a few fragments could be found only, when the morning of letters began to dawn upon Europe? Was Sir Thomas More led forth to the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold for compoſing his Utopia, Harrington proſcribed for his Oceana, or Hume exiled for his Commonwealth? Theſe authors indulged themſelves in a liberty, which, if we now are to be deprived of, we muſt be left hopeleſs, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, as the attempt at amendment and reformation will be for ever precluded.</p>
               <p>Upon the principle which I have explained, I ſhould have thought it equally, if not more dangerous uad inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to have recommended in a Society of the Friends of the People, Plato's Republic, or Hume's Commonwealth. Inexpedient! becauſe theſe writings might have had a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to lead theſe ſocieties from their conſtitutional object; dangerous becauſe, if preſented to weak underſtandings,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:027633_0102_0FD523DE05B7AF20"/>
and to fervid imaginations, they might have influenced them to depart from thoſe ends, which, by calmneſs, perſeverance, and legal meaſures, they were ſure at laſt to accompliſh, in purſuit of chimeras, brilliant but deluſive, always ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaching, but always in reality flying farther away.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I conclude my obſervations upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Mr. Paine's Works. You will remember it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſingle copy which I lent; the circumſtances attending it, which, admitting the book to be as ſeditious and as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as can be imagined, precluded the idea of a felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious circulation. You are the firſt Jury in Scotland, before whom Mr. Paine was either directly or indirectly brought; I truſt, that you will act in ſuch a manner as to do honour to yourſelves, in doing juſtice to him and to me; that you will not attempt to annihilate political ſcience, by condemning a work in its nature purely ſpeculative; that, in this country where our chief glory has ariſen from literature, you will not limit her reſearches, but indulge her in her unbounded flight, into every region where the materials of human happineſs and human improvement can be collected. Above all I entreat you, that you would not ſet the dangerous precedent of condemning a book, for ſentences detached from the whole, when you do not conſider the general tenor and ſcope. I tell you that if you do not carry away this book from your table to your chamber, read every line, and compare the whole in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, you do me moſt flagrant injuſtice. <hi>Finally,</hi> I muſt tell you, that you are not bound by what any Jury has done in England—you are bound by the Law of Scotland; and this is the firſt trial of the kind which ever occurred here:—Even the deciſions in England have loſt the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect due to them, although they were to be held out as precedents. We have ſeen Juries one day condemning the author and the publiſhers, and upon the ſucceeding day we have heard other Juries pronounce a verdict of acquittal.</p>
               <p>The next witneſs is Anne Fiſher, a late ſervant in my father's houſe. Her evidence comes forward to you with peculiar diſtinction; careſſed by the Proſecutor, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented by the Court;—her wonderful accuracy extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and her abilities admired. I will ſoon ſhew you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:027633_0103_0FD52467FAC30B88"/>
that ſhe has but few pretenſions to that accuracy, of which the Lord Advocate ſpoke in ſuch terms;—that her memory poſſeſſes a ſingular quality, retentive to whatever may militate againſt me, but heſitating and confuſed to whatever may ſeem in my favour What this domeſtic and well inſtructed ſpy has given in evidence againſt me, fills my mind with little concern; on the contrary it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords me much ſatisfaction to find that when I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded in the place where I expected moſt ſecurity,— where all ſuſpicion was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lled aſleep, my conduct was ſo guarded.—What do I ſay?—Guarded! Innocence has no need to be on the watch.</p>
               <p>My conduct has been ſuch, as even malice itſelf cannot condemn. But before I proceed to read her evidence from my notes, let me ſolemnly caution you againſt the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous precedent of giving credibility to witneſſes of this kind, under accuſations of this nature. The crime of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if you attend to its eſſence, never can be committed within the walls of a private houſe. It ſuppoſes the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt publicity, the convocation of many. But if power ſhall ſay, that words ſpoken in an unguarded moment within the ſacred walls of a family, amount to this crime, What will follow? Not <hi>thoſe</hi> with whom you may have acted in your political life, and who, with the impreſſion of the oath of God upon them, can beſt tell the truth; not <hi>thoſe</hi> whom you may have admitted to your friendſhip, and to your confidence, and who beſt know the ſecrets of your ſoul; but the meaneſt of your domeſtics, who could hardly approach your preſence even in their menial duties, who, (if the expreſſion may be uſed) to the members of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are almoſt unknown;—Theſe! Theſe! The meaneſt and the loweſt—will be brought forward to ſwear away your property, your reputation, and your life: And ſuch is this witneſs, who is adduced againſt me with ſuch parade. O! Beware how ye ſanctify the ſhameful proceeding. It is not me you wound alone, but you deſtroy the confidence which ſubſiſts between man and man; you lead, by your own hands, to the fire-ſides of your children and your deareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the fiends of ſuſpicion and of danger; and ye forever
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:027633_0104_0FD556D3741E1638"/>
put an end to that reciprocity of communication, which enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and endears domeſtic ſociety.</p>
               <p>Now let us hear what this witneſs has to ſay? I will read you from my notes, her evidence. If I have erred in taking it down, you will pleaſe correct me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Here Mr. Muir read from his notes, the evidence of Anne Fiſher.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The teſtimony of this witneſs ſeems to relate to two of the principal charges in the indictment; the firſt, to my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made ſpeeches in public ſocieties, vilifying the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd conſtitution. The ſecond, to my having diſtributed and recommended ſeditious books, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. Paine, the Patriot, the Paiſley Declaration, and the Dialogue between the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and the Governed. Under theſe two different arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, let us examine the teſtimony of this witneſs. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To my making ſeditious ſpeeches; <hi>Secondly,</hi> To my circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ſeditious books.</p>
               <p>Every thing which the Proſecutor could adduce againſt me, he has told you that he would adduce under the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of the term Sedition, even although it ſhould not be ſpecified in the libel. The Court likewiſe has permitted him ſo to do; and in the caſe of this witneſs, you can ſee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary illuſtration of this right, if it can be ſo called. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of making ſeditious harangues in public, this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed girl is adduced to ſwear to what ſhe ſays, ſhe may have heard in private, when inſtructed to take her watch, ſhe ſtood and marked to deſtruction thoſe who fed her.</p>
               <p>And what is the dreadful language ſhe has heard me uſe in my unguarded moments. I will repeat an that ſhe ſays, I will recall to your remembrance her expreſs words, and upon them I will make no comment. <q>That if every body had a vote, I would be made member for Calder;—that members of Parliament would have thirty or forty ſhillings a-day, and that, in that caſe, there would be none but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men to keep the conſtitution clear.</q> You remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how the Public Proſecutor enlarged and expatiated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words of this witneſs. Now, after labouring ſo long in vain, he fancied, he had got ſomething againſt me. I ſmiled at the indecency of his exultation; but next moment I bluſhed when I reflected he was a lawyer,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:027633_0105_0FD619F4B4C1E3D0"/>
and chief Council in Scotland for the Crown. Here ſaid the Proſecutor, "you ſee the cloven foot.—You ſee French principles manifeſted. Here you diſcover the whole tincture of his ſoul. Members of Parliament to have thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings a-day for their attendance—to be honeſt men and, to keep the conſtitution clear! Is not this evidence, that he means to introduce in place of our Houſe of Commons a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Convention, on French principles, and according to French forms"</p>
               <p>Sorry am I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o record the ignorance of this Lord Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Scotland. Is there a man who has hardly opened the volume of the hiſtory of our conſtitution, who does not know, that until a very late period indeed, when corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion glided in, and tainted and poiſoned the whole, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament received their wages from the hands of the people alone: O! how I ſpeak it with joy when I view the paſt; with ſorrow, when I contemplate the preſent; they would have ſcorned to have received the price of their attendance from any other hands, than from the hands of the people. Then the conſtitution poſſeſſed all its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergies. Then toward the conſtitution in the ſtrength of age, but with the bloom of youth. The people delegated none, but men whoſe virtues they knew, and none but men who poſſeſſed public virtues could be found to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the important miſſion. Look back I entreat you to all the great and good men whom Engliſh Hiſtory records. Turn your eyes to the Hampdens, to the Sidneys, to the Marville's of former times; to thoſe men whom—but I ſtop; they received their wages directly from the people. Let the Lord Advocate pronounce their eulogium by his invective. If what I have ſaid be ſedition, when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard by that ſpy Fiſher, I ſhall next moment render my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf infinitely more criminal; for I declare to you, that we never can expect a virtuous Houſe of Commons a <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Houſe of Commons, a Houſe of Commons, ſuch as it once was, connected with no other intereſt than the intereſt of the people; until ſuch time as its members ſhall receive a compenſation for their attendance from the people and from no other quarter, be entitled to no other reward than the approbation of their own minds, and the applauſes of
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:027633_0106_0FD556D71F8EBC40"/>
their fellow-citizens, of whoſe rights, and of whoſe liberties, they have been the undaunted, uncorrupted defenders.</p>
               <p>Fiſher proceeds to ſtate, that ſhe has heard me ſay, That France was the moſt flouriſhing nation in the world, as they had aboliſhed tyranny, and got a free government; And that, further, ſe has heard me ſay, that the Conſtitution or this country was very good; but that many abuſes had crept in, which required a thorough Reform.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, even in my moſt unguarded hours, this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſpy cannot, by her evidence, ſupport a tittle of the indictment, where it charges me with vilifying the King and Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Of her idle ſtory of what I ſaid concerning Courts of Juſtice, that they need a reform, and that this Court in particular got their money for nothing, but pronouncing ſentence of death upon poor creatures; and that their parade in coming into Glaſgow was uſeleſs, I diſdain to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Only, you will diſcover her exquiſite art. This day, I am tried before this very Court, and ſhe ſuppoſes, that, by inventing and throwing in a circumſtance of this kind, in order to irritate the judges againſt me, ſhe will more completely execute the wretched job ſhe has undertaken to perform. Were there not more ſervants in the houſe, who had infinitely better opportunities to hear my converſation; and muſt ſhe, the loweſt of them all, with whom ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend I had ever two minutes converſation, be ſingled out, and pitched upon for this drudgery?</p>
               <p>This witneſs depones, that ſhe heard me ſay, a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can form of government was the beſt, but a monarchical form of government, under proper reſtrictions, would be the beſt in this country. With all her art, and with all her memory, ſhe cannot depone to a ſingle circumſtance which can ſtrike againſt me. Even from her own account of my private converſation, it appears, that when I ſpoke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican forms of government, it was purely in the abſtract, without any alluſion to this country, without expreſſing any wiſh to ſee any particular mode of them introduced; and that when I ſpoke of this country, I never deviated from the conſtitution, but ſaid that a limited monarchy, under reſtrictions, was the beſt adapted to its intereſt.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:027633_0107_0FD556D96C118268"/>The next article of ſedition to which ſhe depones, is of the moſt extraordinary kind, that I had ſent her to employ an organiſt on the ſtreets of Glaſgow, to play the French tune of <hi>Ca Ira.</hi> What! was a tune, unintelligible to the multitude, to light up the flames of civil diſcord, and to be the forerunner of the revolution? Have you read the words of that popular ſong? Could you diſcover a ſingle alluſion in them to the ſtate of England? But ſuppoſing you did, there is a preſumption from your ſtation in life, that you are acquainted with the French language; but is it ſo with the multitude of our weavers in that quarter of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Britain has always cheriſhed freedom, and ſhall it be deemed criminal in me to liſten to the effuſions of joy, poured out by a neighbouring people, on obtaining that firſt of human bleſſings, which always conſtituted our peculiar diſtinction? But I know it well. The word <hi>Freedom</hi> is ſoon to be proſcribed from our language; it carries alarm and ſedition in the ſound. If I had cauſed to be recited one of thoſe noble choruſes of the Grecian drama, in which, with the enthuſiaſm of liberty, the glories of the Republics of Athens or of Sparta were diſplayed, in language more than mortal, my offence would have been deemed the ſame with that of amuſing myſelf, by hearing the national ſong of France. If it had been poſſible for me to have cauſed to be ſung, upon the Streets of Glaſgow, one of the Pſalms of the Hebrews, in the original language, in which the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of the people and the deſtruction of tyrants are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in a ſtrain of the higheſt poetical inſpiration, the criminality would have been the ſame with that of liſtening to <hi>ca ira.</hi>

               <p>Let me abandon the ſubject. My political career has neither been obſcure nor inglorious. It has undergone the ſevereſt ſcrutiny which ever fell to the lot of man; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every engine has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Let us next attend to the evidence of Fiſher, as far as it relates to ſeditious publications. She ſwears that I uſed
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:027633_0108_0FD619FCFA0B92C8"/>
to recommend to a great many country people who came to my father's ſhop to purchaſe and to read the works of Mr. Paine, as they compoſed a very good book. How can you believe the general averment? In the number of country people, ſhe can only ſpecify one; John Barclay, and when you come to his evidence, you will ſee that he gives her the flatteſt contradiction. She depones, that ſhe has bought, at two different times, for my uncle Alexander Muir, at my deſire, a copy of the firſt part, and a copy of the ſecond part of the Rights of Man. Can you ſuppoſe, that if my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions had been felonious, I would have introduced ſuch writings into my own family? Can you imagine that I could have wiſhed to involve, in the conflagration of my country, my neareſt relations to whoſe property I may eventually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed? Why is not Alexander Muir brought forward as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Certain it is, that he was cloſely interrogated, before the inquiſition held by Mr. Sheriff Honeyman. But the Lord Advocate ſays, that his feelings would not permit him to examine the uncle againſt the nephew. Wonderful huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! Goodneſs ever to be remembered and extolled! But did not you, Sir, adviſe and direct the whole proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and will you have the effrontery to maintain that Alexander Muir was not dragged like a felon from his own home, by the myrmidons of power, carried before your friend Honeyman, and that every art was employed to wring from him every domeſtic ſecret?</p>
               <p>Speak then to us of your humanity—continue to ſpeak to us of your feelings!</p>
               <p>Fiſher next depones, that I much preſſed John Muir to purchaſe Paine's works, that he was prevailed upon, and that ſhe was ſent accordingly to purchaſe them. Now you will hear the evidence of this man, immediately in expreſs contradiction to this witneſs. She next tells you, that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed another domeſtic, Wilſon my hair dreſſer, to purchaſe Paine's works and keep them in his ſhop, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the people, and you will hear Wilſon immediately expreſs himſelf far otherwiſe.

               <p>Gentlemen, the witneſs next ſwears to a fact which muſt rouſe, as having domeſtics yourſelves, your keeneſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Vigilant has this family ſpy been in the courſe of her duty. She tells you what books ſhe has ſeen lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my table.

If they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, as you have heard mine is, there is no crime in the whole catalogue, of which, by the teſtimony of your own ſervants, you may not be found guilty.

Well do I congratulate the Lord Advocate of Scotland.—He has diſcovered a new region in the ſphere of criminality.—He will not merely confine himſelf to a voyage of diſcovery; But, along with his aſſociates, he will make many voyages to this fertile land, and return home, loaded with many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable cargoes. But ſeriouſneſs becomes this place. Can it be believed, that in the cloſe of the eighteenth century, that this night the ſervants of a man ſhould be examined concerning what particular books he may have had in his houſe; and that the proof of the poſſeſſion of particular books may ruin his reputation; ſweep away his property; and deprive him of his life!</p>
               <p>Let us proceed with this witneſs. If you poſſeſs the common feelings of men, every ſentiment of indignation
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:027633_0110_0FD556DD80716740"/>
muſt be excited, not againſt her—ſhe is to be pitied—her taſk has been a dreadful one;—but againſt the manner in which the crime of ſedition has been attempted to be proved.</p>
               <p>The libel charges me with feloniouſly circulating a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue betwixt the Governors and the Governed, extracted from the ruins of Volney. This dialogue is narrated in the indictment, and it is charged to be felonious and ſeditious. There is not a word in this dialogue which is not true. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! in colours but too faithful, it delineates the mournful hiſtory of ſix thouſand years;—the crimes of deſpots, and the artifices of impoſtors, to ſubjugate, and to blind the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is purely abſtracted. It is entirely ſpeculative. To no particular nation, much leſs to England, does it allude; if to any, it muſt be to France, under the ancient ſyſtem. Yet, this dialogue is libelled as ſeditious and inflammatory. The truth is, the crime of ſedition <hi>muſt</hi> be brought home againſt me; and the poſſeſſion of any book, as well as that of Volney, muſt be employed to ſubſtantiate it. Let us hear what the witneſs ſays concerning the felonious circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She heard me read it in the preſence of my mother, ſiſter, and ſome other people; that I ſaid it was very clever, and done by <hi>Velnew,</hi> one of the firſt wits in France. Who were thoſe other people who were in company with my mother and ſiſter when I read it? Her accuracy, ſo much extolled by the Court, totally fails her. But the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſedition muſt not be confined to a mother and a ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it muſt have a wider range;—<hi>other people preſent!</hi> and founding upon his beloved <hi>generality,</hi> the proſecutor has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to argue, there might have been a full company, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous meeting—nay,—an immenſe congregation.</p>
               <p>You have heard the teſtimony of Fiſher, and theſe are the arts; and of this claſs are the witneſſes by which I am to fall. By receiving ſuch teſtimony, you forever deſtroy domeſtic ſociety; you blaſt the bloſſoms of family confidence; you tender ALL ſuſpicious of ALL; each relation, to behold in each, a deadly foe.—And is it not ſufficient to weep over public calamities, that wide-ſpreading deſolation which, <hi>at preſent,</hi> paſſes over the nations; but when we retire to our own homes, we muſt be obliged to confine ourſelves in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:027633_0111_0FD556DF5B9F3678"/>
ſolitude, guarded by ſuſpicion and by danger, where no kindred affections can enter, and where no reciprocal conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation can be admitted.</p>
               <p>I haſten over the evidence of the remaining witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. I am overcome by the exertions of this day; and you muſt be greatly exhauſted.</p>
               <p>The next is the evidence of Thomas Wilſon, my hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer, and he is brought to bring up the rear of Fiſher's teſtimony. He depones, That I aſked him if he had bought Paine's Works, and that I adviſed him to get a copy of them, as a barber's ſhop was a good place to read in. Does this confirm the teſtimony of Fiſher, who ſays, I deſired him to buy that Work, and to keep it in his ſhop, in order to enlighten the people. Mark the art of Fiſher. How ſtrongly ſhe paints what might ſeem to ſtrike againſt me.—<hi>To enlighten the people!</hi> But does Wilſon concur in this? No.—Wilſon!—the perſon who ſhould have beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered—the perſon to whom the words were addreſſed.</p>
               <p>Wilſon tells you, that he bought a copy of the Addreſs to the Addreſſers; but that was not by my advice. He even recollects the <hi>levity</hi> of converſation. An old man, from the country, came in while he was dreſſing me; he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers me ſaying, that this old man was a great reformer. If I ever ſaid ſo, I wiſh it may not have been in jeſt, but in earneſt; and that the fact, with regard to the man, was true. For I know of none who ſhould be greater reformers, of themſelves and of others, than thoſe who are ſtanding on the brink of the grave, and panting upon eternity. But I am afraid that this witneſs remembers only a piece of unmeaning gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. For he adds, the old man ſaid I was only <hi>taunting him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The concluſion of the evidence of Wilſon, affords me high conſolation. It is a proof of the innocency of my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, in moments when I could not poſſibly think of the affectation of integrity. He ſwears, that he has always heard me ſay, that I would maintain the Conſtitution; and that I wiſhed for peace, and good order, and good morals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people; and that he never heard me ſpeak againſt the King.</p>
               <p>The next teſtimony is that of John Muir. He tells you that he had a converſation with me in September laſt, about
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:027633_0112_0FD556E0DDF4BB50"/>
Paine's book, in my father's houſe; that he aſked the loan of it from me; that I told him I had it not. Does this reſemble the conduct of a man accuſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing theſe books to all and ſundry, and ſcattering them over every portion of the land? He ſays, I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I would ſend a ſervant who would get it for him; that a ſervant girl accordingly went and got it. Does not this completely confute the teſtimony of Fiſher, who affirms, that I much preſſed this man to buy the book? and, he tells you, that he himſelf aſked the loan of it.</p>
               <p>Is not this a complete contradiction of her teſtimony?</p>
               <p>The next witneſs is John Barclay. That old and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſon, whom you ſaw adduced as a witneſs by the Proſecutor; and what does he ſay in his teſtimony? That we were elders in the ſame pariſh; the pariſh of Calder, in which the lands of my father are ſituated. He informs you that at the laſt election of a miniſter for that pariſh, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute had ariſen, concerning the right of election, and that he voted upon the ſame ſide of the queſtion with myſelf. This introduced acquaintance, and acquaintance produced friendſhip. The Lord Advocate, in ſpeaking of this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and venerable old man, exclaimed with inſolent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Such men as <hi>theſe</hi> are the companions, and ſuch men as <hi>theſe</hi> are the friends of Mr. Muir! Yes, I tell the Lord Advocate, I tell the ariſtocracy of Scotland, I glory more in the friendſhip of ſuch an old, poor, and virtuous man, than in the friendſhip of the higheſt titled peer, who derives the ſources of his guilty grandeur from the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the people; who wrings out a ſplendid, but a miſerable revenue from their ſorrow and diſtreſs, from their tears, and from their blood, which he ſquanders in diſſipation, to the ruin of private virtue, and to the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of public morals.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee then what Mr. Barclay ſays againſt me. That he aſked my opinion concerning Paine's books; and that I told him he might purchaſe them if he choſe, as they were printed: but that I afterwards ſaid, it was not a book for us. Does Mr. Barclay's evidence ſupport the criminal charge in the libel, of my adviſing people to read ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous books, and of my circulating them over the country?
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:027633_0113_0FD556E380305ED0"/>

                  </gap>te the teſtimony of every other witneſs? That for the reaſons which I ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained, I never recommended, Mr. Paine's works; but that even when that work excited the greateſt attention of the country; when mention of it was introduced into every company, and into every converſation, I uniformly expreſſed myſelf, that it was not a book for our purpoſe.—<hi>For our purpoſe,</hi> who were engaged in the cauſe of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary and conſtitutional Reform! Is there a ſingle witneſs brought forward by the Proſecutor, who has, in the ſmalleſt degree, ſtated any converſation of mine which was unconſtitutional? Hear what Mr. Barclay ſays, that he was frequently with Mr. Muir, and in his library, from which he borrowed ſome books; that he had many conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations with him, and heard him ſay, that the conſtitution of this country was an excellent one; that he praiſed the King; and that he always ſpoke of order, regularity, and obedience to the ruling powers. In ſhort, Gentlemen, all and each of the witneſſes for the Proſecutor, uſe the ſame u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform language, atteſt that neither in public nor in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ever a ſingle expreſſion dropped from me, which the moſt <hi>violent aſſociator</hi> could conſtrue into guilt.</p>
               <p>The laſt witneſs of whom I ſhall take notice, is William Muir; the perſon whoſe religious principles at firſt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him rather to ſuffer, according to the elegant expreſſion of the Lord Advocate, <hi>eternal</hi> impriſonment than to take the oath, until his ſcruples were removed by the Rev.

From theſe numbers of the Patriot ſeveral paſſages are quoted in the indictment. Of the Political Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs there is no mention made; and, I maintain, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſage in the Patriot, quoted in the libel, is highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional. The ſentiments advanced in them may not found muſically ſweet to the ears of corruption. They call upon you to ariſe and vindicate the purity of your conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. To vindicate your long loſt rights; and, if my fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voice could extend to the remoteſt corners of Scotland, I ſhould reſound the ſame ſentiment, in the ſame language. Theſe numbers of the Patriot ſpeak to you concerning ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennial
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:027633_0114_0FD619C6E56C3340"/>
Parliaments. And, I ſay to you, that the act which converted triennial Parliaments into ſeptennial, violated our holy conſtitution; tore the chartar of our national li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and paved the way for the inroads of a frightful deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm.</p>
               <p>But this witneſe concurs with all the preceding witneſſes, with regard to my conduct, and to my principles. He ſwears, That he does not remember to have heard me ſpeak againſt government; that I did not adviſe unconſtitutional meaſures; and that he heard me tell, how Old Sarum was repreſented. Old Sarum repreſented! And, do not the friends of the Conſtitution weep! and do not the enemies of the Conſtitution ſmile, when they hear of ſuch repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Before I ſpeak to the third article of accuſation, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Convention, the Addreſs of the Society of Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iriſhmen of Dublin, permit me to make one obſervation on the manner in which the Proſecutor ſpoke of the papers found in my cuſtody. Do they correſpond with the view which he repreſented of them? Are they the documents of correſpondence with foreign or internal foes? And, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I had involved myſelf in a correſpondence of that nature, do you believe I could be ſo infatuated as to retain, in my poſſeſſion, that which muſt have been attended with, to me, certain deſtruction. Among my papers, there is not one which can be conſtrued into guilt. They conſiſt of pamphlets unconnected with the politics of the day; and of the various publications of a ſociety, pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted in its principles, of which I have the honour to be a member. But every thing muſt be ranſacked to heap cr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination upon my head.

If that letter had contained proofs of ſedition, or of treaſon againſt me, Mr. Palmer, or the writer of it—the ſeal—and the ſpear—and the Cap of Liberty, would have been its feebleſt protection.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I now come to the laſt charge. That of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, in the Convention of Delegates, the Addreſs from the Society of United Iriſhmen in Dublin.</p>
               <p>I admit the fact, and I glory in the admiſſion. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor has repreſented that ſociety, as a gang of mean and nefarious conſpirators; and their diploma of my admiſſion into their number, as an aggravation of my crime. Let me tell the Lord Advocate of Scotland, that ſociety ſtands too high to be affected by his invective, or to require the aid of my defence. I am a member of that ſociety; and, in the laſt moments of my life, to have been ſo, ſhall be my honour and my pride. The Lord Advocate has repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, in general terms, that this addreſs amounts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to treaſon; but he durſt not attempt to point out, in his ſpeech, a ſingle paſſage which could ſupport the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I maintain that every line of that addreſs is ſtrictly conſtitutional. You muſt carry the whole of it along with you into your chamber, and not judge of paſſages ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly mutilated in the indictment. The mutilation of the very firſt paragraph of the addreſs, is a proof of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of the ingenuity of the Proſecutor. I beg leave to read how it ſtands in the indictment, and then to read what follows in the addreſs itſelf:</p>

               <p>This is the firſt paragraph libelled on. But, even as it is in the indictment. It is not permitted to the United Iriſhmen in Dublin, to congratulate this unfortunate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon account of former eminence in literature, in arts, and in virtue;—and to expreſs the wiſh, that they would ſtill retain that enviable diſtinction? And, is that laſt and forlorn period now arrived, when thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch a wiſh, muſt be called <hi>nefarious</hi> conſpirators, and he who has been the organ of its communication, muſt be branded with the epithets of, a "wretch," of an "oracle of diſcord," of "a fiend of ſedition!" The children of your children, in after ages, will not forget this ever-to-be-remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered night. But here let us ſtop. I have ſaid that this indictment mutilated this paſſage, as it does every other paſſage in this Addreſs; It breaks off the paragraph at the words, "You are ſtill Scotland." It breaks off in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a ſentence; and for what purpoſe?—to countenance an inſinuation, that the United Iriſhmen in Dublin wiſhed a diſſolution of the Union betwixt Scotland and England. The Proſecutor cuts off the remainder of the ſentence which demonſtrated the ſenſe, in which the United Iriſhmen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the words "ſtill Scotland," expreſſing ſolely their idea of her ſtill being diſtinguiſhed by her former luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. The words which are ſeparated from the ſentence are in the addreſs as follows: <q>That you are ſtill Scotland— the land where Buchanan wrote, and Fletcher ſpoke,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:027633_0117_0FD556EAD442A928"/>
and Wallace fought.</q> Yes, I give my ſolemn aſſent to this wiſh, and to this hope of the United Iriſhmen. My voice ſhall reſound, Scotland ſhall ſtill be the land, where Buchanan has written, where Fletcher ſpoke, and where Wallace fought.</p>
               <p>Let us attend to the mutilation of another paſſage, in this extraordinary indictment. I ſhall read it as it ſtands:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We will lay open to you our hearts: Our cauſe is your cauſe—If there is to be a ſtruggle between us, let it be which Nation ſhall be foremoſt in the race of mind: let this be the noble animoſity kindled between us, who ſhall firſt attain that free conſtitution from which both are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtant, who ſhall firſt be the ſaviour of the empire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſenſe of both countries with reſpect to intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable abuſes of the conſtitution has been clearly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and proves that our political ſituations are not diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar; that our rights and wrongs are the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The paſſage libelled upon ſtops at the words "rights and wrongs are the ſame." But it forbears to take in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in which the ſimilarity of our rights and wrongs is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. The ſelf-elected magiſtrates of Burghs—the unequal repreſentation of the People in Parliament—and the total privation, in Scotland, of the ſhadow of popular Election.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will read over many paſſages of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, not merely becauſe they are the production of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal pen, but becauſe every word is regulated by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Here Mr. Muir read moſt of the Addreſs; but we forbear to inſert the particular paſſages, as the whole is in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can you call this addreſs ſeditious or inflammatory, which contains the following ſentiment? <q>If Government has a ſincere regard for the ſafety of the conſtitution, let them coincide with the people in the ſpeedy reform of its abuſes, and not by an obſtinate adherence to them, drive that people into Republicaniſm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Lord Advocate has repreſented the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this addreſs, as the meaneſt of mankind, and has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly called them infamous wretches, who had fled from the puniſhment due to their crimes. What ſlander!—what
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:027633_0118_0FD619CEC1B45338"/>
falſe, unfounded ſlander!—Has Doctor Drennan? Has Mr. Hamilton Rowan; whoſe names are at the head of this addreſs, fled from crimes and from puniſhment? "And they are infamous wretches!" If ever after ages ſhall hear of my name, I wiſh it may be recorded, that to theſe men I had the happineſs of being known. To be honoured by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Doctor Drennan is an ambition to which, in the moſt exalted ſtation of life, I would fondly aſpire. To have it ſaid, that I was the friend of Mr Hamilton Rowan. I would conſider as the paſſport to the only acquaintances whom I value; thoſe who found their claim to diſtinction upon the only true baſis, their own virtues. Mr. Rowan is indeed indicted to ſtand trial in Ireland, upon a charge ſimilar to my own. Mr. Rowan has not fled. He will boldly meet his accuſation; and, let me ſay, along with thoſe who know him, that, although it is impoſſible to add any new luſtre to his character, yet, as he has often come forward in the cauſe of individual humanity, he will diſplay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon that occaſion, the firm, the intrepid, and, I hope the ſucceſsful champion of the liberties of his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>I haſten to a concluſion. Much yet remains to ſay. But after, upon my part, the unremitted exertions of ſixteen hours, I feel myſelf nearly exhauſted.</p>
               <p>Look once more, I entreat you, to the indictment, and compare it with evidence.</p>
               <p>The firſt charge againſt me is, that in public ſpeeches, I vilified the King and Conſtitution. All the witneſſes addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced atteſt, that, both in public and in private, even in my moſt unguarded moments, my language was always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful to the King, and that I always recommended the Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The ſecond charge againſt me, is, that of adviſing the people to read ſeditious books, and of diſtributing inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory publications among them: And you hear it proved by the unanimous voice of all the witneſſes for the Crown, that I refuſed to recommend any books, and that the only one which I recommended, was Dr Henry's Hiſtory of England. You will not forget the circumſtance in which I lent Freeland a copy of Mr. Paine's Works; nor will you
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:027633_0119_0FD556EDB250D430"/>
forget the manner in which the writings of that man were introduced in converſation with Wilſon, Muir, and with Barclay. With regard to other books and pamphlets mentioned in the libel, there is not any proof. William Muir has de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oned, that I gave him one or two numbers of the Patriot, and ſome other pamphlets, whoſe titles I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember. William Muir is but a ſingle witneſs to this fact; and you know that, by the laws of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the teſtimony of a ſingle witneſs cannot claim any weight; but I frankly admit and acknowledge that I gave him thoſe numbers of the Patriot and, if I were not now entirely overcome by fatigue, I could demonſtrate to you, that, in thoſe numbers, there is not a ſingle ſentiment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional or ſeditious.</p>
               <p>I am accuſed of reading the Iriſh Addreſs in the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of moving a ſolemn anſwer in return. That ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is neither ſeditious, wicked, nor inflammatory. There is not a ſentence in it, which I have not defended in your preſence.</p>
               <p>You neither can do juſtice to me, nor to the country, if you condemn theſe different publications, upon account of the ſcandalouſly mutilated extracts from them in the libel. You muſt carry the whole of them along with you from this place. It is not upon detached paſſages you are to judge; but you muſt decide upon the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is now perhaps the laſt time, that I ſhall addreſs my country. I have explored the tenor of my paſt life. Nothing ſhall tear from me the record of my departed days. The enemies of Reform have ſcrutinized, in a manner hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto unexampled in Scotland, every action I may have performed, every word I may have uttered.—Of crimes, moſt foul and horrible, have I been accuſed.—Of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rear the ſtandard of civil war, and to plunge this land in blood, and to cover this land with deſolation. At every ſtep, as the evidence of the Crown advanced, my innocency has brightened. So far from inflaming the minds of men to ſedition and to outrage—all the witneſſes have concurred, that my only anxiety was, to
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:027633_0120_0FD556EF21643F90"/>
impreſs upon them the neceſſity of peace, of good order, and of good morals. What then has been my crime? Not the lending to a relation a copy of Mr. Paine's Works; not the giving away to another a few numbers of an innocent and conſtitutional publication; but for having dared to be, according to the meaſure of my feeble abilities, a ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and active advocate for an equal repreſentation of the People—in the Houſe of the People;—For having da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to attempt to accompliſh a meaſure, by legal means, which was to diminiſh the weight of their taxes, and to put an end to the profuſion of their blood. From my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to this moment, I have devoted myſelf to the cauſe of the People. It is a good cauſe.—It ſhall ultimately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.—It ſhall finally triumph. Say then openly, in your verdict, if you do condemn me, which I preſume you will not,—That it is for my attachment to this cauſe alone, and not for thoſe vain and wretched pretexts ſtated in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, intended only to colour and diſguiſe the real motives of my accuſation. The time will come, when men muſt ſtand or fall by their actions; when all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man peageantry ſhall ceaſe; when the hearts of all ſhall be laid open. If you regard your moſt important intereſts,—if you wiſh that your conſcience ſhould whiſper to you words of conſolation; or ſpeak to you in the terrible lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of remorſe,—Weigh well the verdict you are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. As for me, I am careleſs and indifferent to my fate. I can look danger—and I can look death in the face, for I am ſhielded by the conſciouſneſs of my own rectitude. I may be condenmned to languiſh in the receſſes of a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon—I may be doomed to aſcend the ſcaffold—Nothing can deprive me of the recollection of the paſt—Nothing can deſtroy my inward peace of mind, ariſing from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of having diſcharged my duty.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Muir ſat down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an unanimous burſt of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe was expreſſed by the audience.</p>
               <p>When the exclamations had ceaſed, he aroſe and ſaid,</p>
               <p>I have omitted to take notice of the evidence adduced upon my part, I am not going to detain you a moment longer.—To you I leave the import of the whole of that evidence.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="summation">
               <p>The LORD JUSTICE CLERK, in ſumming up the evidence,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:027633_0121_0FD556F19F886EF8"/>
ſaid, that the indictment was the longeſt he had ever ſeen; but it was not neceſſary to prove the whole, in order to find the Pannel guilty, for the Jury had only to look at the concluding ſentence of the indictment, from which it was plain, that if any one part of the libel was proven, it eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the guilt of the Pannel the ſame as if the whole was ſubſtantiated.</p>
               <p>Now, this is the queſtion for conſideration.—Is the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel guilty of Sedition, or, is he not? Now, before this queſtion can be anſwered, two things muſt be attended to that require no proof: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Britiſh Conſtitution is the <hi>beſt</hi> that ever was ſince the creation of the world, and it is not <hi>poſſible</hi> to make it <hi>better;</hi> for, is not every man ſecure? Does not every man reap the fruits of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and ſit ſafely under his own fig-tree? The <hi>next</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is, that there was a ſpirit of ſedition in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try laſt winter, which made every good man very uneaſy. And his Lordſhip coincided in opinion with the maſter of the grammar ſchool of Glaſgow, who told Mr. Muir, that he thought propoſing a reform was very ill timed. Yet Mr. Muir had, at that time, gone about among ignorant country people, making them forget their work, and told them that a reform was abſolutely neceſſary for preſerving their liberty, which, if it had not been for him, they would never have thought was in danger. His Lordſhip did not doubt that this would appear to them as it did to him, to be ſedition.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be attended to, was the outlawry.—Running away from juſtice, that was a mark of guilt. And what could he do in France at that period? pretending to be an ambaſſador to a foreign country without lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that was rebellion; and he pretends to have had influence with thoſe wretches, the leading men there And what kind of folks were they? His Lordſhip <hi>never liked the French all his days, but now he hated them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pannel's harranguing ſuch multitudes of ignorant weavers about their grievances, might have been attended with the worſt conſequences to the peace of the nation, and the ſafety of our glorious conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir might have known, that no attention could be
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:027633_0122_0FD556F2DB7AE1B0"/>
paid to ſuch a rabble. What right had they to repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He could have told them that the Parliament would never liſten to their petition: How could they think of it? A government in every country ſhould be juſt like a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; and, in this country, it is made up of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intereſt, which alone has a right to be repreſented; as for the <hi>rabble,</hi> who have nothing but perſonal property what hold has the nation of them? What ſecurity for the payment of their taxes; they may pack up all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty on their backs, and leave the country <hi>in the twinkling of an eye,</hi> but landed property cannot be removed.</p>
               <p>The tendency of the Pannel's conduct was plainly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a ſpirit of revolt, and, if what was demanded, was not given, to take it by force. His Lordſhip had not the ſmalleſt doubt that the Jury were, like himſelf, convinced of the Pannel's guilt, and deſired them to return ſuch a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict as would do them honour.</p>
               <p>The Court retired at two o'clock on Saturday morning, and met again at twelve o'clock of the ſame day, when the Jury returned the following</p>

               <p>The verdict being recorded, the LORD JUSTICE CLERK addreſſed the Jury, and ſaid, That this trial had been of the greateſt impotance. He was happy that they had beſtowed ſo much attention upon it, and informed them, that the Court highly approved of the verdict they had given. He then deſired their Lordſhips to give their opinion upon this verdict, and what puniſhment ſhould be inflicted.</p>
               <p>Which they did to the following purport:—</p>
               <p>LORD HENDERLAND obſerved, that the alarming ſituation in which this country was during the courſe of laſt winter, gave uneaſineſs to all thinking men: His Lordſhip ſaid, that he now arrived at the moſt diſagreeable part of the duty incumbent upon him, which was to fix the puniſhment due to the crime, of which the Pannel was found guilty. The indictment contained a charge of ſedition, exciting a ſpirit of diſcontent among the inferior claſſes of people, and an attack againſt the <hi>Glorious Conſtitution</hi> of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the Jury, by the verdict which they had returned, and to which the Court had alone recourſe, had found the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel guilty; and it was their Lordſhips duty only, now to fix the puniſhment due to the offence. His Lordſhip ſaid, that he would not dwell upon the evil conſequences of the crimes committed by the priſoner. The melancholy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a neighbouring country, which would forever ſtain the page of hiſtory, rendered it unneceſſary for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate the circumſtances of the caſe. In that country, the conſequences of ſuch meaſures have produced every kind of violence, rapine, and murder. There appeared, he ſaid, to have been in this country a regular plan of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious meaſures. The indecent applauſe which was given to Mr. Muir laſt night, at the concluſion of his defence, within theſe walls, unknown to that High Court, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſolemnity which ought to pervade the adminiſtration of juſtice, and which was inſulting to the laws and dignity of that court, proved to him that the ſpirit of ſediton had not as yet ſubſided. He would not, he ſaid, ſeek to aggravate the offence committed by the Pannel, by the miſconduct of others, in order to increaſe the puniſhment. The puniſhment to be inflicted is arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:027633_0124_0FD619D5DDCB9810"/>
of which there is a variety. Baniſhment, he obſerved would be improper, as it would only be ſending to another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a man, where he might have the opportunity of exciting the ſame ſpirit of diſcontent, and ſowing with a plentiful hand ſedition; whipping, was too ſevere, and diſgraceful, the more eſpecially to a man who had bore his character and rank in life. And impriſonment, he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would be but a temporary puniſhment, when the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal would be again let looſe; and ſo again diſturb the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of <hi>the People.</hi> There remains but one puniſhment in our law, and <hi>it wrung his very heart</hi> to mention it, viz. <hi>Tranſportation.</hi> It was a duty he conſidered he owed to his countrymen, to pronounce it, in the ſituation in which he ſat, as the puniſhment due to his crimes. His Lordſhip obſerved, it was extraordinary that a gentleman of his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, of his profeſſion, and of the talents he poſſeſſed, ſhould be guilty of a crime deſerving ſuch a puniſhment, but he ſaw no alterative. For what ſecurity could we have againſt his future operations, but a removal from his country, to a place where he could do no further harm. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was therefore of opinion, that the Pannel ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed to priſon, there to remain, till a proper oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſhould offer for tranſporting him, to ſuch place as his Majeſty, with the advice of his Privy Council, might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for the ſpace of <hi>Fourteen years</hi> from the date of the ſentence; and that he ſhould not return within that period under the pain of death.</p>
               <p>LORD SWINTON —The crime with which the Pannel is, by the <hi>Jury</hi> of his country, found guilty, is <hi>ſedition.</hi> It is a generic crime, and which is defined by our lawyers, to be a commotion of the people without authority, and of exciting others to ſuch commotion againſt the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. This crime, he obſerved, conſiſted of many grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and might have run from a petty mob, about wages, even to high treaſon. He thought the puniſhment ſhould be adapted to the crime. The queſtion, he ſaid, was then, What was the degree of the crime the Pannel has been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. That was to be diſcovered from the libel, of which he has been found guilty by the unanimous verdict of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Jury of his country. It appeared to him, to be a
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:027633_0125_0FD556F6E9BC8648"/>
crime of the moſt henious kind, and there was ſcarcely a diſtinction betwen it and <hi>high treaſon.</hi> As by the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſocial compact it made way for, and ſo it might be ſaid, to include every ſort of <hi>crime, murder, robbery, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, fire-raiſings,</hi> in ſhort every ſpecies of wrong, public and private. This, he obſerved, was no theoretical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, for we had it exemplified before our eyes, in the preſent ſtate of France, where, under the pretence of aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty, the worſt ſort of tyranny was eſtabliſhed, and all the loyal and moral ties which bind mankind were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Nay, ſhameful to tell, even religion itſelf was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and publicly diſavowed by the National Convention.</p>
               <p>Certain wretched perſons, aſſuming to themſelves, moſt falſely and inſidiouſly, the reſpectable name of Friends of the People, and of Reform, although they deſerved the <hi>very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite</hi> denomination, by which means they have miſled, and drawn after them, a great number of well-meaning, though ſimple and unwary people.</p>
               <p>If puniſhment, adequate to the crime, were to be ſought for, there could be found no puniſhment in our law ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the crime in the preſent caſe, now that torture is happily aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>By the Roman law, which is held to be our common law where there is no ſtatute, the puniſhment was various, and tranſportation was among the mildeſt mentioned. Paulus, L. 38.

               </p>
               <p>The ſole object of puniſhment among us, is only to deter others from committing the like crimes in time coming.—Therefore the puniſhment ſhould be made equal to the crime. All that is neceſſary is, that it ſerve as an example and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027633_0126_0FD619D6A5305708"/>
to others, in time coming, againſt a repetition of the like offence. In the preſent caſe, he thought that <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation</hi> was the ligheſt puniſhment that could be aſſigned, and that for the ſpace of fourteen years, under the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of death, in caſe of returning before the expiration of that term.</p>
               <p>LORD DUNSINNAN.—His Lordſhip ſpoke in ſo low a tone of voice, that we had not an opportunity of following him, throughout the whole of his opinion. He however agreed, with the reſt of their Lordſhips, in the puniſhment which they ſaid Mr. Muir deſerved, viz. Tranſportation for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, with the uſual certification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>LORD ABERCROMBY.—His Lordſhip did not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſay much as to the enormity of the crime, after what had been already ſaid. By our law, it might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to treaſon, and even as the law now ſtands, it came very near it.</p>
               <p>He obſerved, that Mr. Muir laſt night, when conducting his defence, had ſtated, and which was marked, and it had great weight with him, <q>That the people ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and by all manner of means avoid tumults and diſorders, for through time the maſs of the people would bring about a Revolution</q> (Here Mr. Muir roſe, and ſaid, "I deny it, my Lord, it is totally falſe.") If any thing could add to the improper nature of the Pannel's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it was his pretended miſſion to France, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he expreſſed, in the circle of acquaintance he had there. It was evident, ſaid his Lordſhip, that his feelings did too much accord with the feelings of thoſe monſters.—His Lordſhip coincided with the reſt of their Lordſhips, in regard to the puniſhment, which, they had given as their opinion, Mr. Muir deſerved.</p>
               <p>LORD JUSTICE CLERK—His Lordſhip ſaid, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably affected to ſee the pannel ſtand trial for ſedition, a man who had got a liberal education, was member of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable ſociety, poſſeſſed conſiderable talents, and had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a reſpectable character. His Lordſhip conſidered the very loweſt ſpecies of this crime as heinous, and that it was aggravated according to the object in view. Here the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was important; for it was creating in the lower claſſes
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:027633_0127_0FD556F99819B938"/>
of people, diſloyalty, and diſſatisfaction to government, and this amounting to the higheſt ſort of ſedition, is bordering on treaſon, and a little more would have made the Pannel ſtand trial for his life.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip agreed in the propriety of the propoſed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and he obſerved that the indecent applauſe which was given the Pannel laſt night, convinced him, that a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diſcontent ſtill lurked in the minds of the people, and that it would be dangerous to allow him to remain in this country. His Lordſhip ſaid, this circumſtance had no little weight with him, when conſidering of the puniſhment Mr. Muir deſerved. He never had a doubt but tranſportation was the proper puniſhment for ſuch a crime, but he only heſitated whether it ſhould be for life, or for the term of fourteen years!—The latter he preferred, and he hoped the Pannel would reflect on his paſt conduct, and ſee the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety which he had committed, and that if he ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reſtored to his country, he might ſtill have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhowing himſelf to be a good member of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which he ſeemed to deſpiſe ſo much.</p>
               <p>After his Lordſhip had delivered his opinion, and during the time the ſentence was recording, Mr. Muir roſe and ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord Juſtice Clerk, I have only a few words to ſay, I ſhall not animadvert upon the ſeverity or the leniency of my ſentence. Were I to be led this moment from the bar to the ſcaffold, I ſhould feel the ſame calmneſs and ſerenity which I now do. My mind tells me, that I have acted agreeable to my conſcience, and that I have engaged in a good, a juſt, and a glorious cauſe,—a cauſe which ſooner or later muſt, and will, prevail; and, by a timely reform ſave this country from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>

Mr. John Richardſon, a ſon of Deacon James Richardſon, I ſaw him this week at Greeneck, where he is to ſail in the Almy of New-York directly, who has two packets of letters for him; and there is many letters wrote for him to the firſt people in America. And once he were there he'll get letters to General Waſhington; and I hope, dear Sir, you'll ſhew him every civility in your power, which I hope ſome day gratefully to thank you for it. There is a trunk alſo in the Almy for him, which Mr. Richardſon will deliver into his own hand.

               <p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the buſineſs of Mr. Muir. I did not loſe a moment in finding a ſafe and ſpeedy conveyance to him at Paris for your letters, and thoſe of his other friends in Scotland, ſent to my care. I delayed from day to day in the perpetual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſeeing Mr. Muir here on his return. It's now, however, become neceſſary for me to inform you, that he is not yet come; and conſidering the extreme anxiety which he muſt have felt to return as ſoon as poſſible, I think it very probable that this delay ought to be aſcribed to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo laid on the veſſels in the ports of France, which may perhaps have rendered it impoſſible for him, though even at Calais, to make his paſſage to England. I think this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability at leaſt ſufficiently great to be pleaded for a delay of his trial; and it is to enable you and his friends to make any uſe of it that you may think fit, that I have now thought it neceſſary to communicate this ſtate of facts to you.</p>

We honour a nation eminent for men of genius, and we truſt that they will now exert themſelves not ſo much in peruſing and penning the hiſtories of other countries, as in making their own a ſubject for the hiſtorian. May we venture to obſerve to them, that mankind have been too retroſpective; canonized antiquity, and undervalued themſelves. Man has repoſed on ruins, and reſted his head on ſome fragments of the temple of liberty, or at moſt amuſed himſelf in paving the meaſurement of the edifice, and nicely limiting its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions; not reflecting that this temple is truly Catholic, the ample earth its area, and the arch of heaven its dome.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſenſe of both countries with reſpect to the intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able abuſes of the conſtitution has been clearly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proves that our political ſituations are not diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; that our rights and wrongs are the ſame.</q> Out of 32 counties in Ireland, 29 petitioned for a Reform in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and out of 56 of the Royal Burghs in Scotland, 50 petitioned for a Reform in their internal ſtructure and Government. If we be rightly informed, there is no ſuch thing as popular election in Scotland. The people who ought to poſſeſs that weight in the popular ſcale, which might bind them to the ſoil, and make them cling to the conſtitution, are now as duſt in the balance, blown abroad by the leaſt impulſe, and ſcattered through other countries, merely because they hang ſo looſely to their own. They have no ſhare in the national <hi>Firm,</hi> and are aggrieved not only by irregular and illegal exaction of taxes; by miſrule and miſmanagement of corporations; by miſconduct of ſelf-elected and irreſponſible magiſtrates; by waſte of public property; and by want of competent judicatures; but, in our opinion, moſt of all, by an inadequate Parliamentary repreſentation—for we aſſert, that 45 Commoners, and 16 Peers, are a pitiful repreſentation for two millions and a half of people; particularly as your Commons conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not as the repreſentatives of that people, but of the Councils of the Burghs by whom they are elected.</p>
               <p>Excluſive charters in favour of Burghs, monopolize the general rights of the people, and that act muſt be abſurd, which precludes all other towns from the power of being reſtored to their ancient freedom.</p>
               <p>We remember that heritable juriſdictions and feudal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, though expreſsly reſerved by the act of union, (20th art.) were ſet aſide by act of Parliament in 1746, and we think that there is much ſtronger ground at preſent for reſtoring to the maſs of the people their alienated rights, and to the Conſtitution its ſpirit and its integrity.</p>
               <p>Look now we pray you upon Ireland. Long was this unfortunate iſland the prey of prejudiced factions and fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious parties. The rights or rather duties of conqueſt were
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:027633_0143_0FD5571562BE8030"/>
dreadfully abuſed, and the catholic religion was made the perpetual pretext for ſubjecting the ſtate by annihilating the citizen, and deſtroying not the religious perſuaſion but the man; not popery, but the people. It was not till very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the part of the nation, which is truly colonial, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that though their anceſtors had been victorious, they themſelves were now included in the general ſubjection; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing only to be ſubdued, and trampled upon, by Britain as a ſervile dependency. When therefore the Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuffer what the Catholics had ſuffered and were ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; when from ſerving as the inſtruments they were made themſelves the objects of foreign domination, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came conſcious they had a country; and then they felt—an Ireland.—They reſiſted Britiſh dominion, renounced colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſubſervience, and following the example of a Catholic Parliament juſt a century before, they aſſerted the excluſive juriſdiction and legiſlative competence of this iſland. A ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light from America ſhone through our priſon. Our Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun-teers aroſe. The chains fell from our hands. We followed Grattan, the angel of our deliverance, and in 1782 Ireland ceaſed to be a province, and became a nation. But, with reaſon, ſhould we deſpiſe and renounce this Revolution, as merely a tranſient burſt through a bad habit; the ſudden graſp of neceſſity in deſpair, from tyranny in diſtreſs, did we not believe that the Revolution was ſtill <hi>in train;</hi> that it is leſs the ſingle and ſhining act of 82, than a ſeries of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional improvements which that act uſhers in and announc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; that it is only the herald of liberty and glory, of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic emancipation, as well as proteſtant independence; that, in ſhort this Revolution indicates new principles, foreruns new practices, and lays a foundation for advancing the whole people higher in the ſcale of being, and diffuſing equal and permanent happineſs.</p>
               <p>Britiſh ſupremacy changed its aſpect, but its eſſence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained the ſame. Firſt it was force, and on the event of the late Revolution, it became influence; direct hoſtility ſhifted into ſyſtematic corruption, ſilently drawing off the virtue and vigour of the iſland, without ſhock or exploſion. Corruption that glides into every place, tempts every perſon, taints every principle, infects the political mind through all
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:027633_0144_0FD55716D85D1B38"/>
its relations and dependencies; ſo regardleſs of public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as to ſet the higheſt honour to ſale, and to purchaſe boroughs with the price of ſuch proſtitution; ſo regardleſs of public morality, as to legalize the licentiouſneſs of the loweſt and moſt pernicious gambling, and to extract a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous revenue from the infatuation and intoxication of the people.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants of Ireland were now ſenſible that nothing could counteract this plan of debilitating policy, but a radical reform in the houſe of the people, and that without ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the Revolution itſelf was nominal and deluſive—The wheel merely turned round, but it did not move forward, and they were as diſtant as ever from the goal. They reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—They convened.—They met with arms.—They met without them.—They petitioned. But all in vain—for, they were but a portion of the people. They then looked around and beheld their catholic countrymen. Three million—we repeat it—three million taxed without being repreſented, bound by laws to which they had not given conſent, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litically dead in their native land. The apathy of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind changed into ſympathy, and that begot an energy of ſentiment and action. They had eyes, and they read. They had ears, and they liſtened. They had hearts, and they felt. They ſaid—"Give us our rights as you value your own. Give us a ſhare of civil and political liberty, the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive franchiſe, and the trial by jury. Treat us as men, and we ſhall treat you as brothers. Is taxation without repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation a grievance to three millions acroſs the Atlantic, and no grievance to three millions at your doors?—Throw down that pale of perſecution, which ſtill keeps up civil war in Ireland, and make us one people. We ſhall then ſtand, ſupporting and ſupported, in the aſſertion of that liberty which is due to all, and which all ſhould unite to attain."</p>
               <p>It was juſt—and immediately a principle of adheſion took place for the firſt time, among the inhabitants of Ireland.—All religious perſuaſions found in a political union their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duty and their common ſalvation. In this ſociety and its affiliated ſocieties, the Catholic and the Preſbyterian are at this inſtant holding out their hands and opening their hearts to each other, agreeing in principles, concurring in
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:027633_0145_0FD619F1A6CBDE98"/>
practice. We unite for immediate, ample, and ſubſtantial juſtice to the Catholics, and when that is attained, a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exertion for a Reform in Parliament is the condition of our compact, and the ſeal of our communion.</p>
               <p>Britiſh ſupremacy takes alarm. The haughty monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts of national power and common right, who crouch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to domineer at home, now look with more ſurpriſe and leſſ contempt on this "beſorted" people. A new artifice is adopted, and that reſtleſs domination which, at firſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed as open war, by the length of the ſword; then, as covert cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, by the ſtrength of the poiſon; now aſſumes the ſtile and title of Proteſtant Aſcendancy; calls down the name of religion from heaven to ſow diſcord on earth; to rule by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, to keep up diſtruſt and antipathy among parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong perſuaſions, among families, nay to make the paſſions of the individuals ſtruggle, like Cain and Abel, in the very home of the heart, and to convert every little paltry neceſſity that accident, indolence, or extravagance bring upon a man, into a pander for the purchaſe of his honeſty and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We will not be the dupes of ſuch ignoble artifices. We ſee this ſcheme of ſtrengthening political perſecution and ſtate inquiſition, by a freſh infuſion of religious fanaticiſm; but we will unite, and we will be free. <hi>Univerſal Eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation with Repreſentative Legiſlature</hi> is the polar prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which guides our Society, and ſhall guide it through all the tumult of factions and fluctuations of parties. It is not upon a coalition of oppoſition with miniſtry that we depend, but upon a coalition of Iriſhmen with Iriſhmen, and in that coalition alone we find an object worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and at the ſame time the ſtrength and ſinew to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſecure it. It is not external circumſtances, upon the pledge of man or miniſter, we depend, but upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal energy of the Iriſh nation. We will not buy or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row liberty from America or from France, but manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ourſelves, and work it up with thoſe materials that the hearts of Iriſhmen furniſh them with at home. We do not worſhip the Britiſh, far leſs the Iriſh Conſtitution, as ſent down from heaven, but we conſider it as human workmanſhip, which man has made and man can mend.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:027633_0146_0FD55719D8B57080"/>
An unalterable Conſtitution, whatever be its nature, muſt be deſpotiſm. It is not the Conſtitution but the People which ought to be inviolable, and it is time to recognize and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the rights of the Engliſh, the Scotch, and the Iriſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>—Rights which can neither be bought nor ſold, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by charter, or foreſtalled by monopoly, but which nature dictates as the birthright of all, and which it is the buſineſs of a conſtitution to define, to enforce, and to eſtabliſh. If Government has a ſincere regard for the ſafety of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, let them coincide with the people in the ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of its abuſes, and not by an obſtinate adherence to them, drive that people into Republicaniſm.</p>
               <p>We have told you what our ſituation was, what it is, what it ought to be: our end, a National Legiſlature; our means, an union of the whole people. Let this union ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend throughout the Empire. Let us unite for all, or each man ſuffer for all. In each country let the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in peaceful and conſtitutional Convention. Let dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from each country digeſt a plan of reform, beſt adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſituation and circumſtances of their reſpective na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and let the Legiſlatures be petitioned at once by the urgent and unanimous voice of England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You have our ideas. Anſwer us, and that quickly.—This is not a time to procraſtinate. Your illuſtrious Fletch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has ſaid, that the liberties of a people are not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, without paſſing through great difficulties, and no toil or labour ought to be declined to preſerve a nation from ſlavery.

Let this check the raſhneſs that ruſhes unadviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly into the committal of national character, or <hi>if that be already made,</hi> let the ſame conſideration impel us all to advance with active not paſſive perſeverance, with manly confidence and calm determination, ſmiling with equal ſcorn at the bluſter of official a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Being deſired to ſtate, if I could recollect the reaſon which Mr. Muir aſſigned in that letter for his journey to Paris, I ſaid, that it was the opinion of friends, that if Mr. Muir would go to Paris, he might have great influence with many to mitigate the ſentence of the French King.
