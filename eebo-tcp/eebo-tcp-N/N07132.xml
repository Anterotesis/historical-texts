            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST HONORABLE WILLIAM, MARQUIS of LOTHIAN, PRESIDENT, AND The other Members of the honorable Society in SCOTLAND for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Chriſtian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</head>
            <p>THE following ſermon was preached at the
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:009088_0004_10311BB3B98C6C00"/>
deſire of your correſpondent members in New-England; and as they, in their candor, tho't it adapted to ſerve the noble deſign of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with which you had honored them, it was their pleaſure to depute me, with all humble deference, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it to you in their name.</p>
            <p>THE power communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, in virtue of the Royal charter granted to you, gave riſe to thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, which have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Divine ſmiles, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained conſiderable ſums to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of the

miſſions to the weſtern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, of which you will have ſome account in theſe papers: And we doubt not, it will be a ſatisfaction to you, if you ſhould find, that a fair proſpect is opened to diffuſe the knowledge of Chriſt in theſe uttermoſt parts of the earth.</p>
            <p>WE bow the knee in grateful acknowledgements to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who has made you ſucceſsful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in cultivating the minds, and rectifying the manners, of ſuch multitudes
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:009088_0006_10312156039E2D90"/>
in the iſles and highlands of Scotland: at the ſame time, we remember with regret, that your kind and generous attempt, ſome years ago, to chriſtianiſe the Indians on the eaſtern borders of this province, was not proſpered according to your pious wiſhes. Your miſſionaries then went to Indians, who had been ſtrongly prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in favor of the idolatries and ſuperſtitions of Rome. They are now gone to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-nations, who have not been under management by popiſh prieſts: and if they are faithful in their labors,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:009088_0007_103032909B83EA30"/>
and wiſe to conduct them, it may reaſonably be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they will, with the concurring bleſſing of God, be happily inſtrumental in ſpreading the name, and ſettling the kingdom, of the Redeemer, in this remote corner of the world.</p>
            <p>IT was with a ſpecial view to the goſpeliſing theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, that you were pleaſed to conſtitute us your correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent members: and as, in proſecution of ſo benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a deſign, we have been generouſly helped by public bodies, as well as private
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:009088_0008_10311BB956F03140"/>
perſons; we promiſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves we ſhall not want your kind aſſiſtance: eſpecially, as we herein act by delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from you. The income of your funds may not be more than ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the calls from thoſe numerous ſchools, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant miſſions, which are ſupported at your charge: but we queſtion not your wiſdom to deviſe, or readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to carry into effect, ſuch meaſures as ſhall put it in your power to encourage us, as far as may reaſonably be expected, in going on with that work of pious charity
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:009088_0009_10311BBADE3857E8"/>
in which we are engaged, and not without ſome hope of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I NEED not ask your prayers for the miſſionaries gone forth on the ſervice of Chriſt to people of a ſtrange ſpeech, and rude manners; or for your commiſſioners, as they are, in this buſineſs, your ſervants for Chriſt's ſake: And God forbid, that they ſhould ceaſe praying for you, that your wiſe and faithful endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote chriſtian knowledge and virtue may be bleſſed yet more abundantly, to the

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately foregoing ones, exhibit an account of the promiſe which God made, more than three thouſand years ago, to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Patriarch, who is ſet forth as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of faith to all after-generations of men: And it ſummarily contains the whole ſcheme of the divine conduct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting both the nation of the Jews, and the other nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:009088_0012_1030328802D4EA20"/>IT is obviouſly diviſible into two parts. The former relates to Abraham himſelf, and his natural poſterity thro' Iſaac and Jacob; and may juſtly be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the true baſis of the Jewiſh church, and of all the means, privileges, dignities and prerogatives, they were favoured with, diſtinguiſhing them from every other people. The latter reſpects the nations in common; pointing our view to Chriſt, and to the enlargement of God's kingdom under his adminiſtration, when there ſhould be no more any difference between "Jew and Greek," but all kindreds, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and people under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, upon their faith in the promiſed ſeed, ſhould make one body, be fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs, and partakers in common of the ſame goſpel-ſalvation.</p>
            <p>THIS latter part of the promiſe, which concerns the nations of the world in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is comprehended in the words I have ſelected to employ our thoughts at this time,
<q>In thy ſeed ſhall all nations of the earth be bleſſed.</q>
An intereſting promiſe! No one in the ſacred books is more ſo. It was accordingly, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions beſides that in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, expreſsly made to Abraham by name;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009088_0013_10311BC330E05828"/>
and afterwards, in like explicit form, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed both to Iſaac and Jacob: Nor is there a promiſe of God more frequently refered to by the inſpired writers. This is the promiſe, in ſpecial, which the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul ſo often takes riſe from in his reaſonings, particularly, in favor of the Gentile nations.</p>
            <p>WHAT I have in view, at preſent, is to let you into a clear conception of the meaning, importance and extent of this divine promiſe; the doing of which will very obviouſly prepare the way for the reflections that are proper upon ſuch an occaſion as this.</p>
            <p>THE following things then are to be conſidered and explained, the <hi>ſeed</hi> in whom this promiſe is made; the juſt import of the <hi>bleſſing</hi> promiſed; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>extent</hi> of the object of the promiſe.</p>
            <p>AS to the firſt of theſe particulars, the <hi>ſeed</hi> in whom the promiſe is made, 'tis evident we are to underſtand by it, not the poſterity of Abraham in general, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Iſaac or Jacob; but a SINGLE PERSON proceeding from him thro' them. The word "ſeed" is not uſed here as a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009088_0014_10311BC4B975D2D8"/>
name of multitude; but as denoting ONE, by whom, as deſcending from Abraham, the bleſſing ſhould be conveyed. Thus the promiſe ſeems to have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Abraham himſelf. How elſe ſhall we explain that addreſs of our Lord to the Jews, <note n="*" place="bottom">John VIII.56.</note> "Your father Abraham rejoiced to ſee my day, and ſaw it, and was glad?" It was in the lively exerciſe of faith and hope, as grounded on the "ſeed" promiſed in my text, that he was filled with holy joy, while he looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the time, when this glorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would appear in the world to be a bleſſing to it. And this ſame promiſed "ſeed" was ultimately the ground of the univerſal expectation there was among the Jews, particularly about the time of our Saviour's manifeſtation in human fleſh, that a "deliverer would come out of Zion," as proceeding from Abraham.— They entertain'd, 'tis true, wrong noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this deliverer, and of the ſalvation he would effect: But they rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued the promiſe ſo far as they were led, in virtue of it, to expect, that ſome extraordinary perſon would, in God's time, come into the world under the character of a mighty Redeemer. To be ſure, this is the conſtruction the new-teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament-writers
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009088_0015_10311BC733605BE8"/>
put upon the word, "ſeed," in the promiſe to Abraham. The apoſtle Paul, while treating upon this matter ex profeſſo, has thus explained the term in Gal. 3.16. His words are, "He ſaith not," that is, God, in the promiſes he made to Abraham, ſaith not, "and to ſeeds, as of many; but as of one, to thy ſeed; which ſeed (as he goes on to aſſure us) is Chriſt." He accordingly, in the following 19th v. uſes the word, ſeed, in this perſonal ſenſe. For, ſpeaking there of the law that was given by Moſes, he ſays, "it was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, till the ſeed ſhould come," that is, till the appearing of Chriſt, the ſeed it was promiſed ſhould come. In agreement with this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Chriſt is repreſented <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. II.16.</note> as having "took on him the ſeed of Abraham."— And his birth into the world is ſpoken of <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke I.75.</note> as "the mercy promiſed in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the oath which God ſware to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham," that is, the promiſe he ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to him, and confirmed by his oath, in the words of my text. The ſhort of the matter is, the ſeed here promiſed to Abraham is the ſame ſeed that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Adam ſoon after his fall; meaning Chriſt, the Saviour it pleaſed the all-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God early to provide for a periſhing

world, thro' whom alone any of the race of men could be delivered from ſin and wrath, and obtain ſalvation with eternal glory. And 'tis accordingly the truth of fact, that Chriſt is the glorious perſon, to whoſe mediatory undertaking, in our nature, it is every where aſcribed, in the inſpired writings of the new-teſtament, "that the ſerpent's head has been bruiſed;" or, what means preciſely the ſame thing, that "the nations of the earth" have been, and "ſhall be bleſſed."</p>
            <p>THUS the "ſeed," promiſed in my text, means a ſingle perſon, one only, even Jeſus Chriſt, the alone conſtituted ſaviour of men; and ſo I gone on, as was nextly propoſed,</p>
            <p>TO aſcertain the ſenſe in which we are to underſtand the <hi>bleſſing</hi> that is promiſed thro' him.</p>
            <p>AND it means, without all doubt, the ſame thing with goſpel-ſalvation. Abraham entertained this thought of it. I don't ſay, that he had ſo full and diſtinct an idea of the ſalvation by Chriſt as we have, whoſe lot it is to live in the world ſince the incarnation of the ſon of God,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009088_0017_10311BCD1209F738"/>
and the clear diſcovery he has made of the counſels of heaven with reference to the great affair of man's redemption, as grounded on the merit of his life and death: But he was led, in conſequence of this promiſe, into an expectation of good things far more excellent than temporal ones, and as deſigned for other nations beſides the Jewiſh, who could boaſt of having him for their head and father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh. Hence our Saviour ſpeaks of him <note n="§" place="bottom">John VIII.56.</note> as having by faith, "ſeen his day," the day of his appearing, the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel day. And hence the author of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrews declares, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. IX.10.</note> that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham "looked for a city which hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whoſe builder and maker is God." The ſame city is here meant which the apoſtle John calls "the new Jeruſalem," and ſaw in his viſions, "coming down from God out of heaven." Nor could Abraham have looked for ſuch a city as this in any way but that of faith, taking riſe from the promiſe God had now made to him.</p>
            <p>AND 'tis abundantly evident, that the new-teſtament writings do every where underſtand this BLESSING, which was to be conveyed thro' the ſeed of Abraham,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009088_0018_10311BCE96BC28F0"/>
in the above ſpiritual ſenſe. Hence Zacharias, in his prophetic ſong, <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke I. 69th to the 75th.</note> makes "God's granting to us to ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs" one thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in "the mercy promiſed in the covenant with Abraham." Hence the apoſtle Peter tells the Jews, <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts III.25.26.</note> that "the miſſion of Chriſt to bleſs them by turning them from their iniquities," was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in thoſe words of God to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham of old, "in thy ſeed ſhall all the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the earth be bleſſed." Hence the apoſtle Paul declares, <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. III.8.</note> that "the goſpel was preached to Abraham," when it was ſaid to him, "in thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed;" and again, <note n="‡" place="bottom">v. 18.</note> that "the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance," the incorruptible, undefiled and eternal inheritance, as it is ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, was "given to Abraham by promiſe," that is, the promiſe in my text. Hence the author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews ſpeaks of God <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. IX.16.</note> as "not aſhamed to be called their God," the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob, "becauſe he hath prepared for them a city," the ſame city of which he had before <note n="*" place="bottom">v. 10.</note> ſaid, "whoſe builder and maker is God." In fine, it was becauſe this, and the ſimilar promiſes, looked beyond the preſent world, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009088_0019_10311BD12B4299A8"/>
bleſſedneſs in ſome future one, that our Saviour argues therefrom in proof of the reſurrection from the dead. His words are, <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke XX 37.</note> "that the dead ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, even Moſes ſhewed at the buſh, when he called the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living." 'Tis certain, from theſe paſſages, if we may rely on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the new-teſtament writers, that the <hi>bleſſing</hi> promiſed through the ſeed of Abraham was virtually, ſeminally and implicitly, that ſame ſalvation which has ſince, as the apoſtle Paul ſpeaks, <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. XVI.26.</note> "been made known, according to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the everlaſting God, to all nations for the obedience of faith."</p>
            <p>BUT beſides this ſalvation, wherein the bleſſing promiſed principally conſiſts, the way and means of its beſtowment are included alſo; ſuch as the manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt in our fleſh, as proceeding from Abraham; his ſufferings and death; his reſurrection from the dead; aſcention to heaven, and exaltation at the right hand of God; and that ſettlement of God's viſible kingdom, in conſequence hereof, which now takes place in the world, with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009088_0020_10311BD4904BC890"/>
him at it's head. Not that Abraham, or any of his poſterity in former ages, were led, by theſe general words, "in thy ſeed ſhall all nations be bleſſed," into a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knowledge of theſe things. 'Tis probable, neither he, nor they, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood any more by them than this, that ſome glorious perſonage, ſpringing from him, ſhould, in God's time, in ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho't of by them, be the inſtrument in ſpiritually "bleſſing all nations of the earth." But ſtill, the whole work of Chriſt, as Saviour of the world, was virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contained in this promiſe, that is to ſay, all that he was to be, to do, and to ſuffer, while on earth; and, all that he was afterwards to tranſact in heaven, in order to his bringing into effect the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his mediatory undertaking for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The inſpired writers certainly teach us to conceive thus of the matter. Hence they ſpeak of the incarnation of Chriſt, which was an eſſential preparative in the plan of God in order to the ſalvation of men, as an accompliſhment, in part, of this bleſſing promiſed in the covenant with Abraham. Thus Mary, the mother of our Lord, is introduced in her prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſong. <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke I.54, 55.</note> as "rejoicing in God" upon his birth into the world, and for this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009088_0021_10311BD75C040EE0"/>
reaſon, "becauſe he had helped his ſervant Iſrael, in remembrance of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as he ſpake to our fathers, to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and to his ſeed forever." And Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias, upon this ſame occaſion, being "filled with the Holy Ghoſt" is brought in opening his lips in thoſe words of praiſe, <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke I.6<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 72, 73.</note> "bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people, and raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us, in the houſe of his ſervant David,—to perform the mercy promiſed to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to remember his holy covenant, the oath which he ſwear to our father Abraham." And as the incarnation of Chriſt, ſo his obedience in our nature even to the death of the croſs, which ought always to be eſteemed the true and only moral ground of the beſtowment of ſpiritual and heavenly bleſſings, is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and expreſsly repreſented as that by which alſo the promiſe to Abraham was in part fulfilled. Hence that paſſage in the apoſtle Paul's epiſtle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. III.13, 14.</note> "Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us, — that the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles thro' Jeſus Chriſt." In like manner, the reſurrection of our Lord, the firſt ſtep to his exalted
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009088_0022_10311BD8E2F975F0"/>
ſtate in heaven, and ſometimes put in ſcripture for the whole of it, is directly mentioned as effected to make good the promiſe to Abraham. Hence thoſe words in Paul's ſpeech to the men of Antioch, <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts XIII. 32, 33.</note> "We declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promiſe, which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us their children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again." In fine, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſtate of things, under the goſpel-diſpenſation, which was ſet up by Jeſus Chriſt, and has him for its ſupreme director and Lord, was likewiſe included in this promiſe: So tho't the great apoſtle of the Gentiles; for one of the main things he had in view, eſpecially in his epiſtles to the Romans, Galatians, and Epheſians, was to illuſtrate and prove this point.</p>
            <p>THE ſum of the matter is, by the <hi>bleſſing</hi> promiſed thro' the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, we are to underſtand ſpiritual and eternal ſalvation, together with the way and means of its communication; Chriſt's becoming a partaker of fleſh and blood in the fulneſs of time, thro' the loins of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; his dying to make reconciliation for iniquity; his riſing from the dead,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009088_0023_10311BDB5ACCB7C0"/>
and going up to heaven to ſit there at the right hand of God's power; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, his erecting a kingdom, wiſely and mercifully furniſhed with all deſirable means, motives, and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in order to deliver the nations from the power of ſin and Satan, and to form them to a meetneſs in this world for the glory, honor and immortality of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming better world.</p>
            <p>WE go on, in the laſt place, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the OBJECT of the promiſe; which is nobly extenſive, taking in "all nations," yea "all families of the earth," as it is elſewhere expreſſed. Not that "all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and families," viewed either as col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective bodies, or individuals, ſhall be bleſſed in Chriſt, whether they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him or not. Such an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would be contrary to the truth of fact, as well as ſcripture: But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that in Chriſt, the promiſed ſeed, there is no difference between Jew and Gentile; between one nation and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but in every nation under the whole heaven, whoeſover believe in the only begotten Son of God, they are "heirs of the promiſe, and ſhall be ſavingly "bleſſed with faithful Abraham."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:009088_0024_10311BDECBF8AE98"/>THE apoſtle Paul expreſsly aſſures us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. II 13th to the 18th.</note> that the nations of men, which "ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt; for he is our peace," the common peace of Jews and Gentiles, "having broke down the wall of partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between us, and reconciled us both to God in one body by the croſs:" In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof believing Gentiles "are no more ſtrangers and foreigners, but fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens with the ſaints and houſhold of God." Accordingly, that is his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. X.12, 13.</note> There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the ſame Lord over all is rich unto all that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. For whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved." And again, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. III.28, 29.</note> "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus: And if ye are Chriſt's, then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe."</p>
            <p>CONSONANT hereto was the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion our Lord gave his apoſtles to preach the goſpel, the glad tidings of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the "bleſſing promiſed to Abraham." That was their order,<note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. XXVIII.19.</note> "Go
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009088_0025_10311BE1599627D8"/>
ye, and teach ALL NATIONS, baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt." It is elſewhere <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark XVI.15.</note> worded, "Go ye into ALL THE WORLD, and preach the goſpel to EVERY CREATURE," the whole human race. And it is in fact true, that they preached the goſpel, ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, not to the Jews only, but to the Gentiles alſo, without diſcrimination, that is, to all nations and families of the earth, ſo far as they were able, making no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p>THE Jewiſh nation, 'tis true, were to have the precedence. The goſpel was firſt to be preached to them; but not to the excluſion of the other nations. They alſo were comprehended, yea, expreſsly mentioned, in the promiſe to Abraham: And, in fulfilment of this promiſe, the goſpel ought to be, and actually was, preached to them. A ſpecimen of this we meet with immediately upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's being poured out upon the apoſtles on the day of Pentecoſt; for "devout men, out of every nation under heaven," being now at Jeruſalem, the "bleſſing," contained in the "promiſe to Abraham," was offered to them in the name of Jeſus
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts II.</note>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009088_0026_10311BE2E04A9DE8"/>
Chriſt. And it is evident, from the preaching, eſpecially of the apoſtle Paul, that no diſtinction was made between one nation and another, between one man and another; but in all places, and to all perſons, as there was opportunity, the way to ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt was impartially made known.</p>
            <p>THE language, in which the <hi>actually bleſſed</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt, the promiſed ſeed, are ſpoken of in ſcripture, is a further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable proof, that the nations, in all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth, in all ages, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction or limitation, are the object of the promiſe in my text. They are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the book of the Revelation,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. V.9, 10.</note> "Singing a new ſong to Jeſus the lamb of God," and ſaying, "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof; for thou haſt redeemed us to God, by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, and haſt made us unto God kings and prieſts." And the apoſtle John "beheld in viſion.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. VII 9, 10.</note> and lo, a great multitude of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, ſtood before the throne, and before the Lamb,—and cried with a loud voice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Salvation to our God, — and unto
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009088_0027_10311BE64DD18190"/>
the Lamb." And no wonder this is the repreſentation; for the "bleſſed in Jeſus Chriſt," in the coming ſtate, will be a collection of all ſorts and conditions of men, out of all nations, in all parts and ages of the world, even from the days of Adam, till time ſhall be no more. It is accordingly to be remarked here, the "bleſſing" promiſed to "all nations" looks backwards as well as forwards; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in all believers, like Abraham, from the beginning of the world to that day, as well as from that day to the end of the world. Hence Chriſt, the promiſed ſeed, is ſpoken of, in the revelation to John, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. XIII.8.</note> as "the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world," that is, in the purpoſe, and according to the counſel of God; and ſo as that obedient believers of all nations of the earth, even from the day that God promiſed and ſaid, "the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head," might be admitted to the benefit of "redemption thro' his blood, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of their ſins, according to the riches of God's grace."</p>
            <p>THUS gloriouſly extenſive is the OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECT of the bleſſing thro' the promiſed ſeed. 'Tis not confined to the nation of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009088_0028_10311BE8C276BCC0"/>
the Jews in diſtinction from the Gentiles; neither is it limited to ſome Gentile-nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the excluſion of others: But "all nations of the earth," from the beginning of the world to the end of it, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in it.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now ſaid what may be tho't ſufficient to illuſtrate the promiſe in my text. It remains to make what has been offered uſeful, by calling your attention to ſome ſuitable reflections. And,</p>
            <p>THE firſt thing obviouſly perceivable is, that the bleſſing mankind in Jeſus Chriſt was the aim of God, and what he has been proſecuting, all along from the beginning of the world. This was at firſt ſuggeſted only in general promiſes and predictions, and theſe ſo worded as that Adam, Abraham, Moſes, David, and the Prophets, had not a clear and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive underſtanding of the things virtually and really intended by them. And, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it would not have conſiſted with the grand intermediate ſtep in the affair of man's ſalvation, the ſufferings and death of Jeſus Chriſt, to have ſpoken more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly upon the matter, till this had been accompliſhed. But ſtill, ſo much was
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009088_0029_10311BEB94E1EAB0"/>
ſaid in the promiſes of God to Adam and Abraham, and in the propheſies he inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his prophets to deliver, that it was known in general, that ſome great deſign of mercy, by ſome extraordinary perſon that ſhould be born of a woman, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Abraham, was in proſecution; tho' they could not particularly ſay, what this mercy was, or how it would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed thro' this "ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man," and "of Abraham." The clear and full knowledge of theſe things was reſerved to after-times, and has according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been revealed in theſe "laſt days." And to us, who are able to view the ſcheme of God, as it has been explained by the birth, life, death, reſurrection and exaltation of Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the goſpel-kingdom in the world, with its means, motives, and advantages, in order to effect men's ſalvation, it very evidently appears to be one uniform con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent deſign, begun in the days of Adam, and carried on thro' the times of Abraham, Moſes, and the prophets, till the coming of Jeſus Chriſt; who, in conſequence of his humiliation to death, went up to heaven, and ſets there at the right hand of God, cloathed with all power, that he might finiſh this plan, and finally bring it into
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009088_0030_10311BED1B490410"/>
effect. And it is, with me, one of the ſtrongeſt evidences of the truth of the goſpel, and the revelation contained in it, that the promiſe to Abraham, as well as that to Adam, and the other ſimilar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and predictions, are ſo expreſſed as that the ſcheme of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, as unfolded in the new-teſtament writings, is very obviouſly, however ſummarily, pointed out in them; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a ſober enquirer can ſcarce fail of being ſatisfied, that one and the ſame plan has been in proſecution from the beginning; which plan, however dark to former ages, as to it's particulars, is now, in the times of the goſpel, made ſufficiently manifeſt to all men.</p>
            <p>IT is likewiſe natural to expect, from what has been ſaid, that great multitudes will be bleſſed in Jeſus Chriſt. For the bleſſing thro' him is promiſed to "all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and families of the earth." And can it be ſuppoſed, when the promiſe is thus gloriouſly extenſive, as to its object, that a few only will be bleſſed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it?</p>
            <p>WHETHER we underſtand by this bleſſing, goſpel means and advantages,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009088_0031_10311BF17091F9A8"/>
under the adminiſtration of God's viſible kingdom by his Son Jeſus Chriſt: or the end theſe means are deſigned to effect, the bringing men to heavenly happineſs: —it will not be confined to a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but comprehend a vaſt multitude.</p>
            <p>THE goſpel has already been preached to, and the kingdom of the Son of God in fact ſettled among, a great many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth: inſomuch that if we reckon the individuals that now conſtitute theſe collective bodies of men, and have been their conſtituent parts thro' the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſucceſſive ages, ſince Chriſt was made known to them, they will be vaſtly numerous: And the account will ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and riſe almoſt beyond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we carry our thoughts to thoſe numberleſs individuals who may yet be brought into exiſtence, and form theſe communities in all future ages.</p>
            <p>AND the number of thoſe, who have not only had the kingdom of God among them, but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in them to their being made meet for the heavenly kingdom, and actually admitted into it will be vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great likewiſe. To this purpoſe "the redeemed to God, by the blood of Chriſt,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009088_0032_10311BF2F69CD1D8"/>
out of every kindred, and tongue, and nation," is ſaid, in the book of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. V.2.</note> to be "ten-thouſand times ten-thouſand, and thouſand of thouſands." And the individuals out of "all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues," who ſhall finally "ſtand before the throne, and cry, ſalvation to our God and to the Lamb," are again repreſented <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. VII.4, 10.</note> as "a great multitude which no man can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber." From which ſacred declarations we have full warrant to ſay, that the bleſſed by Chriſt the promiſed ſeed of Abraham, conſidered as one collective body, made up of all the individuals that will be ſaved, out of all nations, and in all ages from the days of Adam, will be an inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably great multitude! Nor is this any other than the fulfilment of the word, which God ſpake of old to his ſervant Abraham, when, upon bidding him "look towards heaven, and tell the ſtars if he were able to number them," he ſaid, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gen. XV.5</note> "SO SHALL THY SEED-BE."</p>
            <p>IT may pertinently alſo be recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, from the preceding diſcourſe, to exert ourſelves, in all proper ways, that the barbarous nations, inhabiting theſe American lands, may become partakers
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009088_0033_10311BF5A2760D50"/>
of the ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.—This ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the ſubject-matter of my text, the bleſſing it promiſes; and it is juſtly applicable to theſe tribes of men. As they are comprehended in the "all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons" who ſhall be "bleſſed in the ſeed of Abraham," they conſtitute a part of the OBJECT of this divine engagement, and as truely ſo as any other communities of the human race. And, it may be, they were particularly ranked, in the counſels of God, among the nations that ſhould eventually be bleſſed thro' the ſeed here promiſed; though it was not till after-ages that they were bro't into actual exiſtence. We have ſuch an obſervable paſſage as that in the book of Pſalms, <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm LXXIV.20.</note> "Have reſpect unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty." The words may be looked upon as a prophetic prayer, looking forward to the times of Chriſt, when the covenant-promiſe to Abraham ſhould be fulfilled: And the argument enforcing the prayer is, that there were places in "the earth covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," whoſe inhabitants were, in a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſenſe, "barbarous and cruel." Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, no places in the earth were ever more dark, and at the ſame time more
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009088_0034_10311BF7287C8468"/>
given to cruelty, than theſe American regions, as poſſeſſed by the ab-originals. The Spirit who ſpake thro' David might have in view the nations in theſe parts of the earth, and, upon the foreſight of their deplorably ſad condition, pray God to "reſpect the covenant," his covenant with Abraham, which promiſed a bleſſing to theſe, among the other nations; a bleſſing that would "turn them from darkneſs to light," and of ſavage and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, make them the peaceable, kind and tender-hearted diſciples of the meek and compaſſionate Jeſus. And theſe nations alſo might be eſpecially meant in that grant to the Son of God and ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm II.8.</note> "I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the UTTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOST PARTS OF THE EARTH for thy poſſeſſion." It may be, the epithet, UT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERMOST, can be applied to no parts of the earth with more propriety, than to theſe American lands. But whether they are particularly intended, or not; 'tis as certain the tribes of men inhabiting here are included in the promiſe to Abraham, as that they are nations exiſting on the earth; for the promiſe extends to all ſuch without limitation.</p>

The "glad tidings of joy to all people," ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, has been made known to, and embraced by, them. It is freely owned, neither our fathers, who came over to this Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican wilderneſs for the ſake of enjoying themſelves, and tranſmitting to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, the goſpel-worſhip in its purity and ſimplicity; nor we their children have exerted ourſelves, as we might and ought to have done, to propagate the knowledge of the one true and living God, and his only begotten Son, among the ignorant and ſavage people in theſe "regions of the ſhadow of death:" Yet, ſomething has been done both by them and us, tho' more from abroad, to effect this bleſſed purpoſe: Nor have theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the Lord been wholly in vain. The ſacred books of the old and new-teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament have, by the ſkill and labor of the memorable ELIOT, been tranſlated into the Indian language, and charitably put into their hands, for their inſtruction in the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and of Chriſt: And thro' his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous endeavours, with thoſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned MAYHEWS, and other worthies,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009088_0036_10311BFCF83144E8"/>
a conſiderable number of churches, under the divine bleſſing, have been gathered, conſiſting of Indian members, many of whom have given proof of the reality of their converſion, by their walking in the faith and order of the goſpel, ſo as to "adorn the doctrine of the Saviour Jeſus Chriſt." And ſome of theſe churches are remaining to this day, with Engliſh or Indian paſtors at their head; tho' they are, it muſt be confeſſed and lamented, in a declining ſtate. And, in truth, the Indians, within this and the neighbouring colonies of Connecticut, Rhode-Iſland, and New-Hampſhire, are ſtrangely dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. A few only are left; and it looks as tho', in time not far diſtant, their race would be extinct.<note n="*" place="bottom">Within my remembrance, the Indians at Natick and Punkapog [two ancient Indian ſettlements within 15 miles of Boſton] were conſiderably numerous; but there are few now remaining. I can aſſign no other natural cauſe of this ſtrange fact, than the neceſſity theſe Indians were under, by being ſurrounded by Engliſh towns, to change their ſimple plain way of living for our's. And if this ſhould be the true natural cauſe, it affords a very powerful reaſon, why, in order to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianize the Indian nations, we ſhould not think ourſelves obliged to conce<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

If they ſhould not dwell in ſuch houſes, or wear ſuch clothes, or labor in ſuch employments, or come into the uſe of ſuch modes of civility, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among us, I know not that it would be any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the Goſpel among them. Perhaps, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they are in of providing for themſelves and families by hunting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fiſhing, and fowling, is as innocent, and free from temptation, as any they could change it for. I am perſuaded, ſhould they change it for that CIVILIZED ONE, which ſome are ready to think ſo highly neceſſary, their danger of being enticed and drawn aſide of their own luſts would be vaſtly increaſed. Where they now have one temptation to play upon their paſſions, to ſooth their affections, and inordinately to gratify their natural appetites, they would then have a great many. The plain truth is, if the Goſpel once takes place among them in its power, it will effect the beſt change in them we can deſire. The ſpiritual, and it may be the true, meaning of Iſai. xi.6—9. would then have a glorious and happy accompliſhment. They who were ravenous in their diſpoſition would undergo a transformation, as if a wolf ſhould change his nature, and of ſavage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gentle ſo as to feed with lambs; or as if the leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard ſhould put off his fierceneſs, and lie down with the kids. The roughneſs of their temper would be ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their paſſions ſoftned and refined, and they would be prompted, from the change introduced in them, to the exerciſe not only of humanity, but true chriſtian meekneſs, kindneſs, gentleneſs and goodneſs, as occaſion might be offered therefor in the providence of God. —It may be worth remembring here. The French never uſed any endeavours to change the Indian's mode of civil life; and yet, they have found ways to attach many tribes of them very ſtrongly to the religion of Rome. And why may not we, in like manner, attach them to the religion of Chriſt? Should we expend as much zeal and pains to make them Chriſtians, as the French have done to make them Catholics, we ſhould, I doubt not, ſoon ſee the happy fruits of it; tho' no care ſhould be taken to bring them into our way of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

I have diſcourſed with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with this view, and find that ſeveral are well-eſtabliſhed in the eſſential doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of chriſtianity, and have a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form practical ſenſe of religion upon their minds.—We have ſet up a ſchool here, <note n="‖" place="bottom">The Indian children might be inſtructed in their own towns at a much leſs expence, than if they were brought to live among us. The coſt of bringing them would be very conſiderable; and they muſt be permitted every now-and-then to make a viſit to their parents and friends, which would be a great additional charge. They muſt alſo be boarded and clothed, which would run the expence very high. Whereas, if they were taught where they now live, they might be maintained by their parents; and the only charge worth mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be that of ſupporting ſchool-maſters. More, it may be, would be required for the ſupport of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors among the Indians, than among ourſelves; but this greater charge would be ſmall in compariſon with me charge the other way. And the children might, in their own towns, as conveniently come to ſchool, as if they were among us; for the Indian wigwams are every where nearer to one another, than the Engliſh houſes in any of our villages. One ſchool in a town would therefore very well anſwer all the ends we have in view, as none of the towns are ſo large, but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in all of them might eaſily meet together every day for inſtruction. For theſe reaſons, one of the principal things entruſted with our miſſionaries is, to endeavour to prepare the way for ſetting up ſchools for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Indian children in whatever it may be proper to inſtruct them.

We have had about a dozen a day for about twenty days, and find the children are very much pleaſed with it, and give their conſtant and ſeaſonable attendance, without any conſtraint from their parents. Some of them make ſurpriſing proficiency, pronounce the whole alphabet well, and know each letter; and four have got to pronunce diſtinct ſyllables pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. They appear to be, in general,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009088_0044_10311C1103D1F378"/>
very promiſing children. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are vaſtly pleaſed, that two of our lads <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe lads are about 12 years of age, and as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing as any among us. They are, with their own free conſent, devoted to the Indian-ſervice for life, if God, in his providence, ſhall pleaſe to make way for their being uſeful. 'Tis deſigned they ſhould continue with the Indians, till they have learned their language. Care is taken that they may be under proper tuition in the Indian country; and when they can converſe in their tongue with the ſame freedom as in their own, they will be brought from thence, and put under the beſt means of education we have, in order to their being qualified for miſſionary preachers, or ſchool-maſters, or whatever elſe they may be moſt turned for. I may add, beſides theſe lads we have a young man under edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at our College in Cambridge; who will, we truſt, be fit for ſervice, as a ſchool-maſter, if not as a miſſionary-preacher, as ſoon as there will be occaſion for him.</note> are come to be with them to learn their language; and have, of their own accord, offered three of their's, whom they would ſend to New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to learn our language; but I told them, I muſt wait the pleaſure of the commiſſioners, before I could give any encouragement to take them with me.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">We have not encouraged the ſending theſe boys; and, as we imagine, for very good reaſons. The charge of bringing them from their own homes, and educating them among us, would be very great. We have felt the truth of this, as we lately found ourſelves obliged to pay nearly 60 l. ſterling in leſs than one year for three boys only: on which account we thought ourſelves bound, in faithfulneſs to thoſe who have entruſted their money with us, not to ſpend any more of it in this way, which appears to us enormouſly expenſive. There are other inconveniences in taking lads from the Indian-country;—We can have no ſecurity, whatever expence is laid out upon them, that they ſhall be afterwards em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſuch ſervice as we judge proper: Neither can we know, previouſly to their coming to us, whether their capacities, temper, and inclination to learn, are ſuch as we ſhould chooſe in the children we would be at the charge to educate; and, after all the pains and expence in educating them, they may be viciouſly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or their character otherwiſe ſuch as would unfit them to be employed by us in the ſervice for which they might be eſpecially intended and wanted. Whereas, by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Indian-children in their own towns, theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences will all be avoided. The charge will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a ſmall thing comparatively;—we may ſelect out of a whole ſchool the moſt promiſing youth for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers, good temper, and a pious diſpoſition;— and we might get ſecurity from their parents, that they ſhall be employed in the ſervice their education is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fit them for.—Beſides all this, Engliſh lads will be far the likelieſt, when their education is finiſh'd, to ſerve as interpreters, ſchool-maſters, or miſſionary-preachers. Indians, though fitted, in a good meaſure, for theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, will not have that honor in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and among their own people, which is highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in order to their being uſeful; nor can they with deſirable confidence be relied on.

<q>We have got all our matters ripe to make propoſals to the Indians, and wait only the return of Adam, their chief, who is now expected. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are of a very obliging diſpoſition, and well-diſpoſed toward religion. — Thomas King made a ſpeech in the name of two or three, (who had not been preſent at any of their former councils) in which he expreſſed a very grateful ſenſe of the care the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners have taken of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant intereſt among them, and, for his own part, he greatly rejoiced that

And is it not to be lamented alſo, and more bitterly, that RUM, which is ſo bewitching to them, ſhould be put into their hands, in ſuch quantities, by Chriſtians, ſo called, while they know, at the ſame time, the miſchief it does among them.

this "ſnare of the Devil."

But you have no reaſon to be diſcouraged. The cauſe you are engaged in is nobly great and good. It is the cauſe of God; it is the cauſe of Chriſt; it is the cauſe, the promoting of which lies in "ſhewing men the way of ſalvation," through the atoning blood of the once crucified, but now exalted and glorified Jeſus. The deſign of your miſſion nearly reſembles that of the apoſtles of our Lord. You are "ſet," as they were, "a light to the "Gentiles, that thou ſhouldeſt be for ſalvation to the ends of the earth;" you are to go, as they did, to nations whoſe "minds the god of this world hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the light of the glorious goſpel of

And as the chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of your miſſion is, that "this bleſſing" may be extended to theſe people, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the promiſe of God, will he be wanting in any thing proper, on his part, in order to your being ſucceeded
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009088_0051_10311C22EC32BA50"/>
in a deſign ſo beneficial in it's nature, and that tends ſo much to the glory of his name, and the enlargement of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his dear Son? It cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. It may rather be hoped, that he will fulfil in you that which is written, <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. LV.5.</note> "Behold, thou ſhalt call a nation thou knoweſt not; and nations that know not thee ſhall run unto thee, becauſe of the Lord thy God; for he hath glorified thee."</p>
            <p>AND if this ſhould be the happy effect of your miſſion to the Indian nations, how ſignally would you ſerve your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as your God and Saviour? What honor would it reflect on you; what a bleſſing would you be to theſe lands, if you ſhould be the choſen inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſubduing the Savages of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, making them his willing and obedient ſubjects? Your ſervice herein would be far more important than the victories over them in war, which have coſt ſo much blood and treaſure; as they would now be good neighbours to us, and dwell by us in love and peace, being, in common with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, heirs of the ſame hope of eternal life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:009088_0052_10311C2561453640"/>I CANNOT, in conſideration of ſuch ſervice, however important, enſure you an adequate reward from men; but as this ſervice done for them will, at the ſame time, be a ſervice done for God and Chriſt, "great ſhall be your reward in heaven." Having, by your faithful labours, under the influence of the Spirit of grace, turned theſe heathen people from "darkneſs to light," you ſhall "ſhine in the kingdom of your father, as the brightneſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars forever and ever." Yea, ſhould the deſign of your miſſion fail of being anſwered; ſhould "you labour in vain, and ſpend your ſtrength for nought and in vain;" yet, if you are faithful, you ſhall "in no wiſe loſe your reward." Even in caſe of fruitleſs labour, "your judgment is with the Lord, and your work with your God;" and he will render to you, at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, not according to the ſucceſs you have met with, but according to the integrity of your heart, and the greatneſs of the trials you have gone thro' in your upright endeavours to promote the good of periſhing ſouls. And, having "been faithful to death," he will, of his rich grace, thro' the merits of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's blood, beſtow upon you "the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009088_0053_10311C274401E8D0"/>
crown that fadeth not away," a glorious immortality in the heavenly world.</p>
            <p>I NOW turn myſelf to this great aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and would beſpeak your prayers for "this man of God," who is about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout himſelf to the ſervice of Chriſt among a people of a "ſtrange ſpeech and hard language," and who, at the ſame time, are invelop'd with groſs darkneſs. "Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, pray for him," and for his "com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion alſo in the kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt," gone before on this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult buſineſs, that "the word of the Lord," diſpenſed by them, "may have free courſe, and be glorified" among the Indian nations, as it has been among us, and much more abundantly: Pray for them, that "utterance may be given to them," ſo as "that they may open their mouths boldly to make known the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the goſpel" to theſe ignorant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: Pray for them, that God would "cauſe them to triumph in Chriſt," while they "make manifeſt the favour of his knowledge in every place" they may be called to; and that they "may be unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, a ſavour of life unto life" to many who, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, are "dead in treſpaſſes and ſins." And "pray with all prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009088_0054_10311C29B82E2808"/>
in the Spirit, watching thereunto with all perſeverance." Pray and ceaſe not, "always making mention of them in your prayers," that they may be ſtrengthned with all might, according to God's glorious power, unto all patience and long-ſuffering, with joyfulneſs" in beholding theſe unhappy people "delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the power of darkneſs, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the kingdom of God's dear Son."</p>
            <p>AND together with your prayers, let me invite you to give of your ſubſtance for their bodily ſupport and comfort. Some of you, thanks be to God, have very liberally ſubſcribed towards a FUND that is intended, if the Lord pleaſes, to yield a <hi>perpetual</hi> income for the ſervice of Chriſt among the Indians; as alſo towards bearing the expence we may be called to in our endeavours, for the three or four firſt years, to carry the goſpel to them: But, as the ſubſcription towards the FUND will not take place till the late INCORPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATING ACT ſhall receive the ROYAL SANCTION; and as the <hi>temporary</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, tho' kindly aſſiſted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from the LONDON-SOCIETY, and by the CORPORATION OF HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VARD-COLLEGE, who are intruſted with the diſpoſal of Dr. WILLIAMS's legacy
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009088_0055_10311C2D22750B80"/>
for the inſtruction of the Indians: I ſay, as this <hi>temporary</hi> ſubſcription, with the aids afforded to it, is for the preſent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to anſwer the neceſſary demands, we think it our duty to call upon thoſe, who have not yet had opportunity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, to expreſs their regards to Chriſt by now offering freely to promote his cauſe.</p>
            <p>AND were our views, in this matter, confined to this world only, there would not be wanting powerful inducements to prompt us to liberality. We ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by attach the Indians to our intereſt; at leaſt, we ſhould do that which would happily tend to anſwer ſo good a purpoſe. Had we, in times paſt, been at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that was neceſſary in order to their inſtruction in the things of God and Jeſus Chriſt, inſtead of "ſnares and traps to us, ſcourges in our ſides and thorns in our eyes," they might have been our faſt friends, and maintained a correſpondence with us to our advantage as well as their own. The French nation have taught us this to our ſorrow as well as coſt.— They have all along made it a point to ſupport miſſionaries among the Indians, wherever they could; and to this chiefly it is owing, that they have had ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over them. By the pains they have
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009088_0056_10311C2FA8AB3588"/>
taken to convert them, not to the faith of Chriſt, but to the religion of Rome, they have been able to uſe them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in bringing into effect their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deſigns againſt us; and by them they have committed thoſe barbarities we ſhould never have felt, could they not have excuſed themſelves by transferring the ſhame of them to theſe ſavages in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with them. And as there are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tribes of them untainted as yet with Romiſh ſuperſtition, would it not be wiſe policy to uſe all proper endeavours to bring them to the faith, not "of a lie," but "of the truth as it is in Jeſus?" Would not this, in the end, be the leaſt expenſive method to make and keep them our good friends and peaceable neighbours?</p>
            <p>BUT there are much higher motives to excite in us a zeal to promote the intereſt of Chriſt among the Indian tribes, and much nobler principles to act from in the charitable expreſſions of it. — We ſhould be conſtrained from gratitude to God; that God, who, by crowning the Britiſh arms, in theſe American lands, with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs beyond even our biggeſt expectations, has opened a wide door for ſending the goſpel to the Gentiles inhabiting here. And in what more proper way can we
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009088_0057_10311C321D4A98A0"/>
manifeſt the ſenſe we have of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the ſupreme Ruler, than by taking occaſion from the ſignal victories he has given us to contribute to the enlargement of the kingdom of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt? If our MOTHER-COUNTY, and HE THAT SWAYS THE SCEPTRE THERE, ſhould, by pious donations, encourage ſuch meaſures as are wiſely concerted to ſpread the religion of Jeſus in theſe diſtant and dark corners of the world, would it be an unſuitable acknowledgment to "the King of Kings" for the great things he has done for them, as well as us? May we not rather ſay, thus "to do good and communicate" would be "an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God"?—Love to Chriſt ſhould likewiſe open our hearts and hands upon this occaſion. 'Tis in his cauſe, and to promote the honor of his name, that we are urged to bountifulneſs: And how powerfully is this motive adapted to work upon us? Shall we pretend an affection to the Saviour of men, and not exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as we are able, and have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to ſpread the knowledge of his religion, and extend the borders of his kingdom? If we hang back, or diſcover a niggardly diſpoſition, "how dwelleth the love of Chriſt in us"? It may be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009088_0058_10311C33DFBF3A50"/>
feared, it does not "in deed and in truth," tho' it ſhould "in word and in tongue." —Love alſo to the ſouls of our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, blinded by the God of this world, and periſhing in the darkneſs of ignorance and ſin, ſhould move our hearts. Who among the ſons of Adam are more proper objects of our chriſtian compaſſion? And how ſhould it operate, if not in charitable endeavours, that they may be "tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the light of the glorious goſpel"? With what face of truth can we profeſs religious kindneſs towards them, if we cannot find without ourſelves a diſpoſition to be at ſome ſmall expence to encourage the uſe of means to prevent their being "hurt of the ſecond death"?</p>
            <p>THERE are, I truſt, a good number here preſent, who "love Chriſt that firſt loved them," and thoſe alſo who are "ungodly and without ſtrength," as they were themſelves when Chriſt died "for them." And will ſuch be ſtraitned in their own bowels, when they have a fair opportunity to aſſiſt in enlarging the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt, and ſaving the ſouls of thoſe who are in a loſt condition? They will rather exert themſelves with all chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and liberality in carrying ſo noble a deſign into execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:009088_0059_10311C3657359EB0"/>I CANNOT wiſh any thing better for the people here aſſembled, or for the people in this town, and throughout the land, than that Chriſt and immortal ſouls may be precious to them, as they are to thoſe that believe. They would not then ſpend their money in that furniture for their houſes, or attendance on their perſons, or ornament to their bodies, which the diſtinction God has made between them and others does not call for, but is the fruit of pride and vain-glory: they would not ſpend it in ſupporting criminal amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and inglorious paſtimes, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the mind, and indiſpoſe it to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of piety and devotion; and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides greatly hurtful to ſociety: much leſs would they ſpend it in that luxurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate way of living, which tends to pamper luſt, and render it headſtrong and impetuous. They would rather be inclined, not only to refrain from theſe extravagancies, but to deny themſelves, at leaſt for a time, and in ſome inſtances, as there might be occaſion, even the conveniences of life, that they might be better able to diſtribute to the purpoſes of charity, eſpecially to the ſouls of men: Nor ſhould we, if this love to Chriſt and ſouls was generally prevalent, be at any
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009088_0060_10311C39CC0CF600"/>
loſs for a ſufficiency to proſecute the great and good deſign that is now happily begun.</p>
            <p>MAY it be abundantly proſpered, and in the hands of thoſe who are, at preſent, employed in carrying it on! And may the time be haſtened, when the Son of God, and Saviour of men, "ſhall have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from ſea to ſea," and be "King over all the earth"! when "men ſhall be bleſſed in him, and all nations ſhall call him bleſſed"!</p>
            <p>"BLESSED be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael, who only doth wondrous things: And bleſſed be his glorious name forever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory: AMEN, and AMEN"</p>
