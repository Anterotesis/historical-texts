            <title>A serious address to the members of the Episcopal separation in New-England. Occasioned by Mr. Wetmore's Vindication of the professors of the Church of England in Connecticut. : Being an attempt to fix and settle these three points, I. Whether the inhabitants of the British plantations in America, those of New-England in particular, are obliged, in point of duty, by the laws of God or man, to conform to the prelatic church, by law established in the south part of Great Britain. II. Whether it be proper in point of prudence for those who are already settled in such churches as have so long subsisted in New-England, to forsake them and go over to that communion. III. Whether it be lawful for particular members of New-England churches to separate from them, and join in communion with the Episcopal assemblies in the country. / By Noah Hobart, A.M.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I am obliged to you all by the Laws of <hi>Humanity</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> ſo I look on my ſelf as ſtanding in a <hi>Paſtoral Relation</hi> to ſome of you; ſuch of you, I mean, as have ſeparated from the particular Church of which <hi>the Holy Ghoſt hath made me Overſeer:</hi> For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think your forſaking our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without ever giving me an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to anſwer and remove thoſe Doubts and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you laboured under, can diſſolve the <hi>ſacred</hi> Relation which before ſubſiſted between us. I therefore eſteem it my Duty to promote, as far as I am able, the beſt Good of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006158_0005_1027F8959BD86330"/>you all; and that particularly by endeavouring to reclaim you from the Error of your preſent dangerous Ways. This Duty would be much more pleaſant to me, if I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it in a Way agreable to you. I take no Pleaſure in <hi>noiſy Debate,</hi> much leſs in <hi>angry Controverſy.</hi> And I don't know any Thing but a Senſe of Duty, a Deſire to promote the Intereſt of Religion, and your Advantage, that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to expoſe my ſelf to that <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> which are too commonly the Conſequence of appearing in this Cauſe; and which I expected when I engaged in it. Some of you can teſtify for me, that I once ſtood as high in the Eſteem and Friendſhip of your Party as moſt of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Miniſtry in theſe Parts; and I would gladly uſe all lawful Means for continuing ſo: But if encouraging you in dangerous Errors, or neglecting to defend important Truths, be the Price of your Friendſhip, I muſt ſay you hold it too dear; and how greatly ſoever I value it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not purchaſe it at this Rate. I had rather be the Object of your Ill-Will for diſcharging my Duty to you, than be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by you for neglecting it.</p>
            <p>But why, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> ſhould I be looked on as <hi>your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, becauſe I tell you the Truth?</hi> Or what can juſtify thoſe ſevere and unchriſtian Reſentments that have been expreſſed on my publiſhing the SERMON I delivered at the Ordination at <hi>Stanford?</hi> Is it not highly reaſonable, and even neceſſary, nay, do not you your ſelves expect, and ſometimes even <hi>demand</hi> it of us, that we ſhould juſtify the Principles we act upon? And is any Time more proper and ſeaſonable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon and defend <hi>Preſbyterian Ordination,</hi> than when it is to be practiſed? Would not you ſay we were ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if we did not <hi>ſometimes</hi> inſiſt upon this Subject on ſuch Occaſions? Suppoſe a Sermon preached at the Ordination of one of your Miniſters, on the Neceſſity of <hi>Epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> would you not think it very unreaſonable in any of us to diſturb the Aſſembly by leaving it in Reſentment, in the Time of divine Worſhip; and to fill the Country after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with Noiſe and Clamour againſt the Preacher? Would
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006158_0006_1027F89770C7F5F8"/>you not ſay, in ſuch a Caſe, That we might reaſonably have expected ſuch a Sermon on ſuch an Occaſion; and therefore ought either not to have attended at all, or elſe to have ſtaid and heard it out? And if ſuch a Sermon was afterwards publiſhed, would you not ſay, that it became us rather fairly to anſwer the Argument offered in it, than to threaten, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and defame the Author of it? Now this is exactly what I have to ſay in my Caſe. I had a juſt <hi>Right</hi> to offer my Sentiments in the Controverſy between us and you, I choſe a ſuitable <hi>Occaſion</hi> to do it. And as I am fully perſwaded, on long and impartial Conſideration, that your ſeparating from us is wrong in itſelf, and prejudicial to your ſelves, your Poſterity, and your Country, in it's Conſequences; eſpecially as it tends to the Deſtruction of <hi>practical Religion,</hi> and the Introduction of Immorality and Prophaneneſs, I eſteemed my ſelf under ſtrong Obligations to tell you this in the plaineſt and moſt publick Manner; and to endeavour to convince you of it, and impreſs a Senſe thereof on your Conſciences. And what is there in all this to raiſe or juſtify the Reſentment that has been diſcovered in the Caſe? Why muſt Arguments againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> even tho' they are unanſwerable, be ſtiled <hi>Invectives</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s Vindication, Title Page.</note>, and <hi>Rebuke for his Inſolence,</hi> be propoſed as <hi>the moſt proper Anſwer to be given</hi> the Author<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 25.</note>? Why muſt he be treated with ſo much Contempt, as to be ſtiled, <hi>His humble Saintſhip</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 42.</note>? But above all, Why muſt he be <hi>boldly charged with groſs Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication and Falſhood, done with a wicked Intent,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 22.</note>, when all that is pretended in juſtification of this <hi>bold Charge,</hi> amounts to no more than this, That he was led into a Miſtake by tranſcribing from an Author whom he named, and whom he might take to be worthy of Credit? This, I ſay, is all that is <hi>pretended</hi> to ſupport this <hi>bold Charge,</hi> and 'tis a great deal more than is true; as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. But in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006158_0007_1027F89B9757EFD8"/>mean Time, is this the Way to convince me, if I were in an Error? Does your <hi>Vindicator</hi> think it the beſt Method to recommend himſelf or his Cauſe to the World? Or will he pretend to reconcile ſuch Treatment to his own Declaration, That <hi>if any Objections are thought weighty and forceable againſt conforming</hi> [to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>] he and you <hi>ſhould all be pleaſed to ſee them offered in their full Strength, that</hi> you <hi>may thereby be reclaimed from deſtructive Errors, if</hi> you <hi>have embraced them, or have Oppoptunity, by refuting ſuch in</hi> THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS, <hi>to repreſent Truth in it's native Luſtre</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 6.</note>? Such Reflections as I have mentioned, prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs it be, that the Author of them is very <hi>angry</hi> and very <hi>impotent;</hi> and ſo long as there remains any Senſe of good Nature and Politeneſs, Mankind will be apt to judge, that no Man who was able to defend his Cauſe in a fair, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and generous Manner, would treat an Antagoniſt in ſuch a Way as this; and therefore conclude, either that your Cauſe is bad, or that your Advocate is ill choſen. For my own Part, I can patiently bear ſuch Abuſes, knowing I have not deſerved them, and expecting to convince you and the World that they are injurious, when I come to conſider the Paragraphs which contain them. And in the mean Time, inſtead of <hi>rendring Evil for Evil, and Railing for Railing,</hi> I chuſe to imitate him, <hi>who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, threatened not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> I proceed therefore to what more immediately concerns the Controverſy between us.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has given us your Opinion in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, in theſe Words, <q>We aſſert the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in all the Territories belonging to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to be <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> in Reſpect of the Laws of God and Man: We aſſert it to be not only <hi>expedient</hi> but <hi>neceſſary</hi> too, in order to diſcharge the <hi>Duty</hi> we owe to God, and the Peace and Order of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006158_0008_1027F89D1FC7A690"/>that every Man that has Opportunity, ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually embrace this Communion. Men not only conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with their Duty <hi>may,</hi> but to diſcharge their Duty <hi>muſt</hi> be of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if they are Members of the Nation of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> Page 6. This Way of expreſſing the Point in diſpute is <hi>inaccurate,</hi> and may be apt to lead you into a Miſtake; I ſhall therefore ſtate the Matter more exactly. And would obſerve, that ſtrictly ſpeaking, there is no ſuch Thing as the "<hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> England". The Iſland of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly divided into a great Number of petty Sovereignties, the <hi>South</hi> Part of it (commonly called <hi>England</hi>) was in the Days of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors, divided into <hi>ſeven</hi> diſtinct Kingdoms, and continued ſo for ſeveral Ages.

               </gap> all theſe were united and incorporated in one Monarchy by the Name of the <hi>Kingdom of England,</hi> the <hi>northern</hi> Part of the Iſland remained for many Ages a diſtinct Monarchy, under the Name of <hi>the Kingdom of Scotland.</hi> But about <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Years ago theſe two Kingdoms were united in one entire and grand Monarchy, to be forever after called and known by the Name of the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> GREAT-BRITAIN. So that it is now as really improper to ſpeak of <hi>"the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England"</hi> as it is to ſpeak of the <hi>Kingdom of Kent;</hi> for as <hi>Kent,</hi> which was an independent Kingdom during the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy,</hi> upon it's being ſubdued by EGBERT King of <hi>Weſſex, Anno</hi> 824, ceaſed to be a diſtinct Kingdom, and became a Part of that into which it was incorporated; So the <hi>Kingdom of England</hi> being incorporated with the <hi>Kingdom of Scotland,</hi> by the ACT OF UNION, <hi>Anno</hi> 1707, ceaſed to be a diſtinct Kingdom, and has ever ſince been conſidered as a Part of the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> On this Occaſion the <hi>Royal Style</hi> was changed from <hi>King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,</hi> into <hi>King of Great Britain, France and Ireland.</hi> And from this Time, when there is Occaſion to diſtinguiſh between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Phraſeology in Acts of Parliament, Orders of Council, and the like, is not the <hi>Kingdom of England</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Scotland,</hi> but

               <hi>that Part of the Kingdom of Great Britain called England,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it is in the Order for obſerving the <hi>Fifth of November,</hi> which ſtands in your Common-Prayer Books immediately before the Office for that Day. 'Tis therefore at beſt an inaccurate Way of ſpeaking, for Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> to tell us here of "<hi>Territories belonging to the Kingdom of</hi> England", and of being "<hi>Members of the Nation of</hi> England", and to mention <hi>Page</hi> 34, 35. "<hi>The Colonies depending on the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and to be eſteemed as Part of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation.</hi>" For tho' ſuch a Way of ſpeaking may do well enough in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Converſation, yet it muſt not be uſed in ſtrict Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, eſpecially when any of the Arguments turn upon this Point, as ſome of Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s plainly do.</p>
            <p>All within this Kingdom, which thus comprehends both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> who profeſs Faith in CHRIST and Subjection to him, however they may differ in Things not eſſential to Chriſtianity, are Members of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church, or Subjects of JESUS CHRIST within the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> But there are two different eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions which have obtained very full and ample legal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhments in different Parts of this Kingdom. <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> or the <hi>Prelatic</hi> Conſtitution is by Law eſtabliſhed in the <hi>South Part</hi> of the Kingdom, and the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is as fully and legally eſtabliſhed in the <hi>North</hi> Part of it. <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Conſtitution, or the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> muſt be maintained as an eſſential Part of the civil Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdom. The ACT OF UNION may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the CHARTER of the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> 'Tis what conſtitutes one entire Kingdom to be diſtinguiſhed by that Name, as the <hi>Charter</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the two ancient <hi>Colonies</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> into one entire and new <hi>Province.</hi> Now the <hi>Act of Union</hi> not only <hi>eſtabliſhes</hi> the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but declares it <hi>unalterable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>England</hi> continued a diſtinct Kingdom, theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Plantation were juſtly conſidered as Colonies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006158_0010_1027F8A16D92BF80"/>on the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And there are thoſe yet living who remember when the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> were by Royal Proclamation forbid trading with the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were then attempting a Settlement on the Iſtmas of <hi>Darian.</hi> But ſince the <hi>Union</hi> theſe Colonies are <hi>Britiſh Plantations.</hi> They have an equal Relation to every Part of the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and an equal Freedom of Trade in the ſeveral Ports of it; and <hi>Glaſcow</hi> Goods are enter'd in the Cuſtom-Houſes in the Plantations by the Name of <hi>Britiſh Manufactures</hi> as <hi>London</hi> Goods are, and with the ſame-Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Cuſtoms and Duties.</p>
            <p>The true State of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and of the <hi>American</hi> Colonies dependent on it, being thus explained and ſet in it's juſt Light, I am now ready to conſider theſe <hi>Three Queſtions,</hi> which comprehend the Controverſy between you and us, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Whether the Inhabitants of theſe dependent Colonies, thoſe of <hi>New-England</hi> in particular, are OBLIGED in Point of DUTY, by the Laws of God or Man, to conform to the <hi>Prelatic</hi> Church eſtabliſhed by Law in the <hi>South Part</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Whether it be EXPEDIENT, or <hi>proper in Point of</hi> PRUDENCE, for thoſe who are already ſettled in ſuch Churches as have ſo long ſubſiſted in <hi>New-England,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them and embrace <hi>that Communion?</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="3">III. Whether it be LAWFUL for particular Members of <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Churches to ſeparate from them, and join in Communion with the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Aſſemblies in the Country?</p>
            <p>Theſe three Queſtions compriſe the Whole of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> and me. They are, tho' under ſomething different Expreſſions, and in the inverted Order, the very Heads under which he ranges and propoſes
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006158_0011_1027F8A42A3A5550"/>to conſider the Objections againſt you contained in my <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> See his <hi>Vindication, p.</hi> 6. How well he has ſucceeded in anſwering my Objections, and juſtifying your Conduct, and his own, in ſeparating from us, I am heartily willing you yourſelves ſhould judge, when you have heard my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. And I deſire no other Favour of you in the Caſe, but that you will lay aſide Paſſion and Prejudice, impartially conſider the Merits of the Cauſe, judge as thoſe that expect finally to be judged; and upon the whole, act as becomes thoſe who value the Glory of God, the Honour of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, and the Advancement of <hi>practical Religion,</hi> above the Intereſt of any Party, or the Gratification of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment whatever. I ſhall therefore go on to conſider theſe Queſtions particularly and diſtinctly; and if I diſcourſe ſomething largely upon them, it will proceed from my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething deſirous, not only to reply to all Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> has offered in your Vindication, but to obviate or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch other Objections as you yourſelves ſometimes make to us. And as the Controverſy, at leaſt in this Form of it, is ſomething new, I hope on this Account, the Length of my Book will be excuſed.</p>
            <p>The FIRST QUESTION is, <hi>Whether the Inhabitants of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>thoſe of</hi> New-England <hi>in particular, are obliged in</hi> DUTY, <hi>by the Laws of God or Man, to conform to the</hi> Prelatic <hi>Church by Law eſtabliſhed in the</hi> South Part <hi>of</hi> Great-Britain?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has plainly enough told us which Side of this Queſtion he holds; he aſſerts, that "<hi>Men not only</hi> MAY <hi>but</hi> MUST <hi>be of the Communion of the Church of</hi> England". <hi>p.</hi> 6. And he <hi>"believes it the</hi> DUTY <hi>of all to become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites to it." p.</hi> 34. And <hi>"theſe</hi> (he ſays) <hi>muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the Sentiments of all thoſe, who endeavour to proſelite Men from every Sect to the Communion of the eſtabliſhed Church."
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006158_0012_1027F8A953D11308"/>p.</hi> 6. And he ſpeaks of the ſame Perſons and the ſame Things, as are mention'd in the Queſtion, tho' he don't uſe exactly the ſame Terms. He calls theſe Plantations "<hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories belonging to the Kingdom of</hi> England." <hi>p.</hi> 6. And <hi>"Colonies depending on the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation." p.</hi> 35. I chuſe to ſpeak more exactly, and therefore call them <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations. He calls the Communion you have embraced, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſpeaks of it as the <hi>National Church,</hi> and the eſtabliſhed Communion, and that in ſuch a Senſe as excludes all other Forms of Church Government and Worſhip from being <hi>national</hi> or <hi>eſtabliſhed.</hi> For he argues the Neceſſity of conforming to this Church, from it's being the <hi>National Eſtabliſhment;</hi> and infers, <hi>our</hi> Obligations hereto, from <hi>our</hi> being Members of that Nation in which it is eſtabliſhed. Which Arguments ſuppoſe, that it is the <hi>only</hi> Eſtabliſhment in the Nation. But this is not Fact, with Regard to this Church at this Day, according to his own Notion of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a national Church. He ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 36. <q>When any Nation becomes Chriſtian, <hi>i. e.</hi> by any authentic national Act eſtabliſhes Chriſtianity for the Religion of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and receives ſuch a Model of the Church of Chriſt, as was ſettled by the Apoſtles, that makes a national Church.—And ſuch is the Nation of <hi>England:</hi> Firſt, A civil Society, independent, having a Right to govern it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and make Laws to regulate it's own moſt important Affairs, without being liable to the Controul of any Power upon Earth.</q> 'Tis plain from theſe Words, that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> conſiders a <hi>Nation</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom</hi> as the ſame Thing; for a Nation, in his Senſe, is ſuch a civil Society as has the entire Right of Legiſlation and Government within itſelf; that is, 'tis a diſtinct Kingdom. Now <hi>England,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not a Kingdom, or a Nation, in Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s Senſe, for it is not a civil Society, having a Right to make Laws and govern itſelf: But is a Part of the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation. And if <hi>England</hi> be not an entire and diſtinct Kingdom or
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006158_0013_1027F8ADA355BB08"/>Nation, it will follow that the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot be the <hi>National Eſtabliſhment,</hi> in ſuch a Senſe as to exclude all other Churches from being ſo. I acknowledge it to be a <hi>National Church,</hi> that is, a Church eſtabliſhed by the ſupreme Authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, for a certain Part, tho' not for the Whole of that Nation. And this, as I have already ſhewn, is equally true of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And therefore, that I may repreſent Things as they <hi>truly are,</hi> and not lead you into any Miſapprehenſions concerning them. I chooſe, in ſtating the Queſtion, to ſay, <hi>The Church by Law eſtabliſhed in the ſouth Part of</hi> Great-Britain. I go on to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what Obligations the Inhabitants of the <hi>Colonies</hi> are under, by Virtue of the Laws of God or Man, to ſubmit or conform to this eccleſiaſtical Conſtituton. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis plain that we can't be <hi>neceſſarily</hi> obliged to this, <hi>merely</hi> from it's being <hi>an Eſtabliſhment</hi> in that Nation of which we are a Part.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> repeatedly uſes this Argument, and inſiſts on it as a Proof of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of our conforming to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Thus he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 6. <q>Men—<hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Duty</hi> MUST be of the Communion of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> if they are <hi>Members of the Nation of England".</hi> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 37. "It may ſurely be urged upon <hi>every Man that is Engliſh,</hi> that belongs to this Nation, and is properly a Part of it, in whatever Corner he may live, that <hi>his</hi> DUTY <hi>obliges him</hi> to be of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
               </q> And he informs us that theſe are the <hi>real Sentiments</hi> of all the <hi>Epiſcopal Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, p.</hi> 6. I confeſs he ought to be ſuppoſed beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Sentiments of his Brethren, otherwiſe I ſhould have tho't, that at leaſt <hi>ſome of them,</hi> had known bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to act upon ſo weak a Principle, or uſe ſo fallacious an Argument as this. An eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment may be made for but a Part of a Nation; and it, at moſt, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thoſe only for whom it is made. A Man may therefore be a Member of a certain Nation, which has an eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006158_0014_1027F8AFDEED8AA0"/>Conſtitution eſtabliſhed by ſovereign Authority, and yet be under no Obligation to conform to that Conſtitution; for he may not be of that <hi>Part of the Nation</hi> for which it was made, and to which only it is, in any Senſe, obligatory. I can hardly think Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> himſelf will aſſert, that the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> are obliged to conform to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on the Account of it's being a national Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' it be undeniably true, that they are Subjects in the ſame Kingdom with the People of <hi>England,</hi> and Members of the ſame Nation, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the ſame civil Society, poſſeſſed of an independent Right of Legiſlation and Government, which is his own Deſcription of a Nation, <hi>p.</hi> 36. Much leſs will he allow that the Inhabitants of that Part of the Kingdom called <hi>England,</hi> are obliged to conform to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' I have proved <hi>that</hi> to be a national Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equally with the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe is truly this, There are <hi>two</hi> different eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhments within the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> they are, each of them, <hi>National Churches,</hi> that is, Churches <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, ratified</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by the ſupreme Legiſlature of our Nation. If therefore the <hi>one</hi> of them may claim our Subjection, <hi>merely</hi> on the Account of it's being <hi>a National Eſtabliſhment,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> has an <hi>equal Claim</hi> to it. And to be <hi>equally obliged</hi> to conform to both, is, in Reality, to be <hi>not obliged</hi> to conform to either; for contrary Obligations of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Force neceſſarily deſtroy each other. This Argument therefore drawn from the Notion of a <hi>national Eſtabliſhment</hi> can't poſſibly oblige the Inhabitants of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations to conform to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for it is juſt as ſtrong to oblige their Conformity to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is likewiſe a <hi>national Eſtabliſhment</hi> in that Kingdom of which we are dependent Colonies. Let us try whether Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>'s Argument will not run as ſmooth, ſound as well, and conclude as ſtrong, changing the Terms according to this State of the Queſtion thus, Men muſt be of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> if they are Members of the <hi>Britiſh Nation,</hi> and it may ſurely be urged upon every Man
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006158_0015_1027F8B405F25E90"/>that is <hi>Britiſh,</hi> that belongs to this Nation, and is properly a Part of it, in whatever Corner he may live, that his Duty obliges him to be of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> allows that the Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in this Form, I demand what it proves, for it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that there are two different <hi>Britiſh National Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this is not ſufficient to cure Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> of his Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this <hi>National Argument,</hi> I would aſk him, Whether thoſe in the Plantations that came from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to it, ought to be able to ſhew that the Laws which eſtabliſh this Church <hi>extend to us,</hi> and plainly require <hi>our</hi> Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to it. In Oppoſition to which, I will venture to aſſert.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Laws which eſtabliſh the epiſcopal Church in the South Part of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> do not oblige the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America</hi> to conform to it. I dont remember that any of your Writers have <hi>attempted</hi> to prove, or ſo much as <hi>plainly aſſerted</hi> that the Laws of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006158_0016_1027F8B58D42FD30"/>made for the Eſtabliſhment and Support of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Church there, do extend to, or are in Force in the Plantations. I believe they have been better adviſed. Their uſual Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is to take this for granted, and argue upon it as if it were not diſputed. Thus Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſtiles the People of <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> that don't come to Church, his <hi>diſſenting Pariſhioners,</hi> which ſuppoſes <hi>his Church</hi> to be <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> THERE, and yet he is ſo kind as to tell us, and he quoted the <hi>Lords Juſtices of Great-Britain</hi> for it, <hi>"That there is no regular Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any national or provincial Church in theſe Plantation"</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Second Letter to <hi>diſſ. Pariſh. p.</hi> 8.</note>. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſays many Things likewiſe, which ſuppoſe that theſe Laws extend to us. Thus he repreſents his Fellow-Miſſionaries as endeavouring "<hi>to proſelite Men from every Sect to the Communion of the</hi> ESTABLISHED CHURCH". <hi>p.</hi> 6. He muſt be ſuppoſed to mean the Church eſtabliſhed in <hi>thoſe Places</hi> in which thoſe Gentlemen endeavour to make Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; for if he means no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e than that this Church is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in <hi>ſome other</hi> Parts of the World, a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> Miſſionary, in any one of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations, might uſe the <hi>pompous Expreſſion</hi> with the <hi>ſame</hi> Propriety.</p>
            <p>But though your Writers are <hi>cautious</hi> on this Head, yet ſome of you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> who perhaps are not ſo well aware of the Conſequences of it, are ready enough in Converſation, to declare that the Laws which eſtabliſh the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do extend hither. I have heard ſome of you declare, that you were under an higher Obligation to obſerve <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs,</hi> than one of our Days of Thankſgiving; and give this Reaſon for it, That there was an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> for the Obſervation of the one, and only an <hi>Act of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of <hi>Connecticut</hi> for obſerving the other. And it is common with you to repreſent your ſelves as yielding Obedience to the KING and the <hi>Laws of the Nation,</hi> in conforming to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To convince you of your Miſtake in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006158_0017_1027F8B767842278"/>this Matter, and ſhew you how much you are impoſed on by thoſe who argue on this Suppoſition, I would enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether ALL THE LAWS of <hi>England</hi> made for the Eſtabliſhment and Support of the Epiſcopal Church, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Plantations in <hi>America?</hi> Thoſe of you who are in any Meaſure acquainted with the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in this Reſpect, will not, I am confident, be fond of anſwering this Queſtion in the affirmative; for there are ſome Laws of this Kind, which, I believe, you would not care to be under. By the Law of <hi>England</hi> the Clergy are entitled to <hi>Tithes,</hi> and their Pariſhioners are obliged to pay them. Theſe are <hi>by Law</hi> due to the <hi>eſtabliſhed Church.</hi> Now if the Laws which eſtabliſh this Church extend to the Plantations, you are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to pay your Miniſter, a <hi>tenth Part</hi> of all the Produce of your Lands, and of all the Increaſe of your Cattle of every Kind. And if the Laws you live under have made this his Due, you are guilty of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> in withholding it from him; and Injuſtice of the higheſt Kind; for it is, upon your own Principle, a <hi>Robbing</hi> GOD. But now ſince your Clergy dont claim nor you pay Tithes, I muſt conclude you don't think this Law extends to the Plantations. Well then, let us look upon it as a Point ſettled between us, that <hi>all the Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> made for the Eſtabliſhment and Support of the Church do <hi>not</hi> oblige us. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I demand a Reaſon for diſtinguiſhing in the Caſe, or ſaying, that <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe Laws <hi>do,</hi> when <hi>others</hi> of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly <hi>do not</hi> extend to us. If the Laws of <hi>England, as ſuch,</hi> extend to the Plantations, <hi>all</hi> of them muſt be allowed to do ſo. And if they do not as <hi>ſuch,</hi> or meerly by Virtue of their being the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> oblige us; it will concern him, who pretends that any particular Law of <hi>England</hi> is obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>here,</hi> to give ſome Reaſon for this, by ſhewing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that diſtinguiſhes that particular Law from the others. Thus, for Inſtance, If any Man tells me, that the <hi>Act of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity</hi> extends to theſe Plantations, tho' the Law for <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006158_0018_1027F8B903D74AA8"/>Tythes</hi> does not; I demand a Reaſon for this Difference between theſe two Laws, and if none can be given, ſhall conclude, that I am as free from any Obligation to the one as the other of them.</p>
            <p>It has ſometimes been ſaid that the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> extends to the Plantations, but the <hi>Statutes</hi> do not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Plantations are named <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I may perhaps be miſtaken in this Point, for I don't pretend to any great Skill in the Law. And if the Obligation to pay Tithes ariſes <hi>originally</hi> from <hi>Statute</hi> Law, thoſe <hi>two Laws</hi> are in this Reſpect <hi>equal,</hi> and neither of them obliges us in this Country, unleſs the <hi>Acts themſelves</hi> expreſly mention and are extended to the Plantations in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> Whether there be any Statute requiring the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythes to the Clergy, which mentions theſe Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I am not <hi>Lawyer</hi> enough to determine: But I am ſure the Acts of Uuniformity do not. There are <hi>two</hi> Acts of this Kind now in Force in <hi>England,</hi> except ſuch Clauſes in them as are contrary to the <hi>Act of</hi> TOLERATION. Theſe are uſually printed with the Common-Prayer Book: The former of them was enacted in the firſt Year of Queen ELIZABETH, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1559, the latter in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of King CHARLES II. <hi>A.

There is nothing in either of theſe Statutes, that ſo much as looks like a Deſign of extending the Eſtabliſhment to theſe <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Plantations, except thoſe Words in the former of them, <hi>"Or other the Queen's Dominions."</hi> And theſe are far from being ſufficient to to extend it hither. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This Statute, when it was in it's fulleſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Force, was never deſign'd or underſtood to extend hither. This general Expreſſion did not, either in it's own Nature, or in the Intention of the Legiſlators, extend to the

Thus there were <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Churches within <hi>the Queen</hi>'s <hi>Dominions;</hi> and Miniſters who did not ſubſcribe the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor uſe her Liturgy, officiated in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Churches and received Tithes; and theſe Things were known and approved of by the ſupreme Authority of the Nation, while both theſe Statutes (that of the <hi>Firſt</hi> and that of the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) were in full Force, tho' both of them mention, <hi>the Queen's Dominions.</hi> And we never find the King's allowing and countenancing theſe Things, or his granting Charters to particular Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> with the fulleſt Allowance of Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, condemned as <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>arbitrary</hi> Actions, as the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to diſpenſe with penal Laws in eccleſiaſtical Affairs within the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> has always been judged.

            <p n="2">(2.) If thoſe Words in this Statute are underſtood as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> they are repealed by the laſt Act of Uniformity, in the 14th Year of <hi>Charles</hi> II. The <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ordinal</hi> which were eſtabliſhed by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Statutes, were revived, and had Additions and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in them by the firſt Convocation that ſat in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II, and theſe were ſuch as rendred them, in the Senſe of the Law, <hi>other Books;</hi> ſo different from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that there was need of a <hi>new</hi> Statute to eſtabliſh and enforce the Uſe of them. Upon which the laſt Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity was made, which provides, That the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, and the Book of Ordination, eſtabliſhed in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, ſhall be uſed and obſerved until the Feaſt of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> 1662; and enacts, That a Book of Common-Prayer and Ordination, agreed upon by the Convocation then ſitting, and annexed to this Act, ſhould be eſtabliſhed and uſed from that Time forward. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therefore, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ordinal</hi> are repealed; and that no Man has been obliged to uſe them ſince St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Day, 1662. Now the Repeal of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> was really and properly a Repeal of her <hi>Uniformity-Act,</hi> which had no other View or Deſign but to eſtabliſh <hi>that</hi> Liturgy, nor a ſingle Clauſe that related to any thing elſe. So that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Act of Uniformity would have been abſolutely repealed, to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and Purpoſes, by King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Act of Uniformity,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006158_0022_1027F8C62DDA9620"/>were it not for a <hi>ſaving Clauſe</hi> in this laſt Act, which ſays, that the ſeveral good Laws before made, and at that Time in Force for Uniformity, ſhall be applied, practiſed and put in Uſe, with Relation to <hi>the Book now eſtabliſhed,</hi> and no other. All the Force therefore which the firſt Act of Uniformity <hi>now</hi> has, is entirely owing to the ſaving Clauſe in the latter Act; and conſequently Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Act, tho' it has thoſe Words in it (<hi>other the Queen's Dominions</hi>) can't be more extenſive than King <hi>Charles</hi>'s, to which it owes all the Life it has. Now nothing can be more certain than that King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Statute is limited to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed;</hi> which are likewiſe the very Limitations uſed in the Statute (7th of <hi>William</hi> III. Chap. 6.) <hi>for the more eaſy Recovery of ſmall Tithes.</hi> The Obligations, in Point of Law, to conform to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to pay Tithes to her Clergy, are therefore of equal Extent, and, thro' the Favour of God, neither of them reach to us on this Side the <hi>Atlantic.</hi> And agreable to this (I'm inform'd) has been the Reſolution of ſeveral Caſes in Law, both in the Plantations and at Home. To all which I may add, the <hi>Lords Juſtices Letter to the Lieutenant Governour of</hi> Boſton, in the 1725, which declares, <hi>That there is no regular Eſtabliſhment of any National or Provincial Church in theſe Plantations.</hi> This I quote on the Authority of Dr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and if there ſhould be any Miſtake in it, I hope Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> will not tell me again, <hi>That it will not excuſe me to ſay, I write after another as wicked and falſe as myſelf.</hi> So that if I ſhould allow, what I can by no Means grant, that the civil Magiſtrate has a Right to ſay what Religion the Subject ſhall believe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, or Authority to eſtabliſh a particular Form of Divine Worſhip and eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and oblige all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to conform and ſubmit to it, yet this Concluſion would do you no Good; ſince there is no Eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that affects us in this Country. And I have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued in this Form, becauſe, as it is moſt agreable to your Principles, I tho't it the moſt likely to convince you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006158_0023_1027F8C8EDA51AB8"/>
Having thus (I hope ſufficiently) prov'd that the Laws of Man do not oblige us to conform to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it remains to enquire, Whether the Laws of God do ſo? I go on therefore to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">III. There is no <hi>Divine Law</hi> that requires our Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſays on this Head, <q>If it be every Man's indiſpenſible Duty to be a Chriſtian, the ſame Duty will oblige him to be and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Member of the Church of Chriſt, which is his Body, to preſerve and maintain the Peace, Order and Unity of the Body, and eſpecially of that Part to which he particularly belongs; which will infer the Duty of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing and ſubmitting to the Officers regularly preſiding and governing in ſuch Church; which being the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in chief; every one that makes a Part of this Nation owe Reverence and Submiſſion to them, under Chriſt, and may eſteem our Saviour's Words to his Apoſtles, applicable to ſuch Prelates; <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 37, 38. I can eaſily allow that the ſame Duty which obliges a Man to be a Chriſtian, obliges him to be a Member of the Church of Chriſt, becauſe a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Member of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> are preciſely the ſame Thing. But that a Man is under as ſtrong Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or of any other particular Church whatever, as to be a Chriſtian, is what muſt not be allowed. To be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to eternal Salvation, at leaſt to all who have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Ability to judge of the Evidences of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for of all ſuch 'tis undoubtedly true, That <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> But this cannot be ſaid of every one that is not a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any one particular Church in the World. 'Tis very poſſible that any Church may wrongfully exclude a Perſon from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or excommunicate him, <hi>Clave errante.</hi> The Church or <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' ſhe claims <hi>Infallibility</hi> in her <hi>doctrinal Deciſions,</hi> yet acknowledges ſhe may be miſtaken in judging Matters
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006158_0024_1027F8CE4D47E318"/>of <hi>Fact,</hi> becauſe in theſe the Church depends on human Teſtimony, which may be falſe, and ſhe has no Way to diſcover the Falſity. And ſure no Man, in his Senſes, will ſay, that an unjuſt Excommunication cuts a Perſon off from Chriſt, and neceſſarily infers eternal Condemnation.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange Tho't of Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s, that the Law of God requires us to ſubmit to the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe we make a Part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as he <hi>will</hi> call it. By this Rule an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> muſt be an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalian,</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> a <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt,</hi> a <hi>Sweede,</hi> a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and all this by Virtue of the Law of God. Whereas the divine Law, under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, does not at all conſider theſe petty Diſtinctions between Nations, for in Chriſt there is neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Greek, Barbarian</hi> nor <hi>Scythian.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> quotes that Text, Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give Account;</hi> and obſerves upon it. <q>The <hi>Greek</hi> Word here rendred, <hi>them that have the Rule over you,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Governors,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Prelates</hi> are in the Church.</q> If Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> means that the Word <hi>always</hi> means Governors, he is miſtaken, as he muſt own, if he will but turn to Acts 14.12. <q>And they called <hi>Barnabas, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter;</hi> and <hi>Paul, Mercurius;</hi> becauſe he was the <hi>chief Speaker</hi>:</q> In the Original, <hi>Egoumenos Logou.</hi> Here the Word <hi>Egoumenos,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſays, ſignifies <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> is uſed of the Perſon who was thought to be <hi>inferior;</hi> for <hi>Mercury</hi> is in the <hi>Grecian Mythology</hi> much beneath <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Or if Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> thinks that whenever it is uſed for a Ruler or Governor, it means an <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> one, he is again miſtaken; for the ſame Word is uſed of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Acts</hi> 7.10. And yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> was no Biſhop. But if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all he ſays upon this Text, it will not ſerve his Turn; for if the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> may claim my Obedience, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Text, ſo may the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law has no where determined which of theſe is our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan;</hi> and therefore, if this is ever done, it muſt be by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006158_0025_1027F8CFEADFF3C0"/>Laws: and the Laws of the Nation not having eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the prelatic Church in the Plantations, do not oblige me to ſubmit to either of them.</p>
            <p>It follows <hi>p.</hi> 38. <q>
                  <hi>There are many Texts in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, forbidding Diviſions, requiring the Preſervation of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Peace, and Order.</hi>
               </q> I heartily wiſh he and you had ſhewn more Regard to them, and not broken the Unity, and diſturbed the Peace and Order of our Churches, by your <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necſſary</hi> and <hi>ſinful Separation</hi> from them. And when he adds, Texts requiring, <hi>"Submiſſion to Government,"</hi> this will not at all excuſe you; for neither God nor Man required this of you. One of thoſe Texts requiring Submiſſion to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> had his Eye upon, which is commonly, tho' very improperly uſed in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and which (I know) many of you depend much upon, tho' it really makes nothing for your Cauſe, is, 1 Pet. 2.13. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's ſake.</hi> This Epiſtle was probably written about the ſixth Year of NERO the Roman Emperor. The Laws of the Empire at this Time in Force, eſtabliſhed <hi>Paganiſm</hi> as the national Religion, and it was but four Years after that this Emperor order'd the Chriſtians to be perſecuted, for not conforming to the National Religion eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Empire. And in this Perſecution, according to the beſt Accounts we have, St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſuffered <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Now I appeal to your own Reaſon and Conſciences, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> Whether in theſe Circumſtances, the Apoſtle, by <hi>every Ordinance of Man,</hi> ought not to be underſtood, as meaning only ſuch Laws as were of a mere <hi>civil</hi> Nature. Can you poſſibly believe, that he directed Chriſtians to ſubmit to the imperial Laws of a <hi>religious</hi> Nature, which were all <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> and which he himſelf choſe rather to die than conform to? And I ſubmit to the Learned, whether <hi>Ktiſis anthropine,</hi> the Expreſſion uſed in the Original, don't rather ſignify a Law relating to human <hi>Affairs,</hi> than one reſpecting <hi>divine Worſhip.</hi> Where any Man therefore uſes this and ſuch like Texts to enforce Conformity to the Church of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006158_0026_1027F8D42F527C98"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> in this Country, you ought to ſuppoſe, either that he is in himſelf ignorant in the Affair, or that he deſigns to impoſe upon you: Eſpecially ſince, as we have already proved, there is no Law of Man that requires this Conformity of you.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> therefore would have us believe the Law of God requires our Conformity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he muſt produce ſome other Texts of Scripture; very different from thoſe he has hitherto referred us to. But if this is not to be <hi>directly</hi> proved from any expreſs Text in the <hi>Bible,</hi> perhaps it may be <hi>conſequentially</hi> inferred by Arguments well formed on Scripture. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has attempted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Nature, in what he ſays concerning the <hi>Schiſm</hi> he charges on our Forefathers. I therefore proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Inhabitants of <hi>New-England</hi> are not obliged to conform to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on Account of any <hi>Schiſm</hi> made by their Forefathers in leaving that Communion. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> uſes this as one of his beſt Arguments, and writes with an <hi>Air of Triumph</hi> whenever he is upon this Subject. Thus, <hi>p.</hi> 29. He repreſents our <hi>"Congregations"</hi> (for he will not call them Churches) as <q>founded in Schiſm, and unjuſtifiable Separation from the Communion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or ſuch as uſe their preſent Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt neceſſarily be eſteemed Abettors and Approvers of Schiſm, Diſorders, Uſurpation, Contempt of the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Chriſt has left in his Church, and ſuch like Crimes.</q> And he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 40. <q>The awful Guilt of Schiſm — was contracted by thoſe who began the Separation in <hi>England,</hi> renounced the Authority of their Governors, and invited diſcontented People to join their Diſobedience; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their lawful and faithful Guides, and ſet up Parties againſt them, in Defiance of the Laws of Church and State, and after the Guilt contracted by ſuch Diſobedience and ſchiſmatical Separations, what Influence could croſſing the Waters have to purge ſuch Crimes? or juſtify the ſame diſobedient Tempers, and unlawful Practices, in a new
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006158_0027_1027F8D6EB528BB0"/>Country, dependent on, and Part of the Nation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
               </q> Thus he would repreſent our Forefathers, the firſt Settlers of <hi>New-England,</hi> as Men who deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by Poſterity with <hi>Contempt and Infamy,</hi> for having renounced the Authority of their Governors, deſpiſed their lawful and faithful Guides, defied the Laws both of Church and State, ſet up a ſchiſmatical Separation in their native Country, and then croſſed the Ocean to perpetuate their Schiſm. The firſt Minſters of <hi>New-England</hi> have a ſtill <hi>blacker</hi> Character given of them, they are ſtiled PERFIDIOUS <hi>Preſbyters of the Church, p.</hi> 22. and RENEGADO <hi>Preſbyters, who threw off their Subjection to their Biſhops, and invaded the ſacred Office, contrary to their Ordination Vow and Promiſe, p.</hi> 19. This is the <hi>odious</hi> Character he gives of the firſt Settlers of this Country, and we know who they are in particular to whom he ſuppoſes this Character belongs; for in the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> tells us who he means by "<hi>the Forefathers and Founders of</hi> New-England", even thoſe that came from <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1630. He names <hi>John Winthorp</hi> Governor, <hi>Richard Saltonſtal, Iſaac Johnſon, Thomas Dudley</hi> and <hi>William Coddington.</hi> He means the Governor and Company of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colony, of which theſe Gentlemen really were the Leaders. Theſe were truly, as he ſtiles them, <hi>our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,</hi> and <hi>the Founders of New-England,</hi> and by ſome of them the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> was ſettled.</p>
            <p>It is ſurprizing to me, that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſhould thus load with <hi>Infamy</hi> the Memory of thoſe from whom, I ſuppoſe, he himſelf is deſcended, thoſe whom he ſtiles <hi>"our Forefathers."</hi> If <hi>Truth</hi> had been on his Side, <hi>filial Piety</hi> ſhould have check'd his Pen. Had <hi>his Forefathers</hi> deſerved this Character, yet it was not <hi>decent</hi> for <hi>him</hi> to give it. Why muſt he uſe ſo <hi>foul-mouth'd</hi> a Term as that of <hi>Renegado?</hi> A Term of Infamy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to thoſe moſt <hi>abandon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Wretches,</hi> who renounce the Chriſtian Religion and turn <hi>Mahomitans;</hi> and of whom it is commonly remarked, that they diſcover vaſtly greater <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> againſt Chriſtianity than the native <hi>Turks</hi> do. Would Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> think himſelf handſomely treated, if I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006158_0028_1027F8D9A98983B0"/>ſhould ſtile him a <hi>Renegado Preſbyter,</hi> on the Account of his renouncing his Preſbyterian Ordination, and taking epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Orders? And yet I could give Inſtances of his diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Temper very much like that of the <hi>Renegado</hi>'s in his Conduct toward thoſe whoſe Communion he has forſaken. I dare even leave it to his own Conſcience, whether he did not appear very much in the <hi>Renegado Character,</hi> when he declared before many Witneſſes (ſome of which will appear when he calls for them) that he had rather join in Worſhip with a <hi>Jewiſh Synagogue</hi> than with a <hi>Preſbyterian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> is capable of taking <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in treating the Founders of <hi>New-England</hi> in this Manner, yet I hope you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> can't join with him in it. Can you take Pleaſure in reading ſuch Reflections on thoſe from whom you derive your Being, and the Fruit of whoſe Labours and Sufferings you now enjoy, in the Plenty and Liberty with which this Country is bleſs'd? Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> wou'd repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me (in his <hi>Poſtſcript</hi>) as one of the <hi>"degenerate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our good Forefathers";</hi> and yet I have that Regard for their Memories, that his Treatment of them raiſes my Reſentment, more than all the <hi>perſonal</hi> Abuſes he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me.</p>
            <p>But is this <hi>infamous Character</hi> he gives of the Fathers of this Country, <hi>true,</hi> or ſupported by proper Evidence, or does he himſelf believe it? Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> (if my Memory don't deceive me) in a Piece publiſhed ſome Years ago, mentions the <hi>honeſt old Puritans</hi> as Enemies to the <hi>Separatiſts.</hi> And I have ſome Reaſon to ſuppoſe that he believes the Founders of <hi>New-England</hi> were generally ſincere good Men, and are now with God. And for my own Part, I make no Doubt that <hi>when Chriſt ſhall appear, they alſo ſhall appear with him in Glory,</hi> and that their Crowns of Glory will be the more bright and ſhining, on the Account of their Sufferings for Chriſt in their Lives, and the <hi>Reproach</hi> with which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has loaded their Memories, ſo long after their Death.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of producing any Proof to ſupport this heavy Charge brought againſt the Memory of our excellent Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006158_0029_1027F8DB32332A70"/>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> himſelf, at laſt, ſpeaks honourably of them; tho' it be at the Expence of the groſſeſt Self-Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. In his <hi>Letter</hi> he never mentions them without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>ſtigmatize</hi> their Memories: But when he came to write his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> it ſeems his Heart miſgave him, for the Abuſes he had offered to ſuch excellent Perſons: And now he ſpeaks of them in a very different Manner. <hi>"Our Forefathers"; "Our good Forefathers": "the good Fathers and Founders of</hi> New-England", are the Terms in which the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> mentions the Perſons whom the <hi>Letter</hi> itſelf ſtiles <hi>Renegado and perfidious Preſbyters.</hi> The <hi>Letter</hi> repreſents the Founders of our Churches, as having <q>begun the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>England,</hi> renounced the Authority of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,—deſpiſed their lawful and faithful Guides, and ſet up Parties againſt them, in Defiance of the Laws of Church and State, and after the Guilt contracted by ſuch Diſobedience and ſchiſmatical Separations —croſſing the Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> But the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> paints them in quite different Colours, as ſome of the moſt dutiful Sons of the Church, acknowledging <q>with the utmoſt Gratitude, that all the Good that was in them, they derived from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom they call their <hi>dear Mather.</hi>
               </q> Nay, Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has <hi>now</hi> ſo high an Opinion of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, that he wiſhes and prays that all their Poſterity may forever be like them. Thus he concludes his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> 
               <q>Would to God Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> and all their Children, had the ſame <hi>bleſſed Temper</hi> which they had, and would ſtill and forever ſpeak as they did.</q> This concluding <hi>Prayer</hi> really ſurprizes me. Does Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſincerely wiſh that all the Children of <hi>New-England</hi> may always have the ſame Temper with their Forefathers, and can he call it a <hi>bleſſed Temper,</hi> when (if his Word may be taken) it was ſuch an one as influenced them to <hi>"renounce the Authority of their Governors",</hi> to <hi>"deſpiſe their lawful and faithful Guides, &amp;c."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I firſt read Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s <hi>Vindication,</hi> theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions appeared in ſo ſtrong a Light, that I could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> were wrote by the ſame Hand.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006158_0030_1027F8DE2B67FFE0"/>I was therefore ready to ſurmiſe, that ſome Perſon who met with the Manuſcript, after it went from the Author, might have tacked the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to it. But was at a Loſs whether ſome <hi>weak Friend</hi> of the Author's, who could not perceive that he was contradicting him; or ſome <hi>ſly Adverſary</hi> that deſign'd to expoſe him by ſo ungenerous an Artifice. I have ſince been credibly inform'd that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has diſown'd the <hi>Poſtſcript;</hi> and therefore ſhould have been doubtful of quoting it as his, had he not been ſo kind as to ſend me one of his Books corrected with his own Pen: But as this has the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> annexed to it, I have ſufficient Authority for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering and treating it as <hi>his.</hi> But to return.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion we are now upon, is, Whether our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers contracted "the awful Guilt of Schiſm" by leaving the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And conſequently, Whether the Churches of <hi>New England</hi> are, in their preſent Conſtitution, Schiſmatical? This is plainly Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s Opinion, or at leaſt he would have you think ſo. And if it be really the Caſe, I readily allow, that you are juſtifiable in forſaking our Communion, and returning to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But what Evidence does he produce to ſupport this Charge? 'Tis a Rule founded in Reaſon, That the Evidence ought to be proportion'd to the Nature of the Crime charged: It will therefore require plain and full Evidence to convict us of ſo <hi>heinous</hi> a Crime as Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> allows Schiſm to be. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, does he ſo much as <hi>"ſeem" to prove this?</hi> He firſt introduces this Matter with an <hi>If, p.</hi> 29. <q>
                  <hi>If the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, forſaking which is called Schiſm, are themſelves foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Schiſm, and unjuſtifiable Separation from the Church of</hi> England.</q> I wiſh he had here done what he blames me for ommitting, that is, had <hi>put his Argument in Mode and Figure.</hi> Had he <hi>aſſumed</hi> here, <hi>But this is the Caſe,</hi> &amp;c. there would have been the Appearance of arguing. But this, he was ſenſible, would have proved "a very hard Taſk", and therefore evaded it. However, I will venture to tell him, in his own Words, "He muſt go thro' it before his Charge will lie againſt" us. And 'till he does this, he
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006158_0031_1027F8DFED73C5D0"/>can't be thought to vindicate your Conduct in ſeparating from us.</p>
            <p>The next Paſſage in which this Matter is mentioned, is in <hi>p.</hi> 40. <q>
                  <hi>The awful Guilt of Schiſm—was contracted by thoſe who began the Separation in</hi> England <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Here, if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, he would repreſent the Matter, that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Churches ſet up <hi>ſchiſmatical Separations in England,</hi> and afterward croſſed the <hi>Atlantic</hi> to eſtabliſh and perpetuate their Schiſm. This I utterly deny, and he has not offered the leaſt Shadow of Proof of it, unleſs his Word muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Proof; which he muſt not expect, ſince he has not only contradicted it, but even given us ſome Evidence that the Fact was really otherwiſe. In his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents theſe Perſons as dutiful Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and as a Proof of it, gives us an Extract of a <hi>Letter to the Biſhops and Clergy and People of the Church of</hi> England, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or at leaſt ſigned, on board the Ship <hi>Arrabella,,</hi> which brought them to <hi>New-England.</hi> This <hi>Letter,</hi> the whole of which, Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſays, deſerves to be written in Letters of Gold, was, as Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> informs us, "ſaid to be drawn up by that learned, holy, reverend and famous Mr. <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>

               </note> tho' Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has not given us his Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Signers of it. This <hi>Letter</hi> is a direct Proof that the firſt Planters of this Country, both Miniſters and People, were ſo far from having ſet up ſchiſmatical Separations in <hi>England,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> injuriouſly charges them with, that they continued Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'till they left the Nation. This is an Evidence of Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>'s own producing, which therefore you ought to give full Credit to.

                  <hi>diſobedient Tempers, and unlawful Practices, in a new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, dependent on, and a Part of the Nation of</hi> England?</q> Surely Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> don't think it a <hi>Crime</hi> to be a Member of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> an Argument of a <hi>diſobedient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> to call her <hi>dear Mother;</hi> nor an <hi>unlawful Practice</hi> to <hi>aſk her Prayers:</hi> And yet this is all that the Witneſs he himſelf produces, charges theſe Perſons with.</p>
            <p>It is well known to all who are acquainted with the eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>old Puritans,</hi> tho' they greatly diſliked many Things in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and endeavoured, by all lawful Means, to procure a further and more perfect Reformation (which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls <hi>"opening their refining Shops in the Kingdom"</hi>) were yet Enemies to Separation. They had a great Dread of contracting the awful Guilt of Schiſm. No Men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preach'd or wrote more warmly againſt the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> than the <hi>Puritans</hi> did. Of this I could produce a Cloud of Witneſſes, were it needful. Mr. <hi>White,</hi> a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who is now managing a Controverſy with the Diſſenters at Home, ſays on this Head, <q>It ſeems to be growing mighty modiſh with their People [the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in <hi>England</hi>] to laugh at all Notions of Church Communion, and make nothing of the moſt unneceſſary Separations. But from the Beginning it was not ſo.</q> And after mentioning St. <hi>Paul, Ignatius, &amp;c.</hi> as teſtifying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Separations, he adds, <q>So did the old <hi>Puritans,</hi>—and indeed no body did it more, if ſo much as they<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>White</hi>'s Defence of his three Letters, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note>.</q> This Witneſs is true,</p>
            <p>There were two Sorts of Men who conſcienciouſly ſcrupled, and therefore refuſed to approve of, or uſe ſome of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe were all, on this Account, ſometimes call'd by the general Name of NONCONFORMISTS: But they did not all go the ſame Lengths. Some of them openly and wholly ſeparated from the eſtabliſhed Church; and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006158_0033_1027F8E6B7985878"/>were from thence called SEPARATISTS. The reſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church, and uſed as much of the public Liturgy as they could with a good Conſcience, omitting ſuch Parts as they dare not uſe. Theſe were then called PURITANS, for their profeſſing a Deſire of a greater <hi>Purity</hi> in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances of God. This Sort of Men were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a while connived at, and at other Times ſeverely puniſhed, according as the governing Biſhops happened to be mild or ſevere in their Temper or Principles. Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> was very friendly to them. His Succeſſor Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was their great Enemy, and cruel Perſecutor. <hi>Abbot</hi> had for ſome Time been declining, and <hi>Laud</hi> advancing in the King's Favour, 'till the Year 1677, when the former was arbitrarily ſuſpended, and ordered to retire, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>New-Eng.</hi> Chron. <hi>p.</hi> 238, 239.</note> Thus we have brought our Forefathers ſafe to <hi>New-England,</hi> and that, free from the Guilt of Schiſm; for as yet they had not ſeparated from, but were Miniſters and Members of, the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I conclude the Account of the Conduct of theſe Men, antecedent to their forming themſelves into a Church State in this Land, by wiſhing (in my turn) that Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> and his Brethren the epiſcopal Miniſters, with all others who have run into either the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> or the <hi>New Light</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in this Country, had diſcovered the ſame <hi>bleſſed Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and acted upon the ſame <hi>peaceable Principles</hi> as theſe their excellent Forefathers did. This would have prevented the raſh, uncharitable and ſchiſmatical Separations they have run
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006158_0034_1027F8E9DC844718"/>into, to the Diſhonour and Danger of Religion. For then, if they had tho't any thing greatly amiſs in our Conſtitution, they would have endeavoured to have had it amended, before they had renounced Communion with us. And if theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours had proved unſucceſsful, and they had thought it neceſſary to erect Churches of another Form, they would at leaſt have retired into ſome other Part of the World, where they might have enjoyed what they ſo highly valued, without diſturbing others, ſetting up Altar againſt Altar, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, what Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> agrees with me in ſtiling, the awful Guilt of Schiſm.</p>
            <p>Some of you, <hi>my Brethen,</hi> may perhaps think, that though our Forefathers brought no Guilt of Schiſm into the Country with them, they might contract ſome after their Arrival, by erecting Churches upon a Model ſo different from that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To this I reply, That a <hi>national Church</hi> is in the Nature of it a <hi>local</hi> Thing. It neceſſarily has it's Bounds and Limits, beyond which it does not extend; and theſe are determined by the Laws which eſtabliſh it, or make it a <hi>national</hi> Church. Now I have already proved that the Laws which eſtabliſh the Church of <hi>England</hi> do not extend to the <hi>American</hi> Plantations. Our Forefathers, therefore, when they arrived in this Country, were entirely without the Pale of the national Church of <hi>England,</hi> and abſolutely at Liberty to form themſelves into ſuch Churches, as they, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt Light they could obtain, judged moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the <hi>Goſpel Model.</hi> Their doing ſo did, in no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, infringe the Rights or diſturb the Peace of any Church under Heaven: And therefore no other Church had any Right to controul them, or Reaſon to complain of them. So far as they were perſwaded in their Conſciences, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was, in it's Conſtitution and Practices, agreable to the Goſpel, they were to imitate it. And this is juſt as true of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any other Church on Earth. But conſider it merely as a <hi>national</hi> Church, or <hi>legal</hi> Eſtabliſhment, they were under no ſort of Obligation to it. <hi>Human</hi> Laws did not oblige them in the Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006158_0035_1027F8EF206941A8"/>they did not extend to this Country: And the <hi>Divine</hi> Law did not oblige them in this Caſe, becauſe (beſides what has been ſaid before) the Goſpel knows no ſuch Thing as a <hi>National Church.</hi> There is therefore no more Schiſm in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> on the Account of their being formed upon a Plan different from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than there is in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church on Account of it's not conforming itſelf to the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> or to the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> which were reformed before it. In one Thing we certainly have the Advantage of you, for the Reformers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> tho' they looked on the Scripture as the proper Rule of Faith, did not think them the <hi>only</hi> Rule in Matters of Government and Worſhip. They never ſo much as <hi>pretended</hi> to conform the <hi>Polity</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of the Church to the Scripture Standard; But admitted and retained Things, which they <hi>knew</hi> and <hi>owned</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, 'till ſome conſiderable Time after the Canon of Scripture was finiſhed. Whereas the Founders of our Churches always profeſſed to make the ſacred Scriptures the <hi>only</hi> Rule in Matters of Diſcipline and Worſhip, as well as in Articles of Faith. And tho' you may think they miſtook the Senſe of Scripture, in ſome Inſtances, and we don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they were infallible; yet I believe you think they acted honeſtly. Now, if while they ſincerely endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church State, in every Part of it, to the Rules of God's Word, they were in ſome Things miſtaken, yet on the Whole, inſtead of contracting the formal Guilt of Schiſm, they were no doubt approved and accepted of that God, who judges Men by the Sincerity of their Hearts, and not by the Perfection of their Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Thus, I hope thoſe worthy and excellent Men, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of this Country, are fully cleared from the Crimes, Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has accuſed them of. I have been the larger in vindicating their Reputation, becauſe I hope a Veneration for them may be a Means of inducing the preſent Generation, not only to eſteem and hold faſt thoſe eccleſiaſtical Privileges they purchaſed for us at ſo dear a Rate; but alſo of exciting
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006158_0036_1027F8F0AA30F2F8"/>their Poſterity to imitate that <hi>ſerious Religion</hi> and <hi>practical Godlineſs,</hi> for which they were ſo remarkable.</p>
            <p>And if any of you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> have forſaken the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Churches in which you were educated, on the Suppoſition that you ought to do ſo, becauſe your Fathers were guilty of Schiſm in erecting them, you were really miſtaken, and ought, on your Conviction of this, to return to us.</p>
            <p>But if Mr. <hi>Wetmors</hi> can't prove the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> guilty of <hi>formal Schiſm,</hi> perhaps he thinks he can prove them <hi>Favourers of Schiſm.</hi> He ſeems to imagine this will infer, the Neceſſity of forſaking them; and if he can but deſtroy them, he is not very much concerned about the Means of doing it. Hear how admirably he talks upon this Head, <hi>p.</hi> 29, 30. <q>
                  <hi>If the Congregations, forſaking which is called Schiſm, are themſelves founded in Schiſm,—or in their preſent Conſtitution muſt neceſſarily be eſteemed Abbettors and Approvers of Schiſm, Diſorders, Uſurpation, Contempt of the chief Authority Chriſt has left in his Church, or any ſuch like Crimes: Then ſuch Congregations —ought to be eſteemed, in Reſpect of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, only as</hi> Excreſcencies <hi>or</hi> Tumors <hi>in the Body natural, or perhaps as</hi> Fungoſities <hi>in</hi> an ulcerated Tumor, <hi>the eating away of which, by</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Means, <hi>tends not to the Hurt, but to the Soundneſs and Health of the Body.</hi>
               </q> I can't forbear remarking here, that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> carries the Matter farther than I expected, even from him. I took him indeed for one of thoſe <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> that would preſcribe <hi>Corroſives,</hi> as the only Means of healing the Wounds of the Church; but I ſuppoſed he would have been contented with ſuch Penal Laws as our Fathers ſuffered under, in the Days of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud.</hi> But to propoſe the eating away ſuch <hi>Fungoſities</hi> as he eſteems us, by WHATEVER MEANS, as making for the Health of the Body, is going a great Way indeed. Does he mean to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify ſuch <hi>Military Executions</hi> as were uſed againſt the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Reign of King CHARLES II. or the <hi>Dragooning</hi> the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> in the Time of

            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has another Paſſage relating to this Subject, which ſerves to explain what I laſt quoted from him. <q>
                  <hi>If the Separation be kept on Foot unjuſtifiably in</hi> Old-England, <hi>theſe in</hi> New-England <hi>draw their Guilt upon themſelves; not only by acting upon their Principles; but juſtifying their Contempt and Diſobedience, by denying and diſputing againſt all Epiſcopal Power ſuperiour to that of Preſbyters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the Communion of thoſe that ſubmit to ſuch a Power moſt regularly eſtabliſhed</hi>

               </q> He had before charged to our Account, what he ſuppoſed criminal in our Forefathers, long before we were born, and now he would make us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the Faults of our Brethren, the <hi>Engliſh Diſſenters,</hi> tho' committed at the Diſtance of a <hi>Thouſand Leagues</hi> from us, and by Perſons we never ſaw. Now tho' this may ſeem ſomething hard, yet there is this agreable Circumſtance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, it looks as if the Man was at a Loſs for perſonal Faults to charge us with, when he takes ſo much Pains to fix the Guilt of all he thinks criminal in any of our Relations, on us. Let us ſee, however, whether he has any better Succeſs in his Endeavours to prove us <hi>Favourers of Schiſm,</hi> than he before had, in labouring to fix <hi>Schiſm</hi> on us.

            <p n="1">1. If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters are guilty of Schiſm, ſo are the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Diſſenters likewiſe. He thinks the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> guilty of this Crime, becauſe they forſake a true

If therefore the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> muſt be condemned as Favourors of Schiſm, on Account of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt fall under the very ſame Condemnation for favouring the Diſſenters in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> if he knows anything of the Matter, will not deny, that the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters<note n="‡" place="bottom">Theſe <hi>Scottiſh Diſſenters</hi> were almoſt univerſally in the late Rebellion, while the <hi>Engliſh Diſſenters</hi> were ſome of the moſt zealous Oppoſers of it.</note> have received, at leaſt, as much Countenance, and as many Favours from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as ever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters did from us.

            <p n="2">2. If we muſt be accountable for all the Faults of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe there are ſome Things common to them and us; the Church of <hi>England</hi> may, by the ſame Rule, be charged with all the Faults of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> I hope, will join with me in ſaying, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is ſchiſmatical, hereretical, idolatrous, and even antichriſtian; yet he would think it hard to have the Church of <hi>England</hi> charged with favouring her in the Things which render her ſo. But if his Way of arguing, in the Paſſages now under Conſideration, be allowed, I don't ſee how this can be avoided. He ſays we draw the Guilt of thoſe in the Separation in <hi>England</hi> upon ourſelves, <hi>
                  <q>by acting upon their Principles,</q> juſtifying their Contempt and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by denying and diſputing all epiſcopal Power ſuperiour to</hi>

               </q> In the ſame Manner. I may as juſtly ſay, The Church of <hi>England</hi> draws the Guilt of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon itſelf, by acting upon it's Principles, juſtifying it by denying and diſputing the Preſbyters Right of Ordination and Juriſdiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Powers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently given him by Chriſt's Commiſſion, and by refuſing the Communion of thoſe who ſubmit to this Power. Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> I know, denies that Chriſt has given theſe Powers to Preſbyters: But then he knows likewiſe, that I deny any <hi>"Epiſcopal Power ſuperiour to that of Preſbyters".</hi> So that his Argument and mine are, in this Reſpect, parallel. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>"The Separation"</hi> is not <hi>"kept on Foot unjuſtifiably in Old-England."</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters don't need me for an Advocate; nor ſhall I enter into the Diſpute as it ſtands between <hi>them</hi> and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is different from that between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>epiſcopal Separation</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> I ſhall only obſerve, under this Head, that the Reaſons of the Diſſenters leaving the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are ſufficiently known to the World, and I believe our epiſcopal Diſſenters in this Country would heartily rejoice if they could produce half ſo good Reaſons, to juſtify their Conduct in ſeparating from us. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters have always had ſuch among themſelves as have ſufficiently juſtified their Conduct to the World. Among others, Mr. <hi>Peirce</hi> did this in his Day, to the Satisfaction of the Foreign Proteſtants, to whom Dr. <hi>Nichols</hi> had appealed: And the <hi>Doctor</hi> would never make any Reply.

               <hi>Letter,</hi> in a very convincing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006158_0040_1027F8FCB8CA21B8"/>Manner proved, that the Charge of Schiſm does not lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Diſſenters in <hi>England.</hi> And in his <hi>Second</hi> ſet the Diſſenters Exceptions to the Liturgy, in ſo <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> a Light, as muſt (I think) be convincing to every unprejudiced Mind, as well as fully vindicated his <hi>Former</hi> from all Mr. <hi>White</hi> has ſaid in Reply to it.</p>
            <p>Having thus (I think fully) prov'd, That the general Notion of a national Eſtabliſhment, does not infer the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>our</hi> conforming to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> which eſtabliſh that Conſtitution do not extend to this Country; that there is no Divine Law requiring this of us; and that there was nothing ſchiſmatical, or favouring of Schiſm, in the Conduct of our Forefathers, or in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Churches they erected in this Land; I ſuppoſe the firſt Queſtion ſufficiently anſwered, and that I may now, without any Scruple, conclude, that the Inhabitants of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations, thoſe of <hi>New-England</hi> in particular, are <hi>not obliged in</hi> DUTY, by the Laws of God or Man, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or conform to the <hi>Prelatic Church</hi> eſtabliſhed in the <hi>South Part</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> I ſhall therefore conclude this Head with a Remark or two by Way of IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERENCE from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Thoſe who have conformed to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Country, are not to expect that either GOD or the KING will conſider their Conformity as an <hi>Act of Obedience,</hi> or eſteem them as the <hi>better Subjects</hi> on the Account of it. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Places the higheſt Merit in <hi>unrequired Duties, uncommanded Acts of Obedience.</hi> If the Terms I uſe are contradictory, they are ſo much the more ſuitable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſo abſurd and inconſiſtent a Notion. This impious Doctrine is condemned by the whole Proteſtant World, and by none more expreſly than the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ſays (ART. xiv.) <q>
                  <hi>Voluntary Works, beſides, over and above</hi> GOD'S <hi>Commandments, which they call</hi> WORKS OF SUPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REORGATION, <hi>cannot be taught without Arrogancy and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006158_0041_1027F8FE5590D408"/>Impiety.</hi>
               </q> Since therefore there is no Command of God requiring our Conformity to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> thoſe who have gone from us to that Church, can't teach or expect that God will accept it as an Act of Obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being condemned for <hi>Arrogance</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> by that very Church whoſe Communion they profeſs to embrace.</p>
            <p>Our gracious SOVEREIGN, as he makes the Laws of the Land the Rule of his Government, ſo he always recommends it to his Subjects to make them Standard of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and neither deſires nor expects any more from them than the Laws require. You deceive your ſelves therefore, if you expect your Conformity to Epiſcopacy ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as an Act of Obdedience, either of GOD or the KING. You may pleaſe your ſelves with the Tho't that you are, on this Account, <hi>better Subjects</hi> or <hi>better Chriſtians:</hi> But 'tis all Deluſion and a meer Dream; you proper Judges in both theſe Characters, will reject it as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It hence follows; that the Communion of our Churches is <hi>moſt ſafe.</hi> There has been a long Diſpute between the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> The Diſſenters have great and (I think) <hi>unanſwerable</hi> Objections againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Worſhip of the eſtabliſhed Church. The <hi>beſt Advocates</hi> the Church has ever had, don't pretend to juſtify many of the Things objected againſt, as being <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or indeed <hi>good in themſelves;</hi> but only as Things that may be ſubmitted to, and uſed, without Sin, when eſtabliſhed by lawful Authority. And ſome of them plainly own, that they wiſh they were changed or quite taken away. Now there is not a ſingle Objection made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Conſtitution or Ceremonies of the <hi>Church,</hi> but what has the ſame <hi>full Force</hi> and <hi>undiminiſhed Weight</hi> in this Country as in <hi>England.</hi> If therefore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters are in the <hi>Right,</hi> we are certainly juſtified in not conforming to the <hi>Church.</hi> But if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Diſſenters in the <hi>Wrong,</hi> if we ſhould think they ought, from a Regard to the Laws of their Country, to ſubmit to theſe Things; yet
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006158_0042_1027F901F7536808"/>this don't in the leaſt affect us, who live in a Country to which thoſe Laws do not extend.</p>
            <p>In a Word, All Arguments againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> conclude <hi>fully</hi> in our Favour, and the better Half of the Arguments that have ever been offered in favour of that <hi>Church,</hi> don't <hi>in the leaſt</hi> operate againſt us. Nay they <hi>help our Cauſe;</hi> for tho' you will deny our having an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>poſitive Law;</hi> you muſt own we are eſtabliſhed by <hi>Agreement</hi> and <hi>Preſcription,</hi> which is <hi>all the Eſtabliſhment</hi> the primitive Church had in the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>pureſt</hi> Ages of it. Thoſe that have conformed to the Church in this Country, have acted contrary to the Judgment of the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> Part of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The firſt Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Convocation in Queen ELIZABETH'S Reign, met <hi>Jan.</hi> 12.1562, 3<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Prince</hi>'s Chron. <hi>p.</hi> 220.</note>. After they had agreed upon the xxxix AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICLES, they entred upon the Conſideration of the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> There were great Debates upon this Head, and when they came to vote, it was found, on a Diviſion of the lower Houſe, that <hi>Forthy Three</hi> diſapproved of them, and but <hi>Thirty Five</hi> liked them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 223.</note>. Thus the <hi>Puritans</hi> were clearly the Majority: But in Convocations abſent Members are allowed to vote by <hi>Proxies</hi> or Attorneys, and when theſe Proxies were given in, the Numbers ſtood thus, <hi>Fifty Eight againſt</hi> the Ceremonies, and <hi>Fifty Nine</hi> for them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 223.</note>. So that, as Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> juſtly obſerves, <q>By the Majority of <hi>one ſingle Voice,</hi> and that not a Perſon preſent to hear the Debates, but a <hi>Proxy,</hi> it was determined to make no Alteration in the Ceremonies<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Neal</hi>'s Hiſt. <hi>Purit.</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 182, 183.</note>.</q> There has ever ſince been a Number of <hi>excellent Perſons</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to whom theſe Ceremonies have been a Burden, and who ſubmit to them <hi>merely</hi> in Deference to the Authority which has eſtabliſhed them. But you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> chuſe that Communion for the ſake of thoſe very Things, which ſo great a Part of that
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006158_0043_1027F90638439C38"/>Church eſteem it's <hi>Imperfections</hi> and <hi>Blemiſhes,</hi> and wiſh to have in a <hi>legal</hi> Way removed. I ſay you chuſe it for theſe very Things; for your Rulers do not impoſe theſe on you, nor require your Submiſſion to them. And a Regard to the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the Country you live in, and of the Churches in which you were baptiſed and educated, inſtead of influencing you to conform to theſe <hi>diſputed</hi> Ceremonies, would operate quite the other Way. In this View of Things, I have often wondred at your <hi>Clergy</hi>'s recommending <hi>ſuch Books of Controverſy</hi> to you, as they often do. For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that ſuch Books as defend the Church <hi>as an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and juſtify the Ceremonies <hi>as indifferent Things,</hi> to be ſubmitted to in <hi>Obedience to the Law</hi> that enjoins them, and from a <hi>Regard to the Unity and Peace</hi> of the viſible Church, are really pleading <hi>our Cauſe,</hi> and not <hi>your's.</hi> I believe the <hi>Authors</hi> of ſome of them, had they lived in this Country, would have joined in Communion with our Churches, and have condemned <hi>your Separation</hi> as much as I do. I am ſure their Principles directly lead to this. But I proceed to</p>
            <p>The SECOND QUESTION.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether it be</hi> EXPEDIENT, <hi>or proper in Point of</hi> PRU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE, <hi>for thoſe who are already ſettled in ſuch Churches as have ſo long ſubſiſted in</hi> New-England, <hi>to forſake them and embrace that Communion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though I hope you are convinced, by what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, that you were not ſtrictly obliged in Duty, either to God or Man, to forſake our Communion, and embrace the Epiſcopal; yet, it may be, ſome of you may ſtill think, you have acted a reaſonable Part, ſuch an one as became rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures in your Circumſtances, and conſequently, what you can well account for, <hi>in Point of Prudence,</hi> to your own Minds and to the World. And, I ſuppoſe, many of indeed the moſt that have forſaken us, for ſome Years paſt, have acted upon this Principle, and gone off to the Church, rather from the Notion of it's being a good <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:006158_0044_1027F909068D8550"/>than from any Thought of it's being neceſſary in Point of abſolute Duty. You have acted upon Opinion that the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the Epiſcopal Church are well calculated to promote the temporal and eternal Intereſts of Mankind; and even better ſuited to anſwer theſe great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, than the Conſtitution and Practices of the Churches of <hi>New-England.</hi> Now I apprehend that this is a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>dangerous</hi> Miſtake; and if I can convince you of this, I truſt, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> you will retract what you have acted on this Miſapprehenſion of Things. And with an earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſome Hope of this, I now invite you to a <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>impartial Conſideration</hi> of the Matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> thinks himſelf able to juſtify your Conduct, in this View of it. <hi>p.</hi> 34. <q>
                  <hi>Thoſe that propagate the Church of</hi> England <hi>in</hi> Connecticut, <hi>would not put themſelves to</hi> ſo many Difficulties, <hi>and take</hi> ſo much Pains, <hi>if they did not believe the Glory of God and the Welfare of many Souls, were to be promoted thereby; nor ſhould we endeavour to proſelite ſome, if we did not believe it the Duty and</hi> INTEREST <hi>of all to become Proſelites. and that it would be every Way for the</hi> Benefit and Advantage of the Country; <hi>for the preſent Age, and for Poſterity, to have all Parties and Sects laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is one Thing in this Paragraph, I could wiſh Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> had omitted, becauſe Reply to it may ſeem <hi>invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> but as he has thrown it in my Way, I think, I ought not to let it paſs without a Remark.—I mean his repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who propagate the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Connecticut</hi> as encountering "ſo MANY DIFFICULTIES, and taking SO MUCH PAINS." A Stranger to this Colony might from this think, that our <hi>epiſcopal Miſſionaries,</hi> tho' they were Men of the moſt <hi>unwearied Application</hi> to the Duties of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, were <hi>ſtarving</hi> for want of Support; or <hi>ſuffered Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from the Government they live under, and were <hi>remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable</hi> for the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> with which they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred their <hi>diſtinguiſhing Difficulties.</hi> And I am ſorry to ſay

Of this Kind are the <hi>ungenerous</hi> and <hi>unjuſt Complaints</hi> they are almoſt every Year ſending Home of this Government. A Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which gives them more <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and treats them with <hi>greater Reſpect,</hi> than I ſuppoſe was ever ſhewn to any <hi>Sect of Diſſenters,</hi> who bare ſo inconſiderable a Proportion to the Body of the People among whom they dwell. For, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>perſonal Reſpects</hi> ſhewn them by the principal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the Colony, the Law obliges their Hearers to pay toward their Support, in the ſame Proportion as our Hearers do to our's; and our Collectors conſtantly gather the Rate and pay it to them; and if this be not ſufficient, the Law enbles every Church to tax themſelves in ſuch Sums as are neceſſary, [and for Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> in particular, who here reckons himſelf among theſe Sufferers, tho' he lives in the Colony of <hi>New York,</hi> the <hi>Preſbyterian Miniſter</hi> who lives in his Pariſh, with all his Hearers, is obliged to pay Taxes to him] Nay, ſo far are they from being laid under <hi>any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints</hi> by the Laws of this Government, that while all other Miniſters within, as well as without the Colony, are forbid, under ſevere Penalties, preaching in any Pariſh not under their immediate Care, unleſs invited by the Miniſter, and Church, theſe Gentlemen, whether Inhabitants of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or not, may <hi>itinerate, propagate</hi> their Principles, and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate</hi> their Party, when and where they pleaſe, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And thoſe Gentlemen that have embraced that Communion, have not only retained their Poſts, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been promoted, to a Degree that is ſurpriſing in ſo <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> and <hi>elective</hi> a Government. And I muſt add, to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that will no longer conſiſt with the Honour or Safety of the Government, if they continue their <hi>Diſaffection</hi> to our <hi>civil Conſtitution,</hi> and their <hi>unreaſonable Complaints</hi> againſt a Government that cheriſhes them in it's Boſom. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (and 'tis generally ſuppoſed a <hi>Clergyman</hi>) of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in a <hi>Letter</hi> dated <hi>Connecticut, March</hi> 7. 1746, 7.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006158_0046_1027F90E83F9E9F0"/>publiſhed in the <hi>Boſton Evening-Poſt</hi> No. 606; braggs very much of the Number of Officers, civil and military, in their Communion. Whether this Gentleman ever join'd with his Brethren, in repreſenting Matters to their Friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as tho' thoſe who conformed to them in this Country, were <hi>immediately turned out of their Poſts</hi> or Offices, I don't certainly know, becauſe he conceals his Name. If he has, I could wiſh him to conſider how he can reconcile his Conduct to <hi>common Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Caſe be as I have repreſented it, what can Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> mean by repreſenting himſelf and Brethren, as Men <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their Difficulties.</hi> Had he been writing to the <hi>Society,</hi> I ſhould ſuſpect the View was to have their Pay ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, as <hi>another Miſſionary</hi> ſome Years ago, recommended his Borther to them, by repreſenting him as teaching School all the Week to a Number of poor Children, and on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Afternoon <hi>walking</hi> a dozen Miles in order to read Prayers in a Church next Day<note n="‖" place="bottom">Abſtract of the <hi>Society</hi>'s Proceeding annexed to the Bp. of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note>; when all the Neighbourhood knew, tho' the Society did not, that the Children were <hi>no poorer,</hi> nor the Maſter <hi>worſe paid</hi> than others; and that the young Gentleman <hi>walked</hi> the twelve Miles on a <hi>very good Horſe.</hi> However it anſwered the End, the School-Maſter was taken into the Society's Pay<note n="‖" place="bottom">Abſtract of the <hi>Society</hi>'s Proceeding annexed to the Bp. of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note>. If ſomething of this Sort was not aimed at by Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> I can reſolve it into nothing but that <hi>"Bigotry and Self-Admiration",</hi> which, as he remarks, <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>"Zealots of every Sect—are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tinged with".</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Thing principally to be regarded, in the Paſſage under Conſideration, is Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s repreſenting it as <q>
                  <hi>every Way for the Benefit and Advantage of the Country, for the preſent Age, and for Poſterity,</hi>
               </q> that we ſhould become Proſelites to the Church of <hi>England</hi> Now if he be able to prove this, I muſt own that it would be <hi>prudent</hi> for us all to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006158_0047_1027F913FA905EE0"/>come over to you. I mean upon the Suppoſition of it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>lawful;</hi> which I am willing, for the preſent, to ſuppoſe, tho' I expect to diſprove it before I finiſh. But I find no Proof at all of this, unleſs by the Expreſſion of having <hi>"all Parties and Sects laid aſide",</hi> he intended to ſuggeſt that <hi>Unity</hi> could no other Way be obtained. If this be his Meaning, 'tis eaſy replying, that an univerſal Conformity to the <hi>New-England</hi> Churches would have the ſame happy Effect. And this can't poſſibly be a good <hi>prudential</hi> Reaſon for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons conforming to you; but on the contrary, is a <hi>ſtrong Reaſon</hi> for your returning to us, ſince we have ſo <hi>vaſt a Superiority</hi> to you in Numbers; perhaps, taking the whole Country, Twenty to One. He that would take the moſt probable Way to produce Unity, ought certainly, where the Diſproportion is ſo great, to join with the Majority.</p>
            <p>But, tho' Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has not thought proper to offer any Proof under this Head, which one would have expected from him, when he undertook the Province of <hi>vindicating your Conduct;</hi> yet I ſhall offer ſome Proof of the Contrary, or mention a few of the many Diſadvantages, I apprehend would follow from it, and give you the Reaſons of my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch Apprehenſions. And I ſhall think myſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently rewarded for the Labour of it, I if can prevail with you to conſider them impartially, and to act like prudent Perſons under the Influence of the Love of your Country and your Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The great Number of <hi>unneceſſary eccleſiaſtical Officers</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>immenſe Charge</hi> of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them, argues the IMPRUDENCE of our ſubmitting to that Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh Diſpenſation was a very <hi>coſtly Religion;</hi> and it was agreable to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God that it ſhould be ſo. It was deſigned only for one Nation; and that Nation, ſo long as they obſerved the Law given them, were by the ſpecial and even miraculous Bleſſing of God, to be a rich People. Such a Nation might well enough ſupport a
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006158_0048_1027F915871BEA70"/>
               <hi>pompous Temple,</hi> a vaſtly <hi>numerous</hi> Train of Officers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly <hi>expenſive</hi> Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſpenſation is deſigned for all Mankind, and <hi>the Poor</hi> in particular are to <hi>have the Goſpel preached</hi> unto them. And the Goſpel Church is ſuited to this Deſign, 'tis not a coſtly Religion Chriſt has inſtituted. I ſuppoſe it will be found, on a juſt Compariſon, that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> may be ſupported with a leſs Expence than any other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, true or falſe, that ever obtained in the World. I don't mean that it is ſo <hi>in Fact;</hi> I know there are prodigious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues aſſign'd for the Support of it, <hi>in all Popiſh</hi> and <hi>ſome Proteſtant Countries.</hi> But the expenſive Articles of it do not properly belong to Chriſtianity, nor have they any Foundation in the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> but were introduced into the Chriſtian Church by a fooliſh and ſinful Affectation of imitating the pompous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and coſtly Rights either of the <hi>Jews</hi> or the <hi>Heathens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A wiſe Man would chuſe ſuch a Conſtitution in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> wherein the great Ends of Society may be effectually anſwered, with as little Burden and Charge as may be to the Community. This he would eſpecially do, in a Country which, like this, does not abound in Riches and Wealth. 'Tis an Argument of <hi>Prudence</hi> in our <hi>Civil Rulers,</hi> that they put the Adminiſtration of public Affairs into ſuch a Form, that the great Ends of civil Society may be obtained with the leaſt public Charge. And for the ſame Reaſons, it muſt be allowed prudent in the Body of the People, to chuſe and fall in with ſuch an eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, as does, in the cheapeſt and moſt eaſy Manner, anſwer the great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Deſigns of religious Society. 'Tis neceſſary to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering theſe Intentions, that there be a ſtanding Miniſtry in the Church, or a ſufficient Number of Men devoted to ſtudy and promote the eternal Intereſts of others. Both the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> and the <hi>Credit</hi> of the chriſtian Religion neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that theſe be <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>honourably</hi> ſupported. And the Charge of this can't be tho't unreaſonable, by any Man that has a proper Regard to religious Society, or a real Deſire that the Ends of it ſhould be anſwered. But a wiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006158_0049_1027F91711F59090"/>Man may juſtly think much of the Charge of ſupporting <hi>ſupernumerary Eccleſiaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>, without whom the great Intentions of Church Society might as well, and perhaps better, be obtained. And that there are ſuch, many ſuch in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I believe no Man, thoroughly acquainted with that Conſtitution, will deny.</p>
            <p>The three Orders of Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons are are divided and ſub-divided into ſuch a Number of Offices, as is not very eaſily reckoned up. There are <hi>Archbiſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and <hi>Suffragans,</hi> of the higher Order; <hi>Deans, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Prebendaries,</hi> in the <hi>Cathedrals; Rural Deans, Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſaries,</hi> that pretend to exerciſe a Sort of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the inferiour Clergy, tho' they are themſelves but in the Order of <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> There are <hi>Rectors, Vicars,</hi> and <hi>Curates,</hi> among the <hi>parochial Clergy.</hi> And in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Courts, <hi>Chancellors, Surrogates, Proctors, Apparitors,</hi> and I know not how many more Officers<note n="†" place="bottom">There are about <hi>forty</hi> different <hi>Sorts</hi> of <hi>Officers</hi> in the national Church of <hi>England, Prince</hi>'s Cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I will now ſuppoſe a Caſe, which I pray God may never happen; I will, for once, ſuppoſe the People of <hi>New-England</hi> ſo infatuated as to become generally Epiſcopal, and to have the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in all it's Pomp and Splendor, by Law eſtabliſhed here. In this Caſe I can't pretend to ſay how many Biſhops, Cathedral Churches and ſpiritual Courts we ſhould have in the whole Land; but will ſuppoſe one of each
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006158_0050_1027F919E95281A8"/>in every Government. And now, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> count the Coſt, and ſay whether the Country can poſſibly ſupport the prodigious Expence, or muſt ſink under the inſupportable Burden of it? Let your own Conſciences ſay, Whether you would not have Reaſon to lament your Folly, when it was too late to remedy it; and whether your lateſt Poſterity would not have Reaſon to eſteem you as the Inſtruments of entailing Miſery and Poverty upon them?</p>
            <p>You may perhaps flatter yourſelves by ſuppoſing either that the SOCIETY <hi>for propagating the Goſpel</hi> would bear this Charge for you; or that, when you found the Burden too heavy for you, you might caſt it from you. Theſe are <hi>all the Hopes</hi> I think you can have in this Caſe. They are both of them <hi>vain Deluſions.</hi> And, as it is of Importance, that your Eyes be opened to ſee that they are ſo, I will diſtinctly conſider them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Society</hi> then, are not <hi>able,</hi> nor do they <hi>deſign</hi> to bear the Charge for you. Their <hi>"certain Fund for this great Work"</hi> of propagating the Goſpel abroad, <hi>"is no more than</hi> 57 <abbr>l.</abbr> 10<abbr>s.</abbr> 
               <hi>a Year,"</hi> as we are told by the Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> one of their Members<note n="*" place="bottom">Sermon before the Society, <hi>p</hi> 30.</note> "<hi>The annual Subſcriptions to it, amount to little above</hi> 600 <abbr>l.</abbr>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Sermon before the Society, <hi>p</hi> 30.</note> "<hi>The whole Expence, which the Society has been at this Year</hi> (<hi>Anno</hi> 1739.) <hi>amounts to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> 3800 <abbr>l.</abbr>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 31.</note> What is wanting in the Produce of their certain <hi>Fund,</hi> and annual <hi>Subſcriptions,</hi> they have nothing but <hi>caſual</hi> Benefactions to make good. Theſe are too uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Things to be depended on, and will undoubtedly grow leſs, as the Eyes of the People in <hi>England</hi> are opened to ſee that what they give, under a Notion of ſending the Goſpel to a People that <hi>never heard</hi> of it, is miſapplied to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a Faction in a Country, where the Goſpel is as fully and faithfully preached as perhaps in any Part of the chriſtian World. And as theſe Benefactions abate, the Society muſt leſſen, inſtead of increaſing their Expences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:006158_0051_1027F91DECE24BA0"/>
If you would but open your Eyes you <hi>might</hi> ſee; nay you <hi>muſt</hi> ſee, that the <hi>Society</hi>'s ſupporting your Miniſters, is deſign'd but for a temporary ſhort-liv'd Thing. At firſt, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was, that your Miniſters would <hi>always</hi> be maintained without any Charge to you. Now they require you to do Part, and in a little Time, the whole Burden will be left on your Shoulders. This will <hi>undoubtedly</hi> be the Caſe, if ever the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould obtain a <hi>legal Eſtabliſhment</hi> here. The <hi>Society</hi> erect no Miſſions in <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> becauſe the Church is by Law, in a Sort, eſtabliſhed in thoſe Provinces. And yet I can hardly think Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> himſelf will tax me with <hi>"Bigotry and Self-Admiration"</hi> for ſaying, that there is <hi>full as much</hi> Occaſion for propagating the Goſpel in thoſe Provinces as in <hi>New-England.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> ſpeaking of the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> ſays to the Society, "<hi>If we don't take Care to teach them true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they will not remain long without being taught any Religion at all: They will become a Prey to Popery</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Sermon before the Soceiety, <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note>." His Lordſhip muſt excuſe me in thinking, either that the Society do not act upon <hi>this Principle,</hi> or elſe that they are not very well acquainted with the State of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I can't poſſibly account for it, that they have not a ſingle <hi>Miſſionary</hi> in <hi>Maryland,</hi> in which Province, I ſuppoſe, there are more Papiſts and more popiſh Prieſts than in all the other Plantations on the Continent put together.</p>
            <p>Since I have mentioned the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s Sermon before the Society, I can't forbear tranſcribing a Sentence or two more from it. <q>The Charter under which this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety acts, was granted, to provide an orthodox Clergy in our Plantations, Colonies and Factories in <hi>America,</hi> where many <hi>want the Adminiſtration of God's Word and Sacraments, and ſeem to be abandoned to Atheiſm and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> And for want of Inſtruction in true Religion, <hi>are in Danger of being perverted by Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits to their Superſtition.</hi> This was the PRIMARY AND IMME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIATE
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006158_0052_1027F91F74A7EB60"/>INTENTION of the Charter<note n="†" place="bottom">Sermon before the Society, <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note>
               </q> The Society which acts upon this Charter were (as appears by the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract</hi> of their Proceedings for the Year before) at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of above a <hi>thouſand</hi> Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> yearly, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>epiſcopal Miſſionaries</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and had not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>Miſſionary</hi> in <hi>Virginia</hi> nor <hi>Maryland;</hi> but <hi>two</hi> in <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> where there are no other Miniſters of any other Sort, and <hi>two</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-India Iſlands.</hi> Can any Perſon, at all acquainted with the State of Religion in the <hi>Britiſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> read this Account without Aſtoniſhment! Can this be called propagating the Goſpel? Is this acting agreable to the <hi>primary and immediate Intention</hi> of their Charter? Is it not rather to be eſteemed abuſing the Truſt repoſed in them, and perverting the charitable Deſign of ſuch pious Perſons, as muſt be ſuppoſed to give their Money to promote the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and immediate Intention</hi> of the Society's Charter? Will it be pretended that <hi>New-England</hi> is the Country deſcribed in the Charter, as recited by his Lordſhip? Can it be ſaid that our People are <hi>"abandoned to Atheiſm and Infidelity"</hi> or that they are <hi>"in Danger of being perverted by Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits to their Superſtition"?</hi> Why then muſt ſuch <hi>Numbers of Miſſionaries</hi> be ſent hither, when there are ſo many Places truly in the Condition mentioned in the <hi>Society's</hi> Charter, of whom little or no Care is taken? We are told of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe Miſſionaries</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> 
               <q>That they took no Pains to perſwade the Heathen to embrace Chriſtianity, but were very diligent to oblige the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s to profeſs Subjection to the Pope<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:006158_0053_1027F92231BE8EE0"/>by ſuppoſing, that they, on whoſe Information they depend, do impoſe upon and deceive them.</p>
            <p>I can but ſeldom get a Sight of the <hi>annual Accounts</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Society, yet I am able to produce <hi>ſome</hi> Inſtances wherein they have been thus impoſed upon. Thus Mr. <hi>Checkley,</hi> Miſſionary at <hi>Providence,</hi> by his Letter dated <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1. 1739, acquaints the Society, that <q>
                  <hi>He hath ſometimes performed divine Service, and preached on a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday, at</hi> Taunton, <hi>twenty Miles diſtant from</hi> Providence, <hi>where the Congregation conſiſts of more than</hi> three hundred <hi>Perſons, many of whom were never before in any Chriſtian Church</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Bp. of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 54, 55.</note>
               </q> No Man acquainted with <hi>Taunton,</hi> will eaſily believe that there can be found many Perſons in it, much leſs a conſiderable Part of a Congregation, conſiſting of above <hi>three hundred</hi> People, as the Words fairly imply, that never were in any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church before Mr. <hi>Checkley</hi> viſited them; unleſs it be thoſe who believe (as perhaps Mr. <hi>Check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> does) that no Church deſerves the Name of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but that of <hi>England.</hi> But if this was his Meaning, he impoſed on the <hi>Society,</hi> and ſuch pious People as are induced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his Support, by reading his Accounts.

I wonder what Notion ſuch Men have of Religion; they know there is not one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Syllable in the New-Teſtament, that <hi>preſcribes,</hi> or in the leaſt Degree <hi>encourages</hi> the Obſervation of Chriſtmas, and they may know that <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>practical Religion</hi> decreaſe in the Country, in Proportion as the Obſervation of <hi>Holidays</hi> grows; yet they can repreſent this as a <hi>conſiderable</hi> Point gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an Alteration for the better, and what gives them <hi>unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Comfort.</hi> I wiſh Mr. <hi>Punderſon</hi> may know the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that ariſes in the Mind of a Miniſter, from <hi>winning Souls</hi> to Chriſt, and <hi>turning many unto Righteouſneſs;</hi> I am confident it will cure him of calling <hi>this</hi> an <hi>unſpeakable Comfort.</hi> In the mean Time, when the Society, or thoſe that read this Account in <hi>England,</hi> find it thus repreſented as a <hi>conſiderable Alteration, in the Spirit and Temper</hi> of the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> that they <hi>behave ſoberly and decently</hi> in Time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip at Church, when they happen to be there; and find a <hi>Reverend Miſſionary</hi> repreſenting this as an <hi>unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Comfort</hi> to him; what can they conclude, but that theſe People uſed before to diſturb the Congregation, &amp; affront and abuſe the Miniſter in Time of divine Worſhip? Nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Diſpoſition of Mankind to magnify <hi>Party Stories,</hi> can it be tho't ſtrange, if ſome ſhou'd from hence take Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuppoſe and report that good Mr. <hi>Punderſon</hi> uſed to officiate in Danger of his Life, but now can do it with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? If any have this View of the Matter, they will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this is ſuch an <hi>unſpeakable Comfort</hi> to him, and that he ſends the News to <hi>England,</hi> that all the good Men in the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006158_0055_1027F928803ACAC8"/>Nation may partake with him in the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and Joy of it. I hope the People of <hi>Groton,</hi> and in all other Parts of the Country, when they ſee what an Improvement <hi>theſe Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> make of their keeping <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> will reform that <hi>bad Practice,</hi> and diſcover that they value the Religion of their Country, and the Morals of their Poſterity above a Feaſt or a Frolick.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like, are the Accounts the Society re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from their Miſſionaries, which induce them to take ſo much Care of <hi>New-England,</hi> to the Neglect of other Places, which are really <hi>abandon'd to Atheiſm and Infidelity,</hi> or in great <hi>Danger of being perverted by Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits to their Superſtitions.</hi> I eſteem myſelf therefore doing a <hi>real Service</hi> to Religion, and to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>mean and wicked Arts,</hi> by which they have too long been impoſed on.</p>
            <p>Whenever therefore the <hi>Society,</hi> or thoſe pious People who betruſt them with the Diſtribution of their Charity, ſhall be truely informed of the State of Religion in the <hi>Britiſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> inſtead of affording you any further Aſſiſtance, they will doubtleſs remove <hi>all</hi> their Miſſionaries from <hi>New-England,</hi> which has no Need of them, to other Parts of <hi>America,</hi> where they are really wanted, and might truly ſerve the common Intereſt of Chriſtianity, propagate the Goſpel, and enlarge the Redeemer's Kingdom among Men.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole, if you ſhould be ſo imprudent as to bring this <hi>inſupportable</hi> Charge upon yourſelves, you are not to expect that it will be at all abated by any Help from the Society. Your only Hope for yourſelves and your Poſterity muſt ariſe from the Suppoſition that you can throw off the Burden when you find it too heavy to bear. And you have been ſometimes told, that at preſent the Church requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>eaſy;</hi> and it will be ſoon enough to diſſent, when ſhe requires that which is <hi>unlawful</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable:</hi> But a wiſer Man has told you, <hi>A prudent Man foreſeeth the Evil, and hideth himſelf: But the Simple paſs on

                  <hi>Prov.</hi> xxii. 3.</note>. And if you are ſo ſimple as to make the fatal Experiment, you will wiſh you had taken the Caution given. It will be <hi>too late</hi> to diſſent from the Church, when once it has gained a <hi>legal</hi> Eeſtabliſhment in the Country. For if it may be ſuppoſed (which yet is very queſtionable) that you could obtain a <hi>Toleration,</hi> yet you muſt expect to pay towards the Support of the <hi>eſtabliſhed Church,</hi> as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in <hi>England</hi> now do. Inſtead therefore of acting like wiſe Men, you act a very <hi>imprudent</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> Part, and are making a Yoke which will terribly gall your Necks and the Necks of your Poſterity after you. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">II. The arbitrary Power of <hi>impoſing Miniſters</hi> on People, or <hi>removing them without hearing the People's Objections,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Argument againſt the Expedience or <hi>Prudence</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Every Church, or worſhipping Congregation, has a <hi>Right,</hi> by the Laws of Nature and Chriſtianity, to chooſe their own Paſtor. This is a Right which no wiſe Man would willingly give up. The beſt Intereſts of your ſelves and Families, will be greatly affected by the Miniſtry you and they ſet under. Now is it poſſible you ſhould be willing to intruſt this Right with you know not who; as is done in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> There are few Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> that have Liberty to chooſe their Miniſter. The <hi>Right of Patronage,</hi> that is, the Right of appointing the Miniſter of a particular Pariſh, belongs in ſome Places to the Crown, in others to the Biſhop, in ſome to one of the Univerſities or ſome other Corporation, and in moſt to ſome particular Perſon of the Nobility or Gentry. It is an Eſtate that either deſcends from Father to Son, or is bought and ſold as other Eſtates are. By this Means it may, and frequently does, come to paſs, that the <hi>ſole Right</hi> of appointing or chuſing the Miniſter, ſhall be
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006158_0057_1027F92FEB0F1DF8"/>veſted in the moſt <hi>ignorant</hi> or the moſt <hi>vicious</hi> and debauched Perſon in the Pariſh, and he that takes no Thought or Care about his <hi>own Soul,</hi> muſt be the only man to ſay who ſhall have the Charge of the <hi>Souls of all his Neighbours.</hi> It is very much owing to this, that there are ſo many ignorant &amp; vicious Perſons among the <hi>inferiour</hi> Clergy in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> a <hi>drunken Patron</hi> generally preſenting ſuch a Miniſter to the Living that happens to be in his Gift, as he expects will prove a good <hi>Pot-Companion.</hi> And can you think, <hi>my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> you are acting like <hi>reaſonable</hi> Beings, capable of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miſerable <hi>Eternity,</hi> in embracing and promoting a Conſtitution which may render you, or your Poſterity after you, liable to have ſuch Miniſters ſet over you in this Manner? Would it not have been much more prudent for you to have remained in our Communion, which would have ſecured you in your juſt and very valuable Right of chuſing your own Miniſters?</p>
            <p>You will, it may be, tell me, That you do now chooſe your Miniſters as well as we. And I ſuppoſe the <hi>Society</hi> have <hi>generally</hi> appointed the Perſon you aſked for. But what ſort of Security can you have that they will always do ſo? It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for them to do otherwiſe; and ſend you what Miniſters they pleaſe, without at all regarding your Petitions or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations:</hi> Tho' it may not be quite ſo <hi>politic</hi> for them to exert this Authority over you, 'till you are a little faſter fixed in the Principles you have but newly embraced. And if there were Occaſion for it, I could produce Inſtances of the <hi>Society</hi>'s appointing Miniſters for particular Places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the People's recommending the Perſons, or ſo much as knowing them before they were ſent; and ſuch Perſons too, in ſome Inſtances, as no religious Man would have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, or could ſit eaſy under.</p>
            <p>But if it happen that you have a Miniſter worthy of his Office, how much ſoever you may like the Man, whatever Expence you may have been at, in ſending him for Orders, and ſettling him among you, How little Security have you of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006158_0058_1027F932D9250AD0"/>his Continuance with you, or even of your being allowed to ſhew your Reaſons why he ſhould not be removed from you? This I mentioned in the marginal Note annexed to my SERMON, <hi>p.</hi> 24. <q>This Want of Diſcipline is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen and complained of by the Laity of that Church; as for Inſtance, when their Miniſters are removed from them without any ſufficient Reaſon, nay, when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think they have ſuch Objections as would effectually prevent a Removal, if they could find any Body to judge between them and their Miniſters.</q> When I wrote this I had <hi>particular Inſtances</hi> in my Mind; and ſuppoſed the <hi>Hint</hi> was plain enough to lead your Thoughts to the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; eſpecially as one of them had then newly happened, and was the Subject of much Converſation, and a great deal of Complaint among ſome of you at that Time. I expected therefore that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> would have attempted a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it. But he judged it <hi>ſafeſt</hi> for him to ſay nothing at all upon the Head; and, I own, it was prudent in him ſo endeavour to <hi>huſh</hi> ſuch Matters; for they are what no wiſe Man will ever undertake to juſtify.</p>
            <p>Omitting the Inſtances of this Kind at <hi>New-London, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall mention only that at <hi>Fairfield.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Caner</hi> was ſettled, by the <hi>Society</hi> Miniſter to a ſmall Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Congregation in this Town about twenty Years ago. He, from Time to Time, wrote the Society Accounts of his <hi>great Succeſs.</hi> The Congregation increaſed to ſuch a Degree that they were obliged, he ſaid, to build Galleries in the Church, ſufficient to contain <hi>an hundred</hi> People. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as printed in the <hi>Abſtract of the Society's Proceedings,</hi> ſays, <hi>two hundred:</hi> But as I am informed that Mr. <hi>Caner</hi> corrected the printed Account with his Pen, in the Copy he lent; and as I have no Deſire to <hi>aggravate</hi> the Matter, I mention the Number as he corrected it. Some Time after he mentioned to the Society the building of a new Church at <hi>Fairfield,</hi> and gave this as the Reaſon of it, <hi>"The old one being much too little for the Congregation".</hi> At the ſame Time he deſcribed his Pariſhioners as <hi>"a very good-natur'd induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006158_0059_1027F936CC41AA30"/>People,</hi> that <hi>well deſerv'd the Society's Favour",</hi> and ſays, <hi>"the Number of his Communicants is</hi> Eighty two"<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Abſt. of the Bp. of <hi>Gloceſters</hi> Ser. <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note>. If he means he had <hi>this Number</hi> of Communicants in <hi>Fairfield,</hi> as I conclude the Society, and the World underſtood him, for he gives a diſtinct Account of the Church at <hi>Norwalk</hi> afterwards, in the ſame Letter: If, I ſay, he is thus to be underſtood, I muſt ſuppoſe that he admitted Infants to the <hi>Communion,</hi> for he never had, I am well aſſured, that Number of adult Perſons for his ſtated Hearers. His People here are ſo far from allowing that Want of Room in the old Church was the Occaſion of building the New; that ſome of them of good Credit have declared that the old Houſe, even without Galleries, was more than ſufficient for the Congregation. And that except <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> or ſome ſuch extraordinary Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they were not at all crouded on the Ground Floor. They ſay, they built the new Church at a great Expence, to accommodate Mr. <hi>Caner,</hi> by having it near his Habitation; and ſome of them, that in Conſideration of their doing this, and to enduce them to it, he promiſed, that he would never remove from them. But this notwithſtanding, on his receiving an Invitation to <hi>Boſton,</hi> he immediately determined to leave them, and without waiting for Orders from the Biſhop or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety removed to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and was formally inducted there. I don't pretend to a <hi>certain</hi> Knowledge of all theſe Facts, but have recited them as People of that Church, whom I take to be worthy of Credit, have repreſented them. And whether they are true or falſe, the People who believe them, and look upon themſelves injured by them, ought in all Reaſon and <hi>Equity,</hi> to have had an Opportunity of producing what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they had to ſupport them, before ſome proper and competent Judge. And that eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution which does not allow of, and make Proviſion for this, can never recommend itſelf to any reaſonable Man. What, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> can you think it <hi>prudent</hi> to ſubmit to a Conſtitution, on which your Miniſters, when you have been at ever ſo
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006158_0060_1027F93852EAD5A0"/>much Charge in obtaining and ſettling them, may leave you when they pleaſe, without having any Perſon to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and them!</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>State of eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline</hi> in the Epiſcopal Churches in <hi>America,</hi> renders it <hi>inexpedient</hi> for us to go over to their Communion.</p>
            <p>Diſcipline is as abſolutely neceſſary to the well-being of the Church, as any other Inſtitution of the Goſpel. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> allows the Neceſſity of it, <hi>p.</hi> 27. and he labours pretty hard to prove that you have and exerciſe it in your Churches. And rather than own this your great and <hi>eſſential</hi> Defect, he has contrived a Diſcipline for you, which has no Foundation in the Goſpel, and is really a great worſe than none. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend under my laſt general Head to ſhew, That there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Shadow of eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at Home, and ſtill leſs (if leſs can be) in the epiſcopal Congregations in <hi>America,</hi> and to urge this as an Argument againſt the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of our embracing that Communion. But as I now conſider the Matter in a <hi>merely prudential</hi> View, I will, for once ſuppoſe that you have ſome Diſcipline among you, I will take Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s own Account of the Nature of it; and ſee what Reaſon you have to value it, and how far you recommend your <hi>Prudence</hi> to the World in ſubmitting to it.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 26. of <q>a Commiſſion large enough, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſuch Miniſters as have the Care of <hi>American</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, to enable them, in GOD'S Name, and in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of CHRIST, to do every Thing that Men's comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Hopes and Happineſs require to be done; altho' they act in Subordination, and are obliged to pay a proper Deference to their Superiours the Biſhops.</q> He goes on, after allowing what he calls a <hi>Chiefty</hi> to the Biſhops, (which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual and ambiguous Word, by the Way, means every thing, or nothing, as Occaſion requires) to ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 27. <q>The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters ſubordinate to them, have as much Power in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their ſeveral Flocks, as Wiſdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006158_0061_1027F939F363EDF8"/>can think proper to entruſt them with.</q> Hitherto he is extremely cautious, and talks wholly in general Terms. I wiſh he had been a little more particular, and told us plainly, Whether a Preſbyter in <hi>England</hi> be liable to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> (mentioned in my <hi>Sermon</hi>) was for pretending to exerciſe Diſcipline on a ſcandalous Pariſhioner; and if ſo, whether their Preſbyters in <hi>America</hi> have a larger Commiſſion than thoſe in <hi>England.</hi> For if theſe Things be as I ſuppoſe they are, this ſame <hi>Chiefty</hi> in the Biſhops is (what the Word may well enough ſignify) a real <hi>Sov'reignty.</hi> And then Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> muſt mean, that as much Power of this Kind <hi>"as Wiſdom and Prudence can think proper to entruſt"</hi> the Preſbyters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with, is, in reallity, none at all. Thus I ſhould have been apt to underſtand him, were it not for what follows, <q>Nay we can ſay, even as <hi>Jerom</hi> to <hi>Evagrius, Quid facit Epiſcopus, quod Preſbyter, non faciat, excepta Ordinatione.</hi>
               </q> This ſets the Biſhop and Preſbyter <hi>upon a Par,</hi> in every Thing except Ordination; and conſequently reduces the Biſhop's <hi>Chiefty</hi> in Government and Diſcipline to what I believe it ought to be reduced to, juſt nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Having thus, to ſerve the preſent Occaſion, exalted the Preſbyter's Authority to ſo high a Pitch, as to make him <hi>equal to the Biſhop, in the Affair of Diſcipline,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 28. <q>
                  <hi>That ſuch Affairs</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> all diſciplinary Affairs) <hi>are left with the Miniſter to determine, according to his beſt Prudence, with the Authority belonging to his Office.</hi>
               </q> But then, tho' it is not quite conſiſtent with his adopting <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Saying, he would reſerve ſome Superiory, to the Biſhop in this Caſe; But ſuch an one as will be of no Service to you. He don't allow of an <hi>Appeal</hi> to the Biſhop, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Complaint</hi> againſt the injurious Prieſt. His Words are, That the Prieſt <q>has only to expect, that his Doings may be referred to his Biſhop; unto whoſe Judgment he muſt ſubmit, as well as the <hi>Party complaining,</hi> when Time will give Leave to obtain it.</q> Thus then the Matter ſtands according to him, every Miniſter of the Church of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006158_0062_1027F93CBB45E3A0"/>
               <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> has the <hi>full and ſole Authority</hi> of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, over all his Pariſhioners. The Perſon he cenſures can't <hi>appeal</hi> from his Judgment, but may <hi>refer</hi> the Matter to the Biſhop, <hi>by Way of Complaint</hi> againſt his Miniſter; and ſo be releived when Time will give Leave to obtain his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Judgment.</p>
            <p>But if this be really the Caſe, you muſt give me Leave to think, you are under the moſt <hi>arbitrary</hi> Government that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtained in the chriſtian World; and excuſe me, if I can't poſſibly entertain any <hi>high Opinion</hi> of your <hi>Prudence</hi> in ſubmitting to it. This is really, what Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly objects to us, "to have Judges of <hi>Aſſize</hi> and <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> in every Pariſh"; and which I fully agree with him, in ſaying, "I believe few People will be fond of". <hi>p.</hi> 27. This <hi>ill contrived</hi> and <hi>unhappy</hi> Scheme of his, will undoubtedly ſubject People's chriſtian Rights and eccleſiaſtical Priviledges to the arbitrary Diſpoſal of a Set of <q>
                  <hi>Eccleſiaſtical chief Judges, many of whom have not Capacity to decide a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy of thirteen pence half-penny</hi>
               </q> And this is an Event not more likely to happen in any Church in the World, than among you: For you have no Voice in chooſing your own Miniſters, and the Society, as ſome of the Sermons they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh inform us, appoint not ſuch Miniſters as they could wiſh, but ſuch as they can procure to go abroad, on the ſmall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement they are able to give. It may not be improper on this Occaſion, to put you in Mind of the known Story of of the Clergyman in <hi>England,</hi> who accepted a Miſſion in one of the Plantations. And being adviſed by the Biſhop to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelf well with Cloathing, ſince he was going into a Country where it was dear, and particularly to carry two or three Dozen Shirts; reply'd, <hi>Two or three Dozen Shirts!</hi> Alas, my Lord, had I known how to procure half a Dozen, I ſhould never have thought of going as a Miſſionary into <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Scheme of Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s, I ſay, ſubjects you to the arbitrary Judgment of your Miniſters; for he ſays the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is left <hi>"to determine according to his beſt Prudence".</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:006158_0063_1027F940D3803000"/>And the Right of complaining to the Biſhop, will with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>nine in ten</hi> of you, ſignify nothing, or afford no Relief. The Biſhop is a <hi>thouſand Leagues</hi> diſtant; and if you ſend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Complaint, his Lordſhip has not Leiſure to examine the Complaint and Evidences himſelf; it muſt go therefore to the ſpiritual Court: And who of you would be at the Trouble or Expence of proſecuting your Miniſter in ſuch a Court, or could expect any Succeſs in ſuch a Suit? Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> therefore well enough expreſſes it, when he ſays, the Miniſter muſt in this Caſe, ſubmit to the Judgment of his Biſhop, <hi>"when Time will give Leave to obtain it".</hi> And this, if you put the Matter to the Trial, will be found to mean <hi>never.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> can you conſent that a Stranger, one that perhaps left <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> for want of Bread, ſhould be intruſted with the <hi>ſole Right</hi> of admitting to and excluding from the ſacred Privileges of Chriſt's viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Are you willing to be looked upon and treated either as Chriſtians, or as <hi>Heathen Men and Publicans,</hi> according to the <hi>arbitrary</hi> Judgment of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Perſon?</p>
            <p>This Tyranny, for ſuch it truly is, we have the beſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt in our Communion; in which the Miniſter can cenſure no one Perſon, without the <hi>Conſent of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in the ſame Church. Thus the Man is treated like an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he is always <hi>tried by his Peers,</hi> and if he has Wrong done him, may ſpeedily and eaſily obtain a Re-hearing of his Cauſe before an <hi>eccleſiaſtical Council.</hi> And certainly he will never recommend his <hi>Prudence</hi> to the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial World, who, under the Notion of Expediency, forſakes a Church wherein he enjoyed ſuch <hi>invaluable</hi> Privileges, and embraces a Communion which ſubjects him to ſo arbitrary and <hi>intolerable a Diſcipline</hi> as this.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Conforming to the Church of <hi>England</hi> tends to bring the Plantations into an <hi>unneceſſary and hurtful State of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:006158_0064_1027F943B1018070"/>
Theſe Plantations are, and of Right ought to be, dependent on the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in all their <hi>civil</hi> Concerns. And whatever the Enemies of the Plantations may report at Home, of the Danger of their caſting off their Dependence, I believe it may with Truth be affirmed, that there is not a Man of Senſe in them all, but what is willing, nay, would chuſe to continue in this State. To be ſure, the Advantages we derive from it, are more than ſufficient to render it elegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us. But an eccleſiaſtical Dependence is <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> 'tis what I have already ſhewn, neither God nor Man requires of us. And it will be altogether <hi>uſeleſs</hi> to us; for we ſhall derive no Advantages from it in Point of Protection, civil Privileges, or Trade. But who will engage that it ſhall not prove very <hi>hurtful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many diſadvantagious Conſequences juſtly to be apprehended in this Caſe. I will name one: The Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> allows of <hi>Pluralities</hi> and <hi>Non-reſidence.</hi> By this is meant, that a Miniſter may have two or three Pariſhes at once, and receive the Incomes of them all, how large ſoever they are, without living in them, or diſcharging the Duty of a Miniſter to them in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He need only hire ſome Perſon to do this as his <hi>Curate;</hi> which he can do perhaps for a Quarter of what the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are obliged to pay him. Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> ſtiles this <q>a <hi>Corruption</hi> of ſo crying and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> a Nature, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is practiſed, it is ſufficient to poſſeſs the People with great Prejudices againſt the Church that is guilty of it<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Abridgment,</hi> Vol. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note>.</q> And again, ſpeaking of the Ordination of Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he ſays, <q>They plight their Faith to God for the Care of Souls to be managed by them in Perſon, and upon that they will find the paſtoral Care to be a Load indeed; and ſo will neither deſert their Flocks, nor <hi>hire them out</hi> to <hi>weak,</hi> and perhaps <hi>ſcandalous Mercenaries.</hi> In which the Faultineſs of ſome hath brought a Blemiſh on this
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:006158_0065_1027F94684FA71D0"/>Church, and given Scandal to many<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 112.</note>.</q> But tho' this pious Biſhop, and others of the beſt Men in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have exclaimed againſt this as a <hi>ſcandalous Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and what brings a <hi>Blemiſh on the Church;</hi> it is ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and like to continue, too many of the Churchmen thinking, with Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> that all Deſires and Endeavours to reform the Church, deſerve only to be <hi>banter'd,</hi> under the Notion of <hi>"opening refining Shops".</hi> And ſince this Abuſe is openly tolerated, we have juſt Reaſon to fear, that ſhould we generally embrace that Communion, and have it eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us, ſome at leaſt of the richeſt Livings in the Country, would be given to Clergymen in <hi>England,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of coming over hither, would ſend ſome ſorry Curates to ſupply their Places; or, as the Biſhop expreſſes it, would <hi>hire</hi> us <hi>out to weak, and perhaps ſcandalous Mercenaries.</hi> As this would be conſiſtent with the Conſtitution and Laws of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we can have no Security againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treated in this Form. And perhaps it would be ſaid, that this was a proper Method of repaying the Clergy in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> what they had expended in introducing and ſettling the Church among us. And would you like it, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> to have a good Pariſh in this Country looked on like a good Place in the Cuſtoms, or any other Branch of the civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; and conſequently beſtowed upon the Perſon who could make moſt Friends to obtain it, and who ſought it with no other Deſign than to <hi>appoint a Deputy</hi> to do the Buſineſs, and put the Profits into his own Pocket? But</p>
            <p n="5">V. The <hi>ill Effects</hi> of Conformity to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon <hi>practical Religion,</hi> are the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> Reaſons againſt the <hi>Expedience</hi> of our embracing that Communion.</p>
            <p>I have been, and yet am at a Loſs, whether I ought to place this under the Head of <hi>Inexpedience</hi> or <hi>Unlawfulneſs.</hi> I
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006158_0066_1027F949A3315A88"/>place it <hi>here</hi> becauſe I would not force Things, by laying greater Streſs upon them than they will fairly bear. And as I ſuppoſe this will infer the <hi>very higheſt Degree</hi> of Inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo I hope you will remember there is but a very ſmall Difference between Things in the higheſt Degree inexpedient and Things abſolutely ſinful.</p>
            <p>This Argument againſt you was inſiſted on, in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> and I ſuppoſe no one Thing in it has been more ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has ſpent ſome Pages in attempting to confute it, and has not forgot to interſperſe them with <hi>harſh</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> Reflections on me. I look upon theſe as <hi>ſure Indications</hi> that the Argument pinched him pretty hard, for Men, tho' ſomething unhappy in their Tempers, don't uſe to be ſo angry when they are not hurt. This is all the Anſwer he is to expect to thoſe Things, ſo far as they are <hi>perſonal,</hi> but ſo far as they have any Appearance of Argument, I ſhall endeavour to give them their due Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion then is, Whether forſaking our Churches and conforming to Epiſcopacy, is a proper Means to promote <hi>practical Religion</hi> in the Country? or, on the contrary, will probably, in the Iſſue, prove prejudicial to it? And by <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Religion,</hi> I mean Conformity of Heart to the moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, evidenced by a ſtrict and conſciencious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the divine Laws. This is truly an important Queſtion, and deſerves your ſerious Conſideration. Religion is deſigned to recover Men from the ſad Effects of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from God, to make them holy, humble, meek and loving in the Temper of their Minds, devout Worſhippers of God, and really good Men; exactly juſt, and extenſively charitable in their Dealings with all Men; and ſober, chaſte and temperate in their whole Conduct; uſeful Members of human Society at preſent, and meet for angelic and divine Society in the World to come. So far as it produces theſe Effects it is plainly advantagious to Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>if the Light that is in</hi> them <hi>be Darkneſs, How great is that Darkneſs?</hi> If that which they call Religion makes them worſe, more vicious in their Temper and Conduct; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006158_0067_1027F94DF51ADD28"/>
               <hi>lofty Epithets</hi> they may beſtow upon the Religion they profeſs, 'tis plain that it had, on the Whole, been better for them to have been without it.</p>
            <p>The chriſtian Religion is wiſely and excellently ſuited to anſwer it's great Intentions in the Hearts and Lives of Men. And when it does not produce theſe Effects, and eſpecially when it produces the contrary, there is Reaſon to ſuſpect that it is very much corrupted. The famous <hi>Apologiſts</hi> for Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity in it's early Days, inſiſt much on this Argument in it's Favour, that it reformed Men; that thoſe who were <hi>vicious</hi> before they embraced it, became <hi>virtuous</hi> afterward; and that Chriſtians were really <hi>better Men</hi> that thoſe of any other Religion. And I don't remember that <hi>Celſus, Porphyry</hi> or even <hi>Julian</hi> ever told them in Reply, that their ſaying ſo proceeded from <q>
                  <hi>that Bigotry and Self-Admiration, which the Zealots among every Sort of enthuſiaſtic Sectaries, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ting'd with</hi>;</q> or that it was the Effect of a <hi>"raſh cenſorious Temper againſt thoſe whom they diſapproved"</hi> nor accuſed them of <q>
                  <hi>Phariſee-like pleaſing themſelves with Compariſons between their own Sect and all others; overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Hypocriſy and deteſtable Vices, and paſſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Cenſures upon other's Faults.</hi>
               </q> Or if any of them did make ſuch Replies, there was juſt as much <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in them, as there is in Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s ſaying all this to me. <hi>p.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>We have no <hi>infallible</hi> Rule whereby to judge of ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Things, as do not depend on a certain and known Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between Cauſes and Effects; which is perhaps the Caſe in every thing of a moral Nature. There are, however, Ways of forming a <hi>rational Judgment</hi> in theſe Caſes; and this may be ſo well founded as to be a proper and juſtifiable Rule of Action, to a reaſonable Creature accountable for his Conduct. It may amount to a <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> and we ſhall be inexcuſable, in the Sight of God and Man, if we do not act upon it; much more, if we act in Oppoſition to it. The <hi>beſt Way</hi> of judging with Regard to future Events, is to look back and enquire what Effects ſuch and ſuch Cauſes
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:006158_0068_1027F94F8241F508"/>have already produced. And if we find <hi>ſuch Events</hi> have commonly appeared upon <hi>ſuch Things</hi> being done, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is the Relation of Cauſe and Effect betwen them, tho' we can't always ſee the Connection. And hence we <hi>rationally</hi> judge, that if ſuch Actions be now or hereafter done, ſuch Effects will follow; unleſs we can diſcern ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>ſpecial</hi> in the Caſe, that probably will prevent it.</p>
            <p>This is the Way of judging I uſe, and would perſwade you to uſe in deciding the Queſtion now before us. Would you you form a rational Judgment, what Effect adhering to the Doctrines, Diſcipline and Worſhip of our Churches will have on practical Religion, look back and ſee what the Effect has formerly been; or would you judge what will be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a general Conformity to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> look abroad in the World, and conſider the State of practical Religion in thoſe Places that have for a long Time been wholly, or chiefly of that Profeſſion. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſeems very much at a Loſs what Reply to make on this Head, and attempts rather to <hi>evade</hi> than to <hi>anſwer</hi> the Argument. At <hi>firſt,</hi> he endeavours to <hi>diſgrace</hi> it, by repreſenting it as a Piece of <hi>Phariſaical Oſtentation. Then,</hi> he would <hi>prejudice</hi> his Readers againſt it, by ſaying, that it has been the common Pretence of every new Sect, from the Days of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> down to the lateſt <hi>New-Light Exhorters.</hi> In the <hi>next</hi> Place, he propoſes ſome <hi>Difficulties</hi> in the Way, and would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it <hi>impracticable</hi> to make a fair Compariſon in the Caſe; he aſks <hi>"Who ſhall hold the Ballance"?</hi> and ſays, of making a Compariſon, <hi>"if it could well be done".</hi> And yet, <hi>after all,</hi> he pretends the Argument is really in his Favour. But why all this <hi>Shuffling</hi> and <hi>Evaſion?</hi> If there be nothing at all in the Argument, why did not he plainly tell you, that it was a Matter of Indifference whether you chuſe a Religion that would make you better, or one that would make you worſe? Why ſhould any Perſon be prejudiced againſt an Argument, becauſe Men have pretended to juſtify themſelves by it, who had no Right to it, and againſt whom it concluded with it's full Force? But who will believe that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> thought
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006158_0069_1027F95163E218A0"/>this Argument really in his Favour, when he has taken ſo much Pains to diſgrace it, and prejudice his Readers againſt it? This affords the <hi>ſtrongeſt Preſumption</hi> that he was conſcious, that, on a fair Compariſon, the Advantage would be clearly on our Side.</p>
            <p>I am at no Difficulty in anſwering that Queſtion, <hi>"Who ſhall hold the Ballance"?</hi> Were I actuated by a <hi>Party Spirit,</hi> diſputing merely for Victory, or reſolving to maintain my Cauſe right or wrong, I ſhould, no Doubt, chuſe to refer it to ſuch Judges as I thought favourable to it; be ſure I ſhould not be ſo impolitic, as to chuſe the known Adverſaries of my Cauſe to decide it. But as this is not the Caſe with me, I willingly and <hi>of Choice</hi> refer the Matter to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. You, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> ſhall be Judges in this whole Controverſy between us. And 'tis for this Reaſon that I chuſe to write in the Form of an <hi>Addreſs to you.</hi> Conſider the Matter impartially, exerciſe a proper Concern for the temporal and eternal Intereſts of yourſelves and your Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and then ſeriouſly put this Queſtion to yourſelves, are you really willing that NEW-ENGLAND ſhould become, in Point of Religion, a BARBADOS or a JAMAICA, and let Conſcience give the deciſive Anſwer.</p>
            <p>This Compariſon is eaſily made, for there are few of our Towns but what have ſome Perſons worthy of Credit, who have been in the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands, of whom you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning the Profeſſion and Practice of Religion that are to be found there. And the Compariſon is unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably fair. Theſe <hi>Iſlands</hi> have for a long Time had the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſettled in them. <hi>Barbados</hi> in particular, is wholly laid out into Pariſhes; has Churches built, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters officiating in them. And they are both, I think wholly (to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſure chiefly) Epiſcopal. This Country, on the contrary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as been wholly <hi>Antiepiſcopal,</hi> and at this Day the <hi>Epiſcoparians</hi> bear an inconſiderable Proportion to the Body of the People. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> thinks <q>
                  <hi>a Compariſon to decide this controverſy, would much more properly be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the State of Religion and Virtue in the whole Nation of</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:006158_0070_1027F9542E3E8FE0"/>England, <hi>before any of theſe</hi> refining Sects <hi>open'd their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Shops in the Kingdom; and the State of Religion and Virtue at preſent; and as it has been gradually improving to better or worſe ever ſince.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 32. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> knew that ſuch a Compariſon was <hi>impracticable,</hi> and would decide nothing. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Compariſon propoſed to be made, was eſtabliſhed by Queen ELIZBETH'S <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> which had the Royal Aſſent <hi>June</hi> 24. 1559.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Salmon</hi>'s Chronol.</note> But the Settlement of it was not properly compleated 'till the <hi>Convocation</hi> agreed to it, in 1563. Now if by <hi>"refining Sects",</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> means the <hi>old Puritans,</hi> they were in the Church from the Beginning, and were ſo numerous in this Convocation, that (as I have before proved) they had almoſt carried the Vote in the Lower Houſe. But if by <hi>"opening their refining Shops",</hi> he intends actually ſeparating from the Church, he will get but little by this; for the beſt Hiſtorians date the <hi>Separation,</hi> 1566<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Neal,</hi> Vol. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 230.</note>. There was therefore only <hi>three Years,</hi> at moſt but <hi>ſeven,</hi> from the Settlement of the Church, to the Riſe of the Separation; and this is vaſtly <hi>too ſhort</hi> a Space for making ſuitable Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, in order to the drawing the Compariſon propoſed. His propoſing ſuch an <hi>impracticable Compariſon</hi> as this, could have no other Deſign than to divert you from that juſt and eaſy one I had ſtated. What now becomes of <hi>"the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Virtue, Piety and practical Godlineſs"</hi> of theſe Times, <hi>"remaining to this Day".</hi> The Inſtances he names, <hi>p.</hi> 33. and which he ſays your <hi>"deſpiſing Neighbours can't pretend to vie with",</hi> were either erected before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Popery;</hi> or have ſpung up ſince the <hi>Separation.</hi> and I don't believe he can produce an Inſtance of ſo much as the building a ſingle Pariſh Church, in that ſhort Period, in which the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſat alone, and had no Rival to ſtir her up to Emulation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:006158_0071_1027F957011E9B18"/>
Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> may flout as much as he pleaſes, at "<hi>the ſelf-admiring Saints of</hi> New-England", and gently touch the <hi>abominable Vices</hi> that abound in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and if theſe Things afford him any Satisfaction in his ſober and retired Hours, I ſhall not endeavour to deprive him of it. But after all he has ſaid to make the Difference, in Point of practical Religion, appear ſmall and inconſiderable; I am confident, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> that there is not a ſober Man among you, but that, when dying, would much rather leave a Family of young Children to be educated among us, than in any one of thoſe Iſlands.</p>
            <p>As to what he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 34. of <q>
                  <hi>the late ſcandalous Efforts of ſatanic Zeal",</hi> and "<hi>the Obſtructions and Checks they met with from the Church of</hi> England <hi>Congregations</hi>;</q> I reply, that Errors and Diſorders he refers to, did very much ariſe from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and were an <hi>unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Imitation</hi> of the Conduct of it's Clergy. The <hi>Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> which they had ſpread in the Country did as naturally beget the late <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors, as one Extreme produces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The firſt <hi>Itinerants</hi> I ever knew were <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> from the <hi>Society for propagating the Goſpel.</hi> The Doctrine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t our Miniſters and Churches are neither Miniſters nor Churches of Chriſt, and that therefore it was lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Chriſtians to renounce and ſeparate from them, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> preached by the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and from them the late and preſent <hi>Seducers</hi> learnt the Art of <hi>fiſhing in troubled Waters,</hi> viſiting ſuch Places as were in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and heading every Party that ſat themſelves up in Oppoſition to the Miniſter or Church they belonged to. I wiſh theſe Gentlemen had oppoſed the late Errors as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, not by inſiſting on the contrary Errors, but by du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explaining the great Truths of the Goſpel, which theſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Perſons either miſtook or abuſed. But as <hi>they</hi> have managed the Matter, I fear Religion is thrown into a <hi>chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſeaſe</hi> by their Method of curing it of an <hi>accute one;</hi> as an unſkilful Phyſician, to cure his Patient of a <hi>Pleuriſy,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times takes away ſo much of his Blood and Spirits, as brings
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:006158_0072_1027F95AF9867C78"/>on an <hi>incurable Conſumption.</hi> Upon the Whole, I am of the Opinion, that had there been no <hi>Epiſcopal Congregations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, the late Diſorders would either never have ariſen, or been carried off in a much better Manner.</p>
            <p>There is but one Thing more to be conſidered under this Head. Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> tho' he can't deny the Fact, that <hi>practical Religion</hi> decays among us ſince the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has been introduced; will have it that I miſtake the Cauſe. <hi>p.</hi> 33. <q>
                  <hi>If Mr.</hi> Hobart <hi>(ſays he) had well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the true Cauſe and Springs from which the Immorality, Atheiſm and Profaneneſs of the preſent Age is derived, he could never have imputed it to any Defects in the Conſtitution of the Church of</hi> England.</q> In Anſwer to this I will not inſiſt on the <hi>Want of Diſcipline</hi> in that Church, tho' I look upon it as one of the principal Cauſes of theſe Things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſhall have Occaſion to conſider this more at large, under the laſt general Head. I will therefore at preſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve, That the not altering the publick Forms in the Liturgy, according to the Changes that happen in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Cuſtoms of Mankind, appears to me as one great Cauſe of the <hi>Irreligion</hi> that prevails in the Nation. I ſhall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this Remark by giving an Inſtance or two of it.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Church Catechiſm</hi> was compoſed, all Children had <hi>God-Fathers</hi> and <hi>God-Mothers;</hi> private Baptiſms were not practiſed unleſs in Caſes of apparent Danger, and if the Child recovered, he was brought forth afterwards, and had <hi>Sponſors</hi> to anſwer for him. But the Caſe is now very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and eſpecially in this Country. Many of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren catechized at Church, were baptized among us; many more were <hi>privately</hi> baptized, the Parents chuſing this from a Scruple concerning the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm. It has been a common Practice among you, to teach <hi>ſuch</hi> Children the Church Catechiſm; and you have no other Form of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for them. To uſe this Form is to teach ſuch Children direct Falſities in plain Matters of Fact, as a Part of religious Education. And ſurely that muſt be the direct Way to make them profane and irreligious. This I mentioned in
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006158_0073_1027F95DDB26CA58"/>my <hi>Sermon,</hi> in Anſwer to which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> is ſo far from vindicating your Conduct, that he does not pretend either to <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>juſtify</hi> the Fact: But implicitly gives up the Cauſe; for he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 41. <q>
                  <hi>It might be more proper to begin with the Creed,</hi> or elſe to aſk,—<hi>What Anſwer do the Children of the Church give, when aſked who gave you that Name</hi>?</q> Who would have tho't that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſhould be the Man to <hi>"open a refining Shop"</hi> to melt down and new Coin the public Formula's of the Church? Or how came he by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to alter any Part of the eſtabliſhed Liturgy?</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> by her 59th CANON, requires all her Miniſters, <q>
                  <hi>on every Sunday and Holiday before Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer, for Half an Hoar or more, to examine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Youth and ignorant Perſons of his Pariſh, in the ten Commandments, the Articles of the Belief, and the Lord's Prayer; and diligently to hear, inſtruct and teach them in the</hi> Catechiſm ſet forth in the Book of Common Prayer.</q> I don't ſee but the Miniſter is obliged to keep to the <hi>Form</hi> in <hi>Catechiſing</hi> as much as in <hi>Praying:</hi> And <hi>changing</hi> or <hi>omitting</hi> any Part ſeems as little allowed in one Caſe as in the other. The Penalty for the Miniſter's neglecting <hi>thus to catechize,</hi> on the third Conviction, is <hi>Excommunication.</hi> And <hi>"Fathers, Mothers, Maſters or Miſtreſſes neglecting their Duties"</hi> in not ſending <hi>"their Children, Servants or Apprentices"</hi> to be thus catechized, are to be ſuſpended, and if they perſiſt herein by the Space of a Month, to be excommunicated. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> has been ſo often boaſted of as the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> and <hi>beſt conſtituted Church;</hi> I think it plain, that if her Conſtitution be received by us, without conſiderable Amendments, we ſhall find ourſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, under Pain of Excommunication, to ſuch Things as are <hi>unlawful</hi> in themſelves, and in their Conſequences <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Morals</hi> of our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> could produce Authority for mending the Form of catechiſing, which, as appears from the <hi>Canon</hi> cited, is a <hi>Part of the publick Service of the Church,</hi> to be uſed upon all Sundays and Holidays; yet the <hi>Amendments</hi> he propoſes
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006158_0074_1027F95F6DD12810"/>would not anſwer. To <hi>"begin with the Creed"</hi> would not do; becauſe there is Mention of <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> in the Catechiſm, as well <hi>after</hi> the Creed as <hi>before</hi> it. To change the Queſtion, and aſk, <hi>"What Anſwer do the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church give, when aſked, who gave you that Name"?</hi> would be very improper in the Caſe of ſuch Children as have received the Baptiſm of the Church in Private; for ſince the Church declares theſe <hi>lawfully and ſufficiently baptized",</hi> I hope Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> would not have them look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>"but in the Order of Catechumens".</hi> And indeed this Way of propoſing the Queſtions to any Children is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. Should the Biſhop, when he comes to <hi>confirm</hi> one of theſe Children, very <hi>gravely</hi> aſk him that <hi>important</hi> Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>What does a Child of the Church anſwer, when aſked, who gave you that Name?</hi> If his Lordſhip could keep his own Countenance, I very much doubt whether the Sight of a Pair of <hi>Lawn Sleeves</hi> would keep the Children from laughing in his Face. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> propoſes this <hi>great Advantage</hi> from aſking the Queſtion in this Form, <q>
                  <hi>Such Children would be thus put in Mind, that ſomething more is done by Baptiſm in the Church, than is pretended in the Meetings</hi>", and adds, <hi>I can eſteem ſuch Childrsn but in the Order of Catechumens, until they make the Stipulations themſelves a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many of your Miniſters (and I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> himſelf) have taught <hi>ſuch</hi> Children the Church Catechiſm without changing the Queſtions into this Form. The Child therefore has been ſolemnly taught, that <hi>in Baptiſm</hi> (which he received in one of our Churches) he <hi>"was made a Member of Chriſt, the Child of God, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor of the Kingdom of Heaven"</hi>

               <hi>Deiſt</hi> or <hi>Atheiſt?</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> himſelf was baptized in one of our Churches, and ſo, according to his own Principles, was made not a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> but a <hi>Catechumen.</hi> Now I would gladly be informed, how he ever came to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> (I mean externally, or <hi>Foro Eccleſiae</hi>) and why he is not even yet to be looked upon as in the <hi>Order of Catechumens.</hi> I have been informed that he never received <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and his receiving the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> cannot ſupply the Want of Baptiſm. I would enquire of him, Whether an Heathen's receiving the <hi>Communion</hi> would initiate him into the Goſpel Church, and entitle him to the Privileges of it, tho' it was known that he had never been baptized? And if he allows it, I wiſh he would inform me, Why Baptiſm is ever adminiſtred to an adult Perſon?</p>
            <p>The other Inſtance I ſhall produce to ſhew, that the not altering public Forms, ſo as to accommodate them to the Circumſtances and prevailing Cuſtoms of the World, tends to introduce Irreligion and Prophaneneſs; ſhall be taken from the Office of <hi>Matrimony.</hi> When this Office was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it was the general (I ſuppoſe the univerſal) Practice of the Nation, to marry upon the Foot of the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> which gives the Wife a Right of <hi>Dower</hi> in her Huſband's Eſtate. It was therefore well enough for the Man to ſay, <hi>"with all my Worldly Goods I thee endow",</hi> for he really meant as he ſaid. The Cuſtoms of the Nation are ſo very much alter'd ſince that Time, that perhaps there is not now one Marriage in ten, among People of Faſhion and Eſtate, without a <hi>Jointure,</hi> that is, ſome Certainty ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Woman inſtead of the <hi>Right of Dower.</hi> Thus a Man and Woman agree before Marriage, that in Caſe ſhe outlives him, ſhe ſhall have a certain Sum of Money, or the Rents of ſuch an Eſtate during her natural Life, <hi>in Conſideration of which ſhe quits the Right of Dower,</hi> which the Law would otherwiſe give her. But tho' the Practice is thus changed, the Form of Matrimony is not changed. And therefore when a Man and Woman have ſolemnly agreed under Hand and Seal, that ſhe ſhall <hi>not be endowed,</hi> or have any Right of Dower in
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:006158_0076_1027F96683F4FC38"/>his Eſtate, they go into the Church, and the Man, taught by the Prieſt, ſays to the Woman,—<q>
                  <hi>With all my worldly Goods I thee endow, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </q> Thus is the <hi>ſacred Name</hi> of God taken in vain in a great Part of the Marriages in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe is ſtill worſe in many Inſtances in this Country, where there are frequently Marriages contracted between <hi>Slaves.</hi> I have been informed that ſome of your Miniſters uſe this Form in <hi>ſuch</hi> Marriages, and the Laws of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do, I think, evidently oblige them to it; CAN. 62. <q>No Miniſter upon Pain of Suſpenſion, <hi>per Triennium ipſo Facto,</hi> ſhall celebrate Matrimony between any Perſons without a Faculty or Licenſe—except the Banns of Matrimony have been firſt publiſhed three ſeveral Sundays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any Miniſter, upon the like Pain, under any Pretence whatſoever, join any Perſons—in Marriage—but only between the Hours of Eight and Twelve in the Forenoon, nor in any private Place, but either in the Church or Chapel where one of them dwelleth, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Time of divine Service.</q> Thus Marriage is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Canon,</hi> to be celebrated in the Church, in Time of divine Service; and I think it is allowed on all Hands, that the <hi>Subſcription</hi> required by the 36th CANON, obliges to the Uſe of the Forms in the Common Prayer Book, <hi>in all public Adminiſtrations in the Church.</hi> But now if one of your Miniſters, joining a couple of <hi>Negro Slaves</hi> in Marriage, ſhall teach the Man to ſay to the Woman, <q>
                  <hi>With all my worldly Goods I thee endow, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>;</q> when he and all preſent know, that neither of them have, or are capable of having Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in any thing whatever; the <hi>looſer Part</hi> of the Auditory would probably look upon it as a <hi>ſolemn Farc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and be hardened in Impiety and Prophaneneſs by it; while all who have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Reverence</hi> for that ſacred Name in which they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, muſt find <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Horror</hi> ariſing in their Minds on hearing it thus <hi>abuſed</hi> in the Time and Place of divine
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:006158_0077_1027F9686011E278"/>Service, and ſo expoſed to the Contempt and Ridicule of the profane Part of Mankind. I hope this Specimen may convince Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> that the Immorality, Atheiſm and Profaneneſs of the preſent Age is in ſome Meaſure owing to Defects in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore ſhall wholly omit many other Inſtances which might eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced under this Head.</p>
            <p>And now I ſuppoſe the <hi>ſecond Queſtion</hi> ſufficiently anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if the Church of <hi>England</hi> requires ſo vaſt a <hi>Charge</hi> to ſupport it; exerciſes ſuch an <hi>arbitrary</hi> Power over thoſe who ſubmit to it; in the important Articles of appointing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Miniſters; ſubjects them to ſo <hi>tyrannical</hi> a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; tends to bring theſe Plantations into an unneceſſary and hurtful State of <hi>eccleſiaſtical Dependence;</hi> and if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to it will, in all human Probability, iſſue in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of practical Religion,</hi> and the Introduction of Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Profaneneſs of every Kind; ſurely no reaſonable Man will pretend that it is <hi>prudent</hi> for us to conform to that Church; or that you have acted a wiſe and reaſonable Part in deſerting our Churches and going over to that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And having proved theſe Things, I ſuppoſe I may very <hi>juſtly</hi> and <hi>pertinently</hi> repeat my former Expoſtulation, <q>
                  <hi>Can you anſwer it to God or your own Conſciences, to the preſent Age, or to Poſterity, if you ſhould be inſtrumental in deſtroying an eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution ſo exactly agreable to the Goſpel, and which has been ſo ſignally owned and bleſſed for promoting Religion in the Power and Practice of it: And in introducing inſtead of it, ſo</hi> defective a Conſtitution, <hi>and which will, almoſt certainly, bring with it, an</hi> Inundation of Vice and Looſeneſs, <hi>and iſſue in the</hi> Deſtruction of practical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? <hi>Is it,</hi> my Brethren, <hi>a Matter of Indifference with you, whether your Children prove like the former Generations in</hi> New-England; <hi>who were ſo remarkable for ſerious Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and practical Godlineſs; or run into that Careleſſneſs and Looſeneſs, that open Irreligion and undiſguiſed Profaneneſs, which are ſo dreadfully viſible where the Church of</hi> England

                  <hi>has the Aſcendant, and eſpecially where People are ſo unhappy as to have no other religious Profeſſion?</hi>
               </q> But I paſs to</p>
            <p>THE THIRD QUESTION.</p>
            <p>Whether it be LAWFUL for particular Members of <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Churches, to ſeparate from them, and join in Communion with the Epiſcopal Aſſemblies in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</p>
            <p>By <hi>Members of the New-Engliſh Churches,</hi> I mean, not only actual Communicants, but all that have been born and bred, baptized and educated in them. Theſe all are in ſome Senſe, tho' not in the higheſt Senſe, Members of theſe Churches. And concerning all theſe I make no Scruple to aſſert, that it is <hi>unlawful,</hi> or really ſinful for them to ſeparate from the Churches of which they are thus Members, and join in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Epiſcopal Congregations</hi> in the Country. And the higher Profeſſion any particular Perſon has made, or the more expreſs and particular his Engagements to our Churches have been, the more aggravated is his Sin in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking them. The Reaſons which convince me, and which I think ought to convince you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> of this, are ſuch as theſe:</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>State of the miniſterial Office,</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and particularly the <hi>ſinful Subjection</hi> of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Miniſters in <hi>America,</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates, renders it unlawful for us to go over to that Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is a Matter of no ſmall Conſequence to the <hi>chriſtian Church,</hi> that the miniſterial Office in it, be kept in the ſame State, and on the ſame Footing as Chriſt left it; and all Changes and Innovations in it muſt be of dangerous Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He that has juſt Sentiments of the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God our Saviour, will ſuppoſe that his Inſtitutions don't need our Amendments: And he that has a proper Senſe
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:006158_0079_1027F96FAF5E9E10"/>of the entire Dependence of Goſpel Adminiſtrations on the Bleſſing of Chriſt, will think he acts the ſafeſt Part, and is moſt likely to obtain Succeſs, when he ſtrictly adheres to Chriſt's own Orders and Appointments.</p>
            <p>I endeavour'd in my late <hi>Sermon,</hi> briefly to repreſent the State of the Miniſtry as deſcribed in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> and to ſhew the Oppoſition between this and the State of it in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and among you at this Day. Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> has undertaken your Defence, and taken a pretty deal of Pains to prove me miſtaken in my Notions of this Matter. There are <hi>three</hi> Things he objects againſt in this Affair, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Equality</hi> of Goſpel Miniſters,—My Account of the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi>—and my repreſenting the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>preaching</hi> not by Virtue of their Ordination, but <hi>by Virtue of the Biſhop's Licenſe.</hi> 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Buſineſs to defend what I have offered on theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Queſtion between us under this Head is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt or his Apoſtles inſtituted a proper and <hi>ſtanding Prelacy</hi> in the Church; or appointed <hi>different Orders</hi> in the Miniſtry, veſted with <hi>eſſentially</hi> different Powers and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be continued in the Goſpel Church? Now after all the Labour Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has been at to convince me of this, I can by no Means aſſent to it, and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) It appears plain to me, that all Chriſt left in Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as Officers in the Goſpel Church, at the Time of his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention into Heaven, were equal in Office and Power. The Diſputants on your Side uſe ſometimes to inſiſt, that the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi> Diſciples were left in Commiſſion by Chriſt as Officers in the Goſpel Church. And Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> in ſome of his former Writings, appears to have been of this Opinion. But I find he is grown older and wiſer; for as I referred him to the <hi>Sober Remarks</hi> for a full a ſolid Confutation of this, and he now makes no Mention of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> I look upon him as giving up the Argument drawn from them. There
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006158_0080_1027F9713678AFD8"/>was therefore but ONE COMMISSION, that recorded <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 19, 20. left by Chriſt in the Goſpel Church, when he aſcended into Heaven. And therefore there were only the <hi>eleven Apoſtles,</hi> to whom this Commiſſion was immediately given, that could at that Time be looked upon as Officers in the Goſpel Church. And theſe were equal in every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Office, Power or Authority. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> don't care to allow, that Equality of Power can be argued from the Identity of the Commiſſion; and I have no Occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this with him, ſince he grants all I now inſiſt on; <hi>viz.</hi> That it did in Fact make the <hi>eleven Apoſtles</hi> equal. His Words are theſe, (<hi>p.</hi> 13.) <q>With Reſpect to the Apoſtles who were immediately authorized to gather and govern the Church by this Commiſſion, it ſeems to <hi>make them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals in that Power: Certainly it does not ſubject ſome unto any one their Number.</hi>
               </q> Now if Chriſt left only this Commiſſion in his Church when he aſcended into Heaven, and this Commiſſion was of ſuch a Nature as to make all to whom it was immediately given, that is, all who then were Officers in the Church, equal in Power, and not ſome ſubject to others; it muſt, I think, undeniably follow, that at this remarkable Period of Chriſt's Aſcention, there was the moſt exact Parity among Goſpel Miniſters, and no Subordination of one to another. And conſequently, Prelacy was not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt himſelf. I go on to aſſert,</p>
            <p n="2">(2). The Apoſtles did not inſtitute any other ſtanding Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Goſpel Miniſtry, properly ſo called, either ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or or inferior, to thoſe whom Chriſt himſelf had thus left in Commiſſion. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> here attempts to prove, That the Apoſtles <hi>might,</hi> conſiſtently with the Commiſſion they received from Chriſt, appoint a <hi>Diſparity</hi> in the Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and that <hi>in Fact</hi> they <hi>did ſo.</hi> Let us examine his Reaſonings on theſe Points.</p>
            <p>He will have it, in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, that tho' Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion did not make an Inequality among the Apoſtles, yet it was large enough to authorize them to make one among
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006158_0081_1027F9758F61B2C8"/>themſelves, or at leaſt, that it was no Way inconſiſtent with their Commiſſion for them to do this. This he argues largely, <hi>p.</hi> 13, 14, 15. To all which I reply,</p>
            <p>If by Power to make an Inequality among themſelves, he meant no more than that they might, for Order ſake, chooſe a Prolocutor, or Moderator, or (if he like the Term better) a Preſident, any Thing conſiſtent with his being only <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus inter Pares,</hi> or the firſt Man among Equals; I know no Body that diſputes it, and he knows we allow and practiſe it. But if he means a proper <hi>Difference of Order,</hi> if he would have this Preſident an Officer of an Order diſtinct from and ſuperior to thoſe among whom he preſides, and veſted with Powers and Authorities eſſentially different from their's; which muſt be his Meaning, if he would ſay anything to his Purpoſe, or lay any Foundation for the Prelacy eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> In this Caſe I would enquire, Whether theſe Powers which thus dignify and diſtinguiſh this Preſident, are contained in the <hi>original Commiſſion</hi> given to the whole Number, or not. I ſuppoſe it will be ſaid that they are contained in it: Becauſe otherwiſe the Preſident will have his Commiſſion to ſeek, and it will be found that they who ſet him up have pretended to give him an Authority which they themſelves never had. And if this dignified Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident has no Kind or Degree of Authority but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Commiſſion, how comes he by Powers which the Reſt have not; ſince the Commiſſion it ſelf, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all his Powers was given equally to them all? There is but <hi>one Way</hi> in which this can be effected, and that is, by ſuppoſing each of the others to have <hi>leſs Authority</hi> than they had before the Preſident was choſen; for if he can't have more Power than the Commiſſion gives, they muſt have leſs, or elſe they will ſtill remain in their <hi>primitive State of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> But this latter Suppoſition is as abſurd as the former; for the Powers granted to any Perſon, or to any Number of Perſons by Commiſſion, are their's to uſe, and not go give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And had the <hi>eleven</hi> Apoſtles acted in this Form, and ſet up <hi>Peter,</hi> for Inſtance, as their Preſident, with Powers eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:006158_0082_1027F979070E80D8"/>different from the Reſt; 'tis very plain that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ten</hi> had degraded themſelves from the Office in which Chriſt placed them, and conſequently had incapacitated them ſelves for the Service he required and expected from them. And I hope Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> can ſee that this would have been inconſiſtent with their Duty to him.</p>
            <p>Our Author goes on to conſider the Matter <q>
                  <hi>with Reſpect to other Officers or Miniſters in the Church, to whom this Commiſſion was not immediately given by Chriſt,</hi>
               </q> as he expreſſes it, <hi>p.</hi> 15. And he aſks, <q>
                  <hi>Can Equality among ſuch with any Propriety be argued from this Commiſſion</hi>?</q> Now if by <q>
                  <hi>Officers to whom this Commiſſion was not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately given,</hi>
               </q> he intends only <hi>different Perſons</hi> admitted into the <hi>ſame Office</hi> as <hi>Colleagues</hi> or <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to theſe firſt Officers (which by his Uſe of the Word <hi>immediately</hi> here and in <hi>p.</hi> 13. ſeems to be his Meaning) I anſwer, No Doubt Equality among ſuch may, with the <hi>ſtricteſt Propriety,</hi> be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from the Commiſſion. It would be ſtrange indeed, if the Commiſſion made thoſe to whom it was <hi>immediately given</hi> equal, as he owns it did, and thoſe to whom it was <hi>mediately given</hi> not equal. But perhaps by <hi>"other Officers or Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church",</hi> the Gentleman means Officers of a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Order</hi> from thoſe to whom this Commiſſion was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately given; and if ſo, it would have been exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for him to have proved that there were any ſuch in the Apoſtles Days, before he enquired whether they were equal or unequal to one another. This he well knew I utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and therefore all his Diſcourſe of <q>
                  <hi>every Order and Degree of Miniſtry—how different ſoever in Power—being</hi> virtuated <hi>by this Commiſſion,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 15, 16. is merely <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Queſtion,</hi> for the very Thing in Debate is taken for granted and argued from.</p>
            <p>Nothing is, or can be <hi>virtuated,</hi> by the Commiſſion any Perſon acts under, but what that Commiſſion authorizes him to act. And I believe Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> is the firſt Man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuppoſed a Commiſſion authoriſed a Man to do every thing it does not expreſly forbid; or, which amounts to the

There is no Clauſe in the Commiſſion of <hi>Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> expreſly forbidding him to try and execute a Man for High Treaſon, and yet it would be Murder in him to do it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> perhaps will think this Inſtance not parallel, becauſe he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 13. <q>
                  <hi>Much was left to their [the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles] Wiſdom and Prudence,</hi> eſpecially under the Guidance of Inſpiration.</q> The latter Clauſe in this Sentence, whatever might be intended by it, can I think ſerve no other Purpoſe but to embarraſs the Matter, and miſlead the inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Reader. For it plainly confounds two entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Capacities, in which the Apoſtles acted; and which muſt carefully be diſtinguiſhed by all that would form clear Apprehenſions of their Characters and of the Grounds on which they acted. 'Tis one Queſtion, What the Apoſtles might do, as perſons acting under the ordinary and ſtanding Commiſſion Chriſt has given to the Goſpel Miniſtry; and another, and a quite different Queſtion, what they might do, as Perſons extraordinarily directed and inſpired by the Holy Spirit. In the former Capacity they could act nothing but what a Perſon veſted with the ſame Commiſſion, may at this Day act, at leaſt in like Circumſtances: But in the latter Capacity they might regularly do any Thing the Holy Spirit excited and directed them to.</p>
            <p>This Diſtinction is very plain and obvious, and 'tis what Chriſt himſelf pointed out to his Apoſtles. For after he had given them the <hi>ſtanding Commiſſion,</hi> which made them properly Officers in his Kingdom, and in which only they were to have Succeſſors; he ſaid to them, (Luke xxiv. 49.) <hi>And behold I ſend the Promiſe of my Father upon you: But tarry ye in the City of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>until ye be endued with Power from on High.</hi> This <hi>Power from on High</hi> thus diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Power of Office</hi> which they already had by Virtue of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, evidently means the immediate Inſpiration and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:006158_0084_1027F97E9D45C258"/>Influences of the Holy Ghoſt. The Writers on this Controverſy commonly make this Diſtinction in the Terms of the <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Powers of the Apoſtles; meaning by the <hi>former</hi> what are contained in the Commiſſion, and ſo are common to all to whom the Commiſſion itſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; that is, to the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors in the Goſpel Miniſtry: And by the <hi>latter,</hi> thoſe that aroſe from immediate Inſpiration, and ſo were peculiar to the Apoſtles, or ſuch wherein they had no Succeſſors. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> is too well acquainted with the Controverſy to be thought ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this Diſtinction ſo commonly made, not could he be inſenſible that in my <hi>Sermon</hi> I ſteadily conſidered the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their <hi>ordinary Character,</hi> or as acting merely by virtue of that Commiſſion, which Chriſt gave with an expreſs Deſign that it ſhould remain in Force, and be executed to the End of the World. As therefore he is <hi>inaccurate</hi> in confounding theſe ſo greatly different Capacities, ſo he is <hi>diſingenuous</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents me as ſaying, that <q>Marcus, Demas, <hi>&amp;c. were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual</hi> (for he means is all Reſpects equal) <hi>to St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and the reſt of the Apoſtles". p.</hi> 18. When he declares, as <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>I believe Mr</hi> Hobart <hi>is the firſt Man that ever thought of making</hi> Demas <hi>an Apoſtle of equal Authority with St.</hi> Paul.</q> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 18. <q>
                  <hi>I can't believe that Mr.</hi> Hobart <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any other Perſon of tolerable Senſe, will deny (upon cool Reflection) the Imparity in Office and Power, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between the Apoſtles and other Miniſters.</hi>
               </q> A <hi>generous Adverſary</hi> would not have been guilty of ſo <hi>low an Artifice</hi> as this. For while he would thus, to prejudice you againſt me, repreſent me as ſaying what no Body ever dreamt of before, he knew there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> nothing at all in it. He well knew I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to make any <hi>ordinary Miniſter</hi> of the Goſpel, equal to an Apoſtle, <hi>conſidered in his extraordinary Capacity;</hi> and he knew likewiſe, that to make them equal in their <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Character,</hi> or conſider'd merely as commiſſionated Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in Chriſt's Kingdom, was nothing peculiar to me, but what is commonly done by the Writers on our Side of the Queſtion. And if this plain and eaſy Diſtinction be kept in
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006158_0085_1027F9805DDFCFD8"/>Mind, the Argument for Equality among Goſpel Miniſters, drawn from the Commiſſion Chriſt gave them, remains in it's full Force, and is not in any Degree weakened by all Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has offered againſt it. His having Recourſe in this Caſe to what the Apoſtles might do, <hi>"under the Guidance of Inſpiration",</hi> is a tacit Confeſſion, that they could not erect the Prelacy he pleads for, <hi>merely by Virtue of their Commiſſion;</hi> and the Reaſon of this muſt be, becauſe the Commiſſion did not give them Authority to do it. Thus far then I think we may go on ſure Ground, There was at firſt a <hi>perfect Parity</hi> or Equality among Goſpel Miniſters; and no one of them was of an higher Order, or veſted with greater Authority than the Reſt. For Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> allows, that the Commiſſion itſelf <hi>"ſeems to make them Equals";</hi> and I have proved that it did not give them Authority to introduce an Inequality of Order among themſelves.</p>
            <p>We are <hi>next</hi> to enquire, Whether the Apoſtles, <hi>under the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> did in Fact inſtitute any other or different Order in the Goſpel Miniſtry, properly ſo called. For tho' they could not do this, conſidered as <hi>acting under the Commiſſion</hi> we have been diſputing about, becauſe that gave them no Authority to do it, and conſequently of they had done it, we muſt not ſay that the Order of Miniſty thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted was <hi>virtuated by this Commiſſion,</hi> but by <hi>their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Authority as inſpired Perſons;</hi> yet if they did it under the Influence and Direction of Holy Spirit, we are doubtleſs obliged to obſerve ſuch their Appointment. I argued in my <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> againſt their having done this, from the Silence of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writers on this Head, in this Manner, <q>
                  <hi>We never read in the New-Teſtament of any other</hi> Orders <hi>being erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Goſpel-Miniſtry; and doubtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> we ſhould have had a particular and plain Account of it, if any other had been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appointed; and not have been left to collect it from ſome</hi> few ſcattered Sentences <hi>and</hi> obſcure Hints <hi>of doubtful Interpretation.</hi>
               </q> And I illuſtrated the Remark, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, how very <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>circumſtantial</hi> an Account the inſpired Hiſtorian has given us of the Appointment of
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:006158_0086_1027F983322C8738"/>
               <hi>Deacons,</hi> an Order inferior to the Miniſtry properly ſo called. In anſwer to which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> tells me, <hi>p.</hi> 16. <q>
                  <hi>This whole Diſpute about Equality of Power among Miniſters, may</hi> eaſily <hi>be decided, by attending to the</hi> very plain Matters of Fact recorded in the New-Teſtament, <hi>of different</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>and</hi> Degress <hi>in the Miniſtry.</hi>
               </q> I am heartily glad to hear this; for, from hence I infer, in this firſt Place, That we need not have Recourſe to <hi>any other Records</hi> to decide it; and why then are <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> appealed to in the next Page? Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> I hope don't take their Writings for Part of the New-Teſtament. Again, if the whole Diſpute may be <hi>eaſily decided,</hi> and that from <hi>very plain Records,</hi> I hope we ſhall have no Occaſion to debate ſuch Texts as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly <hi>Obſcure,</hi> and which, after all the learned Labour which has been expended upon them, remain <hi>doubtful</hi> and of <hi>uncertain Interpretation.</hi> And as Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> is on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Side, it plainly belongs to him to produce theſe <hi>very plain</hi> Records of the New-Teſtament, which will ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> decide this whole Debate.</p>
            <p>He begins thus, <hi>p.</hi> 16 <q>
                  <hi>That the Deacons were an Order inferior, not only to the Apoſtles, but to other Miniſters then in the Church, Mr.</hi> Hobart <hi>allows.</hi>
               </q> There is ſomething in this Sentence I can't account for. By <hi>"other Miniſters then in the Church",</hi> he muſt mean, <hi>Miniſters of an Order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Apoſtles,</hi> otherwiſe I can't make Senſe of what he ſays. And yet he knows that if the Apoſtles are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their ordinary Capacity, I deny that there was any Order in the Miniſtry inferior to them; and he even repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents me as making all other Miniſters equal to them in all Reſpects. And there is not a Word in the Page of my <hi>Sermon</hi> he quotes to juſtify him in this. I there ſay, that the Deacons <hi>"are an Order inferior to the Ministry, properly ſo called",</hi> and by <hi>the Miniſtry properly ſo called,</hi> I mean the Office Chriſt inſtituted when he ſaid, <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. which Office I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſe common to the Apoſtles and all other Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goſpel. But this is not the only Time Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:006158_0087_1027F984E8B98598"/>has quoted that from my Sermon which was never in it; his very firſt Quotation, <hi>p.</hi> 7. is a flagrant Inſtance of this Kind. Had I taken ſuch Liberties in quoting from him, or any other Author, I make no Doubt he would have replied, <hi>"I boldly charge him with groſs Prevarication and Falſhood, done with a wicked Intent".</hi> But ſince Recriminations, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever juſt, do nothing toward determining the Controverſy, I chuſe to ſuppreſs them.</p>
            <p>I can by no Means allow that the Apoſtles appointing the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Deacons, proves their inſtituting different Orders in the Miniſtry <hi>properly ſo called;</hi> becauſe <hi>Deacons</hi> are not, properly ſpeaking, an Order <hi>in</hi> the Miniſtry, but (as I ſaid before) an Order <hi>inferior to it.</hi> Their Office is not ſo much as <hi>"vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated"</hi> by the only Commiſſion, given to the Goſpel Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for the Apoſtles in appointing this Office did not act by <hi>virtue of this Commiſſion,</hi> but as Perſons under the immediate Direction of the Holy Spirit. The <hi>Serving of Tables,</hi> which was the only Thing Deacons were originally appointed for, was no Part of the Office of a Goſpel Miniſter, nor is there a Word relating to it in his Commiſſion. Nay the Scripture oppoſes the Office to which <hi>Deacons</hi> were appointed, to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Word, Acts vi. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Then the Twelve called the Multitude of the Diſciples unto them, and ſaid, it is not Reaſon that we ſhould</hi> leave the Word of God, <hi>and</hi> ſerve Tables. <hi>Wherefore, Brethren, look ye out among you ſeven Man —whom we may appoint over</hi> this Buſineſs. <hi>But we will give ourſelves continually to Prayer and to</hi> the Miniſtry of the Word. Here the <hi>Word of God</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>the Service of Tables,</hi> and <hi>this Buſineſs,</hi> that is, the <hi>Serving of Tables</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> The proper Buſineſs of Deacons, and the only Deſign of their Inſtitution, is expreſſed by <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tables,</hi> and the peculiar Buſineſs of the Apoſtles is called the <hi>Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> remembers that <hi>teaching</hi> or preaching the Goſpel is the friſt and great Thing mentioned in the Commiſſion he and I ſo often refer to, I hope he will allow that the <hi>Miniſtry of the Word</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here, is the Miniſtry properly ſo called, and what the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:006158_0088_1027F98A25258198"/>Deacons as ſuch were not appointed to. Notwithſtanding therefore the Inſtances he has produced (ſome of which will not bear examining) of Perſons preaching and baptizing, who had <hi>formerly been</hi> Deacons, but now were Miniſters of the Goſpel; he muſt excuſe me, if inſtead of admitting this as a Proof of Inequality in the Miniſtry, I look upon the <hi>preaching Deacon</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a mere <hi>Lay-Exhortor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Place Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> mentions <q>
                  <hi>two Texts in the Writings of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>to put the Matter out of all Doubt, that in the firſt Planting of Chriſtianity, God himſelf eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed</hi> Imparity <hi>among the Miniſters whom he ſent to preach the Goſpel of his Son.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 18. The two Texts are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 28, 29. and <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 11. The latter of theſe Texts ſays not a Word about <hi>Parity</hi> or <hi>Imparity,</hi> which is the only Thing now under Conſideration; and therefore I ſhall only ſay of it as he does, <hi>"I will leave this without a Comment".</hi> And the former Text does rather expreſs a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> than an <hi>Inequality</hi> between the Perſons it refers to; and the Queſtions is, who theſe Perſons are. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers?</hi> &amp;c. I enquire, <hi>All who?</hi> Does he mean all Miniſters of the Goſpel, or all Members of the Chriſtian Church? Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> muſt ſay, <hi>all Miniſters:</hi> But this I can't believe, becauſe he denies their being <hi>Teachers,</hi> as ſtrongly as he does their being <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and I apprehend that an <hi>unpreaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> tho' allow'd in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did not obtain in the Apoſtles Time. And as the Apoſtle is, in the Context, drawing a Compariſon between the Church of Chriſt, and a natural Body, conſiſting of many Members, deſigned for and ſuited to different Uſes and Services, all of them neceſſary to the Good of the whole Body; it ſeems moſt agreable to his Deſign, to underſtand him, as I do, as ſpeaking of the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church</hi> in general, and not of the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> in particular. And thus This Text proves no Sort of <hi>Inequality</hi> among Goſpel <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:006158_0089_1027F98BAF4CC3C0"/>
I find nothing more in Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s <hi>Vindication,</hi> to prove a <hi>Diſparity</hi> among Miniſters, that requires any Anſwer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perhaps what he ſays <hi>p.</hi> 9. about the Word <hi>Synergoi</hi> or <hi>Fellow-Labourers.</hi> This I uſed in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> rather as an Introduction to the Argument, than as a Part of it. But ſince he has been pleaſed to make ſome Remarks upon it, and, with his uſual <hi>Accuracy</hi> and <hi>Condour,</hi> has carried the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo far as to make the Argument imply Blaſphemy, or a making Men equal with God; I think myſelf obliged to make ſome Reply. And ſhall therefore ſay, The Inſtances he gives of the Uſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Words <hi>Fellow-Men, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Chriſtians, &amp;c.</hi> make nothing againſt me, for the greateſt <hi>Prince</hi> and the meaneſt <hi>Beggar,</hi> conſidered merely <hi>as Men,</hi> or <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> are equal. But what I am principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in is the Uſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <hi>Synergoi</hi> in that Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 9. which is the only Inſtance Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, in which this Word can't be taken in the Senſe of Equality. The Words in the <hi>Original</hi> ſtand thus, <hi>Theou gar eſmen Synergoi,</hi> the moſt literal Tranſlation of which is, <hi>For we are God's Fellow Labourers;</hi> for the genitive Caſe <hi>Theou</hi> ought not to be rendred, as Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>with</hi> God; but <hi>God's,</hi> or <hi>of God.</hi> Should I ſay of myſelf and my Brethren in the Miniſtry, we are <hi>Theou Syndouloi, God's Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants;</hi> I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>would have tho't the Man very weak in his Intelectuals, who ſhould have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with Blaſphemy, for making myſelf equal with God.</hi>
               </q> And indeed <hi>this Expreſſion,</hi> inſtead of repreſenting God as one of the <hi>Fellow-Servants,</hi> really repreſents him as the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord</hi> and Maſter of them all. And thus when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> are ſtiled <hi>God's Fellow-Labourers,</hi> the <hi>Equality</hi> ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in the Expreſſion is <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>only</hi> between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos;</hi> and not at all between the bleſſed God and either of them, which would be Blaſphemy indeed. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> are <hi>Fellow-Labourers,</hi> the Relation between them is that of <hi>Equality:</hi> But God is their great LORD, their Owner and Employer. And all this the <hi>original</hi> Words plainly ſuggeſt. The Word <hi>Theou</hi> is three Times uſed in that one Verſe, and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006158_0090_1027F98D77594408"/>is every Time what <hi>Grammarians</hi> call the <hi>genitive Caſe poſitive,</hi> and denotes God's ſovereign and abſolute Property in the Thing ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe my ſelf to have fully anſwered all Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has ſaid to prove an Inequality in the Goſpel Miniſtry, and therefore to have now a Right to conclude, that neither our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, appointed different Orders in the ſtanding Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and conſequently that the <hi>Prelacy</hi> eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is repugnant to Chriſt's Inſtitution, and renders the miniſterial Character and Offices quite a different Thing from what it was in the Days of the Apoſtles. And if there be but one Order in the Miniſtry, Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> will, I ſuppoſe, allow, that the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ordination</hi> belongs to that Order; for I have no Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that he will turn Advocate for the Power of the <hi>Laity</hi> in that Caſe. And therefore I think it wholly needleſs now to diſpute which Order has the Power of Ordination.</p>
            <p>The next Thing to be conſidered is the <hi>Oath of canonical Obedience,</hi> by which the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>England</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige themſelves to obey their Biſhops <hi>in all Things lawful and honeſt.</hi> This I repreſented as <hi>calling the Biſhop Maſter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Command of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 8, 9, 10. and argued upon it thus, <q>
                  <hi>The taking an</hi> Oath of Allegiance <hi>to a Prince, is the higheſt Acknowledgment of his Sovereignty, the moſt ſolemn Profeſſion of Subjection to him; or, in Chriſt's Language,</hi> 'tis calling him Maſter, <hi>and this, altho' no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is obliged by his Alligiance to obey his Prince in any Thing but what is</hi> lawful and honeſt. <hi>Now who can give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why taking the Oath of Allegiance to a Prince, ſhould be eſteemed calling him Maſter in a</hi> civil <hi>Senſe, and yet taking an Oath of canonical Obedience to a Biſhop not be look'd upon as calling him Maſter in an</hi> eccleſiaſtical <hi>or</hi> religious <hi>Senſe? Or who will pretend that being called Maſter in a</hi> religious Senſe, <hi>is not expreſly forbidden to Goſpel Miniſters by their great</hi> MASTER?</q> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>-don't deny your Miniſter's taking ſuch an Oath as I have mentioned; and he ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006158_0091_1027F9936DD2C238"/>diſpoſed to <hi>quarrel</hi> at the Argument than to anſwer it. He enquires, <hi>Who authorized me to be ſo dogmatical in putting my Conſtruction upon thoſe Words of our Saviour?</hi> I anſwer, the Text itſelf. He further ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 25. <q>
                  <hi>A Rebuke for his Inſolence is the propereſt Anſwer to be given him.</hi>
               </q> This Way of arguing is ſometimes admitted among <hi>Parters,</hi> who, when they can't otherwiſe anſwer their Antagoniſt, tell him, <hi>he deſerves to have his Head broke for his Impudence;</hi> but it ought never to be admitted into the Diſputes of <hi>Gentlemen</hi> or <hi>Schollars,</hi> much leſs into thoſe of <hi>Divines;</hi> and I can't but think Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> on cool Reflection, will be aſham'd of his having uſed it.</p>
            <p>He goes on to ſay, <q>
                  <hi>If there be any Power and Authority in any Order whatſoever in the Church, to which Men ought to be ſubject and pay Obedience, it can be no Fault to own that Authority, and promiſe and engage moſt ſolemnly and faithfully to be ſubject to it.</hi>
               </q> I am glad to meet with anything un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head, that has ſo much Appearance of Argument; and feel a Diſpoſition in my own Mind to treat it with Tenderneſs, on that Account. But however, I muſt ſay, that as Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> undertook the Province of replying to my <hi>Sermon,</hi> he ought to have anſwered my Arguments, which he here has not ſo much as attempted. He does not deny that taking the Oath of Allegiance to a Prince is an Acknowledgment of his Sovereignty, or <hi>calling him Maſter;</hi> he does not pretend that theſe two Caſes are not parallel, nor dare he ſay, that <hi>calling a Man Maſter</hi> in the <hi>religious</hi> Senſe, is not directly contrary to Chriſt's expreſs Inhibition to his Diſciples. 'Tis ſtrange that a Man ſhould not have a Word to ſay againſt either of theſe Things, and yet ſhould pretend to juſtify this Practice.</p>
            <p>To ſay that where any Kind of Obedience is due, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it may properly be ſecured by the Solemnity of an Oath, is (1) Nothing to the Purpoſe; for I have proved that all Miniſters of the Goſpel are, by divine Inſtitution, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; and therefore no one of them owes Obedience to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is (2) contrary to the Senſe of Mankind. There
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:006158_0092_1027F99646006080"/>are a Variety of Caſes in which one Perſon is obliged to obey the lawful Commands of another; wherein yet no Man ever tho't it proper or reaſonable to oblige himſelf by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of an Oath, For Inſtance, the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Rye</hi> has a lawful Authority in ſome Caſes, to command Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> and he is obliged by the Laws of his Country to obey him: Yet ſhould the Conſtable require him to take a ſolemn Oath to obey his lawful Commands, I fancy Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> would think, <hi>"a Rebuke for his Inſolence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt Anſwer to be given him"?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I called this Submiſſion of Preſbyters to Biſhops in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>ſervile</hi> one. And tho' I take no Pleaſure in the Uſe of <hi>harſh Epithets,</hi> I yet think it ought to be ſo ſtiled. No <hi>Servant</hi> is, or can be under a <hi>ſtronger</hi> or more ſolemn Obligation to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> than what ariſes from his <hi>having Sworn</hi> to obey him: No Obligation to Obedience can poſſibly be more <hi>extenſive</hi> than that which reaches to <hi>all</hi> Things lawful and honeſt; nor can any Servitude be more <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> than to be obliged to obey a Man and his Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>The laſt Thing to be debated under this Head, is <hi>the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Preaching by Virtue of the Biſhop's Licence,</hi> and not merely by Virtue of Chriſt's Commiſſion, which he is veſted with in Ordination. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> is more out of Temper at what I have ſaid on this Head, than at anything elſe that occurs in all my <hi>Sermon;</hi> and yet he begins his Anſwer to it by ſaying <hi>"He is too trifling to deſerve a ſerious Anſwer", p.</hi> 22. But what an <hi>odd-temper'd Gentleman</hi> is he to be put into ſuch a <hi>Rage</hi> by a <hi>Trifle?</hi> But however, if I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>a ſerious Anſwer,</hi> it ſeems he tho't I deſerved <hi>an angry one.</hi> He charges me, in the ſame Page, with <hi>"Trifling and Falſhood"</hi> with <hi>"ſuch glaring Falſhood and Prevarication"</hi> as "<hi>muſt expoſe</hi> me <hi>to Shame and Reproach",</hi> he ſays I have <hi>"moſt wickedly falſified"</hi> the Canons of the Church; that I write <hi>"after another as wicked and falſe as my ſelf",</hi> and as if he had not yet ſaid enough to reproach me, or ſufficiently vented his own Ill-nature, he adds, <hi>"I charge him boldly with groſs Prevarication and Falſhood, done with a wickes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent".</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:006158_0093_1027F998275AC4A0"/>To all which I anſwer, A Perſon ought to be very ſure he is in the Right, and that he has ſufficient Evidence to juſtify him before he brings ſo heinous and aggravated a Charge againſt any Man; not only becauſe, if his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence fails him, his own Character muſt greatly ſuffer in the Opinion of all Mankind, but chiefly becauſe the divine Law forbids <hi>Defamation</hi> or <hi>hearing falſe Witneſs againſt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and requires ſuch a <hi>Reparation</hi> in Caſes of this Nature as is not eaſily made.</p>
            <p>I can hardly think Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> would have charged me at this Rate, if he had not <hi>ſuppoſed himſelf</hi> in the Right; and yet it is not ſo eaſy ſuppoſing a Man ſo well acquainted with the Canons as he ought to be (for he is obliged to read them publickly in the Church once every Year) ſo ignorant of the true State of this Matter. For it is evident from the Canons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſome Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</hi> and required to preach the Goſpel, and others, tho' <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> and beneficed too, are <hi>forbidden</hi> to do this. CAN. 45. <q>Every beneficed Man <hi>allowed to be a Preacher,</hi> &amp;c.—ſhall— preach one Sermon every Sunday of the Year.</q> CAN. 46. <q>Every beneficed Man, <hi>not allowed to be a Preacher,</hi> ſhall procure Sermons to be preached in his Cure once in every Month—by Preachers lawfully licenſed.</q> Here it muſt be obſerved, that a <hi>beneficed Man</hi> means what we in this Country call a <hi>ſettled Miniſter,</hi> one that has the ſolemn Charge of a particular Pariſh, and a legal Right to the Incomes of it for his Support. And of theſe benificed Men the <hi>Canon,</hi> you ſee, ſpeaks of ſome as being <hi>allowed,</hi> and of others as <hi>not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Preachers.</hi> Nay further, an <hi>unlicenſed</hi> Miniſter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <hi>fordid</hi> to preach, even in his own Pariſh, CAN. 49. <q>No Perſon whatſoever—not licenſed—for a ſufficient or convenient Preacher, ſhall take upon him to expound in <hi>his own Cure,</hi> or elſewhere, any Scripture or Matter of Doctrine, but ſhall only ſtudy to read plainly and aptly (without gloſſing or adding) the Homilies.</q> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:006158_0094_1027F99C65273B00"/>here ſpoken of has <hi>a Cure,</hi> that is, the Charge of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Pariſh, yet he is abſolutely forbid preaching to his own People, and required to confine himſelf to the Reading of the Homilies, in the doing of which he may not undertake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain anything he reads, how much ſoever it may need Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, for he muſt read them without <hi>gloſſing or adding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>having a Licence</hi> is what gives the former Sort of Miniſters a Right or <hi>legal Authority</hi> to preach the Goſpel; and the <hi>not being licenſed</hi> is the Reaſon why the latter <hi>may not preach.</hi> Thus the Matter is expreſs'd in the <hi>Canons</hi> already cited; <hi>If he be allowed to be a Preacher, he ſhall preach, and if he be not allowed to be a Preacher, he ſhall procure Sermons to be preached by ſuch as are lawfully licenſed Preachers;</hi> and <hi>if he be not licenſed for a Preacher, he ſhall not expound in his own Cure</hi> or Pariſh, but <hi>only read the Homilies,</hi> juſt as they are printed. The 50th <hi>Canon</hi> plainly puts a Miniſter's <hi>Authority</hi> to preach upon the Foot of his <hi>having a licence,</hi> 
               <q>Neither the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Church-Wardens, &amp;c. ſhall ſuffer any Man to preach —but ſuch as <hi>by ſhewing their Licence to preach</hi> ſhall appear unto them to be <hi>ſufficiently authorized thereunto.</hi>
               </q> If Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> preached properly by Virtue of their Ordination, ſhewing their <hi>Letters of Orders</hi> would be evidencing that they were ſufficiently authorized to preach; but the Canon will not admit this as Evidence hereof. And ſhould Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> be proſecuted in a ſpiritual Court for preaching, the beſt Certificate of his having been epiſcopally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained would ſignify Nothing towards juſtifying him, if he could not produce a <hi>Licence for Preaching.</hi> If there be anything further neceſſary to prove that it is <hi>the Licence,</hi> and not <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> the gives the proper <hi>legal</hi> Authority to preach as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I would refer you to CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NON 54. the Title of which is, <q>
                  <hi>The Licences of Preachers refuſing Conformity to be void;</hi>
               </q> and which concludes in theſe Terms, <q>
                  <hi>We determine and decree, that the Licence of every ſuch Preacher ſhall thereupon be utterly void and of none Effect.</hi>
               </q> And will only aſk Mr. <hi>Wetmore,</hi> Whether a
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:006158_0095_1027F99F4A7A1548"/>Preacher whoſe Licence is adjudged and declared void and of none Effect, has, this not with ſtanding, Authority to preach as a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reaſon why ſome of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not licenced to preach, is, <hi>becauſe they have not the proper Qualifications of Preachers,</hi> or Ability to preach. If the Church licences ſome Miniſters for Preachers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to preach; and refuſes a Licence to others, and requires them to confine themſelves to the bare reading of the printed Homilies; it muſt be ſuppoſed, that ſhe does this becauſe ſhe is ſenſible that ſome of her Minſters are not fit to be allowed Preaches. And the <hi>Convocation</hi> ſay plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that this was the Reaſon they acted upon, CAN. 57. <q>Whereas divers Perſons—do refuſe to have their Children baptized by <hi>a Miniſter that is no Preacher,</hi> and to receive the holy Communion at his Hands— <hi>as tho' the Virtue of thoſe Sacraments did depend on his</hi> ABILITY TO PREACH —We require and charge every ſuch Perſon—to reform, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—both the ſaid Sacraments being equally effectual, whether miniſtred by <hi>a Miniſter that is no Preacher,</hi> or by <hi>one that is a Preacher.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Canon</hi> finds no Fault with theſe Perſons for ſuppoſing theſe <hi>unpreaching Miniſters</hi> were really deſtitute of Ability to preach, but only for thinking their Want of this Ability rendred the Sacraments they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred ineffectual; and accordingly refuſing to receive them; which is in Effect allowing that theſe Miniſters <hi>really had not Ability to preach,</hi> and that <hi>on this Account</hi> they were not licenſed to it. Now from hence it follows,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That an <hi>Ability to teach</hi> or preach the Goſpel is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Ordination in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If the Church allows an <hi>upreaching Miniſtry;</hi> if ſhe deſigns Men ſhould be admitted into the Miniſtry, and allowed as Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to read Prayers and Homilies, and adminiſter Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, but not be permitted to preach, and that becauſe they have not Ability to preach; it would be
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:006158_0096_1027F9A226A829F8"/>a ſtrange Contradiction indeed, if after all, an Ability to preach were required as a neceſſary Qualification, in all that are admitted into the Miniſtry by Ordination. To what Purpoſe ſhould an <hi>Ability to teach</hi> be inſiſted upon, or enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after, in a Man that is not deſigned to the a Preacher, but only an <hi>Homily-Reader?</hi> Or rather, if none were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but ſuch as were capable of Preaching, why ſhould not all ordained Miniſters be allowed to preach without any ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Licence? Either therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiouſly contradicts herſelf, or elſe Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> miſtakes her Senſe, when he repreſents the Book of Ordination and the 34th <hi>Canon</hi> as contradicting what I had aſſerted. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> he quotes, does as he ſays, require that the Perſon to be ordained <q>
                  <hi>be able to yield an Account of his Faith in</hi> Latin, <hi>according to the Articles—and to confirm the ſame by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimonies out of the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </q> And this, rightly underſtood, does not contradict what I before ſaid from Mr. <hi>Pierce.</hi> To <hi>give an Account of their Faith according to the Articles,</hi> means no more than <hi>to repeat the Articles,</hi> with a Profeſſion of aſſenting to them. The 61ſt <hi>Canon</hi> requires Miniſters to take eſpecial Care that no Children be preſented to the Biſhop for <hi>Confirmation,</hi> 
               <q>but ſuch as can <hi>render an Account of their Faith according to the Catechiſm.</hi>
               </q> Now 'tis evident, from the <hi>Office for Confirmation,</hi> that this means no more than an <hi>Ability to repeat the Catechiſm,</hi> or anſwer the Queſtions in it. The Perſon to be ordained muſt be able to yield this Account of his Faith <hi>in Latin;</hi> that is, he muſt be able to tranſlate the Articles into that Language, which every one can do who <hi>underſtands Latin.</hi> The <hi>Canon</hi> further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that he be able to <hi>confirm the ſame, by ſufficient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of the holy Scriptures.</hi> Had this Expreſſion been uſed likewiſe of the Child to be confirmed, every Body would have underſtood it as intending the ſame Thing as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expreſs by a Child's having learnt his <hi>Proof-Catechiſm.</hi> And as the Words in the 34th <hi>Canon</hi> are capable of this Seaſe ſo they ought to be taken in it; for they are no other Way reconcilable to the other Canons. It may be proper enough
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:006158_0097_1027F9A3D5682210"/>to require that the Perſon to be ordained, tho' he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be a Preacher, ſhould be able to name ſuch Texts of Scripture as are generally tho't to prove ſuch and ſuch Articles of the Church; and this he may eaſily attain to, ſince there are Editions of the Articles with ſuch Scriptures annexed. But to require proper <hi>Skill in Divinity,</hi> or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to explain and defend the Articles of the chriſtian Faith, as neceſſary to the Ordination of a Man, who after he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained is not to be allowed, even in his own Cure, to expound any Scripture or Matter of Doctrine, but only to read the Homilies, without gloſſing or adding; would be extremely abſurd. I can't find therefore that the <hi>Canons</hi> require any thing more in Point of <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Scholarſhip,</hi> in the Perſon to be ordained, than that the <hi>underſtand Latin,</hi> which is what Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> is ſo angry with Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> for ſaying, and with me for repeating from him.</p>
            <p>It is Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s Buſineſs, and not mine, to reconcile the Forms uſed in Ordination to theſe <hi>Canons.</hi> If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another, I can't help it; and I am not, on that Account, to be charged with Falſhood; for I never ſaid they were not contradictory. I allow that the Biſhop in ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Preſbyter, uſes ſuch Expreſſions as are ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive of the Goſpel Miniſtry, the Office which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has inſtituted in his Church; and in which, I have before proved, there is but one Order. This <hi>"high Dignity",</hi> this <hi>"weighty Office and Charge"</hi> into which the Perſon is called, is the very ſame in which the Biſhop himſelf ſtands, and the Perſon thus ordained, is, by Chriſt's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, equal to him that ordained him. But now I can't t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>k it conſiſtent with his Duty to Chriſt or his Church, or with his own ſolemn Vows and Engagements, the Charge he has received, or the Account he muſt give at laſt, for the Perſon thus ordained, to ſubmit himſelf to the Biſhop, ſo far as to take an Oath of canonical Obedience to him, and a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to preach the Goſpel from him, making himſelf thus entirely dependent on him, and rather the <hi>Biſhop's Servant</hi> than <hi>Chriſt's Miniſter.</hi> 'Tis really ſurprizing to me, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:006158_0098_1027F9A7325F8DB8"/>to what a prodigious Degree the <hi>Imparity</hi> between Miniſters is carried in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Preſbyters, notwithſtanding the <hi>lofty Expreſſions</hi> uſed in ordaining them, are conſidered but as a Kind of <hi>Deputies</hi> or <hi>Journeymen</hi> to the Biſhops. In the Morning Prayer to be ſaid daily throughout the Year, you pray for the Clergy under the Name of <hi>Biſhops and Curates,</hi> and the ſame Expreſſions you uſe in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer, and ſo in the Prayer for the whole State of Chriſt's Church militant on Earth, in the Communion Office. Now if the Word <hi>Curate</hi> be taken in it's <hi>largeſt Senſe,</hi> for any one that has the <hi>Charge of Souls,</hi> the Biſhop himſelf is one. But when it is taken in it's <hi>limited Senſe,</hi> for one that diſcharges an Office for another (as it muſt be here taken, becauſe it is uſed as a <hi>Term of Diſtinction</hi>) it means much the ſame Thing in <hi>eccleſiaſticual Affairs</hi> as a <hi>Deputy</hi> does among <hi>civil Officers,</hi> or a <hi>Journeyman</hi> among <hi>Mechanicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Subjection of ſome Miniſters to others, evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me <hi>Servile</hi> in it's Nature, and directly contrary to an expreſs Command of Chriſt. And I cannot ſee how thoſe who thus degrade themſelves from the Office in which Chriſt has placed them, and incapacitate themſelves for the Services he requires of them, can expect his Bleſſing on their Labours at preſent, or to give a good Account to him at laſt, of the Powers he gave them, and they, by a ſinful Submiſſion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rendred themſelves incapable of exerciſing. This I think proves the <hi>Unlawfulneſs</hi> to forſaking our Churches and joining in that Communion; for it is (with Regard to this Country) to embrace a Communion in which the Miniſters have, or at leaſt can exerciſe but one half the Powers, Chriſt has given his Miniſters, and arrive at the Right of exerciſing that Half by ſuch a mean and ſervile Submiſſion to others as Chriſt has plainly forbid.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed this Part of the Controverſy, without being at all convinced by Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s Arguments, or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated by the Expreſſions of his angry Reſentments; and I hope, without being ruffled by his abuſive Treatment. And
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:006158_0099_1027F9AD13CA8B28"/>I leave his own Conſcience to ſay, what Reparation he ought to make, both to Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s Memory and to my Character.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The unhappy State of <hi>eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi> at Home, and the <hi>total Want</hi> of it in the epiſcopal Congregations in the Plantations, render it <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to forſake our Churches and go over to that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline is generally acknowledge to be an Inſtitution of Chriſt, and a very important one too; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the <hi>Well-being</hi> of the Church. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we</hi> have ſuch a Diſcipline as Chriſt has appointed, and the Epiſcopal Aſſemblies in this Country are deſtitute of it; you muſt allow that you have acted a <hi>ſinful</hi> Part in ſeparating from us, and joining in Communion with them. I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t ſpend Time in deſcribing the Diſcipline practiſed in our Churches, which you are not unacquainted with; nor in ſhewing the Agreableneſs of it to the Precepts and Examples of the New-Teſtament; I have done ſomething of this Kind in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has made no Objection. But ſhall give you an Account of the <hi>unhappy State</hi> of Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and then ſhew, That after all Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s Pretences, there is no ſuch Thing as Diſcipline in your Aſſemblies in this Country.</p>
            <p>I don't deſire you to take my Word with Regard to the State of Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but ſhall take the Account of it from a <hi>Clergyman</hi> of that Church, Mr. <hi>John Heldrop,</hi> Rector of <hi>Wath</hi> near <hi>Rippon</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Diſcourſe entitled, <hi>The Contempt of the Clergy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> in the Year 1739. In which is the following Account of this Matter, (<hi>p.</hi> 173, &amp;c.) <q>The preſent DEPLORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE STATE OF RELIGION AMONG US, is not to be <hi>denied</hi> or <hi>defended.</hi> The <hi>univerſal</hi> and indeed <hi>unavoidable</hi> RELAXATION <hi>of Diſcipline,</hi> and the <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ABUSE even of that SHADOW of it that remains, gives us but a <hi>melancholly Proſpect</hi> for the growing Generation. There
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:006158_0100_1027F9AFDDFC7F98"/>are ('tis true) yet to be ſeen in our <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> ſuch Words as <hi>Diſcipline, Cenſure, Admonitions, Penance, Excommunication;</hi> ſufficient Indications of a Power once claimed and exerciſed by the Governours of the Church. But alas! they ſtand there now as the melancholy Ruins of an old Fortreſs long ago demoliſh'd, uncapable of the leaſt Defence againſt the Enemies of Religion. The <hi>Rubrick</hi> to the Communion-Service directs every Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman to admoniſh and repel from the Communion Men of vicious and ſcandalous Lives, and the Church-Wardens are <hi>bound by their Oaths</hi> to preſent ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, that they may be puniſhed.

If not that, it expoſes him however to the keeneſt Reſentment of the Perſon ſo refuſed, and by Conſequence to the Vengeance of thoſe great Men who had been the Authors of his Promotion. I remember, in the latter End of Queen ANNE's Reign, ſuch a Caſe as this: The Clergyman apprehenſive of the Snare, applied himſelf to the Biſhop of the Dioceſs (with whom I was then in Company) to know how to behave on ſuch a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Occaſion. O (ſaid the Biſhop) you muſt without Doubt follow the Direction of the Canon and Rubrick. But, My Lord, (ſaid he) I know the Temper of this Man ſo well, that I am ſure he will ſue me; and if he does, he will ruin me. I cannot help that (ſaid the Biſhop) the Rubrick and Canons are your Rule. But, My Lord! (ſaid he) Will you uſe your Intereſt above to indemnify
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:006158_0101_1027F9B17517F310"/>me, in Caſe I ſhould be condemned to pay the Penalty? I cannot (ſaid he) promiſe myſelf or you any great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, if I ſhould attempt it. Why then (ſaid he) I muſt comply even AGAINST MY OATH AND CONSCIENCE. Let me rather fall into the Hands of a merciful God, than into the Hands of an unbelieving unforgiving Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Was not this an HARD CASE! And may not this be the the Caſe of <hi>every Clergyman</hi> in <hi>England!</hi> And is there no Remendy! Can there be no Medium between DAMNING and STARVING? How muſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> laugh in their Sleves, to hear the learned Writers and Preachers of our Church, talk of ſpiritual Authority, the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> which every <hi>little dirty Fellow</hi> in an Office ſhall <hi>defy</hi> you to execute? For Shame, let us be conſiſtent; either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal your CANONS or your ACTS OF PARLIAMENT.</q> Thus I have given you a Deſcription of the State of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline at this Day in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the very Words of a Clergyman of that Communion. The Deſcription is <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>Affecting;</hi> and his Reflections on it are <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>natural.</hi> And you ſee all the Clergymen of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will not agree with Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> in ſaying, that <q>
                  <hi>the Immorality, Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs of the preſent Age, can't be imputed to any</hi> Defects <hi>in the Conſtitution on the Church of</hi> England.</q> And if there be, as Mr. <hi>Hildrop</hi> ſays, <hi>"but a melancholy Proſpect for the growing Generation"</hi> in <hi>England</hi> upon this Account, how much more <hi>black and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> will the Proſpect be for our Poſterity in this Country, ſhould that Communion be generally embraced here? For,</p>
            <p>If there be but a <hi>Shadow of Diſcipline</hi> in the Church in <hi>England,</hi> there is ſtill leſs, if indeed there can be leſs, in the epiſcopal Aſſemblies in this Country. In Anſwer to what I had objected under this Head in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> tells us of a Diſcipline exerciſed in the epiſcopal Congregations in <hi>America,</hi> gives us ſome Account of the Nature of it, and attempts to reconcile it to the Conſtitution and Principles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already conſidered how <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>tyrannical</hi> the Diſcipline he pleads for is; and am now to ſhew, that you
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:006158_0102_1027F9B30F440908"/>cannot, conſiſtently with the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> exerciſe any Diſcipline at all in your Aſſemblies. The Advocates for the Church of <hi>England</hi> commonly make Ordination and Government peculiar to Biſhops; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I find the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> in his <hi>Sermon before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, p.</hi> 32. thus reckoning up the Advantages that would follow upon ſending Biſhops into <hi>America,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Had they Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops there, Perſons might be</hi> ordained <hi>without the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of a long Voyage.—The primitive and moſt uſeful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of</hi> Confirmation <hi>might be reſtored; and an</hi> order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſcipline <hi>exerciſed in the Churches.</hi>
               </q> His Lordſhip, it ſeems, thinks you as really deſtitute of an <hi>orderly Diſcipline,</hi> as you are of <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> in your Churches; and that there is no Way to remedy this, but by ſending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Biſhops. Tho' for my Part, I can't ſee that the Biſhop himſelf has, according to the Practice of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> anything to do with the Diſcipline of the Church; this is managed in the ſpiritual Court, by a <hi>Lay-Chancellor,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed indeed by the Biſhop, and acting in his Name, but not under his Direction, nor liable to be controled by him. The Preſbyters, inſtead of having any proper Power of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, are by Law obliged to receive and publiſh the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures pronounced by this <hi>Lay-Chancellor.</hi> And when the old Puritan Miniſters in the Church attempted to exerciſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline upon their ſcandalous Pariſhioners, they were ſeverely puniſhed for it, by the ſpiritual Courts. This was the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> mentioned in my <hi>Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Oppoſition to this, Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> tells of a Commiſſion to be found in the <hi>Form for ordaining</hi> Prieſts, authorizing them to exerciſe Diſcipline. And if this were Fact, the Conſequence would be, that the Church gives them Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and forbids them to exerciſe it, nay, and puniſhes them if they preſume to uſe it, in the Caſe of Diſcipline as well as in that of Preaching. And why ſhould Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> be ſo very fond of taking all Opportunities of repreſenting the Church of <hi>England</hi> as acting ſo abſurd and ridiculous a Part as this? I find <hi>Diſcipline</hi> but once mentioned in the Paſſages
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:006158_0103_1027F9B4D0533AD0"/>he has given us from the Form of Ordination; and then the Exerciſe of it is reſtrained by theſe Words, <hi>"as this Church and Realm hath received the ſame":</hi> Now for a Prieſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, as the Church and Realm of <hi>England</hi> has received-it, as to publiſh and execute the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or the ſpiritual Court; or at moſt, it can mean no more than that he ſuſpend a ſcandalous Perſon for <hi>fourteen Days,</hi> and certify the Cauſe into the ſpiritual Court within that Term; for neither the Canons nor Rubricks allow him to proceed farther than this.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſays that the Prieſt in this Country can't be obliged to notify the Ordinary in fourteen Days, becauſe it is impracticable, <hi>p.</hi> 28. And thus far he is undoubtedly in the Right, for no Man is obliged to Impoſſibilities. But he is greatly miſtaken if he thinks he may therefore ſuſpend for a <hi>longer Term,</hi> or ſuſpend and <hi>not notify</hi> the Ordinary; nay, or that he may refuſe to admit a Perſon to the Communion when the Caſe is ſuch that he cannot certify the Ordinary within that Term. The Rubrick to the Communion Office, after giving the Miniſter Authority to refuſe the Sacrament to Perſons in the Caſes there named, adds theſe Words, <q>
                  <hi>Provided that every Miniſter ſo repelling any—ſhall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give an Account of the ſame to the Ordinary, within fourteen Days after at the fartheſt. And the Ordinary ſhall proceed againſt the offending Party according to the Canons.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Rubrick</hi> does not deſign the Miniſter ſhall inflict any <hi>proper Cenſure</hi> upon the Perſon; <hi>this</hi> is reſerved to the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> and in Order to it, the Man muſt have a <hi>legal Tryal;</hi> the Judge muſt proceed againſt him <hi>according to the Canon.</hi> The Miniſter is only to <hi>prepare the Way</hi> to this, by ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Perſon, and informing the Ordinary. And that the Prieſt may not abuſe this Power to the Oppreſſion of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſhall always be obliged to inform the Ordinary in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days <hi>at fartheſt.</hi> But now an <hi>unlimited Suſpenſion</hi> is a <hi>proper Cenſure,</hi> and differs very littie, or rather nothing at all, from the <hi>leſſer Excommunication;</hi> which is not to be inflicted without a legal Trial, nor by any Perſon but the Judge in
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:006158_0104_1027F9BA54A64140"/>the ſpiritual Court. Now how abſurd is it for Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> to argue, that becauſe <q>
                  <hi>the limited Time</hi> is <hi>impracticable to to be complied with, and the Deſign of referring the Cauſe to the Hearing of the Judges appointed not taking Place,—ſuch Affairs are left with the Miniſter to determine according to his beſt Prudence,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 28. when the Rubrick gives him <hi>no Authority</hi> to <hi>try</hi> or <hi>cenſure</hi> the Perſon? This is juſt as if a Man ſhould argue, that becauſe a <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> may impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a Murderer in order to his having a legal Trial, therefore he may himſelf try and execute him.</p>
            <p>And beſides, is Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> really ſo ignorant of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Deſign of PROVISOS, annexed to Laws, as not to know that if the Law cannot be executed and the <hi>Proviſo</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it can't be executed at all? If a Law were made for inflicting a certain Penalty for Drunkenneſs, provided the Perſon were convicted within <hi>three Days</hi> after the Crime was committed; Would Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſay that a <hi>Juſtice</hi> might inflict the Penalty on a Man who was not bro't before him 'till the <hi>fourth Day,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Proviſo</hi> was impracticable; for the Man kept concealed 'till the <hi>three Days</hi> were elapſed? If ſo, Why mayn't he go one Step further, and if a Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſell him a Farm, <hi>provided</hi> ſuch a Gentleman would be bound with him for the Payment of the Price agreed on, inſiſt on it that the Man was obliged by the Bargain to let him have the Farm and take his own Bond for the Money; becauſe the <hi>Proviſo</hi> was become impracticable by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's utterly refuſing to become his Surety.</p>
            <p>In a Word, The <hi>Ordination-Office</hi> limit the Prieſt to exerciſe the Diſcipline of Chriſt <hi>"as this Church and Realm hath received the ſame",</hi> the <hi>Rubricks</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> are the Laws of the Church, according to which the Clergy are ſworn to yield Obedience. Now theſe give the Miniſter no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>try and cenſure</hi> Perſon; nor do they authoriſe him to <hi>ſuſpend in order to Trial,</hi> unleſs he inform the proper
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:006158_0105_1027F9BBDD7EC800"/>Judge within fourteen Days, that the Perſon may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this State of Suſpenſion, but be ſpeedily acquitted or condemned. The Scheme of Diſcipline therefore which Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> propoſes, as it is inconſiſtent with the <hi>religious Liberties</hi> of Mankind, and contrary to the Goſpel, ſo it is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Conſtitution and Laws of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and conſequently if any of your Miniſters act in this arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Manner, you are under no Obligation as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>as Churchmen</hi> to ſubmit to their Cenſures. And on the Whole, there is not, according to the Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo much as <hi>the Shadow</hi> of eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline in the epiſcopal Churches in <hi>America.</hi> And this renders in <hi>unlawful</hi> to forſake our Churches and go over to that Communion, in which 'tis impracticable to exerciſe that Diſcipline which Chriſt has inſtituted in his Church, and which is ſo eſſentially neceſſary to the Well-being of it. But I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">III. For particular Members of the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Churches to ſeparate from them, and join in Communion with the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Congregations, is properly <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every particular Church is a Society formed for promoting the Redeemer's Glory in the Salvation of Sinners, in ſuch Methods and by ſuch Means as he has appointed for that End. All the Members of ſuch a Society are under very ſacred Obligations to endeavour, according to their ſeveral Places and Capacitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, to promote this End; and that <hi>in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> with one another. The Church, conſidered as a Body, has a Right to the Service of every Member, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Deſigns for which it was formed, by the Means Chriſt has inſtituted. I limit the Church's Authority, and conſequently the particular Members Obligation to the <hi>End</hi> Chriſt has appointed and the <hi>Means</hi> he has preſcribed for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it; becauſe I believe him to be the only <hi>Law giver</hi> in the Goſpel Church; and therefore can't acknowledge any
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:006158_0106_1027F9BDAE0E38E0"/>Man or Body of Men, as veſted with a <hi>legiſlative</hi> Authority in the Church, or having a Right to enact <hi>new Ends</hi> of Church Communion, or preſcribe <hi>new Means</hi> for obtaining the End Chriſt has appointed.</p>
            <p>The Body of a Man is perfect when it has all it's Parts in their due Proportion &amp; Activity, and every Organ or Member diſcharge it's proper Function for the Good of the Whole: But when any particular Members ſeparate themſelves from the Reſt, and refuſe to act agreably to their ſeveral Places in the Body and their mutual Relation to one another; as (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) <hi>If the Foot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the Head, I am not of the Body,</hi> and ſhall thereupon refuſe to act as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Body; or if <hi>the Head</hi> ſhall <hi>ſay to the Feet, I have no need of you,</hi> and ſhall reject and caſt them off as not being Members of the Body, in either of theſe Caſes, the Unity of the Body is diſſolved. The Apoſtle uſes this very Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to illuſtrate this Caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 12,—27. And this Diviſion of the Members of the ſame Body, he expreſly calls a SCHISM, <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. On this Authority many learned Men, and among others, the celebrated Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> define Schiſm by <hi>an unneceſſary Separation from that Part of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of which we once were Members</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide <hi>White</hi>'s Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> Others make Schiſm to be an <hi>uncharitable Separation.</hi> This ſeems like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be ſuggeſted by the Apoſtle, when he mentions the <hi>Eye's ſaying to the Hand, I have no need of thee;</hi> and the <hi>Head to the Feet, I have no need of you, Ver.</hi> 21. which Words as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Members of Chriſt's myſtical Body, are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of an haughty, contemptuous and uncharitable Conduct of one towards another. This then ſeems a plain and firſt Account of the Matter. Every Diviſion or Separation in the Church is <hi>material Schiſm;</hi> that is, it is a Diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niting of thoſe Members which once have been, and ſtill ought to be, united in the ſame Body. And a Separation which is <hi>unneceſſary,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:006158_0107_1027F9C4B99F82B8"/>and attended with <hi>uncharitable</hi> Expreſſions and Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe Men divide from, is <hi>formal Schiſm;</hi> and by this Men contract, what Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> and I agree to call, the <hi>awful Guilt of Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not aware of anything in this Deſcription of Schiſm Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> will be likely to except againſt, unleſs it be my following Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> in making it conſiſt in <hi>forſaking</hi> a Church, which ſuppoſes a Perſon's having been <hi>actually</hi> in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with it. This Mr. <hi>White</hi> faults in it, and will have it that it is Schiſm to live in a State of Separation from that Church which a Man ought to be in Communion with, tho' he never actually was ſo. And tho' I apprehend Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s Difinition may be juſtified from the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe on this Head; yet ſince a good Cauſe allows of a generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and mine in particular will bear the largeſt Conceſſions that can reaſonably be deſired, I will not conteſt this Point; but allow that it is the ſame Thing in this Caſe, whether a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were actually a Member of a Church and ſeparated from it, or under evident Obligations to become a Member of it, and obſtinately refuſed the Communion of it.</p>
            <p>There is hardly anything more contrary to the Nature of true Religion, or more deſtructive to the viſible Kingdom of the Redeemer, than a <hi>ſchiſmatical</hi> Temper, or a Diſpoſition uncharitably to cenſure and unneceſſarily to ſeparate from thoſe with whom we ought to maintain Love and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. By this, whenever it prevails, the ſeamleſs Coat of Chriſt is rent in Pieces; nay his Body is diſ-jointed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; the viſible Church, which ought to appear and behave like the Spouſe of the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> is rendred a meer Scene of Diſorder and Confuſion; and profeſſed Chriſtians, inſtead of wearing the Livery of Chriſt, which conſiſts of Love and Meekneſs, Humility and Peaceableneſs, are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with Hatred and Revenge, Pride and Malice, the very Temper of the infernal Spirits. By theſe Means the holy
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:006158_0108_1027F9C784CC60D8"/>and dove-like Spirit is grieved, and ſo withdraws his ſpecial Influences from Goſpel Adminiſtrations; the awful Event of which is, that the Means of Grace prove <hi>a Savour of Death unto Death,</hi> inſtead of being, as they were originally deſigned, the <hi>Savour of Life unto Life.</hi> The <hi>Guilt</hi> contracted by Schiſm is great in Proportion to the evil and deſtructive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which flow from it. Mr <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſays, <q>
                  <hi>If it be every Man's indiſpenſible Duty to be a Chriſtian, the ſame Duty will oblige him to be and continue a Member of the Church which is his Body, to preſerve and maintain the Peace, Order and Unity of the Body, and eſpecially of that Part to which he particularly belongs.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 37. And I hope this <hi>"will be attended to more ſeriouſly as coming from him".</hi> Nay he profeſſes ſuch a Dread of this Guilt, that if he could think it contracted by Perſons forſaking our Churches and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the epiſcopal Communion in this Country, he would perſwade all againſt doing it. <hi>p.</hi> 28. I am glad he has this Tenderneſs of Conſcience in the Caſe, and as I make no Doubt of proving this Guilt upon you, great and awful as it is, ſhall rejoice in his joining with me in endeavouring your Recovery out of ſo dangerous an Eſtate. And as a Means of this, ſhould be glad he would go on with the Deſign he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the Cloſe of his <hi>Defence</hi> of Dr. <hi>Waterland,</hi> of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a Tranſlation of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Church Unity.</p>
            <p>That your Conduct in ſeparating from us diſturbs the Peace of the Churches you thus forſake, Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> owns, <hi>p.</hi> 29. <q>
                  <hi>I will allow that Diviſions may be in fact made, in ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities which Men leave, when they go into the Communion of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in</hi> Connecticut. <hi>Theſe Societies which they call Churches, may be rent and divided by the withdrawing of ſome of their Members.</hi>
               </q> Another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion he makes in theſe Words, <hi>p.</hi> 28. <q>
                  <hi>I will allow that making Diviſions in, and Separations from regular Chriſtian Societies, with which we are obliged to join in Chriſtian Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:006158_0109_1027F9C90D857CA0"/>and Communion, is Schiſm, and very criminal in the Sight of God, and never to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> juſtified or excuſed before Man.</hi>
               </q> Theſe two Conceſſions are ſufficient to fix this Guilt upon you; and I hope will be effectual for convincing your Conſciences of it. For here you ſee your own Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate allows, that you were once in Communion with us, and have now withdraw from us, and that in ſuch a Manner as in Fact to make Rents and Diviſions in the Societies you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from; and that to do this in regular Chriſtian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties —is Schiſm. Theſe Conceſſions of his leave you no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Way to prevent this Guilt's falling with all it's dreadful Weight upon your Heads; unleſs you will directly aſſert that the Societies you ſeparated from were not <hi>true</hi> Churches of Chriſt. And I am perſwaded that many of you, <hi>my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> are not ſo far gone in a Party Spirit, and ſo eaten up with Bigottry as abſolutely to unchurch us and almoſt the whole Proteſtant World, and declare all our Adminiſtrations null and invalid. Surely you will not be fond of making ſuch a Declaration as this, when you remember that the Baptiſm by which you believe you were, <q>
                  <hi>made Members of Chriſt, Children of God, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>
               </q> was received in our Churches; for if our's are not Chriſtian Churches, your's was not Chriſtian Baptiſm; and conſequently, notwithſtanding your having conformed to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you are not Members of the Church of Chriſt. But if, notwithſtanding the Conſequences of it on your own viſible Chriſtianity, any of you are determined, at all Adventures, to deny our being true Churches of Chriſt, I hope, at leaſt, you will not for the future pretend, that your Separation from us has been attended with no Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wetmors</hi> ſays, <q>
                  <hi>It will lay upon Mr.</hi> Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rt <hi>to prove their Societies to be regularly conſtituted Churches of Chriſt, before the Guilt of rending the Body of Chriſt can be fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Separators from them. This will prove a very hard Taſk,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:006158_0110_1027F9CAAEDF8AD0"/>he muſt go through it, before his Charge of Schiſm will lay againſt</hi> ANY SORT OF SEPARATORS FROM THEM.</q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 29. By <hi>"any Sort of Separators",</hi> I conclude he means <hi>you,</hi> and ſuch as have run into what is commonly called the <hi>New-Light</hi> Separation in the Country. You may thank him (if you think he deſerves your Thanks) for appearing in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>New Light</hi> Separatiſts, and ſetting your Cauſe and their's on a Level. His doing ſo gave me the Hint of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>you</hi> and <hi>them</hi> as ſtanding on the ſame Foot; and I had Thoughts of drawing at large <hi>a Parallel between the New-Light and Epiſcopal Separatiſts,</hi> in Regard to the <hi>Principles</hi> they act upon, the <hi>End</hi> they have in view, the <hi>Means</hi> they make Uſe of, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> they are actuated by. A Thing of this Nature, I apprehend, would have a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to open the Eyes of many deluded People on both Sides; but I have not Room for it at preſent. If Mr. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> would have you and the <hi>other Separators</hi> think that you need not fear having the Guilt of Schiſm charged upon you, until I prove our Churches regularly conſtituted; he impoſes upon you, and you are in Danger of being led into a fatal Miſtake. There are many Things by which you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract great Guilt, and for which you may be condemned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which I have never proved to be ſinful; and if I am as unable to prove the Sinfulneſs of them, as Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes I am to prove the Regularity of our eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, my Weakneſs does not alter the Nature of Things, nor will it excuſe you from Guilt and Condemnation. But if he means no more, by the Paſſage laſt quoted, than that <hi>I</hi> can't properly bring ſuch a Charge againſt you 'till I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this; he diſcovers a Want of Acquaintance with the Laws of Argumentation. For it is allowed in all Diſputes, that when a Perſon is charged with any Crime, if he confeſſes the Fact, and pleads anything ſpecial in Juſtification of it, <hi>it</hi> lies upon him to prove the ſpecial Matter thus pleaded. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> therefore, when he had aſſumed the Province of vindicating your Conduct, and pleaded in your Behalf, that
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:006158_0111_1027F9CE2A3D27F8"/>the Societies you forſook, were ſuch as you had a Right to forſake, or ſuch, the ſeparating from which, was not Schiſm; ought to have looked on himſelf obliged to make this Plea good, and 'till he does this, the Charge of Schiſm lies well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you. But he is ſo far from doing this, that he dare not directly and openly aſſert the Fact, that our Churches are ſuch as a Man may ſeparate from without Danger of incurring this Guilt. He ſeems to have a good Mind to ſay ſo, but ſtill his Courage fails him; and he finally contents himſelf with giving numerous <hi>Hints</hi> and <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> of this Kind. Thus in the Paſſage under Conſideration, he thinks it <hi>"will prove a hard Taſk"</hi> for me to prove the contrary, and in the ſame Page, ſpeaking of our Churches, he ſays, <hi>"Theſe Societies, which they call Churches",</hi> intimating that they are not really ſuch; and again, <q>

            <p>There is one Paſſage more in Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi>'s Piece, which may properly be conſidered under this Head. <hi>p.</hi> 40. <q>
                  <hi>If Impoſition of commiſſionated Hands is neceſſary, this alone will be ſufficient to ſhow the utmoſt Irregularity and Confuſion in the</hi> Connecticut <hi>Conſtitution, which having allowed</hi> Lay-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, <hi>in the Inſtance of Meſſieurs</hi> Eliot <hi>at</hi> Guilford, Buckingham <hi>at</hi> Seabrook, Chauncy <hi>at</hi> Stratford, <hi>and how many more I know not; from whom the preſent Sett of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters derive their Ordination, at leaſt many of them.</hi>
               </q> This is what many of you lay great Streſs upon; and when, all other Arguments fail, you have Recourſe to it, as what you ſuppoſe fully juſtifies your Separation from us, I ſhall therefore conſider it fully, and obſerve.</p>

1. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has not repreſented the Fact, in theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, exactly as it was. It is difficult gaining a certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning Facts of ſo ancient a Date, and of which, ſo far as I can learn, there are no Records remaining. The beſt Account I have been able to get, is, Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> was ordained by Mr. <hi>Whiting</hi> of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Elder of the Church of <hi>Guilford</hi> laying on Hands in Conjunction with theſe Miniſters. This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have from a Gentleman of Note in <hi>Guilford,</hi> who ſays it was what he had often heard from the moſt aged Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he has converſed with there; and as he is a Man in Years, he muſt have been converſant with ſuch as well remembred the Fact. In Confirmation of this, I am aſſured by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter now living, that Major <hi>Fitch</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who has been dead many Years, aſſured him, he was himſelf preſent at Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi>'s Ordination, and ſaw it performed by a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Miniſters, and one of the Members of that Church. Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Milford</hi> has often told a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, that Mr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s Ordination was performed by Miniſters and the Elder of the Church of <hi>Stratford.</hi> I have converſed with an aged Man at <hi>Stratford,</hi> who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Mr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s Ordination, but cannot, at this Diſtance of Time, recollect who the Perſons were that laid on Hands. He tells me, that he well remembers Mr. <hi>Blackman</hi>'s being living, and his baptizing a Child when Mr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> preach'd at <hi>Stratford,</hi> and he thinks Mr. <hi>Blackman</hi> lived ſome Time after Mr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s Ordination. This Circumſtance ſtrongly argues againſt a Lay-Ordination, for the Clauſe in the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge Platform</hi> which ſpeaks moſt favourably of the Power of the Laity in this Caſe, allows it only <q>
                  <hi>in ſuch Churches where there are no Elders.</hi>
               </q> I confeſs I am not ſo certain that any Miniſter actually laid Hands on Mr. <hi>Buckingham</hi> at his Ordination. I am informed, from thoſe that have had Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of converſing with ſuch as remembred the Fact, that there was an <hi>Ordination Council</hi> called. They have been told by the aged People at <hi>Saybrook,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:006158_0113_1027F9D508DF3D80"/>
               <hi>Fitch</hi> were two of the Miniſters that compoſed the Council. I am farther informed by one of the moſt aged Miniſters in the Country, that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> of <hi>Windſor</hi> was likewiſe a Member of the Council, and informed him, that there was a Motion made in the Council to act upon the Clauſe in the <hi>Platform</hi> above referred to; but he does not remember whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> told him the Motion was complied with or rejected, he rather thinks it was rejected. Upon the Whole, the worſt that can be ſuppoſed in the Caſe, is that ſome of the Brethren of <hi>Saybrook</hi> Church did, under the Inſpection and by the Order of an eccleſiaſtical Council, lay Hands on Mr. <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and that thereupon the Miniſters preſent gave him the <hi>Right Hand of Fellowſhip,</hi> acknowledging him as a lawfully authorized Miniſter of the Goſpel, Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Facts to be thus, tho' I believe each of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to have been, in ſome Degree, irregular; yet I can't think the moſt exceptionable of them to be abſolutely invalid. I can hardly ſuppoſe that Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> thinks <hi>Impoſition of commiſſionated Hands</hi> ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary in the Caſe, that a Biſhop who, by Diſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> or Accident, was entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Uſe of his Hands, muſt neceſſarily looſe the Power of ordaining. Nobody, I ſuppoſe, looks upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Authority as ſuch a <hi>phyſical Quality</hi> as is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable only by <hi>Contact.</hi> The Impoſition of Hands in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and of <hi>"commiſſionated Hands",</hi> as it is authorized by the Inſtances recorded in the New-Teſtament, I believe ought to be retained in the Church of Chriſt; nor would I my ſelf be ordained without it: But if any Perſon who has Authority to ordain be incapable of performing it, or thinks it not neceſſary and therefore omits it; or if he thinks it may be performed by <hi>Delegation,</hi> and ſo orders others to do it in his Preſence, I dare not ſay that his Incapacity or his Miſtake nullifies the Action, or renders the Ordination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Inſtances, ſuppoſing them to be as bad as Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> would have them, can in no Meaſure juſtify you in
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:006158_0114_1027F9D6932156C0"/>ſeparating from us. I will, for once, ſuppoſe that each of theſe was a <hi>merely Lay-Ordination;</hi> and that the Perſons thus ordained had no Sort of miniſterial Authority, no more Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to preach the Goſpel or adminiſter the Sacraments than any other <hi>Layman</hi> whomſoever. This is all you can deſire in the Caſe, and this, for Argument ſake, I will ſuppoſe. Now what will this do towards juſtifying your Separation? Theſe Gentlemen were dead before moſt of you wer born; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe long before any one of you forſook our Communion. It was not the Miniſtry of theſe Gentlemen that you forſook, but of others, who were ordained by Impoſition of the Hands of Miniſters. Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> does indeed pretend that our preſent Miniſters, at leaſt many of them, derive their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from thoſe Gentlemen, but of this he produces not the leaſt Shadow of Evidence; nor is there any Probability that ſo much as one Miniſter in the Country derives his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from theſe Gentlemen <hi>only.</hi> You all know that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations with us are performed by a conſiderable Number of Miniſters. There is no Probability that theſe three Men ever joined in the Ordination of the ſame Perſon; tho' they might, and no Doubt did, each of them join with other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in Ordinations. In a Word, make this Caſe as bad as you will, the Argument drawn from it can't excuſe any particular Perſon among you from the Guilt of Schiſm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, before he ſeparated from us, he had <hi>full and convincing Proof,</hi> that the Miniſter he was about to forſake, derived his Ordination <hi>wholly and only</hi> from theſe Men; and this, I am confident, there is not a ſingle Man among you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. So far were you from this, that I dare confidently appeal to your own Conſciences, whether you did not act upon <hi>other Reaſons</hi> in forſaking us; and when you found thoſe other Reaſons were not ſufficient to juſtify you, trump up this Pretence to excuſe your continuing in a Separation, which you could not defend on the Principles you acted upon in making the Separation. It was thus with a Number that ſeparated from the Church of Chriſt in <hi>Norwalk,</hi> they
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:006158_0115_1027F9D9DB05EC48"/>pretended to be greatly grieved and offended at Mr. <hi>Dickin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s reading the Scriptures in publick Worſhip; this they call'd <hi>Popery,</hi> and for this they exhibited their Complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and when they could not have him cenſured for this Crime, they ſeparated from him, and declared themſelves of the <hi>Epiſcopal Communion.</hi> The Mem who acted upon this Principle were careſſed by the Party they turn'd to, and the <hi>Society</hi> had pompous Accounts ſent them of the Growth of the Church. Theſe Perſons evidently diſcovered their Want of Sincerity. The publick Reading of the Scriptures did not offend their Conſciences, for they could immediately join the epiſcopal Aſſemblies, in which this is always practiſed. And when theſe Perſons come to be ſenſible that the Reaſons they profeſſed to act upon will not juſtify them, they have Recourſe to this, That Somebody has told them, that he has heard, that there were, almoſt an hundred Years ago, two or three <hi>diſputable</hi> Ordinations in this Country. When in Truth, if theſe Men could have had their Wills, by procuring a Cenſure againſt their Miniſter for reading the <hi>Bible,</hi> they would no more have been influenced in their Conduct by thoſe old Stories of <hi>Lay-Ordinations,</hi> than they would have been by the Diſputes between the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi> as indeed they were really no more concerned with the one than the other. So dreadfully do Men prevaricate with that God <hi>who cannot be deceived, and will not be mocked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. This can't poſſibly excuſe your forſaking us, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe <hi>the Succeſſion of the Miniſtry in that Church is full as diſputable as you can pretend to make it with us.</hi> There would be ſome Conſiſtency in your Pretence of forſaking us for want of a <hi>regular Succeſſion in the Miniſtry,</hi> if you could have found and had embraced a Communion in which the Succeſſion was <hi>clear and undiſputed.</hi> But you muſt give me Leave to queſtion your Acquaintance with <hi>eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> if you ſuppoſe there is ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:006158_0116_1027F9DDE389ABE8"/>on Earth. I am ſure the Succeſſion in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>very much diſputed.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay it was broken at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the <hi>Nonjurors,</hi> that it was ſo at the <hi>Revolution.</hi> And 'tis paſt all Doubt with me, that, on the Principles you generally embrace, 'tis impoſſible to give a fair Anſwer to either of them. You have been taught, and in your Diſputes with us on this Head you profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That it is <hi>eſſential to a lawful Miniſter</hi> of Chriſt, that he derive his Commiſſion in an <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion</hi> from the Apoſtles; that is, that every Man in the direct Line of Succeſſion between any preſent Miniſter and ſome one of the Apoſtles, was regularly and lawfully ordained. And it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of your Principles, That when the miniſterial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is thus regularly given, it cannot be taken away by any other Authority than that which gave it.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Principles it will be not only <hi>"a very hard Taſk",</hi> but abſolutely impoſſible to juſtify the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformers had very different Notions of theſe Things, and acted in a Manner not to be juſtified on theſe Principles. And indeed, however fond a Sett of hot Men, who have been diſtinguiſh'd by the Name of <hi>High-Flyers,</hi> and who have always been ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of having a ſtrong Inclination to return to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, may have been of theſe Notions; yet the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a Body, has on many Occaſions acted in Defiance of them; ſo often that there is no ſuch Thing as juſtifying the preſent Miniſtry in that Church, without giving up theſe Principles.</p>
            <p>If we look back to the glorious and happy REVOLUTION, which ſecured you and us in the Enjoyment of all our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties civil and ſacred, we find Dr. <hi>Sancroft,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>England;</hi> Dr. <hi>Kenn,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells;</hi> Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely;</hi> Dr. <hi>Frampton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> Dr. <hi>White,</hi> Biſhop of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:006158_0117_1027F9E0B5CFC1C0"/>
               <hi>Peterborough;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Loyd,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> all depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in one Day, by Virtue of AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT. Their <hi>Deprivation</hi> bears Date <hi>February</hi> 1. 1690<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Salmons</hi> Chronlogy.</note>. Theſe Biſhops were not turned out for Hereſy, or any other <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Crime;</hi> but for refuſing to take the Oaths to King WILLIAM and Queen MARY. And their Places in the Church were ſoon ſupplied with others, as though they had been dead. Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> being made Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, May</hi> 31. and ſoon after, Dr. <hi>Kidder</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fowler</hi> or <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cumberland</hi> of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> of <hi>Norwich.</hi> This occaſioned a Diviſion in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which continues to this Day, and is likely to remain; for tho' the deprived Biſhops are all dead, yet they and their Adherents took Care to perpetuate the Schiſm they had made, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing a Succeſſion of Biſhops in this Line. The <hi>Nonjurors,</hi> or thoſe who adhere to the Succeſſion in the Line of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Biſhops,</hi> look upon the <hi>Revolution Church,</hi> as they call you, as being in a State of Schiſm for joining in Communion with, and ſubmitting to the preſent Sett of Biſhops, whom they eſteem as Uſurpers; becauſe they took the Places of ſuch Biſhops as they ſuppoſe were unlawfully deprived; or rather not deprived at all, for they will by no Means allow that an Act of Parliament can deprive a Biſhop, who is a ſpiritual Officer. This Argument has been warmly urged againſt you by the <hi>Nonjurors;</hi> and tho' I make no Doubt the Schiſm lies wholly on their Side, yet I muſt ſay, that I ſee no Poſſibility of anſwering their Arguments, without giving up the Principles you eſpouſe when you are diſputing with us. And ſhould God, for the Sins of the Nation, ever ſuffer the <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion</hi> to be ſet aſide, you are to expect that the Succeſſors of the deprived Biſhops, would be declared the <hi>true Paſtors</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> you, and the Biſhops
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006158_0118_1027F9E37976DC78"/>you ſubmit to, would be look'd upon as Schiſmatick, and your Ordinations declared invalid; ſo that your Clergy wou'd have a Chance for taking another Voyage for Orders.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Nonjurors</hi> themſelves would get little by ſuch a Change; for it is but going one Step farther, and we ſhall find that they and you both are cut off from this Line of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion you are both ſo unreaſonably fond of. 'Tis a Fact known to all who are acquainted with the Hiſtory of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Reformation, that when Queen ELIZABETH came to the Crown, the Biſhops of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church were, to a Man, bigotted <hi>Papiſts.</hi> There was not a ſingle Man of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Reformation, and only <hi>Kitchin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> that would ſubmit to it, when it was eſtabliſhed by the Queen and Parliament. All the other Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived or turned out of their Offices by Act of Parliament, for refuſing the <hi>Oath of Supremacy.</hi> This was the Caſe of <hi>Heath</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York, Bonner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London, Tonſtal</hi> of <hi>Durham, Thurſby</hi> of <hi>Ely, Bourn</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topherſon</hi> of <hi>Chicheſter, White</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter, Watſon</hi> of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln, Bayne</hi> of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield, Oglethorp</hi> of <hi>Carliſle, Turnbervile</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and <hi>Poole</hi> of <hi>Peterborough;</hi> all the other Biſhopricks being at that Time vacant, except <hi>Landoff,</hi> the Biſhop of which complied and kept his Office<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle <hi>p.</hi> 331.</note>. So great was the Change now made, that, as Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> tells us, from Mr. <hi>Strype, Parker,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s firſt Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was conſecrated <hi>December</hi> 17, and by the 19th of <hi>April</hi> twenty two Biſhops more were conſecrated<note n="‡" place="bottom">New-England <hi>Chron.</hi> p. <hi>220.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that, at the Revolution, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with five other Biſhops, and at the Reformation the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> with all the Biſhops of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:006158_0119_1027F9E63A9B8A40"/>Church, one only excepted, were turned out of their Offices by Act of Parliament. Theſe are ſo many Inſtances of <hi>Lay-Deprivation,</hi> which is as directly contrary to your darling Principles, and as inconſiſtent with the Notion of an <hi>uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> Line of Succeſſion as <hi>Lay-Ordination;</hi> for <hi>Laymewn</hi> have as much Authority to <hi>make Biſhops</hi> as to <hi>unmake</hi> them. That the <hi>Line of Succeſſion</hi> was broken, in theſe Inſtances, is very clear; for it Dr. <hi>Sancroft</hi> continued Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> notwithſtanding his being deprived by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which all who deny the Validity of <hi>Lay-Deprivations</hi> muſt ſay; all the Conſecrations in the World could not make Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> lawful Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> while <hi>Sancroft</hi> lived. So that if the <hi>Conſecrations,</hi> in theſe Inſtances, were ever ſo <hi>canonical</hi> and undiſputed, yet the Succeſſion would be broken by theſe Biſhops being put in the Places of ſuch as were deprived by thoſe who according to your Principles, had not Authority to deprive them.</p>
            <p>But further, it is a leaſt very queſtionable, whether the the Biſhops who ſucceeded thoſe deprived at the Reformation were regularly ordained. The famous Story of the <hi>Nag's-Head Conſecration</hi> is a full Match for what you ſo often tell us of the <hi>Leather-Mitten Ordination;</hi> with this Advantage on our Side, that there is no Probability that any one of our Miniſters derives his Ordination from Mr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> of <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> but it is certain that all your's derive from Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But to take the moſt favourable Account of this Matter, Archbiſhop <hi>Parker,</hi> who conſecrated all the Reſt of the Proteſtant Biſhops, was himſelf conſecrated by <hi>Barlow, Scory, Coverdale</hi> and <hi>Hodgkins,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> tells us from the Life of <hi>Parker</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the <hi>Puritans</hi> Vol. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 142.</note> Theſe Men had been Biſhops in the Reign of EDWARD VI, but were legally deprived in Queen MARY'S Reign, and had never been reſtored; and it is, at
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:006158_0120_1027F9E91CBF0628"/>beſt, very doubtful whether they had Authority to act as Biſhops while they lay under a Sentence of Deprivation. The Reformers ſeem to have been ſenſible of ſome Imperfection in this Matter, and endeavoured to have prevented or cured the Lameneſs of it. For, in the firſt Place, a Bill was brought into Parliament for reſtoring theſe deprived Biſhops, but it did not paſs<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Abridg. Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 330.</note>. Then the Warrant for <hi>Parker</hi>'s Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was directed to <hi>Tonſtal, Bourn, Pool</hi> and <hi>Kitchen</hi> four of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Biſhops, together with <hi>Barlow</hi> and <hi>Scory,</hi> two of the deprived Biſhops, but the old Biſhops refuſed to act, whereupon a ſecond Warrant was granted<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 337.</note> and executed by the deprived Biſhops before named. And after all an Act of Parliament was procured to confirm <hi>Parker</hi>'s Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about ſeven Years after it was performed<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Neal</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 142.</note>. Thus the Conſecration of the firſt Proteſtant Biſhop in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Reign, on which all the Ordinations in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to this Day depend, appears to have been a very doubtful and diſputable Thing; ſuch an one indeed as can never be juſtified upon your Principles. You have therefore no Choice left you, but either to acknowledge that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples you have lately been taught are wrong, or elſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Reformation, and the preſent Miniſtry in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are utterly unjuſtifiable.</p>
            <p>I would further, obſerve here, That in the Beginning of the Reformation, Biſhops took Commiſſions from the King, the Form of them, as Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> aſſures us, was this, <q>
                  <hi>That the King appointed ſuch an one to be Biſhop during his natural Life, or ſo long as he behaved well: And gave</hi> HIM POWER TO ORDAIN <hi>or deprive Miniſters, to exerciſe ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction—And this they were to do</hi> IN THE KING'S NAME, AND BY HIS AUTHORITY<note n="‖" place="bottom">Abridg. Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 178.</note>.</q> And
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:006158_0121_1027F9EAB4652D70"/>tho' Biſhops don't at this Day take out ſuch a Commiſſion, yet the King appoints the Perſon, for the <hi>Dean and Chapter</hi> are obliged, under very ſevere Penalties, to chooſe the Man the King names to them.</p>
            <p>You have been taught, and I ſuppoſe generally believe, that the Ordinations performed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are univerſally allowed to be good and valid, and that even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> don't pretend to deny them. But they who tell you ſo, are either themſelves ignorant of the Matter, or have a Deſign to impoſe upon you. I don't deſire you to take my Word in the Caſe, but will give you full Proof. Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> informs us, that in the Book of Ordination ſet out by King EDWARD VI, the Form of conſecrating Biſhops, and ordaining Prieſts, was almoſt the ſame with that now uſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi>

                     <hi>p.</hi> 242.</note>.</q> To underſtand this, it is proper to obſerve, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> always acts upon this Principle, That the Civil Magiſtrate has no Authority over the Perſon of a Clergyman. When therefore ſuch an one is condemned of Hereſy or any other capital Crime, they always degrade him from whatever Orders he has taken in the Church; and being thus entirely ſtripped of his ſacred Character, and made a meer Layman, he is turned over to the <hi>ſecular Arm</hi> to be put to Death. <q>
                  <hi>Conferring Orders, and Degradation from them, are performed in a Manner and with Ceremonies directly contrary to each other. For when Orders are conferred, they begin from the loweſt 'till they gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

            <p>This muſt, I think, convince you, that you are far from getting clear of diſputed Ordinations by leaving us and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Their Ordinations are in Facts as really diſputed, and as abſolutely denyed as our's are; and the Principles you inſiſt upon to invalidate our Miniſtry will effectually deſtroy your own.

            <p>Nothing more can be requiſite to ſhew that your Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is properly ſchiſmatical, unleſs it be to prove that it has been and is attended with <hi>Uncharitableneſs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wetmore</hi> has, I think, ſaid nothing on this Head.

How common is it with you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that our Ordinations and Adminiſtrations are invalid, and that, tho' you yourſelves have no Baptiſm but what you received among us? Are there not many of you who teach your Children that were baptized with us, that in Baptiſm they were <q>
                  <hi>made Children of God, Members of Chriſt, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
               </q> and yet at the ſame Time endeavour to inſtill into them the Notion that our Baptiſms are null and void? Thus rather than fail of being uncharitable to us, you run into the moſt palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; and repreſent Chriſtianity in ſuch an abſurd Light to your Children, as directly tends to prejudice them againſt it, and to cauſe them, when they grow up, to renounce it and turn Infidels. To go on, How many are there of you, who refuſe to hold occaſional Communion with us in the Word of God and Prayer, who, when you have not Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to attend the Church-Service, chuſe rather wholly to omit the publick Worſhip of God than to join with us in it? If ſuch Perſons are not guilty of Schiſm, I am utterly at a Loſs how Men can poſſibly contract that Guilt. If there be any of you (as I hope there are ſome) who do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an uncharitable and cenſorious Spirit towards us in any of the Ways I have mentioned, I wiſh ſuch world ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider, whether they are not <hi>Partakers in other Men's Sins</hi> of this Kind, by joining in Communion with them, and countenancing, encouraging and hardning them therein.</p>

               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:006158_0125_1027F9F8185F78B0"/>
Upon the Whole, It appears evident to me, that Men, by ſeparating from our Churches, and joining in Communion with the epiſcopal Aſſemblies in this Country, do really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the awful Guilt of Schiſm, as their Separation is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and uncharitable. It will, I hope, tend to convince you of this, if I conclude this Head with the Sentiments of one of our Miniſters, for whom, thoſe of you who know him, profeſs a great Regard, who has been thought to have ſtudied this Controverſy with a Mind ſomething inclined to your Side of the Queſtion, and whom you have more than once boaſted of as one that was on the Point of declaring in your Favour. This Gentleman was pleaſed, not long ſince, to favour me with the <hi>Reſult of his Enquiries</hi> into this Subject, and the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that obliged him to continue in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Among other Things, he ſays, <q>
                  <hi>I ſhould be guilty of</hi> SCHISM <hi>in the proper Senſe of the Word, ſhould I break off from our Conſtitution and join with them. And I wiſh this Matter was laid home to them that have done ſo. It is aſtoniſhing to me, to hear one of our</hi> New-England <hi>Gentleman, who was baptized by a</hi> Preſbyterian Teacher <hi>(as they affect to call us) vapouring and ſwaggering of</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interupted Succeſſion, <hi>and</hi> beſt conſtituted Church in the World, <hi>and pronouncing</hi> NULITY <hi>upon all our Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is, with me, perfect</hi> Farce <hi>and</hi> Comedy. <hi>The moſt</hi> raving Enthuſiaſt <hi>does not appear in a more contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Figure,</hi>—BIGOTTRY <hi>is too ſoft a Term to expreſs it by. And when one of theſe Gentleman gravely invites me to come into the</hi> Boſom of the true Church, <hi>I dare not look him in the Face for Fear of</hi> laughing; <hi>I dare not aſk him where he was baptized, for Fear of putting him</hi> out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will add but one argument more to prove the <hi>Unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of ſeparating from our Churches, and joining the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Communion, and ſo conclude my Diſcourſe, which has already run to a greater Length and I deſigned.</p>

Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="4">IV.

            <p>The <hi>Facts</hi> here aſſerted are capable of plain and full Proof, and the <hi>Conſequence</hi> deduced from them is eaſily juſtified.</p>
            <p>The SOCIETY <hi>for the Propagation of the Goſpel in foreign Parts,</hi> was incorporated by a Charter granted by King WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM, on the 16th Day of <hi>June,</hi> 1701.

                  <hi>Upon Information, that in many of our Plantations, Colonies and Factories beyond the Seas, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for Miniſters was mean, and many other of our ſaid Plantations, Colonies and Factories were wholly unprovided of a Maintenance for Miniſters, and the publick Worſhip of God; and that for Lack of Support and Maintenance of ſuch, many of his loving Subjects wanted the Adminiſtration of God's Word and Sacraments, and ſeemed to be abandoned to Atheiſm and Infidelity, and others of them to popiſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry</hi>

Biſhop <hi>Burnot,</hi> in his Sermon, makes mention of what the People of <hi>New-England</hi> had done towards chriſtianizing the <hi>Indians,</hi> and calls upon thoſe who have a Zeal for the Honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to contribute to raiſe her Glory, by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating us.

This is all I can find the Society have done for this <hi>periſhing People.</hi> The laſt Account I have ſeen of them is in theſe Words, <q>
                  <hi>The Society are very ſenſible, that were there more Clergymen and Schoolmaſters of the Church of</hi> England <hi>ſettled in this Province, they would be very fully, and to very good Purpoſe employed; and the Governo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> of the Province hath been made acquainted, that if proper Proviſion ſhall be mads there towards their Support, the Society are ready to aſſiſt them therein</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Abſtr. for the Year 1746. <hi>p.</hi> 55.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Society, whatever the Reaſons of it are, do not treat all the <hi>Britiſh Plantations</hi> in this Manner. The Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> has about <hi>an hundred and fifty</hi> Preſbyterian or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Miniſters in it, the largeſt Number of Miniſters
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:006158_0131_1027FA0AE666BFE0"/>in Proportion to the Number of People, I ſuppoſe, of any <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colony in <hi>America,</hi> yet the Society have been ſo kind as to erect <hi>eight Miſſions</hi> in it, beſides paying <hi>two Schoolmaſters</hi> and <hi>one Catechiſt,</hi> and I can't learn that they ever wrote to the Governour of this Colony, that they would ſend no more unleſs the Aſſembly would make Proviſion for their Support.</p>
            <p>The true Reaſon why there is ſo little done for thoſe Places that ſo greatly need the Society's Help, is becauſe ſo much is thrown away where it is not at all needed, and indeed, where it does rather Hurt than Good. The Reaſon why <hi>North-Carolina</hi> is left to ſink into Atheiſm, <hi>Maryland</hi> to become a Prey to Popery, and the vaſt <hi>Indian Nations</hi> to periſh in the groſſeſt Heatheniſm, is becauſe the large Sums of Money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to the Management of the Society, inſtead of being employed to propagate the Goſpel, are applied to ſupport the epiſcopal Separation in <hi>New-England,</hi> and other Places, where Chriſtian Churches are already erected, tho' not in the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Form. The Society do in Effect acknowledge this. <q>
                  <hi>In</hi> New-England <hi>the Number of the Society's Miſſionaries</hi> (ſays their preſent Secretary) <hi>have been continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing from their firſt Inſtitution, and at this Time</hi> nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Miſſionaries <hi>are ſupported by them therein, and could the Society, in</hi> PRUDENCE AND JUSTICE <hi>to the preſſing Deſires of the other Colonies, anſwer the importunate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this very populous Province for new Miſſionaries, they muſt at leaſt double the Number</hi>

            <p>I rejoice to find the Society at length convinced, that JUSTICE to the other Colonies will not permit them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Number of their Miſſionaries in <hi>New-England.</hi> And I hope God will put it into their Hearts ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:006158_0132_1027D9A695EBE0A0"/>whether it be not really <hi>unjuſt,</hi> and an evident Miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Charity of the Nation, to apply any Part of the Money given for the <hi>Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> to the Support of a Party in <hi>New-England,</hi> while ſo many of the Plantations are really abandoned to Atheiſm and Infidelity, or leſt as a Prey to <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> and while large Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> bordering upon us, are wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the only true GOD, and have never heard of the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST. And I heartily wiſh the <hi>Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and thoſe young Gentlemen who are deſigning to take Miſſions in this Country, or any other, where the Goſpel is already fully preached, would ſeriouſly conſider what an Appearance they will make at laſt, and what a Reception they are to expect, when it ſhall be found that they were ſupported in Eaſe and Plenty, by Money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Propagation of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſpent their Lives (at beſt) in converting Men from one Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity to another, and perhaps from a better to a worſe; and that to encreaſe the Number of their Proſelites they carried Party Principles to an uncharitable Length, countenanced uneaſy and diſaffected Perſons, and admitted to the ſpecial Privileges of the Goſpel thoſe immoral Perſons who fled to them to ſhelter themſelves from thoſe eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cenſures they juſtly deſerved—.</p>
            <p>But I return</p>
            <p>This is, I think, ſufficient to ſhew, that the Increaſe of the Epiſcopal Separation in <hi>New-England,</hi> inſtead of being an Enlargement of the Redeemer's Kingdom in the World, is really a very great Hindrance to the Growth of it. Had not the Society been diverted from their original Deſign by your <hi>"important Demands for Miſſionaries",</hi> what great Advances might have been made toward recovering to a Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, thoſe Colonies where there are hardly any Footſteps of it to be found? And how much might have been done towards converting the neighbouring heatheniſh Nations to
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:006158_0133_1027FA0F97A8CEF8"/>the Belief and Practice of the Chriſtian Religion? Sure I am, that the Money the Society have expended in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſſionaries in <hi>New-England,</hi> is ſufficient (with that Bleſſing which might reaſonably have been expected in ſo pious a Deſign) to have accompliſhed great Things of this Nature. Had it not then been much better on the Whole, much more for the Advantage of the common Intereſt of Chriſtianity, that you had contentedly remained in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, even ſuppoſing our Conſtitution more imperfect than that of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> What Advantages have you derived from the <hi>Separation</hi> that can countervail the Damage it has done by hindring the Enlargement of Chriſt's Kingdom, and preventing the Salvation of ſo many precious and immortal Souls? Is <hi>New-England</hi> become a more religious Country by Means of the <hi>Miſſions</hi> that have been erected in it? Fix upon any one Place, and make the Trial. <hi>Stratford</hi> is the oldeſt Miſſion in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> the Society have maintained a Miniſter there for almoſt <hi>thirty</hi> Years, and have now a Catechiſt and Schoolmaſter in their Pay. They have in the whole expended in <hi>Stratford</hi> better than <hi>twenty thouſand Pounds</hi> this Currency, a Sum which, if properly applied, might have been the Means of converting an whole Nation of Heathen. But what good Effects has it produced in <hi>Stratford?</hi> Will it be pretended that the People in general are by this Means become more ſober and ſeriouſly religious? Are there fewer <hi>prayerleſs Families,</hi> in Proportion to the Number of People, than there were <hi>thirty</hi> Years ago? Is the <hi>Lord's Day more ſtrictly obſerved,</hi> or the <hi>publick Worſhip more generally attended?</hi> Is there leſs <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Extravagance?</hi> Are <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Quarreling, Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> grown more out of Faſhion? If all theſe Queſtions muſt be anſwered in the negative, and the People of <hi>Stratford</hi> are no better in Point of practical Religion than they were before they had a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> ſettled among them, or than in all Probability they would have been if the Society had done nothing for them, it muſt, I think, unavoidably follow, that
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:006158_0134_1027FA13E10DDE48"/>there has been no Equivalent produced for the Loſs to the general Intereſt of Religion, occaſioned by the Miſapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>twenty thouſand Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now gone through what I at firſt propoſed. The Arguments I have offered under each Head, are ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me <hi>plain</hi> and eaſy to be underſtood: And I have endeavoured to ſet them in ſuch a Light as I thought moſt likely to <hi>inform</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> you. My own Conſcience, on a calm Review, acquits me of having <hi>deſignedly</hi> miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any Fact, or impoſed on you by any fallacious Ways of arguing. Theſe Arguments appear to me fully ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove that it was neither NECESSARY in Point of Duty, nor PROPER in Point of Prudence, nor indeed ſo much as LAWFUL for you to ſeparate from us, as you have done; and conſequently that you are <hi>in Duty bound</hi> to return to our Communion, which you have ſinfully forſaken. And the Arguments offered do, at leaſt, deſerve your <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>ſerious</hi> Conſideration. To which if you add ſuch earneſt and fervent Prayers to the <hi>Father of Lights</hi> and <hi>Fountain of Truth,</hi> as the Importance of the Affair plainly requires, I ſhall entertain great Hope of your Condition and Recovery.</p>
            <p>You deceive yourſelves, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> if you think this a Matter of <hi>very ſmall</hi> Conſequence. For beſides the great Guilt you have contracted by ſuch an <hi>unneceſſary</hi> and <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Separation;</hi> I can't help thinking you muſt <hi>now</hi> be in ſome Degree ſenſible that your Conduct has had an unhappy Influence on practical Religion in this Country; as well as on the Intereſts of Chriſtianity abroad in the World; or at leaſt that you muſt have ſome Fears that this has been the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Look round you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> and count the Inſtances (if indeed you can find any) of Perſons who were looſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fain and immoral in their Lives when they forſook us, and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:006158_0135_1027FA15A075F790"/>are become practically religious, or ſober vertuous Men by joining the epiſcopal Separation. Or, if you chuſe it, take a View of ſuch as appeared to be religious Perſons when they left our Communion, and ſee if they appear to grow more holy, humble, and circumſpect in their Behaviour. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves, and ſee what you have gained by this Change. Do you find a quicker and more <hi>affecting Senſe</hi> of your Miſery and Danger while under the Guilt and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin? Are your <hi>Deſires</hi> of Deliverance more <hi>earneſt,</hi> your <hi>Prayers</hi> more <hi>importunate</hi> and your <hi>Endeavours</hi> more <hi>animated?</hi> Do you really appear to your ſelves more like <hi>Men in Earneſt</hi> in this great and important Concern? Or, if you ſuppoſe your ſelves delivered from the Guilt and Power of Sin; Do you find yourſelves growing in an habitual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the moral Perfections of GOD? Do you find that inſtead of being <hi>conformed to this World,</hi> you are <hi>transformed by the Removing of your Minds,</hi> ſo as to <hi>approve</hi> and obey <hi>the good and acceptable and perfect Will of God?</hi> Do you really think that your Souls are more mortified to Sin, more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the World, and the Vanities and Follies of it, and more attemper'd to the Services and Enjoyments of Heaven?</p>
            <p>It requires <hi>evident</hi> and very <hi>great Effects</hi> of this Kind in your ſelves, and in the Country in general, to excuſe your Conduct; for if you and your Families and Neighbours are <hi>no better,</hi> or <hi>but a little better</hi> than you and they might have been, if there had been no <hi>epiſcopal</hi> Separation in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; there is nothing to ballance the bad Effects of that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. You muſt, I think, he now ſenſible that your ſeparating from us, has been the <hi>great Means</hi> of preventing the Propagation of the Goſpel, and the Enlargement of the viſible Kingdom of the Redeemer; as it is the <hi>very Thing</hi> which has diverted to another Uſe the Money given with that Deſign. And can you, without the moſt punged Grief and Sorrow, reflect upon it, That you have been the Means
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:006158_0136_1027FA18757D9698"/>of preventing that <hi>Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> which was promiſed the REDEEMER, in Conſideration of his ſhedding his precious Blood for Sinners—; That you have <hi>prevented,</hi> as much as in you lay, the <hi>beneficent Deſigns of divine Grace</hi> toward the Heathen World—And that probably there are many immortal Souls now in Hell, who (had you contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained in our Communion) might have ſpent an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Eternity in Heaven! If neither the Conſideration of the <hi>Glory of</hi> GOD and <hi>Honour of the</hi> REDEEMER, nor of the <hi>eternal Intereſts</hi> of your Fellow-men will influence you; you muſt not only be Strangers to that exalted and <hi>Godlike Temper</hi> the Goſpel is deſigned to produce in human Minds, but muſt have caſt off all the <hi>tender Principles</hi> of Humanity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>my Brethren, I hope better Things of you.</hi> Theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were never, that I know of, ſet in their <hi>proper Light</hi> before your Eyes. And I charitably believe, that many of you would never, <hi>on any Conſideration,</hi> have acted as you have done, if you had conſidered Matters <hi>in this View,</hi> or had the Conſequences of your Conduct ſet in ſuch a Light before you. Surely you would not have diſſolved the Union and broken the Peace of our Churches, if you had been ſenſible that you thereby contracted the dreadful Guilt of Schiſm. You would not have gone into the <hi>epiſcopal Separation,</hi> had you been aware of the many <hi>hurtful Conſequences</hi> of it with Regard to the <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Intereſts of your Country, and to the Cauſe of <hi>practical Religion</hi> in it. I cannot believe, with Regard to many of you, that you would ever have join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Petitioning</hi> the Society for Aſſiſtance, or in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Aſſiſtance from them, if you had known that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Penny they applied to your Uſe, was ſo much loſt to the common Cauſe of Chriſtianity, and prevented the Propagation of the Goſpel of GOD YOUR SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="unknown:006158_0137_1027FA1A11956F30"/>
But as theſe Things have been now ſet in a plain and (I think) convincing Manner before you; it may juſtly be expected of you, that you approve your ſelves <hi>Lovers of the Glory of the</hi> REDEEMER, and of the Souls of Men, by forſaking the criminal Separation you have run into, and returning to the Communion you have unjuſtly forſaken. Thus will an End be put to the Schiſm you have made in this Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>, and the unhappy Effects of it on practical Religion be prevented. <hi>New-England</hi> will hopefully remain a Country remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſerious and practical Religion. And the SOCIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY <hi>for propagating the Goſpel,</hi> being free from your <q>

               </q> will be at Liberty to apply the Charities they are entruſted with the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, to thoſe great and good Ends for which they were given. By this Means thoſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> which are ſunk or ſinking into <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> may be recovered to a ſerious Senſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to ſuch a Behaviour as ſhall be ornamental to the Profeſſion of it. Thoſe Nations bordering upon us that are now <hi>ſetting in</hi> heatheniſh <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>periſhing for want of Viſion,</hi> may be brought to rejoice in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Light of the Goſpel.</hi> And the <hi>whole Earth be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are Events ſo excellent and deſireable, that we ought to be ready even to lay down our Lives to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and advance them. If I am conſcious to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Action in my ſelf, 'tis with a View to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them that I have engaged in, and carried on this Controverſy.
