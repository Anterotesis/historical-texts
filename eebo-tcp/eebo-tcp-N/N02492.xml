            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GOD Calls upon us <hi>this Day</hi> to <hi>Stand in awe of Him;</hi> for He hath terribly ſhaken the Earth under us, and threatn'd to ſend us down quick into the Pit. At the ſame time, He alſo encourageth us to <hi>Hope in His Mercy.</hi> We might have been ſuddenly deſtroy'd, and that without remedy. Yeſterday might have been the laſt Sabbath, and the laſt Opportunity of hearing GOD ſpeaking to us in His Word; but Adored be the divine Patience &amp; Long-ſuffering! Our gracious LORD hath choſen rather to Warn us by a very aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence, and then to give a further ſpace for Repentance. O that His Goodneſs might lead us to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. We are now <hi>Aſſembled</hi> in His Name and Fear, to humble our ſelves under GOD's Mighty Hand, to Cry to Him to turn from the Fierceneſs of His Angery, and to Praiſe Him for his wonderful Deliverance O that I could speak, and you Hear under the deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe Things!</p>
            <p>The Penman of this Pſalm was <hi>David;</hi> the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it is uncertain.

The Word, ſays a worthy <hi>Divine</hi> ſignifies any moving of the Heart; the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render it, Be angry, and Sin not. Which Words being us'd by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 4.26. are ſuppos'd by ſome to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a Quotation from this Pſalm. Others render it by word which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to tremble or ſhake for fear <hi>Piſcator</hi> gives the ſenſe thus; Be mov'd with fear of the anger of GOD. Which is agreeable to our own <hi>Verſion,</hi> Stand in Awe. There is alſo ſome difference among <hi>Expoſitors</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Perſons to whom theſe words are directed. Some think they are directed to his Enemies, that they ſhou'd fear GOD and not Sin againſt Him by their oppoſition to <hi>David's</hi> Perſon and Government, who was anointed by GOD's eſpecial Direction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Others rather underſtand the words as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Friends, that they ſhou'd ſtand in awe of GOD's terrible Majeſty under their diſtreſſing troubles, and not ſin by murmuring againſt GOD, or taking any forbidden Courſes to Extricate themſelves. However it is plain, that theſe words are ſpoken to a profeſſing People in a time of Calamity, and I may from them obſerve this Doctrine,</p>
            <q>DOCT. <hi>IT is the Duty of particular Perſons and of a Profeſſing People in times of great Diſtreſs, to Stand in Awe of GOD, and not Sin.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>IT is our Duty at all times to <hi>fear that glorious and fearful Name, the LORD our GOD,</hi> and eſpecially when He diſplays his terrible Majeſty in awful Judgments, we ſhou'd then look above Second Cauſes, and obey that word which GOD ſpake to his People in a time when their Hearts were ready to fail them for fear, Iſa. 8.12, 13. <hi>Say ye not, a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,— Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> We
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002954_0005_0FE6A4BDC6B5E928"/>muſt at ſuch a time Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts — We muſt have our minds impreſs'd with an holy awe, a reverential fear of his terrible Majeſty, and give him the Glory of his infinite Power, Juſtice, Holineſs, Faithfulneſs and Mercy, and other admirable Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſhine forth in his judicial Diſpenſations; and in that ſeaſonable help which he affords his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under them; Inſtead of being Slaviſhly afraid of Evil, which fear brings a ſnare. We ſhou'd Exerciſe a religious filial fear of GOD as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, Job 23.15. <hi>When I conſider, I am afraid of him.</hi> We ſhould be deeply concern'd, and afraid at the tokens of GOD's diſpleaſure, <hi>Even when his Wrath is kindled but a little, and begins to burn;</hi> when he gives us to ſing both of Mercy and Judgment. And being mov'd with fear of GOD's diſpleaſure, we ſhou'd put away our Sins which ſtir up his Anger, and are the ground of the Controverſy between GOD and us. We ſhould be afraid of offending GOD by breaking his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and accordingly ſhould Repent of, and put far away thoſe Sins wereby we have tranſgreſſed his Law. Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto GOD at ſuch a time, <hi>I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more,</hi> Job 34.31, 32. It is the Duty of a Perſon or a People thus to ſtand in Awe, and not Sin; to Fear the Lord and depart from Evil. Here, I wou'd in a practical way, and with a particular Application to our ſelves, Conſider ſeveral Sins which a Perſon or People under threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Judgments ſhou'd put away in the Exerciſe of an holy Awe of GOD, and dread of his righteous Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>WE ſhou'd ſtand in Awe of GOD, and not Sin by Impenitency &amp; Unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a very comprehenſive <hi>Head,</hi> however I ſhall give it a diſtinct Conſideration. When GOD is coming out in Judgments againſt us, We ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002954_0006_0FE6A4BF21D1E9C8"/>humble our ſelves under his mighty hand, loath our ſelves for our iniquities, and repent in duſt and aſhes. Thus GOD ſaid to his People of old, Jer. 2.19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy backſlidings ſhall reprove thee: know therefore and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts.</hi> Afflictions ſhould teach us the evil of Sin, and make that moſt bitter which is the procuring cauſe of them. When GOD is threatning us we ſhould open our ears to diſcipline, and from an affecting ſight and ſenſe of the evil and danger, the filthineſs and odiouſneſs of Sin, heartily grieve becauſe we have offended GOD by breaking his Law, and putting away our Sin, ſhou'd turn to him. As <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> bemoan'd himſelf thus, <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, Surely after that I was turned I repented; and after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea, even confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth,</hi> Jer. 31.18, 19. Again, we ſhou'd ſtand in awe, and not Sin by <hi>Unbelief.</hi> This is a very heinous Sin, 1 John 5.10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in himſelf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</hi> And it is highly diſpleaſing to GOD, and upon the account of it GOD is provok'd to bring terrible Judgments upon a profeſſing People. Thus when the <hi>Son of God</hi> was manifeſt in the fleſh, and came to his own, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him not. The Body of the Jewiſh Nation rejected the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and then GOD caſt them off, and poured out his Wrath upon them in a moſt terrible manner, Rom. 11.20. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off</hi> —. When GOD is come out in terrible Judgments againſt us, we ſhould therefore be convinced of Sin, particularly of this great Sin of not believing in Jeſus Chriſt, and take heed there be
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002954_0007_0FE6A4BF46120FD8"/>not in any of us <hi>an evil Heart of unbelief.</hi> We ſhould give glory to GOD by receiving the record he hath given of his Son, as a faithful ſaying and worthy of all acceptation, and reſt upon Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as reveal'd and held forth in the word of the Goſpel, for Juſtification and Eternal Life. Let us then ſtand in awe of GOD, while under the tokens of his diſpleaſure, repent and turn from all our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; ſo iniquity ſhall not be our ruin. Let us, being mov'd with fear fly to Jeſus Chriſt who is the hope of his Iſrael and the Saviour thereof in times of trouble. Let us not give our gracious Lord reaſon to complain as of Jeruſalem, Matt. 23.37. <hi>O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not.</hi> But let us now fly to Chriſt and truſt under his Shadow, who is <hi>an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt:</hi> Iſa. 32.2.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THE Keeping of a <hi>Weekly Sabbath,</hi> or Day of holy Reſt to the LORD is of Divine and Perpetual Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as the Fourth Commandment declares. The Firſt Day of the Week ſince CHRIST's Reſurrection on that Day, is the Sabbath; as appears by the Practice of the Apoſtles who were divinely inſpired, with reſpect to thoſe Matters which were of general concern to the Church: Act. 20.7. <hi>And upon the firſt day of the week, when the Diſciples came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to break bread, 'Paul preached unto them</hi> —. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. — <hi>Upon the firſt day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him</hi> —. And this is agreably call'd, <hi>The
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002954_0010_0FE6A4CC5DFAFCE0"/>Lord's Day,</hi> Rev. 1.10. Now GOD requires his People, to whom He gives his <hi>Sabbath</hi> as a Sign, to Sanctify it by Reſting from all Unneceſſary Worldly Buſineſs, and from Recreations lawful at other times, And then by ſpending the whole time, unleſs when works of Neceſſity or Mercy take us off, in the Secret, Private &amp; Publick Worſhip of GOD. It is our Privilege that we have the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and very ſtrong are our Obligations <hi>to Remember, and keep it Holy:</hi> unleſs we do it, Religion will languiſh, and GOD will be provoked to bring terrible Judgments upon us. Jer. 17.21, 24, 27. <hi>Thus ſaith the LORD, Take heed to your ſelves, and bear no burden on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jeruſalem. And it ſhall come to paſs, if ye diligently hearken unto me, ſaith the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of this City on the Sabbath-Day, but hallow the Sabbath-Day, to do no work therein. But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath-Day, and not to bear a burden, even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in at the gates of Jeruſalem on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day: then will I kindle a Fire in the gates thereof, and it ſhall devour the palaces of Jeruſalem, and it ſhall not be quenched.</hi> Let us then take care and Sanctify the Lords-Day. Bleſſed be GOD the ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath has been no ſmall part of the glory of NEW-ENGLAND, and of BOSTON: O let us take heed and beware of every thing that would ſtain this glory! Let us therefore remember the Sabbath, and bear it in mind, eſpecially when it draws nigh, that we may be diſintangled from all Worldly Cares, and ready to enter into this holy Reſt.</p>
            <p>In the Scriptural Account of the Creation, the Darkneſs is reckon'd before the Light of the Natural Day. And the Evening and the Morning were the Second Day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.8. Agreable to this the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath was from Evening to Evening, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> commanded the Gates to be ſhut when it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002954_0011_0FE6A4CC81A1B1B0"/>began to be dark before the Sabbath, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.19. which by reaſon of the Mountains round about and near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeems to have been about Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting at furtheſt. The Chriſtian Sabbath is the firſt Day of the Week. And it muſt begin as other Days. As to the exact Time of CHRIST's Reſurrection, it is not ſet forth in Scripture.</p>
            <p>LET us then diſpatch our Worldly Buſineſs towards the Evening, before the Sabbath Day. Such as are in Trade, ſhou'd take Care that their Shops be ſhut ſeaſonably. Such as have Meat or any other things to buy, ſhould take Care to do it before Night. Or whatever <hi>Secular Buſineſs</hi> is to be done, we ought to finiſh it ſo that we may not be cumber'd about it, when we ſhould be keeping an <hi>holy Reſt</hi> to the Lord. On the <hi>Lord's Day Morning,</hi> we ſhould riſe early, if our bodily Health will allow it, and take Care that we and our Houſholds ſeparate a whole Day for the Service of GOD; and that we do not thro' Covetouſneſs allow them in any unneceſſary worldly Labour. There muſt be no <hi>Burden</hi> born on the Sabbath, No! not ſo much as to ſetch or carry any wearing Apparel: yea on this Day the Beaſts muſt Reſt from Labor <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not do any Work, thou nor thy Cattle</hi> partly to teach us to exerciſe Mercy toward the brute Creatures, partly becauſe the uſe of Cattle muſt have drawn along with it the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or Employment of Men.</q> The Reſt of Man and Beaſt muſt not be interrupted without weighty Cauſe. We muſt look to it that it be a Work of Neceſſity or Mercy, or elſe we may not employ Men about it.</p>
            <p>Again, As we muſt take Care that our Children and Servants be not Idle at home; ſo <hi>that they attend the Publick Worſhip.</hi> GOD requires that we &amp; ours appear before him to do him <hi>Homage</hi> on this Day, and we muſt take Care to go up to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002954_0012_0FE6A4D884CC2E10"/>Houſe of the Lord; and we muſt not neglect the Aſſembling our ſelves together on this Day: We muſt ſee to it that our Seat be not Empty; and that our Children &amp; Servants do not abſent themſelves; unleſs when Sickneſs, the neceſſary Occaſions of the Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> require it. And tho' it be true, that the Sabbath is but one Day in the Week: yet there is Prudence to be uſed on the Evening after the Sabbath-Day, that we do not loſe what we have wrought or got on the Lord's Day, by going Abroad into vain Company, by viſits of meer Ceremony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but rather Employ the Time in Catechiſing our Children &amp; Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us then be Exhorted to Keep the Sabbath holy. Let us turn away our foot from the Sabbath, from doing our Pleaſure on GOD's holy Day. Let us call the Sabbath our delight, the holy of the Lord honourable, and honour him, not doing our own ways, nor finding our own pleaſures, nor ſpeaking our own words. And let us be awakened to great Diligence &amp; Care herein from the Warnings GOD hath given us, and by the ſhakes of his Rod over us. GOD lately Viſited us with a terrible <hi>Storm</hi> on the Evening before the Sabbath Day-light; And <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with an amazing Shock of an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> on the Evening after it. O let it not be ſaid that GOD ſpake once, yea twice, and yet we regarded it not!</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE ſhou'd ſtand in aw, and not Sin <hi>by the Neglect of Family 'Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is our Duty to reſolve with <hi>Joſhua, As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24.15. And with <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. 101.2. <hi>I will walk within my Houſe with a perfect Heart.,</hi> We muſt walk as in the fight of GOD, and approve our Hearts to him by a conſcientious diſcharge of Family Duties, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when his Judgments have an eſpecial threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aſpect on our Houſes. We ſhou'd be moved
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002954_0013_0FE6A4D89B7674E0"/>with an holy Fear to put all Iniquity far from our Tabernacles, and to ſerve GOD in them. For GOD threatens the Wicked, <hi>Job</hi> 27, 28, 29. <hi>The heaven ſhall reveal his iniquity: and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him. The increaſe of his houſe ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and his goods ſhall flow away in the day of his wrath. This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, that GOD hath cauſed our Houſes to ſhake under us, and threaten'd to bury us in the Ruins of them; let us be excited to Worſhip GOD conſtantly in and with our Families. Let us offer to him the Morning &amp; Evening Sacrifice of Prayer. For ſurely, If it be a Duty, <hi>to Pray always in every thing, at all times, and with all Prayer,</hi> we can't neglect Family Prayer without great Sin. Let us not then practically deny that GOD who ſets the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in Families, by refuſing this part of <hi>Social Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> for which we have daily Occaſion as well as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Let us with <hi>David,</hi> Bleſs our Houſhold. Let us thus <hi>Fear God with all our Houſe,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our religious Fear by <hi>Praying always,</hi> as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> did <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2. Leſt we provoke GOD to Conſume us in his Wrath according to that dreadful Imprecation, Jer. 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that call not upon thy Name.</hi> If the word <hi>Family</hi> be here taken in a large ſenſe, it includes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Houſholds. O let us join together in asking GOD's Protection and Bleſſing on our Houſes, in ſeeking the Pardon of our Family Sins, and in Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing GOD for Family Mercies, leſt we provoke GOD to conſume us together. Again, <hi>Let us Read the holy Scriptures</hi> in and with our Houſes, and teach our Children &amp; Servants the good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord. Let us as 'twas ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.19. <hi>Command our Children and Houſhold
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002954_0014_0FE6A4D9B7B5FA68"/>after us,— that they may keep the way of the Lord.</hi> Let us ſet them <hi>Examples</hi> of Sobriety, Righteouſneſs and Godlineſs: and then uſe our Authority to Reſtrain them from all Sin. GOD threaten'd <hi>Eli,</hi> that <hi>he would judge his Houſe,</hi> i.e. <hi>Condemn, Puniſh it — for the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity he knew, becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Sam. 3.13. O let us then take heed we do not connive at Sin in our Children or Servants; but do our utmoſt by ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Admonitions &amp; Corrections when needed, to Reclaim them, left GOD be provok'd to enter into Judgment with us, and Puniſh us for the Sins of our Houſes. Let us <hi>bring up</hi> our Children in the <hi>Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi> And let us do our Duty towards our Servants alſo, even the meaneſt of them, conſidering we have a Maſter in Heaven, and there is no reſpect of perſons with him. Job 31.13, 15. <hi>If I did deſpiſe the cauſe of my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, or of my maid ſervant, when they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me: What then ſhall I do when God riſeth up? and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this Head, I wou'd ſay, We muſt ſtand in aw, and not Sin by being <hi>Unjuſt in our Family Buſineſs,</hi> or by taking any indirect Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Provide for our Families. We muſt take heed there be no Fraud, Unrighteouſneſs or Oppreſſion in our Trading; the Eighth Commandment requires Juſtice in Commerce between Man &amp; Man, our ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to every one his due; and forbids <hi>"whatever may unjuſtly hinder our own or our Neighbour's Wealth &amp; outward Eſtate."</hi> There is a flying <hi>Roll</hi> which is call'd the <hi>Curſe,</hi> and GOD ſays, it is for every one that Steals, and threatens to <hi>bring it into the Houſe of the Thief,</hi> and that it ſhall conſume it, Zech. 5.2 — 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WE muſt ſtand in aw, and not Sin by <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling &amp; Contending one with another.</hi> When there
<pb facs="unknown:002954_0015_0FE6A4D9D8A29848"/>is reaſon to ſay, <hi>What means the heat of GOD's Anger?</hi> Then GOD's People ſhould avoid all unchriſtian Heats, Heart-burnings &amp; Animoſities one againſt another, and endeavour to unite as one Man, in ſeeking to turn away GOD's Anger from them. It's dreadful indeed for Men to be caſting fire Brands, Arrows &amp; Death. For them to ſeek in their Wrath, in any ſort to hurt &amp; wound their Neighbour, either by bitter Words, or injurious Actions. Inſtead of this, we ſhould do our utmoſt to extinguiſh the Fire of Contention; that we may lift up pure hands to GOD without Wrath in ſervent Supplications, and unite hearts and hands in the great Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Let us then obey that word, Eph. 4.31, 32. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. WE ſhould ſtand in aw, and <hi>avoid the Sins of Drunkenneſs &amp; Uncleanneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I put theſe together, and indeed they often go together, the former being an eſpecial Provocation to the latter, and therefore forbidden in the ſeventh Commandment. Prov. 23.31, 32. <hi>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red —. At the laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder. Thine Eyes ſhall behold ſtrange women.</hi> Now that GOD hath fulfilled that word, Iſa. 24.20. <hi>The Earth ſhall reel to &amp; fro like a Drunkard;</hi> let us avoid this Sin, and obey that word, Eph. 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine — but be filled with the Spirited.</hi> Let us take the Warning, and not inflame our ſelves with ſtrong Drink: Let us not indulge this Sin in our ſelves, or connive at it in others; but avoid all Temptations to it, and be ready in our ſeveral Places to bear our Teſtimony againſt it. Let the <hi>Civil</hi>

Let ſuch as ſell Strong Drink, take heed &amp; beware of being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with others in this Sin, by ſuffering Perſons to drink to Exceſs. O do not make a gain of the Sins of others, leſt you be drowned with them in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

O do not ſpend your precious Time, and your Eſtates there!

            <p>Again, LET us ſtand in aw and not Sin by <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Unclean Luſts,</hi> and gratifying our carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SODOM</hi> was infamous for the Sins of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>the Lord rained upon them Fire &amp; Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from the Lord out of Heaven,</hi> Gen. 19.24. Yea they ſuffered the Vengeance of eternal Fire, <hi>Jude ver.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002954_0018_0FE6A4E727DEBDC8"/>be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? ſhall there be evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> No ſurely, this terrible Judgment is the Work of GOD, and he ſpeaks aloud to us by it, as Joh. 5.24. <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> GOD ſeems to ſay to us in his Providence, I have given you fair Warning, do not further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me. Or, as Hoſ. 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</hi> Let us then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent under GOD's Hand, and by an hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance turn unto him. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Let us fear the Lord and his Goodneſs; and not after our hardneſs and impenitent Heart, <hi>treaſure up to our ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> by abuſing the Riches of it. O that we cou'd each of us, with an heart broken for Sin, fly to JESUS CHRIST, who ſaves his People from their Sins! O that we cou'd as a People, Repent, and turn from our evil ways unto the Lord, our Covenant GOD! Then we might Hope that GOD wou'd turn from the fierceneſs of his Anger: But if after all that is come upon us, and GOD hath <hi>given us ſuch Deliverance as this,</hi> we remain incorrigible, <hi>and again break his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, will he not be angry with us till he hath conſumed us, ſo that there ſhall be no remnant, nor <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> our Caſe be like that of <hi>Jeruzalem,</hi> which is compar'd to a <hi>boyling Pot,</hi> whoſe <hi>Scum</hi> went not out of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. <hi>i. e.</hi> The Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their abominable Vices was not caſt out, tho' GOD's fiery Indignation burnt againſt them. I ſay,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002954_0019_0FE6A4E74B3BFDE8"/>If this be our Caſe, we ſhall have Reaſon to fear the fulfilment of that awful Threatning upon us, ver. 13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi> Let the Terrors of the laſt Night then convince us of the Neceſſity of Reformation, and quicken us to fly our provoking Sins, as we wou'd hope to eſcape the amazing Judgments of GOD, yea the Wrath to come. And here tho' I have already mention'd ſeveral Sins which an holy Aw of GOD ſhou'd excite us to forſake, and put far away from us; yet I wou'd further ſay; Let this terrible Judgment of GOD teach us the great Evil and folly of a <hi>covetous worldly Spirit,</hi> which alas dreadfully prevails in this Land. Our Lord &amp; Judge ſays to us this Day, <hi>Take heed &amp; beware of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs.</hi> O let us not then immoderately Crave, and with greedineſs purſue this world's Goods: Let us not Truſt in <hi>uncertain Riches,</hi> when GOD hath caus'd the Earth to ſhake &amp; tremble under us. O do not now pant after the Duſt of the Earth? Do not practically ſay, Your Houſes are for ever, when the Foundation on which they ſtand is mov'd! Leſt you, your Houſes and Eſtates periſh together in the Day of GOD's Indignation.</p>
               <p>Now is it not one ſign of the prevailing of this <hi>Evil</hi> that the <hi>weekly Lecture</hi> in this populous Town, is often ſo poorly attended? I can't but fear, <hi>My Brethren &amp; Nei'bours,</hi> that this <hi>Omiſſion</hi> is provoking to GOD. Certainly we might have a <hi>full Aulitory,</hi> and yet give large Allowances for the <hi>urgent Affairs</hi> of the Town, which require pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſpatch. Let us not then be ſo careful and cumbred about many things as to neglect this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Opportunity.</hi> Let us in this particular, <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of GOD,</hi> and other things ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002954_0020_0FE6A4EFC785E358"/>be added. I am ſatisfied this wou'd not hinder but promote the Succeſs of our <hi>Secular Buſineſs,</hi> thro' GOD's Bleſſing. And O that we might be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>every Inſtance</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> towards GOD, and <hi>Charity</hi> towards our Neighbour, to lay up our Treaſures in Heaven, and to ſeek that Kingdom which can't be moved!</p>
               <p>Again, Is not <hi>profane Swearing &amp; Curſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dreadfully Common</hi> with ſome ſorts of People? Now this is an heaven-daring &amp; heinous Iniquity, which GOD is wont ſeverely to Puniſh. Jer. 23.10. <hi>Becauſe of ſwearing the Land mourneth</hi>—. Zech. 5.1. — <hi>Behold, a flying Roll.</hi>— ver. 3. <hi>Every one that ſweareth ſhall be cut off on that ſide.</hi> O let not any for the Time to come, dare thus to ſet their Mouths againſt Heaven; but let the dread of GOD fall upon you; <hi>Fear an Oath,</hi> and do not take GOD's ſacred Name into your Mouths upon every light &amp; trivial Occaſion; do not Call him to <hi>Witneſs</hi> to a lie, leſt he appear as a <hi>ſwift Witneſs</hi> againſt you, and ſtop your Breath in a moment. Don't imprecate <hi>Curſes</hi> on your ſelves or others, leſt the Curſe of GOD fall upon you, and you be ſuddenly ſent down to the <hi>Place of Torments,</hi> where is wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth for ever.</p>
               <p>Again, ARE there not ſuch as <hi>ſet light by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; Mother;</hi> who Refuſe to give that Honour which is due to their Parents, their Civil Rulers, Paſtors and the like? If there be any ſuch, be warn'd to fly this heinous Sin. <hi>Honor thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy Mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Remember the <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that with others of the Children of Iſrael, gather'd themſelves together againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.) and fly this Sin.</p>

Again, ARE there not <hi>Evil Cuſtoms</hi> prevailing among us, in which we are conform'd to the <hi>preſent Age?</hi> Tho' GOD forbids this, Rom. 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world.</hi> Let us ſearch them out, and Reform them, leſt we be condemned with the World another Day.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this USE, I wou'd ask leave to Addreſs ſeveral ſorts of Perſons particularly:

               <p>WE read of a great <hi>Earthquake</hi> at Midnight, while <hi>Paul &amp; Silas</hi> Pray'd —, after which the <hi>Jailor</hi> came trembling — and ſaid, <hi>Sirs, What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 16.25, 26, — 29, 30. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry very needful for thoſe to make who are yet under the Guilt &amp; Dominion of Sin, now that GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his Wrath in this amazing Judgment. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Terrors of the Lord, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, <hi>be ye reconciled to GOD.</hi> O do not go on obſtinately in your Sins, leſt GOD ſend you down to the bottomleſs Pit <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Now make Supplication to your <hi>Judge,</hi> and cry for Mercy while He is ſeated on a Throne of Grace, and ſays, <hi>Come unto me — Look unto me, and be ye-ſaved</hi> —. And if there be any awakned, as I hope there are not a ſew, and bro't to cry out, What muſt we do to be ſav'd? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given to the Jailor is ready, ver. 31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and then ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Go out to him, truſt in him, and ſubmit to him in

Who can tell, but GOD deſigns to make uſe of this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing &amp; extraordinary Providence to prepare you to receive and obey the Calls of his Word? O dont neglect this remarkable <hi>Day of Grace!</hi> You are never like to enjoy ſuch another. To Day then while it is call'd to day, Hear GOD's Voice, and harden not your Hearts. Now! Now! Work out your Salvation with fear &amp; trembling, crying to GOD to work in you to will &amp; to do. If you now reject the Offers of the Goſpel, there will be great reaſon to fear that this Judgment will prove a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of unavoidable Deſtruction. And wo to you if after all, you Periſh becauſe you will not come to CHRIST that you may have life. <hi>It will be more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for Sodom &amp; Gomorrah in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than for you.</hi> The Lord ſpeak to your hearts, and make you willing in the Day of his Power!</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>LET this rouſe up</hi> GOD's Children, <hi>and awaken them out of their ſleepy Frames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> may <hi>ſlumber &amp; ſleep,</hi> Matth. 25.5. But what a Cry is now heard to awaken you? Behold, <hi>The Lord ariſeth to ſhake terribly the Earth.</hi> Ariſe then, and <hi>trim your Lamps;</hi> Prepare to meet the Lord in the way of his Judgments. Know it, Your Sins may help to pull down Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon GOD's People. <hi>Aaron's &amp; David's</hi> did ſo. Pray therefore, as Pſal. 143.2. <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant</hi> —.

Had there been <hi>ten Righteous</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> GOD wou'd have ſpar'd it, <hi>Gen:</hi> 18.32. I hope there are many <hi>hundreds</hi> in in this Land.

               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>LET our</hi> Young People <hi>Fear the Lord, and flee youthful Luſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HERE is a loud Call to you, to <hi>Remember your Creator in the days of your Youth;</hi> for you lie as much expos'd to this threatned Judgment as the Aged, and can no more eſcape it. O turn at GOD's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooſ</hi> then, <hi>leſt he laugh at your Galamity, and mock when your fear cometh,</hi> when your fear cometh as deſolation — <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26, 27. You are apt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of many days; but now GOD teacheth you that <hi>ſudden 'Deſtruction</hi> may come upon you. Do you then hear and fear and turn to the Lord. Seek CHRIST early; Receive him without delay, <hi>That you may have power to become the Sons of GOD,</hi> Joh. 1.12. Then you may go to GOD as to your <hi>reconciled Father</hi> when in diſtreſs. But if you now deſpiſe the Son of GOD, and neglect his great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there will be dreadful Reaſon to Fear, that GOD will utterly forſake you in the evil Day. Be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therefore, O <hi>young People,</hi> to conſider of your
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002954_0024_0FE6A4FCDB59E078"/>ways, and turn your feet to GOD's Teſtimonies. GOD in his Word and by his Providence ſpeaks to you as, Eccl. 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment.</hi> It is at your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Peril if you go on in the ways of Sin, after ſuch loud Calls and fair Warnings. Now then, forſake the fooliſh and live; hearken to the Lord, that you may dwell ſafely, and be quiet from fear of Evil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.33.</p>
               <p>IN a word, <hi>LET us all be quicken'd to make ready for the Coming of our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE learn from this <hi>ſurpriſing Providence</hi> that we know not how ſuddenly our Lord may come to us <hi>by Death,</hi> and call us to appear before Him. Let us not then be at reſt till we can in ſome meaſure ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 21.13. <hi>I am ready to die.</hi> And who can tell how near the <hi>glorious Appearing</hi> of the SON OF GOD may be? <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are nam'd among the <hi>Signs</hi> of our <hi>Lord's Coming,</hi> Matth. 24.7.29, 30. <hi>Great Events</hi> have been attended with them; as our Saviour's <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> Matth. 27.51, 54. Upon which they ſaid, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God.</hi> His <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Matth. 28.2. And are we not directed to expect terrible <hi>Convulſions in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> before our Lord's <hi>ſecond Coming,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10, 12. And that it will be very ſudden and ſurpriſing to a ſecure World. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.36,—39. O let us then ſtand with our Loins girt, and Lamps burning, as they that wait for the Coming of the Lord! <hi>Let us be diligent that we may be found of our Judge in Peace, without ſpot &amp; blameleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now, <hi>LET us Cry to GOD to pour out his Spirit upon us,</hi> that we may Obey his Voice, and make an <hi>holy Improvement</hi> of this awful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
               <p>

THE moſt extraordinary Means will be ineffectual without GOD's Bleſſing communicated by his Spirit. And ſurely, <hi>It is time to ſeek the Lord, till he come and rain Righteouſneſs upon you,</hi> Hoſ. 10.12. We are undone without this; for we ſhall grow worſe and worſe under the moſt awakening Judgments, till we are ripe for Ruin. Let us then thirſt after this comprehenſive <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and ask it of our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> who is ready to beſtow it upon diligent Seekers, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. And let us offer up our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to GOD in the <hi>Name</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who hath received the <hi>Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> We read, Acts 4.31. <hi>When they had prayed the Place was ſhaken where they were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together: and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> O that this <hi>ſhaking</hi> we have felt might be follow'd with a plentiful Effuſion of the Spirit, to convince us of our many heinous Tranſgreſſions, to Convert &amp; Reform us! This wou'd take away the ground of the Controverſy, and give us good reaſon to expect all needed Salvation from the light of GOD's Countenance. Ezek. 39.29. <hi>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my ſpirit upon the Houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>USE, II. <hi>LET us bleſs GOD who hath not bro't upon us the Deſtruction we fear'd, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd us from going down to the Pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS amazing Judgment hath in a great meaſure deſtroy'd other <hi>populous Towns.</hi> They have ſunk under the weight of GOD's Anger, and been ſwallow'd up. When as we are ſhaken indeed and terrified; but without any great Damage. Let our Hearts then be deeply affected with this wonderful Deliverance, and our Mouths fill'd with the high Praiſes of the great GOD our Saviour. But let us not grow ſecure, as if the bitterneſs of Death was wholly paſt; for GOD can eaſily cauſe the Judgment to riſe up again, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002954_0026_0FE6A50190AB26A0"/>as an <hi>overſlowing Scourge</hi> that ſhall bear down all before it, and make the Land deſolate. O let not our Ingratitude under ſo diſtinguiſhing a Mercy, provoke Him; but let us render to the Lord accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Benefits.</p>
               <p>USE, III. <hi>LET ſuch as ſtand in Aw of GOD, Encourage themſelves in him, and hope in his Mercy.</hi> Pſal. 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy.</hi> You that dread GOD's diſpleaſure, and fly from Sin as the worſt of Evils, ſhou'd fear nothing with amazement; but ſhou'd have your <hi>hearts fixed truſting in the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 41.10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not diſmayed, for I am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> GOD is your <hi>Father;</hi> and your <hi>Redeemer</hi> is mighty, having all Power in Heaven &amp; Earth. Do you therefore receive and obey that Command, Joh. 14.1. <hi>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Truſt and Rejoice in CHRIST JESUS, who ſaves to the uttermoſt. Depend on his watchful powerful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who is the Head over all things to the Church. And then, Let your Hearts be in tune, to ſing the 46th Pſal. <hi>God is our refuge &amp; ſtrength, a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, tho' the earth be removed, and tho' the mountains be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the midſt of the ſea.</hi> For GOD will help you, and that right early. You that fear the Lord ſhou'd <hi>Truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon your God,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. Even in your darkeſt Hours; for he is a preſent help in Trouble. Thus you may Live in holy Security &amp; Peace, without being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with anxious Cares &amp; Fears, and may ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 4.8. <hi>I will both lay me down in peace, and ſleep: for thou Lord only makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi>
