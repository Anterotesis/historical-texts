            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVERY effort to ſupport and ſtrengthen the Chriſtian cauſe, to inculcate the amiable principles of virtue and morality, to diſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the glad tidings of ſalvation through a glorious Mediator, to impreſs upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and careleſs ſinner, ſenſations of the vaſt and inconceivably important realities of a judgment to come, and a never-ending eternity of happineſs or miſery.—Such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts deſerve the encouragement and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage of all good members of ſociety, all thoſe who are anxious to preſerve the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility and well-being of their country. For righteouſneſs will prove an impenetrable bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier in ſecuring the permanency of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whilſt every ſpecies of vice muſt tend to enervate, debilitate, and finally ſap the foundation of the wiſeſt conſtitution. For the Almighty will be a canopy and ſafeguard to his faithful ſervants.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:025427_0003_0FCCE3CE1EFA11A8"/>
UPON the candour of my readers, and my own conſcious rectitude, I muſt depend for the reception of this Publication: at leaſt I ſhall enjoy the inward ſatisfaction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing mercy mite, to rouſe mankind from their ſtupor, and promote the cauſe of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. And I can aſſure my readers that I am not inſtigated to this undertaking, by ſelfiſh motives; but am directed for the good of ſouls, and the glory of God. Should it in any degree anſwer the much deſired pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſhall be amply compenſated for my labors.</p>
            <p>GRANT, O thou inexhauſtible Fountain of all good, thy enlightning, enfluencing, all-prevailing grace, to make my pen like that of a ready writer; in awakening, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and converting thoſe, who have never participated of the ineffable riches of divine grace and pardoning love, which flow inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly from the right hand of the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Jeſus! O that I may experience that ſweet complacence and ſerenity—that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of perception—and that divine illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, from the immutable Source of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which are neceſſary for all thoſe who engage in thy ſervice! Suffer no faſcinating allurements of worldly objects to draw me aſide, or the ſeducing wiles of the devil to pervert my pen from the ſimplicity and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the unerring Word of Truth. O thou whoſe wiſdom never degenerates into craft, juſtice into ſeverity, or mercy into weakneſs!
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025427_0004_0FCCE3D041A1F030"/>
direct my mind in this undertaking! With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy bleſſing I can do nothing; every effort will be as the ſounding braſs or tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cymbal: but under the auſpecious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thy ſpirit, I truſt thy kingdom may be advanced—thy church militant more and more eſtabliſhed, and that many precious ſouls may taſte the pure, unſullied joys, that flow from thee! Grant this, for thy dear Son's ſake.</p>
            <p>I MUST beg leave to premiſe, that I ſhall ſedulouſly wave all diſputation on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points of Chriſtianity. It is far from my intentions to engage as a champion in the vindication of any jarring opinions of ſcholaſtic divinity; which perhaps is not worth the contention, or not at all neceſſary to ſalvation. Neither intrude upon the "ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſubtilties" of Deiſts: nor ſhall I perplex myſelf or readers, with the deep reſearches of metaphyſical diſquiſition. I ſhall ſubmit ſuch lucubrations to thoſe who are more pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating, or conſider them of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than myſelf: for I have long enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the opinion, that controverſies have a very pernicious effect; and are generally cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative of animoſity, envy, hatred, and the very paſſions that are the moſt unlike thoſe inculcated, by the meek and lowly Jeſus. Scripture expreſsly commandeth to avoid all vain contentions. How is it poſſible for Chriſtians, to reconcile that implacable ſpirit of bitterneſs and acrimony, with which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025427_0005_0FCCE3D11369A678"/>
are maintained? So high is the reſentment of the opponents ſometimes raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they catch with avidity at any clue, however weak or oppoſite to truth, to extend the controverſy, interlarded with ſcurrility and abuſe. And diſputants are generally predetermined not to acquieſce in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advanced againſt their own, however ſanctioned by truth, or guided by reaſon.—Diſputes ſow the ſeeds of hatred and malev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and finally terminate in open rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! And it is a lamentable fact, that good men ſometimes greatly err in this. Is it not devoutly to be wiſhed, that all jarring opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſſentions could forever ceaſe? And is it not fervently to be deſired, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Jeſus of every denomination, ſhould join together in an amicable league of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious love? Is not every Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to exclaim, "Accelerate O God, that glorious period, when peace, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, triumphant peace! ſhall reign on earth! when the kingdom of this world, ſhall become the kingdom of God and his Chriſt! and anti-chriſt no more be ſuffered to diffuſe his baneful ſeed." Are not all Chriſtians deſirous of attaining the ſame haven? Do not their deſires inſeparably centre there? Why then ſhould one ſay, "I am of Paul," another, "I am of Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los," ſince Jeſus Chriſt is all in all, and through his name alone can we be ſaved. Do we invariably obſerve his affectionate
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025427_0006_0FCCE41FD5CC5E38"/>
mandate, "Love one another?" Can we do this and at the ſame time foſter the worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of gall and bitterneſs in our boſoms?</p>
            <p>THERE was never perhaps a more gloomy ſeaſon, never a period more pregnant with calamities, and "big with death," in the city of Philadelphia, than the preſent. Her ſtreets are become deſolate, and the goodly proſpect, is quite reverſed! Was there ever a time that called with a more audible voice, for a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſincere and unreſerved reformation? The wrath of the Almighty ſeems inflamed againſt this City—his wrath impregnated with death!—His fiery indignation ſcatters terror around!—The light of his countenance is hidden from us—his long ſuffering patience is at length exhauſted—his mercies ſlighted—his goſpel deſpiſed! At length the ſword of his indignation, the ſharp two edged ſword of wrath is unſheathed. And his vindictive juſtice muſt be ſatisfied. His thunders arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with triple horror and vengeful fire, ſleep no more; but hang impending over our guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty heads, replete with mortality. "Yet the reed, the brittle reed, juſt ſinking, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to the Rock of ages!"</p>
            <p>I KNOW there are many who attribute this awful Contagion to natural cauſes, and ridicule the idea of a ſupernatural agent: but I conceive, we may clearly trace the finger of God in our chaſtiſement. Although his ways are a great deep to mortals, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dark and inſcrutable to finite intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025427_0007_0FCCE4215B76A3C0"/>
yet here his wonder-working wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is manifeſt, and thoſe who are diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and not wholly blinded by the god of this world, may behold omnipotent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance carried on.—Let any one of my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers lay his hand upon his heart, and aſk his conſcience if he has not contributed his ſhare in provoking the wrath of almighty God: if after an impartial examination he receives an acquital; I ſalute him as a thrice happy ſoul! and pronounce, that he need not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the approach of any peſtilential diſeaſe, however deadly, nor death itſelf with all its frightful apparatus!</p>
            <p>THE preſent afflicting ſeaſon moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly depicts, the amazing folly, and fatal deluſion of thoſe whoſe affections are inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately attached to the fluctuating, unſtable enjoyments of a vain world. Theſe ſolemn ſeens of mortality will lead us to reflect, that there is no permanency in any worldly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. How ſoon, alas! do all the guilded baubles vaniſh, (in which we have placed ſuch durable gratification) and leave nothing to ſatisfy the famiſhing ſoul! The earth and all the fulneſs thereof, with all the blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time and ſenſe, can never be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient value to attach the rational, immortal mind! This tranſitory ſtate can never bound its attainments, it ardently pants for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial joys of a kingdom <hi>whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi>

DEATH, is truly an all-eloquent preacher, it convinces powerfully, when all arguments have been wielded to no purpoſe—it points and ſays, "Be ye alſo ready!"—for in ſuch an hour as ye know not, the fatal arrow will receive its irreſiſtible mandate! Nay often attacks thoſe who are hugging themſelves, ſaying, "I will enjoy the fruits of my labor and lay up wealth for future grandeur—ſoul, ſoul, take thy reſt." Fatal ſecurity! fool!—to imagine thyſelf ſafe, when death is even now approaching towards thee with rapid ſtrides, like a "ſtaunch murderer, ſteady to his purpoſe:" and perhaps in a few hours all thy braggart hopes will be included in a mouldering coffin of inanimate clay:

            <p>THE expreſs declaration of inſpiration muſt convince every believer, that judgments are often inflicted upon rebellious and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying generations, as a chaſtiſement for their departure from him. If we turn to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred volume, we ſhall find this invariably the caſe, in God's dealings with the old world, whenever they apoſtatized, the ſcourges of his rod purſued them.—I do not expect to convince thoſe who ſacrilegiouſly deny the divine origin of the Scripture, of this ſacred truth: the power of omnipotence alone, will ſtrike conviction into obſtinate unbelieving ſouls; yet God is not a man that he ſhould change, he is the ſame immutably, perfect being, that he then was, and we are equally the objects of his care. Sin cauſed the utter diſtruction of the ante-deluvians. Their prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val rectitude was transformed, and they were immerſed in every ſpecies of licentiouſneſs, pride and corruption.

            <p>AH Sirs! ſuffer yourſelves no longer to be deceived by the god of this world.

            <p>PROPHANE ſwearing has of late ſhed its baneful contagion, in a moſt alarming degree in this city; notwithſtanding the moſt ſolemn and repeated prohibitions againſt ſuch a God-provoking ſin. "Swear not at all," ſays the inſpired penman: and again. "Take not the name of the Lord thy God in vain." Our ſtreets are replete with the moſt horrid imprecations of blaſphemies. The great, holy and immaculate name, which archangels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with the moſt profound veneration, is uſed upon the moſt vile and trifling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with all the attendant aggravations that a genius fertile in wickedneſs could invent. The moſt ridiculous tales receive the ſanction of numerous atteſtations of this kind. How ſhocking, how affrontive muſt this be to the Divine Majeſty of heaven? He who could with an inconſiderable exertion of omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025427_0014_0FCCE4A61B96A328"/>
cruſh the impious authors, and plunge them into the abyſs of eternal, never ending deſpair! How heart-rending muſt ſuch pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of degenerate mortality, be to the Chriſtian! How ſincerely muſt he lament over the fatal miſtakes and depravity of his fellow mortals? He retires under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of affliction to his cloſet, and with a torrent of commiſerating tears, exclaims in ſome ſuch language as this; Pity, heavenly Father, thoſe creatures who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo exceedingly ſinful and obnoxious to thee!—O turn them from ſuch awful profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy—picture their folly in all its odious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.—Turn, O turn them from eternal death! Lord thy children mourn inceſſantly for them—hear the united prayers of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and finally, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.—Swearers cannot have the leaſt ſhadow of vindication, to plead an extenuation of their wickedneſs. Some vices may afford a brutal pleaſure to gratify; but this ſin does not even admit of this poor palliation. No man is born of a ſwearing conſtitution, nor can it be of the leaſt conceivable advantage. What then is the wonderful inducement to it? what valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able end can the ſwearer propoſe to himſelf? It requires not the leaſt exertion of genius to make a perfect adept in this accompliſhment; and this is obvious that the moſt illiterate of mankind excel in ſwearing. It is pathetically to be lamented, that men of conſequence
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025427_0015_0FCCE4A7BB3800F0"/>
ſhould indulge themſelves in ſo pernicious and illiberal a practice. I am clearly of opinion, did ſuch perſons give themſelves the trouble of deliberating upon the probable termination of it, a regard for their country; mere political motives would effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rulers, from ſetting ſo deſtructive a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent before the governed. It muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tend to invalidate the validity of oaths, upon which in a great meaſure depends the firmneſs of the conſtitution. This naturally aſſiſts in the introduction of perjury; from which crimes of the moſt enormous magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude naturally flow. But what ſhall I ſay to the fluttering, giddy herd of profligates and libertines, on this head? What effect can I hope to have on ſuch who ſeldom peruſe any books, excluſive of plays, romances, &amp;c. who would conſider it an intolerable piece of drudgery, at being compelled to read a <hi>dull performance</hi> on Chriſtianity. With gilded plumage, an audacious effrontery of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and a well-timed oath (as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it,) they impoſe upon the undiſcerning and illiterate, as perſons of profound impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and as a proper pattern for imitation: when alas! they are rendering themſelves obnoxious to the diſpleaſure of their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father. Their wiſdom is at beſt but low cunning, for they degrade themſelves by vices, unworthy the character of Chriſtians, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the image they ought repreſent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of men. Strip ſuch mortals of their

borrowed plumes, their bluſhing honors—inveſtigate them through a right medium, and they will appear objects of pity rather than envy: "For a follower of Jeſus ſhould view vice with deteſtation, whilſt he looks upon the vicious, with the tenderneſs of a pitying angel."<note n="*" place="bottom">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>SWEARING then, can be uſed for no other purpoſe than to ſhow a brutal courage, in greatly daring to diſobey the Lord of glory, and defy his power; in fighting againſt the ſupreme majeſty of heaven, and ſpeaking more irreverently of the King of kings, than they dare of a petty prince. Is it not a very alarming preſage of a ſtill greater judgment, when children are heard liſping out oaths before they can ſpeak intelligibly! when <hi>comparative</hi> infants make the ſtreets reſound with oaths and execrations? This would alone, convince us of our depravity and wickedneſs; and that this is ſtrictly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with veracity, all who have the organs of hearing will jointly bear teſtimony.

            <p>THE violation of the Sabbath is another flagrant and glaring offence, againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and his expreſs command; "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath to keep it holy." It is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025427_0018_0FCCE4AD440CE938"/>
notorious and needs no confirmation, that the holy day is perverted by many, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted for anſwering the moſt unjuſtifiable purpoſes. Elſe, whence ſo much viſiting, unneceſſary rambling (not to mention great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enormities) on this ſacred day! Do not the ways of Zion mourn for this? Are not the attibutes of the Deity ſhamefully and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently treated by this practice? And is not God incenſed at the violation of ſo plain and declarative a commandment? Are not public houſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Taverns, tippling houſes, &amp;c.</note> filled with idlers on this day? Does not inebriety and intoxication frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceed; and then all kinds of execrations reverberate from unhallowed lips? And more ſhameful ſtill, the ſacred day is ſometimes employed in rattling the dice, or "detaching and arranging painted paſte-boards." Ah Sirs! you are ſporting on a tremendous precipice, which may daſh you and all your full-blown hopes on the rock of never never ending diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and woe! Ye are voluntarily diſpoſing of your eternal all, for momentary deluſive gratifications, for gay viſionary dreams of pleaſure. That mandate of devoting one day in ſeven to reſt and devotion, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reaſonable as well as neceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. It is a truly benevolent ordination, and worthy the ſapience of the divine author. And how ungrateful is it to repine at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, ſo juſt and good in itſelf? How
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025427_0019_0FCCE4AED0BE25E8"/>
exceedingly culpable are thoſe, who treat it with indifference.</p>
            <p>O LET me conjure you to ſtrive to avert the preſent and future judgments, by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den reformation in hallowing and keeping holy this day. Do not vainly imagine that God will hold you guiltleſs if, in defiance to this, his moſt reaſonable mandate, you know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tranſgreſs the Sabbath of the Lord. Alas! if you neglect this admonition, the time ſwiftly approaches, when you would give worlds to purchaſe the probationary term of a few Sabbaths. When you ſtand upon the verge of death; when conviction has ſeized you, and your deplorable ſituation puts on the moſt affrightful aſpect. Every reflection at this dreadful period will tend to aggravate your woe—not the leaſt glimpſe of hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains—horrible amazement, and wild deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair glares around—O how you execrate your folly for miſpending your invaluable time—diſregarding Sabbaths, and ſpurning at Chriſtianity. Alas! all this can avail nothing.</p>
            <p>O THEN for God's ſake, and for your own ſakes, for the time to come, hallow the Sabbath-day. Let your penitential tears aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the throne of purity, acceptable and well pleaſing ſacrifices—Earneſtly intreat your heavenly Father that he would ſtop the growing ſin of Sabbath breaking. Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional exerciſes on this holy day, will be attended with the divine bleſſing—and the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025427_0020_0FCCE4B003130C60"/>
ſpirit of all grace will animate thoſe who conſcientiouſly practice prayer, thankſgiving and praiſe on this day.</p>
            <p>FAMILY prayer is a duty incumbent upon all who are parents, maſters or guardians over families. What is deprecated upon prayerleſs communities? <hi>Pour out thy wrath upon thoſe families who call not upon my name.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. x. 25.</note> And yet this great duty is ſhamefully neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and frequently treated with contempt and ridicule. And when it is performed at all, have we not cauſe to lament of the cold and inanimate manner which attends it? Where ſhall we obſerve that propriety, that decency of behaviour which is requiſite on ſuch occaſions? Is it not greatly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that the whole mind is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely engroſſed by heavenly aſpirations? and that worldly objects have too great a ſhare in the affections? To a conſiderate mind, prayer ought to be eſteemed the moſt inval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable privilege, that mortals can enjoy: by this ſweet intercourſe, a vital communion is maintained between God and the ſoul—O how precious are ſuch ſeaſons! how is the whole ſoul drawn out towards the fountain of grace. We are admitted by prayer into his preſence, and participate of his pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and condeſcending goodneſs. By prayer we riſe toward perfection, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more inſeparably connected to our
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025427_0021_0FCCE4B2F7752C90"/>
heavenly Father. I am perſuaded, that by this means we attain to what Mr. Addiſon beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſpeaks of—"There is not in my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, a more pleaſing and triumphant conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration in religion, than this, of the perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual progreſs which the ſoul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at a period." This noble attainment is gained by prayer.—Suppoſing an earthly monarch to iſſue a proclamation throughout his dominions, that on a day appointed his ſubjects ſhould aſſemble around his throne, and whatſoever demands they would make, he promiſed to grant. If at the day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they univerſally appear, and inſtead of making known there requeſts, they fall aſleep in his preſence—would not his majeſty be highly offended and puniſh their neglect? How much more then our heavenly Father, who is willing to beſtow ſuch unſpeakably precious gifts. Nothing then can excuſe any perſon from joining in the exerciſe of public or private prayer.</p>
            <p>How beautiful it is, when houſes are made vocal with the grateful incenſe of prayer and praiſe! How ſweetly are the devout aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſincere heart wafted on the ſilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wings of the dove, to the holy of holies; and return with tenfold bleſſings, like the fructifying moiſture of the ſpring, on the petitioners head! he receives the anticipation and foretaſte of the joys of heaven—the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant glory of the cherubim, ſeraphim, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025427_0022_0FCCE4B45A9177C8"/>
all the celeſtial choir of beatific ſpirits, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with unſullied robes of pureſt white to his rapt imagination! they inraptured touch their golden harps, and the trembling muſic floats around—The Chriſtian beholds in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the face of the LAMB!—"He ſees the diſplay of paradiſiacal innocence, the lofty, the reſplendant traces of the ſon of GOD! This fills him with ſilent extacy, he is too highly bleſſed to be affraid of man: elevated by a flaming ardor, his eye is ſerene, filled with the irreſiſtible fire of awful virtue." Thus Chriſtians ſometimes enjoy communion with GOD, which is better felt than deſcribed.</p>
            <p>PRIDE is a ſin fearfully prevailing among us at this period. Its pernicious and diſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tendency is ſufficiently realized, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all. All agree in decrying the turpitude of it; and ſometimes the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant repudiate it with a greater degree of inveterancy than the really humble of heart. The devil makes uſe of pride as the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of our undoing. Every precaution is neceſſary to conquer this truly formidable enemy. <hi>Be not high minded, but fear,</hi> ſays the apoſtle. We ought to keep a ſtrict cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinal, in order to guard every avenue of the human heart, and repulſe the faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating enemy, oppoſing force to force. Its baneful influence infuſes itſelf into every faculty of the ſoul, and rankles in each vein.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vulnus alit venis et coeco carpiter igni. VIRG.</note>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:025427_0023_0FCCE4B6C3C4DBE8"/>
A writer obſerves, "That pride is a rank weed, and generally takes root in a barren ſoil." From this paſſion naturally flows many other hateful and diſcordant vices, degrading to the rational nature, and diſhonoring to the Deity. It impels the mind to graſp at unwarrantable attainments, and produces an unceaſing ſolicitude.</p>

               <l>
                  <hi>Pride ſtill is aiming at the bleſt abodes,</hi>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>To define pride in all its different poſitions, windings and eccentricities, is perhaps a taſk impoſſible to be performed. It operates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely different in different perſons; and ſometimes rankles at the heart of apparent humility. Shall we continue to foſter a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in our boſoms, that thief like infixes its barbed ſtings into our hearts, and by poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning the fountain, renders the ſtreams nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious and impure? Is not pride its own ceaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs tormentor? The pomp and ſpledour of the great, excites this paſſion. We ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with ambitious and aſpiring hope. "The glowing pencil of fancy, dipt in her own creative ideas," pictures to the mind perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net happineſs in deluſive, vaniſhing trifles!</p>
            <p>Do the ſcenes at this period continually exhibited before us, furniſh matter for pride and oſtentation? Do charnel houſes and graves inſpire that mad principle? Does the gauzy mantle of death excite your arrogance? Do Cypreſs weeds, and mournful funeral
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025427_0024_0FCCE4B82E9195C8"/>
obſequies ſerve to inflame your ambition! Do not ſuch diſtreſſing ſcenes rather level your pride proſtrate with the duſt? and awaken your whole ſouls in anxious ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for your ſafety? If neither the long ſuffering goodneſs of God, nor his fierce judgments have any effect—think for once, you hear your deceaſed friends and relations who have departed before you, addreſſing you form their everlaſting habitations: "Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, prepare for eternity, ye frail ſhort-lived mortals—ye dear neighborers to the world of ſpirits—ye borderers on heaven and hell, <hi>make ready—</hi> looſen your hearts from earth, and all that it contains—weigh anchor, and prepare to launch into the boundleſs ocean of eternity, which is now within your ken, and roars within your hearing!"</p>
            <p>THE pride of man revolts at the humiliat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine of the croſs. Proud aſſuming man, immediately takes the alarm when a crucified, deſpiſed "Jeſus of Nazareth," is held up as a proper example for their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They flee <hi>from the Rock of ſafety,</hi> to the contaminated garments of their own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteouſneſs. They thus hang uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of danger, over a tremendous gulf, ſuſpended by a ſcarce percepible thread!—Perhaps the pride of the human heart, cannot be exerted in any point of vice, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to itſelf, than in this dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, of all that is ſalutary to the ſoul.

Thus "The empty pageant of a day fondly rolls along;" exulting in his boaſted ſtrength and ſelf-ſufficiency: he beſtows not a thought on futurity, and rides on fortunes paſſing gale in triumph.

This is the peculiar prerogative of divine illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it excites to charity, and diffuſes philanthropy—vain and worſe than vain, are all pretentions to Chriſtianity without this, which is the eſſence, the foundation of all religion. Religion was founded upon love—and ſo far as we act according to this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful principle, ſo much the nearer reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance we obtain to the Founder of ſalvation.

What avail our prayers, our pompous profeſſions, or our bearing the name of Chriſt, if we ſend the hungry from our doors, refuſe to comfort and relieve the naked traveller, and turn a deaf ear to the cries of the widow and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs—Ah Sirs! whoever you are, think not that you are Chriſtians, not attending to a duty, without which, you are worſe than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.

grace never gives the ſpirit of perſecution or uncharitableneſs—it is meekneſs, love, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and every ſocial virtue; whilſt unenlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by a divine ſpark, from the Rock of ages, the ſoul is immured in a baneful priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but touched with a coal from the ſacred altar, all nature changes its appearance; like a bird which having eſcaped from its priſon, conſcious of having regained its liberty, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers aloft, and joyous ſkims through the cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air—ſo the human ſoul when illuminated by the Spirit of grace.</p>
            <p>THE neceſſity of regeneration or a change from above, is abundantly evident from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as from revelation. A knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of our evil and corrupt hearts ought to convince us of this—yet alas! unleſs awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by an inviſible agency, we ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a maze of darkneſs. "Not all the angels in heaven, nor the doctors on earth, can convince us of this, till Chriſt ſhall be pleaſed to convince us that we are poor, frail, erring, vile and deſpicable creatures; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to innumerable lapſes and infirmities; ſickneſs, paſſions and croſſes; griefs, agonies and death—When this is effectually done, the whole of the buſineſs is done—We ſhall call for and catch at a Saviour, in the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our want of him. When we come thus ladened with our ſins to him, he will in no wiſe caſt us out; but he will take us as Noah took the wearied dove into the ark; he will receive us within the vale of his own

            <p>THE Almighty has been pleaſed to extend his afflicting arm over this city: yet he hath ſcourged us for our good. His chaſtiſements are like that of a father to a beloved ſon, in order to reclaim, and turn him from the broad way of deſtruction. For though he cauſeth ſorrow, yet he will have compaſſion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the multitude of his tender mercies. Our crimes had provoked him, and he ſent forth his miniſters of wrath. We ſaw his correction—we beheld his frowns, and we ought to acknowledge his ſuperintending care, with fear and trembling. Our God cannot rejoice in the ſufferings of mortals, and he would not have created this life a vale of tears, were it not abſolutely requiſite that mortality ſhould endure temporary evil, in order to be conducted into that world of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing joy, where God will wipe all tears from our eyes. Therefore, God ſaw and commiſerated our fallen, miſerable ſtate; he beheld, and by a kindly reverſe, determined to turn all the evils of corrupt and fallen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to our endleſs benefit, and everduring felicity. He therefore in compaſſion for us, inſtituted diſeaſe, pain, affliction, diſtreſs and judgments, as monitors and miniſters to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our convictions of the depravity of our natures, and abſolute need of a Saviour. This is the great end to be accompliſhed, and if we are ſo happy as to be warned by this

The bright Morning-Sar, the Lamb of God, ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, will (upon our ſincere repentance) be our portion forever. Then when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

FAITHFUL and perſevering Chriſtians are truly an ornament of ſociety—they put forth the luſtre of the Chriſtian religion, and ſhine more conſpicuous in a time of danger, and an hour of darkneſs—they prove the ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of their profeſſions, by their boldly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in their Maſters ſervice—and enduring all things to render themſelves more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the image of their divine Maſter, who had not a place to lay his head. I ſhould injure my own feelings ſhould I neglect this opportunity, of publicly expreſſing my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the conduct of the Rev. Mr. Pilmore, through the whole courſe of the alarming contagion in this city. That intrepid fortitude and unvarying perſeverance, which has ſo highly diſtinguiſhed him, merits our reſpect and gratitude. His affectionate, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and pathetic addreſſes from the deſk, clearly evinces his concern for precious ſouls, and his reſignation to the Divine will. Ever attentive to his abundant labors in the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, his activity and his extenſive abilities, renders him a laborer that needs not to be aſhamed. The envenomed tongue of envy and malevolence muſt ſhortly lie dumb and acknowledge the attractions of ſuperior vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and religion.</p>
            <p>PERSONS who have peculiarly felt the weight of the diſtreſſing ſeaſon, by ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting bereavement; are thrice miſerable if they are not brought to reflect ſeriouſly upon their own exit. For this purpoſe did God in

his love afflict you. Perhaps your affections were inordinately attached to your deceaſed relatives—it is poſſible that your God was neglected on the account. Now if you made the right application, two moſt important ends would be anſwered: that of detaching your thoughts from the creature, and directing them to the Creator, God bleſſed forever more! And by exhibiting mortality before you in the image of death, ſhows you as in a mirror, that you alſo are mortal, and muſt ſhortly follow. Again, the Almighty wounds but to heal more effectually, more ſavingly; and when you ſeem ſhrouded in a cloud of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable darkneſs, and encompaſſed about with many ſorrows, when all nature wears a lowring aſpect, and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſeems hid from you; he is then work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater things for you than you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: in ſhort, he is preparing a crown of immortal glory for you. He is not more merciful in his favous than his puniſhments. Since it is evident that proſperity renders us fargetful of our benefactor; and adverſity, by pointing out the inſtability of all created enjoyments: forces us to ſeek for more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent poſſeſſions in the embraces of the great Bridegroom.

            <p>THE late lamented and revered Licius and his amiable conſort, long dived in connubial felicity, far tranſcending the lot commonly aſſigned to humanity. The ſoul of Licius was harmony—with the moſt amiable and tender ſenſibility, and formed highly ſuſcept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible of tender and ennobling emotions. He was remarked, and eſtimated for his probity, undiſtinguiſhed honeſty, and undiſſembled ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. Taught by his divine Maſter, he looked upon the great family of mankind with love, and exerciſed his talents in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, and aiding the indigent and diſtreſſed. His chief happineſs however conſiſted in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, innocent amuſements. He loved his wiſe with the moſt ardent, though temperate paſſion; that is, his regards were not tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ounding profeſſions, but reduced to a calm and unruffled ſunſhine. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his affection, and nothing appeared wanting for the completion of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on earth. Yet alas! vain, unſtable, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſtate of tranſitory things! how ſhort, and how uncertain are all created enjoyments! His avocations called him to a diſtant part of the continent; and he left his family after recommending them to the protection of their heavenly Father. Immediately after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the peſtilential contagion made its appearance in the city. Licius received ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the deadly malady; he prayed fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025427_0033_0FCCE50497FB0DA8"/>
for the preſervation of his partner and little ones; and left them in the hands of him who formed their mortal bodies. He how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, accelerates his return, and with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of hope and fear; as he advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his habitation, he heard the ſound of mourning and lamentation. And upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the door, was met by a coffin and mourners—His daughter was no more—the prevailing contagion had cut her off, in the bloom of youth! He ſupported this sight with the fortitude that becomes a Chriſtian; and hurried to ſee if his ſtill dearer Naomi was ſafe—he haſtened to her apartment; when, O heart-rending idea, the dear part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his life was laid upon her bed, pale and breathleſs—a lump of inanimate clay! Such a trial was for a moment too much for his gentle nature—his fortitude forſook him—his knees trembled beneath him—a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like paleneſs overſpread his countenance, and he fell almoſt deprived of all ſenſation upon the floor—On recovering, the tears invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily ſtreamed from his eyes, and his heart was rent with diſtreſſing convulſions—he cried out, ſhe is gone!—the dear ſoother of my ſorrows is gone!—never—never—more to return. Why, O why was life ſo pleaſant, ſo delectable to me—it plunges me ſtill deeper into exquiſite miſery! Yet what ſhall I ſay? forgive, O Father in heaven, forgive the repinings of thy poor afflicted ſervant—I will no more murmur, no more
