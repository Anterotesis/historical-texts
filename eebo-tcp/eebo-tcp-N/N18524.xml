            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THOUGH the Author has been often induced to exhibit his Productions to the publick view, he conſidered the infirmities of the Seventy-ſeventh year of his age, a ſufficient bar to any attempt of that kind in future; but after the People of this Town, in a manner very unuſual in ſuch caſe, appeared quite unanimous in taking down the old meeting houſe, fixing the ſpot for the new one, and finiſhing it in an elegant manner: The Undertakers, Committees, and Artificers, deſired him to deliver a Diſcourſe at the Dedication of it. And then were urgent for a Copy of the Sermon for Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And conſidering the ſeveral ſingularities of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence in the whole affair, ſuch as the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of the Town, in an affair, uſually attended with diviſion: the notable patronage of divine Providence through the perilous operations, in preſerving every Perſon from harm; and the urgency of the gentlemen abovementioned, he ſubmitted, relying on publick candor, and the allſufficient favour and bleſſing of God, to ſerve ſome divine purpoſe, by theſe feeble efforts.—<hi>AMEN.</hi>

                  <p>Put off thy ſhoes from thy feet, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy ground.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE divine nature is the original, and only perfect ſample of all holineſs. Every thing therefore named holy, under God, gets that ſtile, from ſome likeneſs or relation to God. It may now be aſked; but what likeneſs or relation, can be between a piece of ground, or any other material ſubſtance, and a <hi>Spirit; immortal Being; the eternal mind?</hi> I anſwer, juſt the ſame, as gave reaſon to the well known expreſſions, in the old ſtate of the church; viz: <hi>Holy Garments, holy oil, holy mountain,</hi> and as in our text, <hi>holy ground.</hi> Now there can be no degree of likeneſs in nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween any of theſe material ſubſtances, and the holy God. But a relative connection with him, there certainly was, for he ordered them to be made, appointed their uſe, and they were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actually uſed, and in the greateſt affair that ever took place in any world, viz: Serving eternal councels in the ſalvation of men. Conſequently, in mere relative holineſs, no virtue or property is communicated, to give reaſon for the predicate, holy, to be fixed to any material ſubſtance. There can be no holineſs in it. What therefore God has ſtiled holy, is to be held ſuch for that reaſon,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024034_0005_0FC2EC50766C6B38"/>
without thinking of any thing in its <hi>nature</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that predicate.</p>
            <p>There are two means by which this relative holineſs takes place. 1ſt. When God expreſsly preſcribes it, as Exod. xxix. 33. "<hi>A ſtranger ſhall not eat things conſecrated becauſe they are holy.</hi>" So 37th verſe, "<hi>The Altar is moſt holy, and whatſoever toucheth it ſhall be holy.</hi>" Alſo the anointing oil; and all the utenſils of the Temple, worſhip, and ſacrifices, were made holy by the ſame mean.</p>
            <p>2nd. Another mean of this relative holineſs, was poſſeſſion, and uſe by God himſelf, or his ſpecial order, ſo the cenſers which the two hundred and fifty men in Korah's rebellion, had uſed by ſpecial order, were put into golden plates to cover the altar, and never more to be uſed as cenſers, becauſe they were holy, Num. xvi. 38. So Exod. 111 5. When God poſſeſt and uſed the burning buſh, and Moſes was approaching to ſee the ſight, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him, becauſe the place was holy; i. e. was already poſſeſt and uſed by God himſelf. So when Jeſus Chriſt appeared to Joſhua before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico; he had Joſhua put off his ſhoe, for the place was holy, being already poſſeſt and occupied by divine majeſty. Joſh. v. 15. But that cauſe being removed, that effect muſt ceaſe.</p>
            <p>It may be aſked, how was putting off the ſhoe an acknowledgement of holy ground? This muſt be anſwered both litterally and miſtically.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Litterally. Being barefooted was badge of a ſervant; a token of being always ready to run and ſerve. Therefore the evidence of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail's conſent to be David's wife was, 1. Sam. xxv. 41. That ſhe would be devoted to waſh the feet of David's ſervants: which being bare as ſervants, were expoſed to need waſhing. And to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhoes, was a type of readineſs to ſerve God; which was eſpcially neceſſary, when the divine majeſty was viſibly preſent. But when this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024034_0006_0FC2EC525DF63638"/>
preſence was withdrawn, there was no more reaſon for this practical reſpect, than in all times and places.</p>
            <p>And ſo putting off the ſhoe in the viſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, was in practical reverence of his holy majeſty. A ſign of ſubmiſſion to him; and of readineſs to do all his pleaſure. It was alſo a token of humiliation and mourning for ſin. For this reaſon David went up mount Olivet bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, in flying from his ſon Abſolom. 2. Sam. xv. 30. And to ſhew that the temper of mind pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured hereby, becomes us, in the divine preſence, as well as in all humbling circumſtances, this ſpeaking ſignal was enjoined.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may underſtand the miſtick deſign of this type, we muſt know</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the feet are a type of affections: For as the body moves by the feet, ſo does the mind by the affections. This therefore gives light in Eccleſ. v. 1. "<hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God.</hi>" For if not you offer there, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Fools; i. e. a ſacrifice, which has not your affection, love and delight in it, becauſe theſe were placed on other objects, when you came there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As our feet are placed on that which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports our bodies, ſo our hearts reſt and ſtand, on that which is the object of the affections. And as the ſhoe is between the foot and its foundation, ſo it obſtructs and hinders the foot from coming to that foundation. Juſt ſo every wrong object of affection interpoſes and hinders the mind from coming to God, truſting in Chriſt, and his word, as it ought; and as it muſt, in order to ſtand firm by faith. Therefore all ſuch wrong objects of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or mental attachment, whether among outward things, or inward diſpoſitions, as intercept and hinder the concurrence and compliance of the heart with holy matters, are called ſhoes, and are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024034_0007_0FC2EC5D0ED3B720"/>
forbidden. God commands us to put them off. And unleſs we do ſo, the heart can never approach to God, or comfortably enjoy him. So that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this command's being a ſenſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning thing, 'tis the ſummary of all practical holy religion; and quite eſſential to the life of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and all true chriſtian experience.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, as ancient types looked to Chriſt and his kingdom which is come and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſo tipical holineſs antiquated; why do we retain the ſtile of <hi>holy</hi> hill, in ſeveral inſtances. As in caſe of the Sabbath, Bible, Ordinances, &amp;c. The firſt of theſe only, ſhall be attended to.</p>
            <p>The holineſs, or morality of the Sabbath, and our bonds to its religious obſervance may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the following manner, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the only being of perfect reaſon, and righteouſneſs, had perfect reaſon for following his own judgment in every point; and has made us know that he did ſo, in inſtituting the Sabbath; then there was perfect reaſon for the inſtitution; &amp; then we are under juſt ſuch bonds to obſerve it. Nothing but Atheiſm can evade this argument. For we are told Exod. xx. 9. "Six days ſhalt thou labour," &amp;c. Giving us divine liberty for our own employments, on all theſe days, that he might with more perfect reaſon, reſerve the following monument for himſelf, viz. "<hi>But the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi>" He did not ſay it <hi>ſhall be</hi> the Sabbath hereafter; but <hi>it is now,</hi> already the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. But if this declaration was quite right, then the Sabbath had its foundation in the nature and reaſon of things; for by this declaration it had perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, before God ſpoke a word about it. And ſo it follows. 11th vr. "wherefore" or for which reaſon, "God bleſſed," the <hi>ſabatiſm,</hi> for ſo it is is in the original, i. e. confirmed it, and connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bleſſings with it, for all its faithful obſervers.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024034_0008_0FC2EC610D2B9118"/>
Thoſe bleſſings were not connected with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, (tho' God reſted or ſabbatized on that day) but with the ſabbatiſm itſelf. For God never deſigned that day of the week ſhould always be the time for ſabbatizing; For he knew that Jeſus Chriſt would come, and would be Lord of the ſabbatiſm, and would diſpoſe of it as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he did ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the only perfect being is our ſafe pattern, and perfect example, ſo we are bound to obey that divine commandment, Eph. v. 1. "<hi>Be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God, as dear children.</hi>" The inſpired word is <hi>Mimetai,</hi> which ſignifies to imitate, or mimick; but we cant do ſo in this caſe, without keeping holy the Sabbath day, for he did ſo. He reſted on the Sabbath, bleſſed and hollowed it. And 'tis impoſſible to ſupport the character, or enjoy the peace, of dear children of God, without imitating him, in this important caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would now give you a third reaſon for ſanctifying the Sabbath, which avails much more for the chriſtian Sabbath, than for that of the Jews. But a few ſentiments are neceſſary to introduce it. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sabbath</hi> was always deſigned to memorialize and commemorate, the greateſt work which God had been know to accompliſh, as Exod. xx. 10.11. Where God's <hi>making the world,</hi> is the reaſon for ſabbatizing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt was the creator of the world. Jon. i. 1. In the beginning was the word, and the word was God, all things were created by him. And Heb. i. 2. "<hi>He made the worlds</hi>;" Yea "<hi>all things viſible and inviſſible.</hi>" Col. i. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As creation was then the greateſt work, God had been known to do, ſo the firſt, or Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was in memory of that, as the greateſt work of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But redemption, wrought by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024034_0009_0FC2EC68A913C328"/>
agent, was infinitely greater work than creation, creation was the ſtage on which redemption was to be wrought; it was made for that very purpoſe. No oppoſition was made to creation; but redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was oppoſed by earth and hell, and yet was accompliſhed. No death was neceſſary in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the moſt terrible death that ever was, was neceſſary to accompliſh redemption. Creation was made for bodies, and natural life; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for ſouls, and eternal life. So it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that redemption was an infinitely greater, &amp; more important work than creation. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the divine agent of both, knowing when redemption was finiſhed in his reſurrection, the reaſon of the firſt Sabbath ceaſed; becauſe now an infinitely greater divine work was to be memorialized by ſabbatizing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his redeeming work, through the ſeventh day, Sabbath, and reſted from his work, and ſo ſabbatized on the firſt day of the week, Mat. xxviii 1.6. 1. Cor. xv. 4. Heb. iv. 9.10.</p>
            <p>And ſo the doctrine is eſtabliſhed, that there is infinitely greater reaſon for the chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, than ever was for that of the Jews. And this is ſo far from fixing changeableneſs on the inſtitutor; that it gives evidence of his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs. He always deſigned the Sabbath to be a memorial of the greateſt work of God; and now as a greater work of God has taken place, than that of creation, he fixed the memorial of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ceaſed, or reſted from his work, i. e. ſabbatized on the firſt day of the week, himſelf: thereby ſetting the ſame example for his followers, as he did in the beginning on the ſeventh day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He practically taught his diſciples to tread in his ſteps. Jon. xx. 19. For when the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were aſſembled, on the firſt day of the week; he joined them, and inſtead of reproving them,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024034_0010_0FC2EC6A82F21EB0"/>
encouraged them, in the higheſt manner, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a Sabbath's bleſſing on them, in theſe moſt encouraging and comfortable words; "<hi>Peace be unto you.</hi>" Implying all bleſſings, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual ones, (for peace is ſuch) are for you, on this day, as Sabbath; and in this practice of ſanctifying it. And becauſe it was a point of great importance, Luke alſo atteſts it. Luke xxiv. 33.36. And again the next Sabbath, or firſt day of the week, Jeſus to confirm them in this practice, met with them again and bleſſed them. See Jon. xx. 26, And the inſpired apoſtle confirms it, by directing the Corinthean Church to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for publick contributions on the firſt day of the week, as the ſtated time of their publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. 1. Cor. xvi. 2. And to encourage them in it, tells them, he had ordered the Churches of Galatia to do the ſame on that day. And for this reaſon the firſt day of the week was ſtiled em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically the day when diſciples come together to break bread. Act. xx. 7. And there is not one word in the Bible about chriſtians obſerving any but the firſt day of the week, as Sabbath, ever ſince. And doubtleſs this was meant when Chriſt is called <hi>Lord</hi> of the Sabbath day. Mark, ii. 28. And ſo it appears that the Sabbath is connected with the firſt day of the week, by ſpecial inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſting in the expreſs word, &amp; actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Jeſus Chriſt, who is Lord of all.</p>
            <p>Therefore though the ſabbatiſm was movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from one day to another, it is in itſelf unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and of courſe, the ſtile <hi>holy,</hi> belongs to it juſt as it did originally. Exod. xvi. 23. Neh. ix. 14.</p>
            <p>As to other ſubjects of the predicate <hi>holy,</hi> ſuch Bible, Ordinances, and worſhip, ſince I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of the uſe of my hand in writing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great mercy of God to us in general, in giving us light and underſtanding enough to acknowledge their <hi>holineſs,</hi> I ſhall only add; that
<pb facs="unknown:024034_0011_0FC2EC6CD38D0140"/>
no portion of meer matter can have holineſs in its nature. The <hi>Bible, Elements,</hi> in the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c. are holy by ſpecial divine order, and by their divine import. God had alſo once a houſe of worſhip, ſtiled <hi>holy,</hi> &amp; Jeſus Chriſt gives us the reaſon, becauſe it was a type and picture of his body, Jon. ii. 19.21. It was alſo a type and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Church, the collective body of his <hi>holy ones.</hi> For of them he ſays, 11. Cor. vi. 16. "<hi>Ye are the temple of the living God.</hi>" And 1. Tim. iii. 15. he ſays, "<hi>The church of God, is the houſe of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</hi>"</p>
            <p>That houſe therefore was holy by ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine order, and by its tipical import. But there has been no houſe in the world, entitled to the ſtile of <hi>holy,</hi> ſince Jeſus Chriſt aſcended to Heaven. And of courſe, 'tis owing to ignorance, bigotry, &amp; ſuperſtition, that a houſe for chriſtian worſhip, is ever ſtiled <hi>holy, houſe of God, holy place</hi>; and ſuch like. A houſe for chriſtian worſhip, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip in any place, is to be attended in a a very holy manner. The object, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are <hi>holy.</hi> The heart of the ſubject ought to be holy; anſwerable to the employment.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to make ſome remarks on the premiſes. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have ſeen that there can be no holineſs in mere matter. Objection, Our bodies are mere matter; and yet the apoſtle implies, that <hi>our bodies muſt be made holy.</hi> 1. Theſſ. v. 23.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Our bodies are holy, when they are devoted to divine ſervice, and in practice are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the laws of holineſs in the Bible, and to a principle of holineſs in the heart. But this implies no holy property in the matter of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. If mere matter can't love God, which is the principle of holineſs; 'tis impoſſible it ſhould have holineſs in its nature.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen alſo that the Sabbath is fixed to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024034_0012_0FC2EC6FB5AD9B90"/>
the firſt day of the weak, by Jeſus Chriſt the Lord: and we all know, that a primary object in building, and furniſhing this houſe, is to ſerve the appointed uſes of that holy Sabbath. And that for thoſe purpoſes ſpecially, it is ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated this day. If we believe theſe things, and have any religious, or only rational notions of them; we ſhall never enter this houſe, for any of thoſe moſt ſacred purpoſes, with malignity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in our hearts; or with the air, or ſpirit of levity. This is not a vulgar houſe; nor made &amp; furniſhed for vulgar uſes. The deſign of it is to be a convenient place for the ſervice of God. Let every perſon who enters it profeſſedly for that purpoſe, remember God is preſent in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of his people; and that his eye is on their heart; and he will make them eat the fruit of their own ways; and fill them with their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. He will be ſanctified in them that come near him. Lev. x. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then our firſt buſineſs in all approaches to God, is to put off every myſtick ſhoe. 'Tis moſt dangerous to ruſh into the worſhip and ſervice of God, with heart and affections muffled, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and embarraſſed, with myſtick ſhoes. Remember this is the firſt thing he ſees about us when we approach his preſence; for he looks at the heart. Jer. xx. 12. And is much diſpleaſed with the heart that inwardly departs from the living God. 'Tis mockery to draw near to God, with a falſe treacherous heart. We ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remember when we enter this houſe, for the ſervice of God, it muſt be with hearts and affections quite barefooted. Otherwiſe we are in danger of his wrath every moment. The ſight of this place of worſhip, ſhould bring the thoughts to view.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Divers circumſtances require ſuch ſolemn regard, in all our improvements of this houſe. As</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:024034_0013_0FC2EC74F1788530"/>1. There have been ſpecial Tokens of divine patronage towards this town, reſpecting their place of public worſhip, for ſeveral years paſt. Men are apt to be jealous for ſuppoſed rights, and contentious, if they are invaded. Yet a majority of this town, who were not accommodated in the place of worſhip, it being a mile from a proper centre; endured that exceſs of travel for ten years, in peaceable compliance with the minority. And if but one hundred perſons did ſo; then in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and returning, they endured two hundred miles travail every Sabbath day. And as there are fifty two Sabbaths in a year this exceſs of travail on Sabbaths only, is ten thouſand and four hundred miles. And if other occaſions of meeting there, were as many more as the Sabbaths, the travail would be more than twenty thouſand miles, which is nearly equal to the diameter of the terraque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Globe. Yet all this was endured with more ſubmiſſion than is common in like caſes. Which is to the honor of thoſe who endured it. And ſince we are bound in all things to acknowledge divine Providence, Prov. iii. 6. And ſince if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons enduring all this, had been as querulous as common in ſuch caſes, the town had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed; and our happy enjoyment of this houſe had never exiſted. Theſe conſiderations bind us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to enter this houſe with grateful veneration for its bounteous author.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The goodneſs of God was ſo conſpicuous, in preſerving every one of the multitude em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in taking down the old Houſe, and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it here from any diſaſter, that it demands a dutiful acknowledgment from every perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe facts, whenever they enter this houſe, eſpecially to worſhip the preſerver of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As convenient accommodation for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, is the honor and happineſs of any people; ſo the unuſual elegance of this houſe, for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024034_0014_0FC2EC77790E9CF8"/>
the purpoſe of its preſent dedication, calls aloud on its proprietors, to honor its great object, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they approach his preſence, to worſhip in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third remark on the premiſes is, that we ſhould pay ſuch regard to the word of God &amp; his worſhip, as never to admit any thing unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or antichriſtian. The Bible ſtiled a houſe for worſhip and ſacrifice, among the Jews, <hi>The houſe of God, Sanctuary.</hi> &amp;c. Reaſons for which have been given. But it allows no houſe for chriſtian worſhip to be ſo ſtiled. And ſince the antitype of all thoſe types is come, to uphold the types, is practically to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt is not come, and that he who bore that ſtile was an impoſtor. And ſo to deny chriſtianity, ſpeak falſehood, and ſupport the Jews. 'Tis unſcriptural. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have holy Ground, Houſes, and Places: but God bids us "<hi>come out from among them, and not touch the unclean thing.</hi>" 2. Cor. vi. 17. and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all who mean to purify themſelves as he is pure, will purify from theſe corruptions; becauſe they are antichriſtian.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have ſeen the abſurdity of types, after their deſign is anſwered. The name of Chriſt was <hi>to be above every name.</hi> Phil. ii. 9. <hi>His name alone to be exalted in all the earth.</hi> Paſ. lxvii. 10. We have ſeen alſo, there is more reaſon; infinitely more reaſon for the chriſtian Sabbath, than ever was for that of the Jews. And we have had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a moſt ſacred improvement of that day; &amp; ſome of them are encreaſed by the privilege of this houſe. To which others ſhall now be added.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This houſe is not made for vanity; but for the ſervice of God. And is this a triffling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Is there a perſon among us, who don't know this demands attention, ſolemn attention! What ſhall be thought then of the perſon, old or young, who ſhall attend worſhip in this houſe in a light, airy manner; comes gazing, ſmiling, gabling, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024034_0015_0FC2EC7BCAFF5690"/>
a place dedicated to the ſervice of God? ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency is infinitely more aggravated, than to ruſh into the preſence of worldly majeſty with a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which would enſure the cenſure of groſs ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeding, idiotiſm or inſanity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The dedication of this houſe to holy uſes, binds us to uſe it in a holy manner. No guile, envy, hypocricy, or other evil habits, ſhould be admitted here. Theſe are ſhoes forbidden to be worn. Indeed, tis impoſſible for a ſoul to draw near to God, with theſe embarraſſments. When we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this houſe therefore, remember the command, "<hi>put off thy ſhoes,</hi> and "<hi>be ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould take argument, compulſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, from divine Bounty, in the comfort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and privilege of this houſe, for holy ſervices and enjoyments, to become a people to the honor of a bountiful benefactor; and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this grace is not ill beſtowed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with ſome gratitudinary notes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are in debt to divine Majeſty, for this elegant accommodation for his worſhip. God ſaid of the firſt houſe for holy ſervices, "<hi>the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is mine, the gold alſo is mine.</hi>" Hag. ii. 8. He has indulged us the materials of this houſe; ſhall we pervert them? Shall we ſuffer the prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch favour? Far be it! But let us at every ſight of this bounty; "<hi>give unto the Lord, the glory due to his great name.</hi>" And dedicate, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily dedicate, this monument of his goodneſs to his ſervice. And allow it to ſtand a witneſs of our duty; and ſolemn teſt of our allegiance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The People at large are to be acknowledged, for their concurrence in the important work; as alſo for their ſteady approbation, and promotion of it from the firſt. May divine bleſſings here renumerate to them, all their care, and all their coſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The undertakers, inſpectors, and all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024034_0016_0FC2EC7C7A0B0240"/>
committees, are to be thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; the undertakers eſpecially; that when divine providence had opened a proſpect of ſomething of the kind; they indulged ſo liberal a projection, as this which has taken place. And both they, and the Inſpectors, are intitled to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick thanks, for that good judgment, patriotiſm, firmneſs, and perſeverance, with which the whole has been proſecuted, to the preſent perfection.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But our gratitude, is eminently due, under God, the patron of all ingenious artificers; to that curious artiſt, who with his aſſociates, undertook that arduous work, and whoſe diligence, conſtant attention, and high mechaniſm, have accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this brilliant accommodation for divine ſervice. We ought to deſire that their ſouls might be beautified with the Grace of God, and that they might be edified to his Palace above the ſkies.</p>
            <p>And now after honouring the preſence of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous friends on this agreeable occaſion; we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain call on our ſouls, and all that is within us to bleſs and praiſe the name of the Lord, for all his benefits; and for this diſplay of his favour, to his unworthy people. And dedicate this houſe, as a memorial, and monument thereof; and as a teſt of our allegiance to his holy Majeſty.—AMEN.</p>
