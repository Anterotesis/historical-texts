            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE BY THE EDITOR.</head>
            <p>THOUGH the uſefulneſs of PREACHING is univerſally acknowledged among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet we find they differ in opinion with regard to the manner of performing it, and the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary to the preacher. A man is generally required to go through <hi>a courſe of learning at a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or an academy</hi> before he be admitted to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial office; which done, his uſual method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing others, is, by <hi>reading in public a diſcourſe previouſly ſtudied and penned in private.</hi> But there are ſome who think that <hi>a good life and converſation,</hi> and <hi>a ſincere heart,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>a divine influence,</hi> though not accompanied with the knowledge of the learned languages, are ſufficient to conſtitute a miniſter of the goſpel; and that the beſt and moſt ſucceſsful inſtructions are delivered <hi>without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation of the preacher,</hi> when under ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of mind as would render his ſilence incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his duty. This laſt is well known to be the opinion of the people called QUAKERS; and I muſt acknowledge myſelf to be of the ſame ſentiment.</p>
            <p>'TIS commonly objected, that an <hi>extempore</hi> preacher muſt needs be liable to frequent inaccura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of expreſſion; that his language is ſeldom gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical; that it is very difficult for him to avoid tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011483_0004_0F832E4FD508D788"/>
and to obſerve that method and coherence which are neceſſary to the beauty of a diſcourſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THESE objections I allow to be true, as to the matter of fact; but of ſmall weight when the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and deſign of preaching are conſidered; which being to inform the <hi>mind,</hi> has no further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>ear,</hi> ſtrictly ſpeaking, than what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary towards being underſtood.—Not that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or deſpiſe the beauties of language, and the force of eloquence, or believe the QUAKERS leſs ſenſible of them than others are; but as the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heart is, or ought to be, principally in the preacher's view, they think a caſual ſlip of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion very excuſable, while his meaning is obvious to ſuch as give a proper attention.</p>
            <p>PLAINNESS of language in a preacher is certainly moſt agreeable to the ſimplicity of the goſpel, however it may be rediculed by thoſe who will not give themſelves time to conſider the nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or by thoſe who endeavour to make every thing myſterious in religion, in order to ſerve their own private purpoſes. It is likewiſe moſt ſuitable to the capacities of mankind in general: <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> believe it will hardly be denied, that a <hi>plain <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> diſcourſe is preferable to a <hi>learned ſpeculative</hi> only if it be conſidered, that the former may be of <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> benefit, whereas the latter can be profitable (or rather pleaſing) only to a <hi>few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS I hinted before, I would not be underſtood to blame or depreciate the accompliſhments of <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>eloquence:</hi> They are certainly <hi>ornaments</hi> to any man, and more eſpecially to a preacher. But though the QUAKERS eſteem theſe qualifications as <hi>uſeful,</hi> yet becauſe they deny them to be abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> to a <hi>goſpel miniſter,</hi> they have been condemned as deſpiſers of <hi>ſcience,</hi> and obſtinate
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:011483_0005_0F832E509B3BDCE0"/>
encouragers of <hi>ignorance,</hi> even in their teachers, in whom knowledge ought moſt to abound. Which wrong notion has ſo much prevailed, that men of tolerable capacities will enter their meetings with a contemptuous ſmile; and, as they come with a full expectation of hearing nothing but <hi>nonſenſe,</hi> are very unwilling to own themſelves diſappointed.</p>
            <p>I AM far from inſinuating, by what I have ſaid, that the following diſcourſes are offered to the world as a ſpecimen of uncommon learning and eloquence; they being neither preached with a view of being made public, nor at firſt taken down with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Nor are they choſe on account of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the diſcourſes generally delivered by the ſame perſon; for, as they were ſpoken without the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſign of publication, it is improbable they ſhould contain any particular excellencies.</p>
            <p>WHEN they were tranſcribed from the ſhort-hand, and ſhewn to ſeveral friends who heard them, they appeared ſo full of ſound doctrine and argument, that it was thought they might bear printing, with a few trifling alterations; which were accordingly made, agreeably to what the author and ſome of the auditors could recollect of their firſt ſhape; he declining to alter them in any other reſpect, that they might keep their genuine ſimplicity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a few inſignificant ſlips that may poſſibly have eſcaped him.</p>
            <p>AS theſe diſcourſes are offered to the public as they were firſt delivered by one engaged in a pretty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of preaching, without any other deſign than the edification of his hearers, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little or no improvement, the allowance which is natural on theſe accounts will, I believe, be as much indulgence as they will ſtand in need of in the eyes of the judicious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011483_0006_0F832E5186DA8FF8"/>BEFORE I conclude, I cannot help obſerving, with much pleaſure, how ſuperior theſe are, even in their preſent form, to many ſermons which are daily publiſhed by men who have ſpent a number of years in ſtudying the art of making them, and who never produce one without labour and mature deliberation.—In diſcourſes offered by ſuch men, faults are much leſs excuſable, it being the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed buſineſs of their lives to avoid them; great part of which is aſſigned to the ſtudy of a ſcience unknown to the firſt promulgators of the goſpel, that of our <hi>ſchool-divinity;</hi> which has been of very little ſervice to mankind, unleſs by introducing a vaſt number of ſubtle and perplexing diſtinctions, unintelligable definitions, and ſuch-like ſtuff, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome of the moſt famous modern preachers are peculiarly ſkilled; but which can never in the leaſt promote the main deſign of Chriſtianity, <hi>the putting an end to ſin, and the introducing of righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE nothing more to add, than my earneſt wiſh, that theſe diſcourſes may be read with cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and without prejudice or partiality; and that the divine bleſſing may attend the peruſal of them, which alone can make them effectual to anſwer the deſign of the preacher, and the deſire of</p>

            <p>I HAVE in remembrance a very ſhort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a man of underſtanding, though not under the character of a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which, I think, may be well worthy of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every one here; and it is this:
<q>Know Thyſelf.</q>
There is not a more uſeful knowledge than this, except the knowledge of God; and if we do not know ourſelves, how ſhall we know the Lord? I have obſerved, as I ſat in ſilence, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God in this meeting, that all matter is created of God, as well that which is inert and lifeleſs, as the living creatures; and all matter that we are acquainted with revolves from form to form, but there is no annihilation of any.</p>
            <p>THE plants of the earth obſerve a ſucceſſion from age to age: From ſmall ſeeds they ſpring up, and proceed from ſtature to ſtature, after their kinds, till they arrive at the perfections aſſigned them; and then alſo they gradually decline, and others take place from their ſeeds, and as their offspring.</p>
            <p>THE living creatures alſo obſerve the laws pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them; after their manner producing their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011483_0008_0F832E52DDEE79C0"/>
own ſpecies, which renew, increaſe, decreaſe, and ſucceed, from generation to generation, as the others do; ſo that there is no certain continuance of any particular.</p>
            <p>THE next thing I have in view is, the very low ſtate in which we mortals are firſt produced into this world. In that ſtate we have no knowledge, no underſtanding, but are like the beaſts of the field, and other animals, or even more helpleſs than they, and incapable of any law but that of nature, which we cannot break.</p>
            <p>AND, being endued with five ſenſes, we grow up by imperceptible gradations in the uſe of them, and proceed from ſtature to ſtature, and ſtrength to ſtrength, both of body and mind, to the degrees of which we are ſeverally capable, as variouſly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, for we are not alike in either.</p>
            <p>THE mind, dwelling in the body, could never perceive, or apprehend, the things that are without, or have any knowledge of them, but by the ſenſes, through the organs of the body adapted to that end. The mind within by theſe begins to take notice of things without; and every creature and thing, that we ſee and obſerve, exhibits its own idea to the ſenſe; and as we grow up, more objects are frequently preſented, and the mind which hears, ſees, taſtes, ſmells, and handles, by the organs of the body, gradually becomes more and more furniſhed with ideas, which, in time, it is enabled to collate and compare; and as the underſtanding is by this means enlarged, it now begins to attend to cauſes and their effects, and to form ſome conjuctures of the why and why not of things, whence they are, why they are thus, and not otherwiſe: And as they differ in their forms, ſo likewiſe in their natures, virtues, and ends, it is the mind and underſtanding, being

informed of the outward creation by the ſenſes, that deduces this conſequence from thoſe premiſes; that they, and we ourſelves alſo, muſt have an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our being, all-wiſe, almighty, eternal and all-good, holy, righteous, juſt, and true, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy above all to be ſought after, known, loved, feared, honoured and obeyed. Yet as our firſt ſtate in this world is only animal, before we arrive at a competent degree of conſideration and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or knowledge of ourſelves, or value of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls; we are by the perpetual preſence of objects adapted to our ſenſes, and a natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to purſue the ſight of the eye, the hearing of the ear, and the delights which the other ſenſes, ſeated in the natural mind and corporeal frame, can afford, and which are the chief good and of the higheſt eſteem in our view, as not having yet taſted of any thing of a ſuperior nature or kind; we are by theſe (I ſay) ſo ſtrongly habituated and biaſſed to the purſuit of theſe objects (though moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of our pains) that we are apt to proceed in this manner, without a due ſearch into ourſelves, what we are, and why we were created, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced here in this world, and by whom, and what the proper end of our being, as if to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to gratify our ſenſes, and live in ſenſual pleaſures and delights, as others the lower animals do, and like the brutes of the field, which feed on the fruits by the roots of the trees, and reſt under their ſhades, and never look up to ſee whence the food and ſhelter come, or conſider their own being and end.</p>
            <p>THUS the generality of mankind live, for a time, in this preſent world. Whilſt in this manner of being, they live and die, and are never acquainted with themſelves: But he that perfectly knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011483_0010_0F832E545B226D28"/>
perceives that man is an abridgement of the whole creation of God, and has made a great ſtep towards knowing it. But if we are not able rightly to know ourſelves, how ſhould we come to the knowledge of the moſt high, our creator? And if we could know all the creation, and anatomize every part of the matter of it, and diſtinctly account for the manner of its coheſion and exiſtence, and knew all that is poſſible to be known of it, and had all the knowledge of the angels of God in heaven; though the knowledge and contemplation of things in the mind and underſtanding affords an intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pleaſure, ſuperior to that of the ſenſes; yet all this would not render us compleatly happy, even in this preſent world; we may live and die unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py notwithſtanding: Neither would the gratifying of all our ſenſes and appetites, if without account and with impunity, alter the caſe at all.</p>
            <p>WE purſue, with diligence, thoſe objects which promiſe us delight in the views we have of them at a diſtance; but when obtained, though with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and hazard, and enjoyed, they do not anſwer the expectations we have formed, in our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning them; but periſh with the uſing, and we are diſappointed. It is therefore moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that, as reaſonable creatures, we purſue that ſatisfaction, and thoſe things, which are real, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and everlaſting.</p>
            <p>WHAT is that, therefore, which makes mankind everlaſtingly happy, and gives him full ſatisfaction? It is the knowledge of the creator of all things; of the true and living God, and not of the things that are made only. And it is the Lord himſelf that, in infinite goodneſs and mercy, ſo qualifies the hearts and minds of mankind, that we are made capable of knowing him, and of being united to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011483_0011_0F832E5515F54AC8"/>
him, and enjoying him, through that bleſſed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um which he, in his divine wiſdom and goodneſs, hath been pleaſed to prepare.</p>
            <p>AND all that are come to any competent degree of underſtanding, thinking and conſideration, may conclude, that ſince the creator hath produced and appointed ſome things agreeable unto us, as his creatures, in which we have great pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, lawful and allowable, as objects and ſubjects both of our ſenſes and underſtandings; how much greater pleaſure and ſatisfaction, and more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and certain, muſt there be, in the knowledge and enjoyment of the creator himſelf, who is the root and fulneſs of all divine pleaſure unſpeakable, and endureth unchangeably for ever.</p>
            <p>THE ſenſible pleaſures created of God, and given unto man in this life (not the falſe and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit ones forged by man) though agreeable to his nature and ſtate, and juſtly and reaſonably propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and bounded, are but for a ſhort ſeaſon, and attended with ſuch degrees of alloy as often ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them null: But when God is pleaſed ſo to qualify the mind of man, that the creator himſelf becomes the chief, if not only, object of his love, deſire, and contemplation; then man finds in the Lord all that his heart could deſire or think, and more abundantly, according to a ſaying of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced man of God;
<q>eye hath not ſeen (ſaid he) nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him.</q>
And if we love God, we ſhall likewiſe love mankind in the ſame love; for I remember what an apoſtle of the Lord Chriſt ſaid, treating on that ſubject,
<q>if a man loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, how ſhall he love God, whom he hath not ſeen?</q>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:011483_0012_0F832E579A2D9578"/>NOW what way, and by what means, ſhall we mortals attain to this experimental knowledge of God, ſo needful and deſirable, as the perfection and eſtabliſhment of our being? For when we look upon the heavens and the earth, and things that therein are, ſo far as we can behold them, reaſoning from the effects to the cauſe, we conclude that <hi>he is,</hi> and that he is the cauſe of all things, and we cannot do otherwiſe as rational beings. And contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, we muſt needs determine, as intelligent creatures, that he hath all thoſe divine attributes we commonly attribute unto him; as that he is an eternal, incomprehenſible ſpirit, or mind, omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, omniſcient, almighty, all-good, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And that he hath all thoſe moral characters uſually aſcribed to him in the holy ſcriptures, as righteouſneſs, holineſs, juſtice, mercy, truth, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: Where alſo, after the manner of men, even the affections and paſſions of mortals are aſcribed to him, as anger, hatred, fury, revenge, jealouſy; as alſo coporeal parts and ſhapes, as head, arms, hands, feet; whereas thoſe human properties and parts, (conſidered as in men) are not really and formally in God, but in the creatures by whom he worketh.</p>
            <p>BUT though the earth ſets forth his handy work, and the heavens his power and glory; and though the holy ſcriptures report of the moſt high thoſe things that are true, yet all this (as to us mortals) is but as an hiſtorical account, or a report; for we ſtill remain, in point of experience, ignorant of him of whom it is thus declared, though we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it as we ought. We are at a diſtance ſtill; there is a vaſt chaſm, and as a fixed gulf between the creator and us, all theſe things notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>THE ſcripture declares, as from the mouth of Chriſt, that God is a ſpirit, and we believe it;
<pb n="13"
                   facs="unknown:011483_0013_0F832E5814933A28"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
but who can conceive any proper idea of a ſpirit by the word, what he is, and how he appears to the mind? He is only known to the mind by his own influences, through a holy medium of his own adapting; by the ſenſible operation and effects of his wiſdom and power there. And as every object exhibits its own proper idea to the eye, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares itſelf thereby in the light, as a proper and neceſſary medium of ſeeing, without which we could not have formed any idea of things at all; ſo likewiſe we can form no idea of God, but what he himſelf is pleaſed to give, and in what manner, and by what medium ſoever he makes himſelf known; and is to all mankind whatever he pleaſes to appear to be, and that is according to the various ſtates of men. And to the faithful, holy, ſincere, and obedient, he is love; but to the unfaithful, unclean, hypocrites, and diſobedient, he is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire and deſtroyer; and we are one to another whatever he thinks proper to make us.</p>
            <p>AND I give you a ſimile in the works of God; that as we can form no idea of the body of the ſun in the firmament of heaven but what himſelf exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, nor can we ſee him but by the efflux of his own light, as from its proper center, which darting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eye when in its rectitude, directs it to the object: And as we have no words, or means, by which we can convey a proper idea of light to the underſtanding of one that is born blind, or the manner of its diſcovering objects to the ſight; even ſo, there are no words in any language I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, whereby we can convey the idea we conceive of God, by his own act of manifeſting, to any other, but to ſuch only as have the like ideas from the ſame manner of appearance in themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:011483_0014_0F832E59FB58DB18"/>WE expreſs abundance of words concerning God, and the things of God, very little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the greateſt part of mankind to whom we ſpeak: Therefore we direct all to the Lord himſelf, that he may teach them true knowledge and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the knowledge of himſelf, in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and in the ſilence of all the imaginations, cogitations, agitations, deſires, affections, paſſions and hurries of the natural mind, which is ever in action and fluctuating, paſſing from object to object, till the Almighty, by the manifeſtation of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word, and the influences of his holy ſpirit and grace, commands ſilence in the mind, inſpires her with underſtanding, and works a change there.</p>
            <p>GOD ſpeaks to the underſtanding by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word of his divine power, by revealing the things of God through the inſhining of the eternal light thereof in the mind: And when the moſt high ſo qualifies the mind, by his work of ſanctification therein, that he himſelf becomes the only object, and the mind is ſettled and ſtayed upon him alone; then all the creatures of God, and all the enjoyment of them, is loſt, for the time, and of no regard in compariſon of the great and glorious creator of all, and the divine and unutterable peace, joy, and conſolation, found in him, even in this preſent world, ſo far as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mode of being can bear the earneſt and ſure evidence of the fulneſs, when time to us here ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>I NOW proceed with what is further before me, as I may have aſſiſtance, by the grace of God, and utterance, for we ſpeak, from time to time, thoſe things that are renewed or opened in our minds and underſtandings, without any particular application to any one; the Lord himſelf, knowing every
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011483_0015_0F832E5A79D5D4F8"/>
ſtate, directs matters to particular perſons, or to the general, as it may pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>I SAY then that mankind are degenerated, being miſled by their own ſenſes and ſenſual appetites, into the love of the creatures (things without them) and themſelves, and ſo become ſtrangers, and alienated from the life of God, through their own darkneſs and corruptions; and peradventure the greateſt of all that are here have been ſo, as well as myſelf: Yet ſtill we find ſomething in ourſelves, admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us of our miſtakes, in our courſe through this world; and we ought to reflect, and conſider what this is, which many times ſurprizes us with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of things paſt, which we had forgot for ſome years.</p>
            <p>THIS is one who has wrote down all our failings, as it were, in his book; and he opens the leaves thereof, and ſhews us all the errors of our lives, and brings every thing to remembrance in our minds and underſtandings, one thing after another; and then, and not till then, we have a right foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for repentance and ſorrow for ſin (for he who never ſees his ſins, can never repent) and then, as the apoſtle ſaith, "ſin becomes exceeding ſinful;" they are ever before us, ſo that the mind becomes thereby heavy laden and oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>AND then, and not till then, we mortals are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to cry for a ſaviour, O Lord, a ſaviour, or I am undone for ever! How then comes the knowledge of ſin? It is through the love of God, who is not willing that any ſhould live, and die, and periſh therein. It is made manifeſt by the brightneſs of that all-diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy medium, which the moſt high father of all hath mercifully provided for that great and bleſſed end; that mankind might be redeemed, made free
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011483_0016_0F832E5B2CC40988"/>
from ſin, and the corruptions of the mind, through ſenſual luſts.</p>
            <p>WE all muſt own, that the wiſdom of God is himſelf, the power of God is himſelf, the ſpirit of God is himſelf: He is that eternal ſpirit, and was never without his wiſdom and power from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. He, therefore, hath been pleaſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and unite unto himſelf, the whole human nature; not only the intelligent reaſonable mind, but alſo the mortal part of man, which is the body, by which he might come near unto mankind, in our own nature and likeneſs, under the character and name of Jeſus Chriſt, who in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called the wiſdom of God; and the power of God; and by <hi>John,</hi> the evangeliſt, is called the word of God, by whom the world was made, and all things that therein are. And I conclude none are ſo weak as to think the body of Chriſt is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of God, but a miraculous effect of that cauſe, and, as the apoſtle compares it, is as a veil, whereby he veiled his divine nature, for a time, from every eye.</p>
            <p>AND the human mind, or reaſonable ſoul of Chriſt, is likewiſe a veil, but of a more excellent kind than the body, though congenial with the intellectual mind of mankind;
<q>for he was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin,</q>
(according to the language of holy writ.)</p>
            <p>GOD dwelleth in inacceſſible divine light, which no eye can penetrate, which no ſoul can with open face behold; therefore the Lord hath condeſcended to veil his glory, by aſſuming a human mind, eſſentially united to himſelf, thereby accommodat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo to the mind of man, as to appear and be manifeſted therein; and he who thus appears <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the true God, as it is written,
<q>God, who in the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011483_0017_0F832E5BDCD370B8"/>
beginning commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts, to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face (or appearance) of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the minds of mankind he diſcovers to our underſtandings whatever is proper for us to know of himſelf, or our duty toward him, and one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another. The Lord begins with ſmall things, wherein if we are faithful and obedient, he makes more and more of himſelf, and the enjoyment of his divine preſence and goodneſs, and his juſt and holy ways, known unto us; but if we err and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, though but in ſmall things, the mind is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thereby till we return and amend.</p>
            <p>THIS is the beginning of the manifeſtation of the law of the ſpirit of life, which makes free from the law of ſin and death, the revelation of the mind of Chriſt. He manifeſts in the minds of mankind ſuch things as are proper, according to our ſeveral degrees and capacities, beginning with little low things, as a ſchool-maſter, till we are capable of more, and then gradually he opens in us the myſteries of his kingdom. He that hates inſtruction, hates the inſtructor, according to what he ſaith under the character of wiſdom,
<q>how long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity, and ye fools hate knowledge? Turn ye at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and I will pour forth of my ſpirit upon you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE hear the reproof of inſtruction in your minds and underſtandings, that the ſpirit of wiſdom may be poured forth upon you; that you may firſt become proficients, and perfect in all moral righteouſneſs and duties, by the dictates of this wiſdom, which if we deſpiſe and refuſe, we never can attain; and then, as the Lord Jeſus hath ſaid,
<q>if
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011483_0018_0F832E5CF545AE18"/>
you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will make you rulers over greater riches?</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF men are not righteous and juſt one toward another in temporal things, how can they expect the divine influences of the immortal ſpirit and power of God, the true and eternal riches? If we are not faithful to the diſcoveries and dictates of the law of the ſpirit of life, the light of the divine word, manifeſted in our minds, how can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to experience the effuſion of divine love in our hearts, which is the greateſt bleſſing, and higheſt attainment, human kind are capable of in this life? This is that eternal life, this is the grace of God which is come by Chriſt, and is of an everliving nature; but if man refuſes this, and goes on from one evil to another, he rejects that eternal life, and by degrees degenerates more and more, till he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes altogether ſenſual as a brute beaſt, as it is written,
<q>the ſpirit of a beaſt goes downward, but the ſpirit of a man goes upward.</q>
For the man that aſcends by degrees of virtue and holineſs, one degree after another, till he comes to be united unto God, through Chriſt, the bleſſed medium, in whom is the fulneſs of all divine virtue, that ſoul hath the enjoyment of the divine preſence in this world, in a manner not to be expreſſed by the language of men or angels.</p>
            <p>IN this great city there are many temptations, and opportunities to hurtful things; and I have ſometimes conſidered the youth among us to be in great danger of corruption thereby: But the holy ſpirit of God ſtrives with you, and would gather every ſoul to himſelf. O! therefore conſider your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and know your own inclinations, thoughts and imaginations! what they are upon, what they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011483_0019_0F832E5D6065DE78"/>
are ſeeking after, whereunto they tend, whether toward good or evil, to the right hand or to the left, the broad or narrow way.</p>
            <p>SOME are ſo bent toward the mean, low, and ſordid pleaſures of an animal and ſenſual life, that they could even wiſh, for the ſake thereof, that they had no future ſtate; and ſome are ready to wiſh, O! that I were but as the little bird upon the tree, that I might go where I pleaſe, and do what I will, without any account of my actions in this world, or in another, if there be any yet to come! There is nothing more dreadful, and to which a reaſonable thinking mind is more averſe, than to remain without the knowledge of God, and not to believe a future ſtate. I have often thought any tolerable being is better than none at all; I would therefore have your minds ſo ennobled, as to contemplate the divine Being, conſider the great Creator, and how much better it is to become acquainted with him, become like him, and to live forever with him, and in his favour, than to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated. It is no ſmall matter, indeed, to be acquainted with God, ſo as to be united unto him; it is the greateſt advancement that the nature of man is capable of.</p>
            <p>AS concerning moral precepts, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, they are given altogether for our good, and it is our higheſt intereſt to obſerve them. It is the good pleaſure of God that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould live ſocially and amicably, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath given us ſocial precepts; and that we may be able to do them, he hath breathed into our ſouls the breath of life from himſelf. When the love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart of man, it raiſes the ſoul to God, as its firſt and chief object; and then likewiſe it flows forth towards mankind,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011483_0020_0F832E5E2C2047A8"/>
in every duty of friendſhip and kindneſs; and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be upon earth, when that part of the prayer which Chriſt taught his diſciples is come to paſs,
<q>thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven:</q>
Though many are daily uſing theſe words, and ſeeming to pray, yet they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it ever can be;
<q>and what is not of faith is ſin:</q>
But if it had not been poſſible, and the mind and purpoſe of the father, that mankind ſhould, in due time, be advanced into ſuch a ſtate, in this life, as to do the will of God on earth, ſo far as made manifeſt and required, and according to the mode and end of their being here, Chriſt would not have taught his diſciples to pray after that manner. Thoſe will be glorious days indeed, and if we can attain to that ſtate in our time, we ſhall be examples to others, our cotemporaries, and thoſe that may ſucceed us in ages yet to come.</p>
            <p>ALL the angels of God in heaven, the ſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims and cherubims, and ſpirits of juſt men made perfect there, the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, continually do the will of God, and rejoice without ceaſing, in beholding the face of their heavenly father, their creator; they ſurrender their crowns at the feet of God and the lamb, the redeemer and ſaviour of mankind.</p>
            <p>WE are ſatisfied and certain of the truth of the being of God, by the works of his creation without us, and by our own exiſtence, as not originally ſelf-productive: Let us not reſt here, but alſo ſeek after the knowledge of God, that we may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and enjoy his divine preſence, in a ſtate of a reconciliation and acceptance with him; which is not by any thing that we ourſelves, of ourſelves, can do, but by the work of God in us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011483_0021_0F832E5F49F53990"/>THE firſt work of God in man, in order to this knowledge, is to convince him of the errors of life, and of his ignorance, by his divine light, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or power; and the firſt work of the mind of man is, to believe, truſt, and confide therein, as its immediate object; as it is written,
<q>this is the work of God, that you believe in him whom God hath ſent.</q>
Again,
<q>believe in the light, that you may be children of light:</q>
That is children of God, who is that light. It is neceſſary, therefore, that mankind firſt believe in the divine convincing power, or Chriſt working in themſelves: As it is alſo ſaid,
<q>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, of two making one new man, and ſo making peace.</q>

            <p>MANY are upon the wing in this preſent age, flying from the divine truth, which they reject, and laying hold of their own reaſon, as ſufficient for them in the things of God, and knowledge of him. Doſt thou think, friend, that thy reaſon is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal divine word and wiſdom of God, by whom the worlds were made? Thou wilt hardly adventure to ſay ſo, upon a ſolid thought. Thy reaſon, if thou knoweſt what it is, thou wilt find to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent part, or property, of thy own being as a creature, thou canſt not be a man without it and thy underſtanding. Thy reaſon or underſtanding is a property eſſential to thyſelf, not ſelf-informing, nor ſelf-ſufficient in the knowledge of God, of whom thy reaſon can form no idea adequate to his eternal being. Thou muſt be under the dictates of a ſuperior, and not thyſelf. He who informs, and he who is informed, are not the ſame; the creator is not the creature, nor is the creature the creator: Thou with thy reaſon art a creature, and a weak one too; the divine informing light and

wiſdom, the eternal <hi>Logos</hi> (what word <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THE Lord God is eternal unapproachable light, and thou with all thy reaſoning, and ſelf-agitation and cogitation, art darkneſs, until he himſelf ariſe in thee, as the brightneſs of ſeven days, and give thee light and underſtanding. The divine wiſdom and power is diſtinct from all creatures: I know very well what I ſay, and therefore ſpeak it boldly; for I had reaſon, and could reaſon as other men, concerning God and the things of God, of whom I had heard and read, and ſpoke againſt <hi>this way</hi> before I knew what it was, as many now do, and before I knew the truth of God as a director of mankind, or that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is that truth and informer.</p>
            <p>SOME men argue very perverſly by their reaſon, or what they call ſo; which being baffled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved through ſenſual luſts, is enſlaved and made ſubſervient to the accompliſhment of them, ſo that they mean ſenſuality when they ſay reaſon.</p>
            <p>NOW I would have all you young ones to be careful and circumſpect, for it is for your ſakes that I am thus concerned at this time; that you may all truſt in the living God, and not lean to your own underſtandings as natural creatures, but embrace the truth freely, and be not aſhamed of the heart-tendering work of it in you; for he that is aſhamed of the work and word of God, rejects it, and that eternal life that comes by him; and of him will the Lord be aſhamed, and will reject him in that day, when all nations ſhall ſtand before the dreadful throne of his eternal judgment, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

            <p>I WOULD have you conſider therefore your own minds, with all the faculties and properties of them, and your own thoughts, and know them, and what you receive for truth in that ground: Seek for a more certain and excellent guide and director, ſomething that can inform your underſtandings with certainty, that will rectify all errors in you, and bring you forth in his own image, in the nature of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Your minds will then come to be inveſted, indued, and adorned with all the powers of the croſs againſt your animal corruptions; the ſweet properties and qualities of the human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Son of God you will be partakers of, and of the divine nature in him: You will love God above all, you will love all mankind, and hate none: You will be ſocial, for in the Son of God are all the perfections of the human nature exalted and glorified, and in him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head ſubſtantially or eſſentially: I ſhall therefore direct and leave you unto him.

            <head>THE INSUFFICIENCY OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE, AND THE BENEFITS Ariſing from that which is SPIRITUAL.</head>
            <head type="sub">A <hi>DISCOURSE</hi> delivered at the Metting-Houſe in <hi>Gracechurch-ſtreet, LONDON, Auguſt 14, 1737.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IF we can ſpare time from the multitude of thoughts and hurries in our minds concerning the things in this world, we ſhall find what our minds are moſt of all engaged in, and our deſires moſt after, whether tending more towards good or evil.</p>
            <p>THERE is hardly any deſire engages the mind more than that of knowledge; this was the way by which, according to the teſtimony of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the mind of mankind was firſt drawn out from the love, obedience, and enjoyment of the creator, into the love of himſelf and the creatures, and diſobedience to his maker; which reminds me of that ſaying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<q>a man's foes ſhall be they of his own houſhold:</q>
Which may be applied to the evil thoughts and deſires of the heart, as well as to domeſtics and relations, in another ſenſe, without us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:011483_0025_0F832E61D9D75B40"/>EVIL thoughts are as ſo many images and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of hurtful things, in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when ſuch are entertained in the mind till the deſires be inflamed, that is evil in the nature and tendency of it, and ſin in the ſight of God, if it ſhould never be brought forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to word or action; according to that ſaying of an apoſtle of Chriſt,
<q>luſt conceived brings forth ſin, and ſin, when it is finiſhed, brings forth death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND, according to the doctrine of Chriſt, all ſin begins in the thoughts, and defiles the mind; and ſo long as the mind of mankind remains defiled, it can never be united unto God, nor accepted of him. When the <hi>Phariſees</hi> pleaſed and valued themſelves upon an outſide cleanneſs, in waſhing of hands, and divers other like clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they ſeem to have been generally ignorant of this inward defilement, and need of inward waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore the Lord Chriſt reproved them, ſaying;
<q>not that which goes into the mouth defileth a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</q>
               <hi>Matt.</hi> xv. 18, 19. <hi>James</hi> iii. 6.
<q>For out of the heart proceed <hi>evil thoughts.</hi>
               </q>
Here the Son of God, who knows the hearts of men, and what is in man, begins at the root of all evil in us: Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, adultery, fornication, thefts, falſewitneſs, and divers other groſs ſins he there mentions.</p>
            <p>AND all things inconſiſtent with the mind and attributes of God, are firſt preſented in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and as the deſires of us mortals are enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled toward any thing inconſiſtent with him, which brought forth into word or action would be hurtful, and deſtructive to others, or one another; as he who knows all things, every the moſt ſecret
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011483_0026_0F832E6296D6C570"/>
thought, imagination, deſire and purpoſe of the heart, whether good or evil, being ever fully open to him; as he loveth all mankind, he often premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us of the evils of this world, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of them before hand, and reproves and condemns us in our hearts for them, when finiſhed or committed; approved in well-doing, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from evil, by a ſenſible conſolation, ariſing from his countenance and good preſence: And this the Lord doth by the operation of his holy ſpirit, word, or divine eſſential truth (which is the ſame, though expreſſed in divers terms) that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to the knowledge of evil, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and forſake it, be redeemed from it, and eſcape the future dreadful conſequences of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting therein, and of being cut off from God and the joys of his ſalvation, and determined under condemnation for ever; and that we may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above what we are by nature in the firſt ſtate, and become like unto God, in all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, holineſs, goodneſs and truth: For God never gave a law to mankind but with a view to the good of man, that the nature of man might be advanced above what it was, and that he might be preſerved and redeemed from theſe enemies, and from all the miſerable conſequences of ſubmitting to them, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, cleaving to them, and being incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with them. All evil is ſeated in the mind; and tho' the body and mind be connected by divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power, and are one man for the time of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet we ſee they are ſeparable; and then the mind ſubſiſting in a ſeparate ſtate, remains properly the man in another mode of being; and when the mind is departed, the body ſoon corrupts, diſſolves, loſes its form, and returns to earth, properly and truly ſo: But during the union of body and mind we are
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011483_0027_0F832E6365DC5260"/>
in a ſtate of probation, and may all poſſibly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God, renouncing theſe his and our enemies, and be ſaved. Yet if we give way to evil deſires and actions, and the mind continues to be thereby defiled, and in a manner incorporated and united therewith, we may arrive at laſt to ſuch a diſmal ſtate, as that our minds can never be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated therefrom, or ſaved, or have the enjoyment of the good preſence of God, in a ſtate of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with him in eternal bliſs.</p>
            <p>MAN'S own evil deſires, when they have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far the aſcendent over him as to be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with his mind, which is of an immortal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they are often his tormenters even in this life: ſo they may continue to be in eternity, when the union between the body and mind is diſſolved.</p>
            <p>TO illuſtrate this matter, I will ſuppoſe that a man hath a violent deſire, and moſt ardent luſt, to know ſuch and ſuch things as are neither proper or poſſible for him ever to know; or to poſſeſs any thing which is improper for him, and which he can never obtain: If he ſhould die in that ſtate, and his mind be for ever fixed in that condition, thoſe deſires remaining in his mind for ever, after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the body, would be tormenters ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, without any other puniſhment, and render that ſoul ſufficiently unhappy to all eternity: So that ſin, and the conſequences of it, is a puniſhment ſufficient in its own nature, if there were no other. Violent deſires therefore after what cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or, being poſſible, is inexpedient or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and conſequently hurtful, are to be avoided and ſhunned, and ſuppreſſed in their firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the mind, leſt they increaſe by indulgence or neglect, have the aſcendent, and reign in the mind, ſo as that they cannot be ſubdued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:011483_0028_0F832E64350BA6A0"/>WE ſee a great many things here in this world which we deſire, and do not obtain; and if we had them, they would be really hurtful to us, though not ſo in their own nature, but ſo unto us, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our miſapplication and abuſe of them, or ourſelves, or one another, in them; and therefore God, in goodneſs and mercy, is come near unto the minds of mankind, or rather has brought us near unto himſelf, through that holy and bleſſed medium whom he hath prepared, and by whom he convinceth the heart of man, and directs him to the choice of the beſt things; that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his inward and ſpiritual appearance; of whom I may ſpeak a little as he may be pleaſed to make way in my underſtanding, and give me ſtrength and utterance; and I would not have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be to any of you in vain.</p>
            <p>WE mortals do naturally deſire after knowledge; and it is good, well applied to the uſeful things of this life; and we have heard many excellent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, on divers ſubjects and occaſions, during our time in this world, concerning matters of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance, and have likewiſe read of them; yet many of them we may not have underſtood, and forgot moſt of them, through negligence or diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, if through much labour, coſt and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, we have attained to great knowledge in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things; and think ourſelves wiſe and learned, and therefore ſet a high and over-value upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are thereby exalted and puffed up, and are alſo eſteemed of others, as men of letters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge; what would all this avail? Or of what uſe would it be in a future ſtate? For we muſt ſoon be diveſted of mortal bodies, through whoſe organs we have attained ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011483_0029_0F832E64DFC996A8"/>
ſeated in a natural or carnal mind; and then all that knowledge will end as a flaſh, vaniſh, and be of uſe to us no more.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore hearken to the divine voice of the Moſt High, our Creator himſelf, by whom we are graciouſly invited to the moſt excellent, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and permanent knowledge, wherein we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not offend him; that knowledge which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with life eternal, and will remain ſettled in the pure mind to all eternity, and is to be learned and had of God only, who hath ſaid,
<q>be ſtill, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I will be exalted in the earth.</q>
It is by this knowledge the Moſt High will exalt himſelf, or manifeſt his eternal power, excellency and exaltation, as the creator and upholder of all things, in all nations, and in all people throughout the earth, in his own time.</p>
            <p>BUT what kind of <hi>ſtillneſs</hi> do you think this is? We are all ſtill in this meeting; we have been ſo a conſiderable time, and can do the like when we pleaſe; and good manners, and regard one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as men, on ſuch occaſions, will induce us to be ſilent, as to any outward noiſes, indecencies, or diſturbance; but the ſtillneſs, or ſilence, which God requires, is of the mind; from all the hurries, and runnings, and willings, and imaginations of mankind, that have any manner of tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evil: Silence of the clamorous importunities of the deſires in the heart, ſave toward God only, in a humble reſignation of mind and will unto him, in a pure act of hope, faith and love; that ſo the Lord himſelf may be heard in the mind, as we are attentive to the operations, and ſoft and tender whiſperings of the holy ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby he does inform the underſtanding,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011483_0030_0F832E659DCF60D0"/>
and reveal himſelf and the Father; for this is life eternal, ſaith Chriſt, to know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent. <hi>This ſtillneſs</hi> therefore is in order to <hi>that knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN,
<q>No man knoweth the Son but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him.</q>
Let us therefore examine ourſelves, and conſider theſe ſayings, every one for one; what do I <hi>know</hi> of theſe things? Many of us may and do believe theſe things, as we <hi>read</hi> them in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures of truth, or <hi>hear</hi> them; but what do we experience? Do we <hi>know</hi> that the Father ſpeaks in the ſecret of the hearts of men by the voice of his Son Chriſt, the holy ſpirit of Chriſt; the divine wiſdom and power by whom he created the worlds, cloathed with a holy human mind, congenial to the minds of mankind, in their priſtine ſtate?</p>
            <p>WE ſee what the Lord Chriſt ſaith of himſelf; he calls himſelf the TRUTH; "I am the way" (ſaith he)
<q>and the truth, and the life: No man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Father but by me. If ye had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo: And from henceforth ye know him, and have ſeen him.</q>
He is the way to God the Father, the truth, and divine and eternal life.</p>
            <p>DIVERS of the prophets of God, eſpecially <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> by the ſpirit of Chriſt which was in them, propheſied of the coming of Chriſt to the Jews, many hundreds of years before he came, ſo clearly and plain, as if they had rather been writing hiſtories of things paſt, than propheſying of things to come: And he came accordingly in the fleſh, born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and appeared among them for a time, and in him were fulfilled all the prophecies concerning the MESSIAH. And having
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011483_0031_0F832E66576E8CE8"/>
finiſhed all other the great ends of his coming, in the concluſion of all, he yielded up his precious ſoul upon the croſs, a propitiatory and acceptable ſacrifice, declaratory of the love and mercy of the Father to the whole world.</p>
            <p>BUT a little before his departure he foretold his diſciples of another adminiſtration, and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine manner of appearance of himſelf than that was, to thoſe who believed in him, and followed him. You may read at your leiſure, in the 14th, 15th and 16th chapters of <hi>John</hi> the evangeliſt, many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſpiritual ſayings of the Son of God, for your information concerning the Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<q>It is expedient for you (ſaid he) that I go away; for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you: And when he is come, he will reprove (or convince) the world of ſin, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of judgment: Of ſin, becauſe they believe not in me,</q>
&amp;c. chap. xvi. 7, 8, 9. Again,
<q>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of TRUTH, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be <hi>in you.</hi> I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world ſeeth me no more; but ye ſee me: Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo. At that day ye ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt myſelf unto him. Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, being yet preſent
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011483_0032_0F832E67240BC498"/>
with you: But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</q>
               <hi>John</hi> xiv. ver. 16, 17, to 26, incluſive.</p>
            <p>HERE Chriſt was with his diſciples as man, and they ſaw him face to face, as we ſee one another, and he talked with them familiarly and graciouſly on thoſe divive and moſt important ſubjects.
<q>It is expedient for you that I go away:</q>
Why was his departure, as to his bodily preſence, ſo expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them? That departing, as to his bodily preſence, which was to be but for a ſhort time, he might thereby make way for a more excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation and appearance of himſelf, inwardly in ſpirit, as he is life eternal, and the true comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Can any one doubt therefore who this divine comforter is? Sure it is no other then Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſpirit; for the ſame who is the TRUTH, is the ſpirit of-truth. The Holy Ghoſt, the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is Chriſt himſelf in ſpirit; for though he ſpeaks of one in the third perſon, as of another than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet it evidently appears, by comparing one of thoſe texts with another (if we had no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) that it was no other than his own ſpirit that was to be manifeſted in them after his glorification. And what and who it is in mankind that reproves and convinces us of ſin, is plainly the Holy Ghoſt, according to ſcripture evidence; and yet we have a more ſure teſtimony, even the Truth Himſelf, by the manifeſtation of his power and grace in our hearts, opening unto us the holy ſcriptures, and bearing witneſs that he, the ſpirit himſelf, was the author of them.</p>
            <p>'Tis the ſpirit of Chriſt then that reproves the world, even the whole world, of ſin; and the firſt great
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011483_0033_0F832E67D9131CF8"/>
ſin is unbelief, as the inlet and foundation of all others:
<q>Of ſin (ſaith the Lord Jeſus) "becauſe they believe not in me.</q>
               <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſin till he departed from his faith in the word of God; and as we are his offspring, and ignorant of God by nature, we do not believe in him, and therefore we ſin againſt him: Nevertheleſs that we may be redeemed from ſin and eternal death, and return unto God and live, he hath, in unſpeakable love and mercy, ſent the ſpirit of his Son Chriſt, the word of life, into our hearts, to reprove and convince us of our ſin, make us ſenſible of it, and repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and be ſaved from ſin and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and uncleanneſs, and from all its deadly fruits, and have daily communion with God in this life, and be glorified with God and the Lamb in a ſtate of everlaſting bliſs, when time to us here ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>BY this divine, ſpiritual, and inward coming of Chriſt, he ſpeaks, or manifeſts to the underſtanding, all things neceſſary to eternal life. He mortifies and ſubdues all the evil thoughts and deſires in the hearts of them who believe and receive him in the way of his coming, in love. He deſtroys and takes away the root of evil in mankind; as it is written,
<q>for this end was the Son of God made manifeſt, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</q>
How then doth Chriſt begin this work? Juſt as he ſaid before; for the firſt work is, the condemnation of man for the ſin of unbelief in him, with all the reſt of his ſins grounded thereon, or conſequential thereto; and not only of all man's own righteouſneſs, of his own inventing, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces him alſo of the righteouſneſs of God, who juſtly condemns and reproves him for ſin; the mind aſſenting alſo to the juſtice of God, manifeſted and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011483_0034_0F832E6893669168"/>
executed on the author of ſin, the prince of all the ungodly of this world, and of darkneſs: And this is effected by the ſpirit and power of Chriſt, as he is divine, eternal, univerſal light, and judge of the world. And the firſt act of the mind of man (thus convinced) toward Chriſt is, to believe in him as light and its immediate object; then to forſake ſin, ſelf, and Satan, through the grace of God, and become obedient to every diſcovery of truth in the underſtanding thus illuminated, that ſo we may be born of that light, and thereby become the children of God (who is eternal light) and heirs of eternal life: As ſaid the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<q>believe in the light, that ye may become children of light.</q>
And again, in him is life, and that life is the light of men; and though this light ſhineth in the dark hearts of men, yet they do not comprehend it; though this is the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, yet they do not know him, and therefore they do not receive him; but to as many as do receive him, as he is the word of God and divine, eternal light, he gives power to become the ſons and daughters of God, to them who believe in his name: Thoſe are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. This indiſpenſible work of regeneration comes not by deſcent of blood, nor by generation of the moſt holy progenitors, nor by any thing man can do in his own will or power, or by any inventions or ſyſtems of religion contrived and impoſed by man; but is the work of God alone, by his holy ſpirit, in them who believe in his, wiſdom and power, in the inward manifeſtations of it in their own hearts. <hi>John</hi> i. 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>CHRIST himſelf then, in his ſecond coming, was the comforter of all thoſe who had believed in him,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011483_0035_0F832E6955528EA0"/>
and received him in his firſt coming, and ſo he is ſtill: And the nature of this comfort is ſuch, that it unſpeakably tranſcends all the ſatisfaction and enjoyments we can have in the creatures of God, human or others, or any pleaſures of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting. No other enjoyment is to be laid in the ballance with that divine love and conſolation, which the holy ſpirit of Chriſt gives in the mind; He is all conſolation, and peace, and divine love.</p>
            <p>THUS he was to be a comforter to his diſciples and followers (and more alſo) and ſo he is ſtill. He was to be their leader and guide into <hi>all truth,</hi> and their great <hi>remembrancer</hi> and inſtructor: He had many things then to ſay unto them, but they could not bear them at that time. <hi>John</hi> xiv. 26. xv. 26, and xvi. 12. And whoſoever are acquainted with this coming of the Son of God, are much weaned from deſires after the many things of this world and their pleaſures therein are mightily abated and cut off: Only thoſe things that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the ſupport of life and ſuſtentation of the body, obtained by deſcent from relations, or lawful and honeſt induſtry, rightly uſed and applied, are bleſſings in this life from God, in the courſe of his good providence, and for which we are to be thankful unto him, in the enjoyment of them.</p>
            <p>AND though Chriſt is all this, and whatever can be deſired, unto his people and children, from time to time, according to the will of God the Father, yet no man can command this conſolation, or any manifeſtation of him, in his own will or time: It is the gift of God, and therefore we wait for it from him, in a holy and humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to his will; and he is not wanting to us therein, in his own time, as we remain faithful in our love and duty to him. Of this I am fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011483_0036_0F832E6A142BE508"/>
and do underſtand and know, that there is a divine ſelf-evidencing immortal <hi>power</hi> manifeſting itſelf, from time to time, in the minds of mankind, and ſenſibly influencing them, after a moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, the idea whereof is incommunicable by any language but its own, unto any who have not the experience of the ſame thing in themſelves; and that this power is not eſſential to the being of man; he was and is man before he knew or knows it; the celeſtial influences whereof cannot be commanded, or had, by man when he pleaſes; though he may reſiſt, oppoſe, and neglect them, to his own everlaſting ruin: And I believe I am ſpeaking in the audience of many of both ſexes, that have evidence, and are witneſſes, that there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, living, ſoul-quickening power appearing in them, which is not of themſelves, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move or command in their own time.</p>
            <p>NOW ſeeing Chriſt the Lord is thus the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, leader, ſtrengthener, and ſupporter of them who believe in, follow and obey him, what is he to the world? And who is this world? Even all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, throughout all ages, paſt, and at this time, and ever will be, who have not believed, do not, or ſhall not believe in the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they are all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under this general word, the <hi>world.</hi> He ſhall reprove the world of ſin: Here is a general reproof of all the world for ſin. What then is ſin? It is the tranſgreſſion of a law; for where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion. What law therefore hath the world received from God and tranſgreſſed, for which they are reproved and condemned by the Holy Ghoſt? Doth he mention any manner of immoral actions, prohibited by any given law, for which he ſhall reprove them? No, it is becauſe they believe not in him who does reprove them: For, though
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011483_0037_0F832E6BE7BA74B8"/>
God hath written and made manifeſt this law, the law of the ſpirit of life, the law of divine light, in all mankind in the world, from the foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; yet the world hath ſtill hated and oppoſed it, both in themſelves, and in thoſe who have believed and obeyed it.</p>
            <p>GOD condemned the old world for their ſins, and deſtroyed them in judgment without mercy: Is God unrighteous therefore, or cruel? Did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the world without offence, or the tranſgreſſion of any known law, and the higheſt provocation? No, God is altogether holy, righteous, juſt and good, and ſo is his law, and all his ways are truth, and condemneth none without a cauſe on man's part, and juſtly. We find, therefore, that God gave a law to the old world altogether good, and well adapted from the beginning of it; for the neglect, contempt, and breach whereof they were juſtly condemned; for, ſaith the Lord, my <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhall not always <hi>ſtrive with man.</hi> Again, in him (that is, in Chriſt, the word of God) was life, and that life was the light of men; this was their law, which law they brake; and for which they were condemned and puniſhed. This is the myſtery that lay hid from the foundation of the world, Chriſt in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the only hope of glory; and this law is in being ſtill, and ever will be, and is written in the hearts of all mankind; this law is light, and is as a lamp always burning; the true light which lighteth every man, male and female, that cometh into the world; which is again reſtored by the union of the ſame with the nature of man, in the man Chriſt Jeſus; that whoſoever believeth in him, and obey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth him, ſhall have forgiveneſs of ſins, and life everlaſting; even by him by whom came the law of the ſpirit of life, which ſets free from the law of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011483_0038_0F832E6C53B08AE8"/>
ſin and death; being life everlaſting in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This law being given unto all nations under heaven, men generally break it in one article or other; by obeying and following the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eye, and pride of life, and their own inventions and imaginations; for which this law reproves and condemns them, and from which condemnation they can never be ſaved, till they believe therein and obey; it being the ſpiritual appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the word of God, the true light, which lighteth every man, male and female, that cometh into the world.</p>
            <p>MEN may ſtout it out as much and long as they pleaſe, and decry the Holy Spirit of God, and call it by what opprobrious names they will; yet this eternal light and day of God will be the everlaſting condemnation of all thoſe who continue in unbelief. And until mankind come to believe in the Son of God, they muſt remain in a ſtate of ſeparation from God, in ignorance and condemnation.</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary therefore that every one conſider how we muſt believe in him; we muſt believe in him as the Father promiſed, and hath accordingly ſent him; I will give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xlii. 6. As we come then to believe in the Son of God, as he is the light of the world, and are <hi>baptized</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> (as we have heard this morning <note n="*" place="bottom">Another perſon having ſpoke before this diſcourſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivered.</note>) we ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As he ſaid, after his reſurrection from the dead, when he was ſpeaking concerning the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his diſciples to preach ſalvation by him unto ill the world: All power is given unto me in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth; go ye therefore and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011483_0039_0F832E6E906841A0"/>
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you; and lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world <note n="*" place="bottom">Matthew xxviii. 18, 19, 20.</note>. Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature. He that <hi>believeth</hi> and is <hi>baptized</hi> ſhall be ſaved, but he that <hi>believeth</hi> not ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mark xvi. 15, 16.</note>. Again, I am come a light into the world, that <hi>whoſoever believeth</hi> on <hi>me</hi> ſhould not abide in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="†" place="bottom">John xii. 46.</note>. He that believeth on him is not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he that <hi>believeth not</hi> is <hi>condemned already, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God; and this is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>that light is come into the world,</hi> but men <hi>loved darkneſs</hi> rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil. <hi>John</hi> iii. 18, 19. Again, all things that are <hi>reproved,</hi> are made manifeſt by the light: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth make manifeſt, is light. <hi>Epheſians</hi> v. 13. And to premoniſh them what baptiſm he intended, as conſequential to their teaching, or rather to be done at the ſame time, in the act of preaching, in the power of the Holy Ghoſt (and that it was not water-baptiſm) he bid them wait for the promiſe of the Father, which he had told them of before. <hi>John</hi> xv. 26. For <hi>John</hi> truly <hi>baptized</hi> with <hi>water,</hi> but ye ſhall be <hi>baptized</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> not many days hence; but ye ſhall receive <hi>power</hi> after that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is come <hi>upon you.</hi> And ye ſhall be <hi>witneſſes</hi> unto me, both in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in all <hi>Judea,</hi> and in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and unto the uttermoſt part of the earth. <hi>Acts</hi> i. 4, 5, 8.</p>
            <p>BY all which it appears, that the apoſtles of Chriſt were commanded and authorized by Chriſt to proclaim him unto all nations, and to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011483_0040_0F832E6F1A875DD8"/>
of him, not only what he had done in the fleſh in that adminiſtration, but as he is the word of God, the light of the world, and Holy Ghoſt; and that all who ſhould believe in him as he is that light ſhould be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt (that is, be made partakers of it in ſome degree) and be ſaved; but that they who did not believe ſhould remain where they were, under everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation by the Holy Ghoſt as a perpetual, true, and powerful witneſs againſt them. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is as we ſtand in the ſtate of nature in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and in unbelief from which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, we may be redeemed and ſaved, if we do not <hi>continue</hi> in <hi>unbelief</hi> and <hi>diſobedience:</hi> But if we do not believe in the Son of God, as he is the divine light, and ſent as ſuch unto us, that <hi>condemnation</hi> will be <hi>confirmed</hi> upon us, and remain for ever.</p>
            <p>BUT then ſome may think it hard that ſo many millions of people, who never heard of Chriſt, ſhould be damned becauſe they do not believe. To whom I ſay, that, ſo far as God doth make manifeſt his will by the light of his Son Chriſt, that is his law to <hi>that</hi> ſoul; and ſo far as man loveth that law, and ſhows it by practice, he cannot truly be called an unbeliever, he believes in a holy SOMETHING, a <hi>powerful perſuaſive</hi> SOMETHING, for which he has no name; and when he acts and ſays according to the manifeſtations of it, he finds peace, tranquility, and conſolation in his mind; but when he ſpeaks or acts contrary to it, he finds trouble; ſo that he is diſciplined, as by the rod and reaſonable perſuaſion, into moral virtue and goodneſs. I therefore conclude this is a mode and degree of faith in the Son of God, the light of the world, working by love: And God is not unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous or unreaſonable, to require any more of any
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011483_0041_0F832E7012CF1FE0"/>
one than he hath given or made known; for Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the reſt of the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> if ye had been <hi>blind</hi> you had <hi>not had ſin,</hi> but whereas you ſay you ſee, you have no cloak for your ſin.</p>
            <p>MANY of thoſe who make no profeſſion of Chriſt, and to whom he hath not been inſtrumentally preached, are in the practice of moral virtue, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they would be done by, through the evidence they have of it as a duty, by the <hi>divine light</hi> giving them <hi>underſtanding,</hi> though they do not know, or <hi>formally</hi> believe in it, <hi>under that character, in any language.</hi> Whatever you ſee therefore (for I have a mixed auditory) or ſuſpect in your minds to be wrong, ſhun it with all your ſtrength; yet not truſting therein, but in the grace of God; and the Lord, in his own good time, will open his counſel, and give you divine wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, according to his kind invitation:
<q>Lift up thy voice for wiſdom, and with all thy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings get underſtanding:</q>
For the knowledge of God is everlaſting life:
<q>This is life eternal, (ſaith the Son of God) to <hi>know</hi> thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</q>
Then follow on and proceed in the knowledge of God, and in the increaſe of that wiſdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to avoid every appearance of evil.</p>
            <p>Now I would obſerve to you, that the Chriſtian religion, in every form of it, or whatever is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is accidental to the greateſt part of mankind profeſſing it, being educated in ſome kind of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or profeſſion or other, according to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their parents, guardians, or tutors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have any thought or underſtanding to diſtinguiſh between truth and error, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly fall into that way or profeſſion of religion
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011483_0042_0F832E701EB66188"/>
moſt in <hi>repute</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> and moſt <hi>faſhionable;</hi> if therefore one is born among the <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> he is of that way; if among the <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> he is of that way; or, among the <hi>Preſbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Baptiſts,</hi> or us who are now diſtinguiſhed by the name, of <hi>Quakers,</hi> they are of thoſe ſeveral ways or profeſſions; and if among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> they are of that falſe way. How powerful therefore and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective is the prepoſſeſſion and prejudice of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and how uncertain and unſtable is any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid only in that way? Howbeit, where there is nothing elſe but motions, true ones are better than falſe; and where there is only a mixture, the trueſt are beſt of all, and may be taught and embraced, till he who is the TRUTH appears, and till light and life be made manifeſt in him.</p>
            <p>THE religion then which moſt of you under this diſtinction at this day do profeſs, you had it firſt accidentally by education, tradition, and imitation; but being convinced by the holy ſpirit of truth, and believing in and obeying the ſame, to the ſanctifying of your minds, by the effectual operation of the power and divine virtue thereof in you, your religion is now become that of your underſtandings, judgment, experience, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; wherein being eſtabliſhed as upon the ſure rock of ages, and foundation of all the generations of the righteous from the beginning of the world, even upon Jeſus Chriſt, the wiſdom and power of God, you are not perverted, nor I hope perverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor toſſed in uncertainties by the ſubtle inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of crafty yet ignorant and deſigning men, wherein they are deceived and deceiving: As it is written, if the blind lead the blind, they ſhall both fall into the ditch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:011483_0043_0F832E70DFFB3D98"/>To conclude: There never was any thing in the world under the notion of religion worthy of that name, ſave what came by the inſpiration of God, whereby the knowledge of himſelf was taught by the revelation of the Son of God, that mankind might be reſtored to communion with God in this preſent world, and to know him to be the moſt beneficent and ſure comforter, and that at laſt we may come to launch into the fulneſs of his goodneſs, at whoſe right hand are rivers of divine pleaſure, for evermore.</p>
