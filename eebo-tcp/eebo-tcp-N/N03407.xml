            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Pſalm is Entituled, <hi>A Pſalm of David;</hi> in which he ſtirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſummoneth all his Powers, both of Body and Mind, to bleſs &amp; praiſe the Name of GOD. The particular Reaſons of it, are;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Special mercy ſhewn to him in forgiving his ſins &amp; healing his diſeaſes, and in ſaving him from death when in imminent danger.</hi> See ver. 1. <hi>to</hi> 4. He ſhews his care thus, To relieve the Oppreſſed, ver. 5, 6. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His Particular care for &amp; over his Church, even for Iſrael, in giving his Law to them, and opening to them the myſteries of his Providence in their favour.</hi> ver. 7, 8, 9. So that if he corrects them for their Sins, as his choſen people; yet he limits &amp; ſets bounds to his Anger, as to the time and the meaſure of it. If he viſits ſore, yet not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the demerit of their ſins; but cauſes His Grace to Exert it ſelf over their Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. But 'tis in ſpecial

to <hi>them that fear Him:</hi> He pardons their ſins &amp; does them all away. They are removed from them <hi>ſo far as the Eaſt and the Weſt in their diſtances,</hi> ver. 12. This the Lord promiſes to do for the faithful, in the day of his gracious viſitation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31 34. And here, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. His gracious dealing is compared to that of a <hi>tender and compaſſionate Father</hi> in his dealing with his Children. Text, <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c</hi> God is a Father to ſuch; in the way of the New Covenant he owns them to be ſuch, let them be <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> in the Goſpel day, without diſtinction; and he treats them with like care and tenderneſs. And he is in ſpecial ſo tender and gracious in his dealings towards them that <hi>truly Fear him; i. e.</hi> the Seed of the Faithful; ſuch as are Upright before him, and are under the influence of his Fear. ſo as to make it their care to pleaſe Him by keeping Covenant with him. Be it ſo they offend at times and break his Laws, He that knows their defects, will bear much with their froward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers &amp; peeviſh diſpoſitions. He is not ſtrict to <hi>mark their iniquities againſt them,</hi> for he <hi>knows their frame,</hi> ver. 14.</p>

               <p>And we may briefly hint it in ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which the Lord ſhews it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In declaring them to be his Children and owning them as ſuch.</hi> When God brings <hi>Iſrael</hi> into Covenant, he thus declares for Himſelf, and brings them thus to ſtipulate with him; or to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the mutual Engagement between them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18. So it is in Goſpel Times, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8, 10. <hi>Again,</hi> He is ſaid in terms, <hi>To be their Father;</hi> and they are ſaid to be, <hi>His Sons &amp; Daughters,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18.</p>
               <p>But will the Moſt High and holy GOD thus tranſact with Vile and Sinful men, that be as Worms of the duſt? Yes, ſo tis; Oh! ineffable Grace and Condeſcention in him. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt therefore Expreſſes his Raiſed thoughts upon it, Pſal. 8.4. <hi>What is man, that thou art thus mindful of him? or the ſon of man, that thou art pleaſed thus to viſit him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In taking them under his Fatherly Conduct &amp; Directions</hi> Herein he acts the part of a Father. Parental care tends to this; To be ſure for the Child while he is a Child, and wants skill and conduct to direct himſelf. Now the Father will keep him under his Eye, and not let him go
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004155_0008_1003DABA56A6E788"/>
far from him, or get out of his ſight. The Lord has thus the wakeful Eye of his Providence over <hi>Iſrael</hi> night &amp; day: The <hi>Pillar of the cloud by day,</hi> and that <hi>of fire by night,</hi> to guide them in the way they ſhould go. This ſhews his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care to guide them in the Wilderneſs, after he has brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by a Mighty Hand and prevented them in their low Eſtate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21, 22. So <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks in his Divine Song concerning them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.10. Thus, <hi>When Iſrael is a child the Lord loves him, and calls his ſon out of Egypt,</hi> Hoſ. 11.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the Proviſion he makes for them.</hi> 'Tis the care of a tender Father to provide for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; to be ſure while they be young and not able to provide for themſelves. The Lord has this care for men in general, to provide for them, <hi>He provides for Man and Beaſt;</hi> Theſe are all his Creatures, and live upon his Bounty day by day. But he provides in ſpecial
for <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as his People in Covenant; in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pſal. 78.26. <hi>He gives them bread from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and water out of the rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In taking them under his ſpecial Protection.</hi> A Father will do this as he is able for his Child, He will protect him from harm, if he be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Enemies, or by Beaſts of prey, &amp;c. The Lord takes <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the time of his coming up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> down to Succeeding Times, under the wing of his Protection. He is tender
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004155_0009_1003B86C5E17EB20"/>
of them, <hi>even as of the apple of his Eye, Deut.</hi> 32.10. If any touch them to do them harm, ſtill they provoke Him to anger by their ſins; and ſhall be ſure to feel his Reſentments for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>In bearing with their evil Tempers and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Parents are thus pitiful towards their Children, in bearing with their peeviſh Tempers and froward Diſpoſitions; they bear much and long with them; to be ſure ſome do ſo: they bear with that from them thro' love &amp; tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which others can't that be ſtrangers to them or not ſo nearly related. So the Lord bears with that from his People in Covenant, that he will not bear with from others. He bears with that from them, which they won't or can't bear with from one another. This the Context ſhews. He bears with them long; and if their Sins be many and very grievous, and heavy Enough to tire his Patience, if he were like a weak and angry man; ſo that he would be for conſuming them at once. See <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.1, 3. <hi>compar'd with Neh.</hi> 1.3. Mal 36. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not: therefore ye ſons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>In the Correction he uſes when he ſees there is need.</hi> He ſees at times there is need of it: Milder means won't do; Chidings won't do; Reproofs, Admonitions, Warnings, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings won't do; He hews them by his Servants

But how loth does he ſeem to be to come to it, or to uſe it as he might? If he Corrects, he acts as a Father in it, and not as an incenſed Judge. His Correction is ſeaſonable; He will take a proper time and ſeaſon for it: He will not do it too ſoon; ſo as to be ſudden and haſty in it; nor will he defer it too long. He will take them alone to do it, or by themſelves as ſeparate from other people, and when their minds are beſt prepared to receive it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.28.

               <p n="2">II. <hi>To ſhew He has this Care in ſpecial for them that truly Fear Him.</hi> Be it ſo his Fatherly care reaches to the Body of a People in Covenant with him, then that of a more ſpecial nature to them that truly fear him.

               <p>His Fatherly Care for them intends ſuch things as theſe in it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Obligations of ſuch a People to GOD muſt be ſpecial and very great.</hi> As they be the Subjects of his Fatherly Care, ſo their Obligations are proportionate as Children, to be true and faithful to him. See what the Lord expects from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on the account of what he had done in taking them into Covenant with himſelf. He ſaves them before hand, as it were. He migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily truſts and confides in them, that they will be obedient &amp; true to what they promiſe, and what he has ſo fairly bound them to do.

Its like to go well with a People when the Fifth Commandment is ſtrictly obſerved by them. They are to own and profeſs the Truths of God, and to Worſhip him aright, <hi>Job.</hi> 4.24. They are to Fear and Reverence his Great and Holy Name; to Sanctify the Sabbath, to keep it as a Holy Day unto the Lord; to Love his Houſe, his Worſhip and Ordinances therein, and not live in the careleſs Neglect of any of his Inſtitutions. Farther, They are to to be Sober, Temperate, Peaceable, Chaſt, Diligent in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, Men of Truth and Honeſty, Kind and Charitable, and ſo govern their Affections as to theſe things, by the rules of Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: They are to be Humble and Meek, not Proud &amp; Haughty; ſo as to gain the aſcendant over their corrupt Humours and Paſſions: And to be in all things Blameleſs as the Sons of God

If they are told of their Pride, Covetouſneſs, Voluptuouſneſs, Injuſtice, Deceit and Lying. If they are told of their Strifes &amp; Diviſions in Towns and Churches, to the waft of much precious Time, as well as to their apparent hurt and damage in Temporals and Spirituals. And yet there is no return to God by Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: Still the ſame Sins laid in charge againſt them, Year after Year; no change in the general for the better; but it may be growing worſe, here is a ſad Omen upon a people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.25, 26.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Sins for which they have ſuffered much already.</hi> If for theſe &amp; ſuch like Sins the Land mourns, and for them the Lord yet ſmoaks againſt our Prayers; and we have yet Sickneſs ſore and grievous; juſt complaint of our low and declining ſtate in Temporals, as well as Spirituals. In particular, as to frowns in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Spring, and ſo in Harveſt time, ſo that the work of our hands fail as to the Fruit of it, and our Stock dies in particular places. If our Loſſes are conſiderable by Land or Sea, every Year, and yet we have not Eyes to ſee nor Hearts to reform; but ſome are impatient &amp; find fault with others, while ſome are eaſie and unconcerned; others be in the dark and at a loſs, not knowing what to do to Revive a dying or decaying State; ſaving but to go on in the Path they have gone on in from year to

What is it but to come to their caſe in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. <hi>To put away, &amp;c.?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Inference, <hi>It may teach ſuch a People not to diſtruſt God's Care in time of Diſtreſt, Straits and Dangers.</hi> They may be at times much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; their Conſtitution may be Threatned, by ſuch as are no Friends to it; God is angry, and a ſeries of Evils follow it: yet ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as are in the hands of a Merciful God and Compaſſionate Father, are not to diſtruſt his Care. It may be the People ben't brought low enough yet. To be ſure they be not as to temper and ſpirit; it may be as to their Circumſtances neither.

The Lord knows our frames, and conſiders that we are but duſt; as it follows the Text. See ver. 14, 15.</p>

And laſt, <hi>May be in a word of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement &amp; Comfort, to Two ſorts of Perſons.</hi> Is the Lord as our God &amp; Father in Covenant, a God of <hi>ſuch tender Pity to them that fear him as his Covenant Children?</hi> It may Encourage or Comfort two ſorts of perſons. In particular,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To Souls in Diſtreſs under Inward Troubles;</hi> as Convinced Sinners, or ſuch whom the Lord may be about to humble and prepare for his grace, that yet remain in the dark, and have not ſeen that the Lord is gracious. Here,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Conſider, <hi>There is grace enough in God for you.</hi> Be it ſo you have ſinned with a high hand and have lived long in it, ſo as to give ground to fear you have got beyond the <hi>reach of mercy,</hi> yet conſider this grace &amp; goodneſs in the <hi>Foun'<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain,</hi> 'tis Infinite. And it may be the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to pour it forth upon you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>He gives you particular Encouragement to ſeek it.</hi> Does your trouble and diſtreſs drive you to God? as it does if it works aright. As
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004155_0030_1003DC2433EAC968"/>
wounded in ſpirit, are you ſo prepared to look <hi>to him for Healing?</hi> Your Encouragement now is great. 'Tis the Spirits work now in the time of his gracious Viſitation, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10 <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.10</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>He has beſtow'd it on others, as vile or worſe than you be.</hi> Be it ſo you are Vile &amp; deſerve to be turned down to Hell, and you appear to be viler than any man; yet there be Patterns of mercy before you. See it in <hi>Manaſſeh, Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> the <hi>Thief on the Croſs,</hi> &amp; others 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>He promiſes to Accept you upon believing and hoping in his Mercy.</hi> He bids you do it, &amp; warns you not to ſeek for reſt any where elſe. 'Tis the Lord <hi>againſt whom you have ſinned,</hi> and 'tis his Prerogative to indemnify &amp; clear you from your Guilt. And this is ſure to the Soul that truly turns and repents, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let it be of Comfort to all ſuch as truly fear the Lord.</hi> This Doctrine gives ground of ſtrong Conſolation to all ſuch <hi>as truly fear the Lord,</hi> or have reaſon ſo to hope from what they have <hi>ſeen of him</hi> in his <hi>Power, Grace</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> after they have been brought <hi>to ſenſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of their own Sinfulneſs, Nothingneſs &amp; Unworthineſs of his Favour.

have <hi>ſure ground of Comfort.</hi> Here Two things. Let ſuch Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>The Covenant with the Promiſe of it is ſure.</hi> The Covenant is Everlaſting: It reaches to you, and to your Seed, upon condition. 'Tis ſuch a Relation made between God and you, as that no Relation in Nature can reach it, or in the way of Civil Contract. 'Tis ſet forth by many things; but they do but faintly ſhew it. The Lord ſpeaks of being <hi>a Father to you in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> and he is more than ſo: Of being <hi>your Husband;</hi> and he is yet more than ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. Such Relations hold faſt for Life; but ſuch is your Covenant Intereſt, as that <hi>neither Life nor Death can diſanul it.</hi> The Covenant <hi>it is Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> and ſo is the Foundation of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 38, 39.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Hence all his Dealings with them are in this way.</hi> Let the man that truly fears the Lord Conſider this, <hi>The Lord is ever mindful of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in the good or evil which he brings upon you;</hi> and it reaches to your Children too, as they may be prepar'd to fear him &amp; ſerve him Early. For which you have great Encouragement to Plead at the Throne of grace. See the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, here as it follows the Text, ver. 17, 18. <hi>But the Mercy of the Lord is from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to Everlaſting upon them that Fear him; and his Righteouſneſs unto Childrens Children: To ſuch as keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that remember his Commandments to do them.</hi>
