            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Main part of the Work which the Lord Jesus has committed to me at present, is to be doing service to your Souls, and the Souls of your Children; to be directing, quickening and encouraging of you in the way unto eternal life: which work requires the utmost care and diligence, not only in respect of the necessity that you stand in, of that blessedness which is the design and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereof, but also in respect of that difficulty that you will unavoidably meet withal, in your pursuit of that blessedness:
<pb facs="unknown:000434_0003_0FA5AB5A5B826B60"/>
however many men that know not their own hearts, and are utterly unexperienced in the way of life, may fancy it to be a matter of case to go to heaven, as if there wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but a step between them and heaven, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account are bold to cast off all care about it at present; yet such as have tried it, and are walking in that way, can upon plentiful experience witness to what Christ has taught us, <hi>That strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leadeth unto Life</hi>: every thing in corrupt nature is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to it: and upon this account he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Ministers to use their utmost indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in their work, <hi>Luk. 14.23. Compel them to come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have travelled in this work among you for many years, and I may say without ostentation, that I <hi>have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful:</hi> I have made it my business to gain Souls to Christ, and build them up in Faith and holiness: prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally insisting upon such things as have reached the heart of Religion; and I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it one of the choicest mercies of the Lord towards me, that I have <hi>not run in
<pb facs="unknown:000434_0004_0FA5AB5B95CF5BD8"/>
vain nor laboured in vain</hi>: I have great cause to bow my knee to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and bless his Name that he has made me an instrument of bringing many among you into saving acquaintance with himself; and I count it worth the while to spend the residue of my dayes in promoting the welfare of your Souls.</p>
            <p>It is in pursuance of this design, that this small Treatise is published, (not that my care is confined to your selves, I owe a regard to the prosperity of other places:) the scope of this Discourse is to clear up the way of Salvation by Christ; I meddle not with those false Doctrines that have been invented by men, in opposition to this truth: the Lord hath been pleased to keep these Churches sound in the Faith, and does not yet lay a necessity upon his Ministers here to spend their time in the confutation of such erronious Opinions: but I have made it my work to establish your hearts in this Truth, to satisfie your Consciences from the Scripture in the safety of your reliance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, vindicating the same from those secret workings of unbelief that are wont to
<pb facs="unknown:000434_0005_0FA5AB5C1D5D5D50"/>
rise up in the hearts of men, that you and others may grow up <hi>unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, and the acknowledgment of the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, even of the</hi> Father, <hi>and of</hi> Christ: That you may be armed against those temptations wherewith your Faith is wont to be assaulted; and learn to live in all conditions upon the righteousness of Christ.</p>
            <p>If the Lord please to bless this Discourse together with other endeavours of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Countrey, both in Preaching and Writing, to be a means to lying many Souls to an hearty closing with Jesus Christ, that will be the great security of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey against that degeneracy that is begun, and against those superstitious practises that are entertained in other professing places: the life of Religion takes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the spiritual knowledg of Christ, and is maintained by the same; as long as we are built upon this Rock, the Gates of Hell will not prevail against us.</p>

                  </gap>hensions of Gods anger have spurred them on to discover a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: they have not been able so to stupifie their hearts with worldly occasions and carnal delights; as to let fall the consideration of this, but have been compelled from their own terrors to make that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, as they <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Many men who have busied themselves in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry have not been advantaged to attain a right reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution thereof; the Heathen Nations had lost the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the way of Salvation: something in Religion was handed down to them by tradition: and something particularly that had a reference un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But besides these, there are many others, who have been advantaged with the light of the Gospel that have been unsatisfied in that account which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have given concerning the way of our acceptance, and have pleaded for such methods of Salvation as the Word of God is utterly a stranger to: withal wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many passages of Scripture to vindicate their own delusions: thus as the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, so especially the <hi>Papists &amp; Sooinians</hi> now go about to establish a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which the Gospel does not acknowledg: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we come to him, <hi>John</hi> 16.10. and therefore all those that are assured of the truth of the Gospel, do close with Christ and are regenerated: and this leads us to the interpretation of several passages of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where such Men as assent to the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are said to be in a good condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with thine heart that God raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved:</hi> 1 Joh. 4.15. <hi>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he is in God:</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. <hi>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God</hi>: These passages are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of that Faith which is common to Professors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Faith that may be separated from holiness, which <hi>James</hi> calls a dead Faith, <hi>Jam</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> but of that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that is wrought in the heart by the Holy Ghost.</p>

The third is a discouraged frame, Christians are many times much over-born
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000434_0018_0FA5AB6B1D358230"/>
with this frame, their spirits are sunk within them lest they be not upright, for fear they never had a thorow work of regeneration: there are many more immediate occasions of this, sometimes because they have not a distinct knowledg of the several steps of the spirit of God under the work: sometimes because they see so little sanctification, sometimes because they imagine that God does not deal with them as with such as are truly converted; he dont answer their prayers, comfort their Souls, meet them in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as he does others; but the very foundation and root of their discouragement is their doubtings of the truth of the Gospel: for we may observe that men under discouragement are still harping upon the greatness of their provocations, and their unworthy carriages; they run in a legal strain, they are still insisting on the multitude and aggravations of their sins: had men but a spirit of Faith prevailing in them, these would be humbling things but not discouraging: men would not so harp on this thing but would see enough in Christ to quiet their hearts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.16, 45 <hi>Isai.</hi> 24. and accordingly it is observable that when a Saint is under greatest discouragements, if God does but open his eyes to see indeed this way of Salvation by Christ, he will no longer stand insisting upon his fears but with comfort and joy, roll himself on Christ: the inward discoveries of the Gospel make his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations vanish; yea, he does not only rejoyce i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Two Things Promised,</p>

               </p>
               <p>To make the way to the Subject proposed more plain, I shall premise two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That there is a possibility of the Salvation of Sinners; for a sinner when his Conscience is awakened lies open to that temptation among others, that it is impossible for such an one as he to be saved: and these fears arise upon a double account; the first is, he fears it is beyond the mercy of God to pardon him; his sins are so great that they have turned away the heart of God from him, that God cannot find in his heart to pity and pardon such a sinner as he is: man is very prone to limit the mercy of God, and entertain low and dishonourable thoughts of his grace, especially when under a sense of his anger: but such an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as this is altogether groundless, what his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purposes are towards this or that particular man
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000434_0021_0FA5AB77109F89F8"/>
is beyond us to determine, till he makes it known: but no man has cause to question the sufficiency of Gods mercy, in order to his pardon and salvation: there is an infinite Ocean of mercy in his heart suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all sinners: To clear up this, I shall shew first, wherein the merciful nature of God does consist, and then shew you the greatness of it:</p>
               <p>For the first: The merciful nature of God is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfection, whereby he can find in his heart to shew mercy if he pleases: a merciful nature in man is a bent and inclination of heart unto the exercises of mercy: the heart of man is biassed, set and bent that way; but we must not conceive this of God: the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful purposes of God were the free actings of his own will: God was an absolute free Agent either to bestow mercy or deny it as he pleased; if he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally an inclination to shew mercy, he could not have forborn to shew mercy without going contrary to the inclination of his own heart: the exercise of mercy does not flow necessarily from the merciful nature of God: but he exercises grace freely from His Sovereign Wil and Pleasure: there is nothing in Gods nature that does compel him to shew mercy to any man: God had been infinite in mercy if it had pleased him never to exercise any: there are voluntary inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in God to exercise mercy, but no natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but his merciful nature is that whereby he can find in his heart to exercise mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is not of such a nature as to be uncapable of pitying and being kind: there is no opposition in the nature of God unto acts of mercy: his nature is such as that he can be willing to shew kindness and do good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the merciful nature of God is a power to be willing to deal graciously with his creatures, God is of such a nature, as that he can be willing to do good to those that are
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000434_0022_0FA5AB77C67F40F8"/>
unworthy, willing to pardon those that are guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is called his merciful nature: the words of <hi>Moses</hi> serve to clear up this, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17, 18, 19. <hi>Let the power of my Lord be great according as thou hast spoken,</hi> saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>the Lord is long suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don I beseech thee the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of thy mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the greatness of Gods mercy, or merciful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture consists in this, that he can find in his heart to do any thing that is an act of mercy: his merciful nature reacheth to every thing that is an object of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

else of the like nature may be thought on, fall within the reach of divine mercy; yea, the reason why he does not pardon the sin against the Holy Ghost, the sins of devils and reprobates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not for want of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but because of the soveraign determinations of his own will: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p>That God is thus great in mercy, may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from those two considerations:</p>
               <p>First, That there is no corruption in God to make him uncapable of performing any act of grace: men can't find in their hearts sometimes to do acts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, because their lusts are too strong for them: it will not suffer them: their corruptions bear such sway, that they cannot be willing: sometimes mens covetousness is such, that they cannot shew acts of mercy; so it was with <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. sometimes pride and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion so prevail, that they cannot forget an injury: they have a spirit of revenge, and cannot satisfie their hearts, without avenging themselves: but God is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free from corruption, there is no evil disposition in him to hinder him from doing good: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11: he has no evil properties to be an impediment unto him: men are ill conditioned, which makes them unwilling to do good: but God is of unspotted purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Isai.</hi> 6.3. God is not subject to any wrongful passions: the Scripture does often attribute anger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but that must be understood so as is agreeable unto the nature of God: whatever injuries God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, he never is transported with passion; he ean overlook millions of offences: his grace is such as can prevail over all our guilt: hence his grace is said to reign, it overcome all those objections that are in the way of the exercise of it: <hi>Rom</hi> 5.21. there is nothing of any unruly passions in God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. God is not subject unto envy: he can find in his heart to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000434_0024_0FA5AB7AA9A8EEA8"/>
his creatures unto eternal felicity: he does not scorn or disdain that dust and ashes should have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with him: God is not of such a spirit, that he cant bear that man should be happy, but he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to make him so, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18.</p>
               <p>By this we have gained one step, namely, that the grace of God does exceed the grace that is in sinful man: which may be of advantage to us, for there is that vanity in the heart, that we are prone to measure the mercy of God by our own: and to allow him no more grace than we find in our selves, and others like our selves: which God witnesses against when he tells us, <hi>That his thoughts are not as</hi> our <hi>thoughts, Isai.</hi> 55.8. but there is a further consideration that will make it appear, that the Grace of God does exceed the grace of the most glorious angel in heaven: which is the unlimited perfection of Gods nature, the <hi>Angels</hi> have a stint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d measure of perfection: the excelling of their nature is not sufficient in order to some acts of grace: as in other respects, they are not sufficient, so they have not grace enough to pardon such wrongs as God pardons; to be at such cost for mans salvation, as God has been at: 'tis true that they do approve of and rejoice in all those acts of Grace that God does? but such actions do exceed the grace that is in their hearts; they have can't perform those acts of mercy that God does: therefore where God would shew his sufficiency to pardon the iniquities of his people, he tells them, that <hi>God, Hos.</hi> 11.6. this infiniteness of Gods grace is the foundation of our faith, for such things as we are utterly unworthy of: <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.7. <hi>how excellent is thy loving kindness O Lord, therefore the Sons of men put their trust under the shadow of thy

                  </gap> gifts upon his creatures, that their natures are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of: this plain from that absolute liberty which the Scripture does ascribe unto God in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>he does all things after the counsel of his own Will</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eph. 1.11. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Rom</hi> 9.15. which shews there is no limitedness in his perfection, to be any restraint unto him: or a reason why he does not pardon and save these and those: his glorious excellency is such, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, nor provocation can overcome his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but there is a sufficiency of grace in him, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is an act of mercy.</p>
               <p>A second thing that makes awakened sinners fear, that there is an impossibility of their salvation, is an apprehension that it is contrary to the Justice o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Arg. I. <hi>The Righteousness of Christ is the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that the Law required of us: it answers the demand that the Law makes of us, and therefore it is safe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it.</hi>

                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:000434_0032_0FA5AB825F9FFE38"/>
5.18. <hi>One jot, or one tittle of the Law shall in no wise pass, till all be fulfilled</hi>: man may break the Law, but God will fulfil it; the Law is never out of date, and as it cannot be abrogated, so neither can it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: God will never take up with less satisfaction then the Law admits of, nor with a less perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then the Law requires: God does under the Gospel, accept of imperfect Obedience; but not for Justification. There can be no varying from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and highest demands of the Law: the Law is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and must be exactly attended: it abates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: so that a regular conscience can never give peace until the Law be fully answered: the Law gives sin a condemning power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. <hi>the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the Law must be answered.</p>
               <p>And it is sufficient for us if we have the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law; there is no danger of our miscarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we have that righteousness: the sincerity of the angels in heaven is, that they have the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law: and that is a sufficient sincerity, for us if we have the righteousness of the Law: if we have the righteousness of the Law, then we are not liable to the curse of the Law, we are not threatned by the Law, Justice is not provoked with us; the condemnation of the Law can take no hold upon us: the Law has nothing to object against our salvation: that soul that has the righteousness of the Law, is out of the reach of the threatnings of the law, where the demand of the Law is answered, the Law finds no fault; the Law curses only for want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. yea moreover where there is the righteousness of the Law, God has bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to give eternal life; such persons are heirs of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that it is that righteousness that the law requires of us: this is that consideration from which conscience does take satitfaction.</p>
               <p>But there lies one great objection against this, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> seems to make an opposition between the righteousness of the law, and the righteousness of faith, and between justification by the law, and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by grace, and by faith, and by the promise: so <hi>a man is not justified by the law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ, Gal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith, Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>the law is not of faith, Gal</hi> 2.12. <hi>if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise, gal.</hi> 3.5, 18. <hi>if there ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> I may be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ: the righteousness which is of God by faith, Phil</hi>: 3:9: <hi>by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, but now the righteousness of God without the law is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, Rom</hi>: 3:20, 31: <hi>we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law, Rom</hi> 3.28. <hi>if they that are of the law he heirs, faith is made void, Rom</hi>: 4:14: <hi>if by grace it is no more of works, Rom</hi>: 11:6: by these places it seems there is no need of having the righteousness of the law in order to our justification.</p>
               <p>The resolution of this doubt does depend upon the right understanding of what is meant by the law, and by the works of the law; by the law he intends a meer covenant of works, abstracted from that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of accomplishing of it, which God has revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Gospel, and thus the law is utterly uncapable of justifying of us; <hi>it is weak through the flesh, Rom</hi>: 8.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the way of life by the law, is distinguished from
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000434_0035_0FA5AB86059ABCF8"/>
that way by faith; for though the covenant of works leaves room for salvation by Christ, and does no way forbid such a way of salvation: yet it provides no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for fallen man; yea is utterly silent as to a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for him: leaves sinful man in a perishing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; denouncing the curse against him, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By the works of the law the Apostle understands, such works as men themselves do perform in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the law, this is evident, because he calls them <hi>his own righteousness which is of the Law, Phil.</hi> 3.9. and these works are utterly uncapable of justifying us: though Christs works according to the law, are the matter of our justification, <hi>Rom</hi>: 5.19. but our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal conformity to the law being attended with so much imperfection, can't justifie us: we must seek our justification by the righteousness that the law requires: but not by our own works according to the law, <hi>Israel</hi> is not blamed <hi>for seeking after the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that is the righteousness of the law; but becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this interpretation of the curse of the Law; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has provided a Mediator for us, and inflicted the punishment of our sins on him: which shews it is no ways contradictory to his law so to do: such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is agreeable to the law, otherwise God would never have had an hand in it; God has shewed us how the law is to be understood in executing it on Jesus Christ, and it is very unreasonable to think, that there should be any thing in the law to hinder our salvation by Jesus Christ; for this way of salvation has been decreed by God before the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>he was foreordained before the foundation of the world,</hi> and certainly he would never make such a law as should overthrow his decree: the law must be so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as not to cross his everlasting purposes of saving sinners by Christ; the Apostle argues, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace could not be disanulled by the law of <hi>Moses, which was given four hundred and thirty years after, Gal.</hi> 3.17. so I may argue, that the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purpose of God to save us by the sufferings of Christ, cannot be disanulled by a law that was made in time, and therefore that law must be so understood, as not to cross that design.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing to be cleared is,</p>
                  <p>

Christ stands in that relation of a Mediator, and this implies both duty and authority, to work out all our salvation for us, both as to the purchasing and also the applying of salvation: That Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is a Mediator, is set down in express terms: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and man,

                  <p>There are three things requisite unto the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torly Office of Christ, the fitness of his person, the consent of the Father, and his own consent:</p>
                  <p>The first thing requisite, was the fitness of his person, whereby he was capable of discharging this Office: it did not become infinite Wisdom to lay such a task on one that was uncapable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and this requisite was found in Jesus Christ: this undertaking was too great for any meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it was not too heavy a burden for the shoulders of Jesus Christ: he was fit to purchase our salvation, and also to apply it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon this account he was much prized by God, he is said to be <hi>Elect and Precious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. as a Prince prizes some men, because they are of such abilities, that they are fit to serve him in the greatest Offices of the Kingdom, so God having a design to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he prizes Christ as a person fit to bring about that design.</p>
                  <p>The principal fitness of Jesus Christ for the work of Mediator, consists in his being God man in our person, yet we must not think that he did not enter into his Office, till he was actually incarnate: the incarnation was necessary to his full discharge of that work, but he entred into his Office, and began to fulfil it before his incarnation: our sins were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually imputed to him, till his incarnation: but he was a Mediator immediately upon the fall of man: from that time his blood was efficacious, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>He is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world</hi>;

from the time of the making of the covenant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Christ by being man, was fitted as for some other parts of his Office, so especially to fulfil the law for man: to obey and suffer for us, had he been only God he had been uncapable of obedience or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; had he taken upon him the nature of angels, he had been uncapable of obeying and suffering for us: the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law concerning the right of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in the kinsman, did typifie that Christ should be our kinsman; this manifested what God intended: but that doth not prove that there was a necessity of it; but if he had assumed the angelical nature, he could not have fulfilled that law that was given to man: the precepts and curses of the law were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mans nature, and some of them could not be fulfilled By the angelical nature; besides the tenour of the covenant of works with man ran thus: that man must fulfil the righteousness of the law, and in case of disobedience, man must bear the curse of it: this the Apostle shews when he teaches us <hi>that because we did partake of flesh and blood, Christ also partook of the same. that by death be might deliver us, Heb.</hi> 2.14. and intimates, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. that if he had taken the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of angels, it would not have served the turn: and whereas he adds that he took on him <hi>the seed of Abraham</hi>; we are not to understand, that there was any necessity of that any further than from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and prophesies thereof, that he should come of that stock; but he mentions his coming of <hi>Abraham</hi>

                     </gap>at the fitness of Jesus Christ for the work of a Mediator, there were necessary some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial qualifications of the humane nature, especially holiness and wisdom: his holiness was necessary unto all his Offices: he would not have been fit to have executed his Prophetical Office without that; he had need be holy and faithful that is to declare the mind of God to man: without this he would not have bin fit to have executed the Office of a King, he that rules the world, and judges mens eternal estate, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the next verse, he repeats the argument in other terms: <hi>for if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life</hi>: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the argument is, that if God had so much love to us, as to send his Son to purchase our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, when we were Offenders, then certainly being brought into a state of reconciliation by <hi>Christ</hi> we shall be saved by him.</p>

The foundation that he builds this argument on is, That God had such love to sinners, as to send his Son to dye for them: this was an act of wonderful love: it was great love in Christ to come to dye, and great love in the Father to send him to dye: this was more than man could hope for when he had sinned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I shall pass by other considerations, to help to shew the greatness of his love, and onely select those five that serve to enforce the argument that lies before us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was great love that God should send his son to endure such sore sufferings for us; it was much that God should condescend upon any account that his Son should undergo such sufferings: it was a great thing that God should be willing that Christ should be brought into such a condition, when we consider the glorious excellency of his person, and the dear love of the Father to him, it may well be admired by us that God should find in his heart to put him upon such sufferings: we may well conclude that those persons for whose sakes all this was, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of God, that the heart of God was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily concerned in their good: it was a great thing for the glorious Son of God to suffer any thing, much more to bear what he did: his suffering was very great, <hi>he was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief,</hi> Isa. 53.4.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He suffered much pain, though many men have endured more, yet it was a great deal that the Son of God endured: especially when he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly scourged, and after that crucified; that manner of death was exquisitely painful, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22 16. <hi>they pierced my hands and my feeet</hi>: the nailing of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

to the cross, and the weight of his body being born by those wounded parts for so many hours, could not be without exquisite pain: he expresses it <hi>by his bones being out of joint, Psal.</hi> 22.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it must needs be a terrible torture, because persons that were crucified, was not wont to be very long in that condition before they dyed. The suddenness of their death could not be from the meer effusion of blood, but the exquisiteness of their pain contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He suffered much disgrace, he endured all manner of indignities from men: he of whom God said, let all the Angels of God worship him; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected himself to great contempt: they flouted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his sweating great drops of blood, so probably of his suddain death: he dyed before the others that were crucified with him, of which it is hard to assign any other reason than this, that the sence of Gods wrath much hastened his death, as God tells <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>no man can see his face and live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> that is the sight of Gods love and glory as the Saints see it in heaven, is such that the nature of man in this state of mortality can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. He suffered a state of death, and he continued in a state of death for some time; his body and soul were rent asunder: which state is contrary unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the union of body and soul was dissolved, and his body left for a time stark dead, and his soul in a preternatural estate of separation, a state which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does abhorr; exceeding contrary to the instinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and inclination of nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was great love for God to send his son to dye for us, when we had grievously offended him: for we were looked upon under that consideration, when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God sent his Son to dye for our salvation: 'tis true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And God certainly knew that the Elect that were

and discharge from that guilt which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit,</hi> the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> expresses it thus: <hi>he was quickned in the spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi>: 3 18: so that when he was quickned, he was justified, Christ could never have been delivered out of the hands of Justice, if he had not paid the uttermost farthing. Hence we are said to have a <hi>lively hope by the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3 <hi>God has begotten its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a lively hope by the resurrection of Christ from the dead</hi>: this consideration is a means by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to beget a lively hope in us: the ground of our hope is the resurrection of Christ; it might better be rendred a living hope: the same word is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred living, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2:4 this is such an hope as will abide and continue, the hope that is built upon the foundation, will never fail; other hopes may dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but this is a living hope, a parallel Scripture to this is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Conscience sees in the resurrection of Christ, the satisfactoriness of his sufferings, and has peace on that account that the debt is paid; and upon the same account it is that <hi>Paul</hi> attributes power to the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ, <hi>Phil</hi>: 3.10. <hi>that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection,</hi> when God sets this consideration home upon the heart, it has a mighty comforting power: this will raise up a drooping spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: when a man is distressed indeed with the guilt of sin, the world has no power to comfort him, his

               <p>Argument 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that are commanded of God to believe in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ may safely appear before</hi> God <hi>in the righteousness of Christ: but we are commanded by God to believe in the righteousness of Christ: though the calls of the</hi> Gospel <hi>are many times propounded in a way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>I might argue the safety of coming unto Christ, from thence that we are invited to come unto him for help: for surely in those invitations God does not go about to delude men, and lovingly draw them in to take such a method for the salvation of their fools, as would fail them: 'tis not to be imagined, that the glorious God would with great seeming love to the souls of men, draw them into a snare, and with an appearance of good-will to them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise them to take a course that were not safe: it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t to be thought that God would lovingly, and with a great deal of tenderness perswade men to set their feet on slippery places, and build their hopes upon a sandy foundation: there is no soul delusion in the Gospel: he would not urge men with such compassion to put their trust in Christ, but that the well-fare of their souls is secured
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000434_0113_0FA5ACE81F20A4A8"/>
thereby: they may without fear venture upon the counsel and entreaties of the Lord: being secure in that that God will not lead them into danger: when God advises us to trust in Christ, he commands this way to us as a way of safety: for 'tis no part of love to advise us to put our confidence in a broken reed: but besides what might be argued this way, these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations have in them, the force of commands, and lay us under duty in obedience unto God, to come unto Christ: as there is love in these calls, so there is author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>quired to come. God does prescribe this way, and enforce it both by his love and also his authority: God that has put Jesus Christ into office, doth require us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in all his offices, <hi>Psal</hi>: 2:12. and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways to be putting our trust in him: therefore this is called <hi>the work of</hi> God, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. this is the great business that he has set us to do; and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>his commandment,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which shews not only that it is commanded, but that this is the special commandment, that God lays peculiar weight upon and hence it is a sin for men not to believe in Jesus Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>This command of believing in Christ is a brand of the second commandment in the Law: by that command it is required, that we should worship i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that way that he appoints, that we should attend such worship as is instituted by him, &amp; not devised by ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is the great institution of God under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, that we worship him by Jesus Christ, seek to God through him, and believe in

God thorough him: Jesus Christ is the great ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that God has set up to be worshipped by: Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ as God is to be worshipped with divine worship, by vertue of the first command: Jesus Christ as mediator, is the means whereby we are to draw nigh to God, by vertue of the second command, as the sacrifices of old were a principal ordinance whereby God was to be worshipped, so Christ who was typified by those sacrifices, was and is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ordinance whereby fallen man is to draw nigh unto God: and through whom we are to believe in him.</p>
               <p>And this command of God does argue the safety of appearing in Christs Righteousness, the command of God does evidence our assured salvation in this way: this would never have been commanded of God if it were not safe.</p>
               <p>And this appears by three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be commanded, that we believe in Jesus Christ Righteousness, then it is lawful for us so to do; God would never put us upon that, which its own nature is not lawful, it must needs be a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing for us to put our trust in the righteousness of Christ: there can be no unlawfulness in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which God requires: but if it were not safe to appear in the righteousness of Christ, it could not be lawful to believe in it; it would be an irregular thing to put our trust therein and that on two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It would be a putting of too much honour upon Christ and his righteousness: if it were not
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:000434_0115_0FA5ACEB0A937560"/>
safe appearing in Christ Righteousness, then Christs Righteousness were not worthy to be believed in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it were not safe trusting in it, then we should give too high a commendation to it, when we believe in it: for when we believe in it, we proclaim it to be safe so to do: it would be an idolizing of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teousness, to trust in it, if it were not safe so to do; it is a fault to believe in that which cannot save: when we believe in Christs Righteousness, we give him the honour of having purchased salvation for us, if it were not safe to trust in Christs righteousness, then in so doing we should give him a glory that belongs not to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It would be self-flattery for us to believe in the righteousness of Christ; if it were not safe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in it, it could not be lawful to trust in it: to trust in it would be presumption, what would it be, but to delude our selves, and to please our selves with an idle dream, which would deceive us: men are blamed in the Word of God for such confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.8. it is not lawful or warrantable for us to believe in that which we have not sufficient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to believe in; but we have not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent encouragement to believe in the righteousness of Christ; if it be not safe to appear be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it our duty to trust in that which is not a sufficient ground of faith: it were an hard lesson to be bound in conscience to do that, which we could not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our consciences in doing: it were wildness for any man to imagine that God should command us to love that which is not lovely, or to mourn for that which is not matter of sorrow, or to rejoyce in that which is not matter of joy: so it is to think that God should require us to trust in that which is not a ground of confidence: that would be very hard for God to bind us to put our confidence in that which we could not put our confidence in, except we were out of our wits: if it were not safe to trust in Christs righteousness, what could induce us to do it, except we were under a delusion: it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature for man to put confidence in any thing but under this notion, that there is ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in it: what perswasions can prevail to make men rest on that, which they could not safely rest upon: the Lord is a righteous God, and gives no such unequal command, all his commands are righteous, he requires but what is equal, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119:138.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God commands us to believe on the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Jesus Christ then we must do it upon pain of damnation, if we fail thereof: every sin does by Law deserve death: and the continuance in the neglect of any known command does unavoidably bring death and ruine, and so the neglect of this command, <hi>John</hi> 3.18 <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it is madness to believe in Christ, and will God punish us for not acting the part of mad men: it were an unreasonable thing for a man to believe in Christ if it were not safe so to do; and therefore unreasonable that he should be punished for not doing of it: will God damn man for not building their hopes for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen upon the sand? will God cast a man into Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will not embrace a delusion, and put his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in a broken Reed? the Lord is a righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Because they believe on Christ, and venture their souls upon him 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16 <hi>Believed on in the World,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>I have written to you that believe on the Son of God</hi>: and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is is the effect of their assurance, that it is safe appearing in Christs righteousness: if they were not convinced of that, no Arguments would perswade them to venture upon Christ: when men come to Christ they come under that conviction, that it is safe coming unto him: the <hi>Gospel works effectually in them that believe,</hi> 1 Thess. 2.13. every one that comes to Christ <hi>hath the witness in himself,</hi> 1 Joh. 5 10. this makes them come with boldness unto Christ; tho there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others that are afraid to come: if they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the truth of the Gospel they would be afraid to come too: they would not dare to cast themselves on Christ, before they were convinced they withstood all Arguments that could be used with them: they had their answers ready, and their excuses at hand, they had an unperswadable spirit, somewhat to turn off all that could be said: and the reason that now they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture themselves on Christ is not any self-excellency, for they come to him when they are at word, when they see the plague of their own hearts; but is it because they are convinced of the safety that is in Christ: <hi>to them that believe Christ is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because they have comfortable and gracious hopes of glory: there be many flattering hopes of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness that ungodly men do entertain, that depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000434_0122_0FA5ACF040064578"/>
their vain conceits; but the people of God have a gracious hope of glory: and the hopes of the people of God do principally depend on the conviction of these two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is safety in Christs righteousness; and then that they have an interest in it, have received it: their Faith of dependance arises from the conviction of the first, but their hope arises from both together: 'tis true that their hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s do rise from the belief of other promises of glory, together with a sight of the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in themselves that are mentioned in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: thus Saints have hope from those promises that are made to those that love God, that mortifie sin, that love the Saints, that are patient under afflictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the fundamental promise of the Gospel is that which is made to believing in Christ: and the hopes of christians do principally arise from the conviction of Christs righteousness, together with our interest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 8. <hi>Believing ye rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of glory</hi>: Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with joy and peace in believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This conviction is not the fruit of mens natural reason; natural reason tho advantaged with external revelation, cannot satisfie the heart that it is safe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the righteousness of Christ: natural reason may work some conviction of this truth, and discover so much of it that a man may come to look upon it very rational and probable: but it cannot discover the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it: flesh and blood can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t reveal that: natural reason may make such a discovery of this truth, that they may be urged in conscience to believe in Christ, and condemned in conscience for not believing in him, that they may think those hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y that do believe in him: that they judg those grosly erroneous that do deny
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:000434_0123_0FA5ACF5A00989C0"/>
this Doctrine: but yet it will not give such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction as can assure the soul that it is so indeed, men are apt to think that they are satisfied, that there is safety in relying on the righteousness of Christ, only they question whether God does call them as the case is circumstanced with them to rely upon him, but they delude themselves: mans reason does not discover the certainty of this truth by all the helps that the world does afford; yea, though they do partake of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward common illumination: <hi>the nature of man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually discerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. There is a twofold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in natural reason that hinders men from receiving of this Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Natural reason cannot apprehend that <hi>God</hi> can find in his heart to save sinners on the account of Christs righteousness: when men come to be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and have a sence of the guilt of sin, and wrath of <hi>God,</hi> it will not eater into them, that <hi>God</hi> can be free to forgive them, and save them on the account of Christs blood; they are strangers unto the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nature of <hi>God</hi>: and hence are seeking to get some worthiness of their own, to pacifie <hi>God</hi> with: and can't conceive that God is willing to pardon them, who are so unworthy; except they were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better: they think they must have something to commend them to God: they think it would be mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for them as bad as they are to venture on Christs bloud. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. <hi>the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness</hi>: they have strange and low thoughts of the mercy of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.8.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:000434_0124_0FA5ACF7A81BFD78"/>2. Natural reason will not make men believe Gods testimony; natural reason will not beget faith: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men are in Scripture described to be unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>John.</hi> 5, 46. natural reason will not lay weight on the testimony of God: no man will receive Gods testimony, and act faith thereupon, until he knows God, <hi>Paul says, I know him whom I have believed,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. and every man must know God before he will believe him: many men do entertain some of the things that God says; so the Devils believe and tremble: but those perswasions rise from the convictions, and not from faith in Gods Word. No man will receive any thing meerly on Gods testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, until he know him: and therefore will not be assured of that which he can know no other way but by faith, and which carnal reason has many obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The conviction of this Truth is by the Spirit of God: it is the work of Gods Spirit to satisfie the heart in this, that it is safe appearing in the righteousness of Christ: God does create light in the mind to discover this: the outward call of the Gospel presents the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before men, and the work of the Spirit is to give men eyes to see the truth of it: mens natural reason makes them understand the sense of the Proposition: and the Spirit of God puts a new light in them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they understand the truth of the Proposition: their perswasion about this is the fruit of Divine Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>This I shall shew from several Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</p>
               <p>John 16.7, 8. <hi>The comforter will reprove the World of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment</hi>: in this Text for the clearing of what is before us, we shall take notice of three things:</p>

                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:000434_0125_0FA5ACF7CF97D628"/>1. That the comforter here is the Spirit of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this is clear not only because he was a person sent to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in and succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> also because he is called <hi>the Spirit of truth,</hi> John 14.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. <hi>He shall give you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the works of the Spirit here is conviction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> so 'tis in the Margent, the word signifies to convince by Argument and Reason; and here is the Argument that the Spirit shall convince by <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Because I go to my Father and ye see me no more,</hi> so the word is used, <hi>John</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 14.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the thing that the Spirit does convince of, is our safety in Christs Righteousness: it is his righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ness that he speaks of: for his going to the Father is the argument of it; and it is the sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his righteousness to our salvation,</p>
               <p>This is clear by two things:</p>
               <p>First, Because the Spirit is promised to confirm the Doctrine of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>And then Secondly, because the argument menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>verse</hi> 10 does confirm this truth: Christs As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention to the right-hand of God, shews, that he has performed the work he came for, and wrought righteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, commeth unto me</hi>: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this is not that all that were godly among the Jews, that had been taught of God, should acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and depend on him: this is indeed a truth, that upon the setting of convincing light before them they would do it: so did <hi>Nathaniel Joh.</hi> 1.49. the <hi>Eunuch, Act.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi>: this is not the meaning, for when he says every one that hath heard &amp; learned of the Father, he means every one that has been taught by God the Doctrine of the <hi>New-Testament:</hi> and he speaks of such teaching as did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately draw men to Christ: but the meaning is, that they who have been taught the Gospel by God, will believe on Christ: so that this is clear from hence it is the work of God to encourage men to come to Christ: and God encourages men by satisfying their hearts in the safety that is in the righteousness of Christ. that perswasion that draws men to Christ is wrought by God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We may well argue, that if they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced throughly by the spirit, that they will never be utterly carried away with unbelief to reject the truth: but we cannot conclude that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt: men may call those things in question which they have learned by the spirit of God: so the <hi>Prophet</hi> did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13 17, 18, 19. yea, men may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion things that they have been taught by the saving work of the spirit: God revealed it to the Disciples, that Jesus was the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17. yet afterwards they questioned it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.21. <hi>they say, we verily thought it had been he that should have redeemed Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>: the <hi>Psalmist</hi> no doubt had been convinced that God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and yet afterwards, he had such workings of heart as these, <hi>verily I have cleansed my heart in vain,</hi> Psa. 73.13: and it is no wonder, for the blindness of the mind is but in part removed, and sometimes they have not the exercise of that light which is in them: the Devil is busie to throw scruples and objections into their hearts; and they have several principles in themselves that lead them to doubt of those things that God has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them of: they have a principle of unbelief, carnal reason and enmity to the truth, so that it is no wonder that they have doubts about it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But there are two wayes whereby the truth of this is evident above exception.</p>
               <p>One is by the testimony of Gods Word; the Scripture does commonly give the title of Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believers, hence that title of Saints in Christ Jesus is given to the <hi>Church at Philippi,</hi> 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. so they are called holy brethren, that are partakers of the heavenly calling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. and Saints, and fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another way whereby it is made evident, is by the experience of many saints: hereby it is made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to them, though not unto the world: every

                  </gap>at change in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, though they have many fears whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a life of holiness that they live, it is exercising unto them whether they go beyond hypocrites, and are acted by any higher principles than self-love and conscience: yet there be several that at times do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently see a spirit of holiness working in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: so that their consciences do bear witness that they are the children of God: besides what they do perceive of a daily bent of heart to keep Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; there are at times more visible and sensible actings of grace: there are times when the strings are wound up to the height, when grace breaks forth as the light: and the heart is satisfied in that; that he has a spirit of holiness, <hi>John</hi> 21.17. <hi>Lord thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee: Psal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was also upright before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this sanctification which the people of God have, they have in a way of believing: some take sanctification so largely, as to comprehend the work of regeneration: and count regeneration also an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of closing with Christ: but I will not now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss that controversy; though there is no doubt but regeneration is the fruit of Christs purchase: but I take sanctification for that work of Gods spirit, whereby he does more and more purge away the remainders of sin, and carry on the work of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the hearts of his people, and this is the fruit of faith in Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>they are sanctified by faith that is in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me</hi>; and this sanctification comes from Christs purchase, he has by his death redemed us from the power of sin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2 4. <hi>who gave himself for us, that he might

               <p>Which we may consider under these two heads of peace of conscience and communion with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The people of God in a way of believing, have peace of conscience: and this is not a particular priviledge of some believers, but a blessing that all do in some degree partake of: those men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their coming to Christ, were under the terrors of an evil conscience, conscience was terrifying of them, and binding them over to eternal judgement, do upon their closing with Christ, enjoy a tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind, and inward peace.</p>
               <p>Indeed this peace may be interrupted and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because of darkness and temptations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause conscience is but in part satisfyed: but they are never brought back to take up such conclusions, against themselves as before their closing with Christ, but commonly they do enjoy some comfortable sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of heart: <hi>have the answer of a good conscience by the resurrection of Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. this comes to pass by these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:000434_0140_0FA5AD0C0F8D4AF0"/>1. When a soul comes to Christ, the soul is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that there is peace with God, to be obtained in a way of coming to Christ, that there is safety in coming to Christ: the inward call of the Gospel satisfies the soul that there is salvation in Christ for all that come to him: conscien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The first act of closing with Christ is not so sensibly done, but that he does take some notice of it: some after acts of faith may be more plain, and in continuance of time the soul may lose the exact knowledge of the time of his first closing with <hi>Christ</hi> and the circumstances of it: but this first closing with Christ is not so secret a thing, but that it falls under the observation of conscience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22.</p>
               <p>This is clear For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The act it self is very observable: when the soul comes at first to close with Christ, there is a weighty change wrought in it, it is a thing quite contrary to what he has been doing; he has been reasoning against it, making objections, standing out against all the pleadings of God with him, but now when he closes with Christ, he lets fall all his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and gives entertainment unto Christ, before he despised him, now he prizes him, before argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did not sink into him, now they do, now he makes Christ well-come: this is exceeding remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, easy to be observed, this carriage of the soul is

A carnal man may have many internal discoveries of God, and be mightily affected therewith; but they do not properly enjoy any communion with him: but the people of God doe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ</hi>: the fullnes of this is reserved in heaven, but there is an inchoation of it here: God had communion with <hi>Abraham</hi> and others of old in a visible appearance, and now has commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Saints, though in a more spiritual manner.</p>
               <p>And there are four particular ways of it, that <hi>I</hi> shall mention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By discovering his own glorious nature to them: sometimes God breaks out of the clouds, and makes a discovery of his own glory to the soul: he has promised to the pure in heart that they shall see God: and sometimes he does cause his glory to pass before the soul: sometimes God makes a special dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:000434_0143_0FA5AD0E52441620"/>
of one of his attributes, and sometimes of another, of his soveraignty, holiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mercy, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, <hi>Job.</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>now mine eye seeth thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>we all with open face behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord</hi>: hereby men come to know God, other men have notions of God, but a Saint knows him:</p>
               <p>And there are two effects of these discoveries.</p>
               <p>One is a drawing out of the actings of grace, they put new life into the soul: they are very quickening and powerful on the heart.</p>
               <p>The other is, That they enkindle a desire to know more of God: they make the soul long after further acquaintance with God, <hi>to see his power and glory, as they have seen him in the Sanctuary,</hi> Psal. 63.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By revealing of Christ and gospel-grace unto the soul. God does not only at first conversion, but many times after, make a discovery of Christ, to the soul, the Lord shews the soul the safety of this way of salvation; Saints long for this: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10 <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrectiion:</hi> and God is at times gratifying them: Christ is openi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g this mystery of the Gospel unto them; the Lord draws nigh and holds forth the Scepter of mercy, the acceptableness of his sacrifice, the freeness of his grace, the wonderfulness of his love, the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of salvation in a way of believing: and these discoveries that the Lord makes of the Gospel, doe answer all the objections of the heart, that though the soul was before in an unbelieving frame, he has power to resist no longer: these discoveries make Christ very precious, he esteems him as one that
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000434_0144_0FA5AD0F0378E2B0"/>
does indeed save from sin and wrath: these discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries make the soul contented with Christ: he sees he needs nothing but this righteousness to carry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: he has done looking out else-where for help, yea he takes delight in this way of salvation, it is a way that pleases, he counts it glorious, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By promises of particular mercies: God does draw nigh to some of his people, and by his spirit make known unto them that he will bestow some particular mercy upon them: thus he sometimes promises assistance in their works, recovery from sickness, publick deliverance: of old God has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Prophets made particular promises to wicked men, as to <hi>Abab and Jehu</hi>: whether he does any such thing by his spirit now to those that are carnal men, is not so certain: but undoubtedly he does to some Saints: and that in answer to their prayers: when they have been begging a mercy for God, he by some promise gives assurance to the soul, that the request shall be fullfilled.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By witnessing his love to the soul: God does not only help the soul to gather it by consequence, but God by his spirit does evidence the same to the soul: that he may quicken the heart in holiness, and that he may help the soul under temptations and sinking discouragements; or arm him against some special conflicts, he gives witness to his good estate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. this differs much from those tasts that hypocrites may have; wherein they have some sence of the sweetness that is in promises: for this is by way of testimony: yea the spirit does make it manifest at that time that it is his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: and hereby this differs from the delusions
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:000434_0145_0FA5AD0FBAD71858"/>
of Satan: as the Prophets knew it to be the Lord that revealed things unto them: so Saints at the time knew it to be the Spirit of God that witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to them; they do not need any other help at that time to know it to be the voice of God: they do not need a candle to see the Sun: though soon after they may have doubts.</p>
               <p>Thus I have cleared up the assumption of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, it remains that somewhat be added to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the proposition, that it must needs be safe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in that righteousness upon the account of which God does bestow the beginnings of salvation here:</p>
               <p>And I may evidence that from these two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>The first Principle is, That righteousness which does purchase any part of the good of the covenant, does purchase the whole good of the covenant: by the righteousness of Christ believers stand already possessed of some part of the good of the covenant and that righteousness that brought them into the possession of that, will in due time bring them into the possession of what remains: for that which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases any part of the good of the covenant, must needs purchase the whole: the condition upon which all the good of the covenant depends was one, so that the good of the covenant must be wholy purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or wholly forfeited: it could not be in part purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; in part forfeited; the condition of the covenant of works was perfect righteousness, if that were performed, all the good of the covenant was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, if that were not performed, all the good of the covenant was forfeited, an imperfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would not purchase any one good thing mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:000434_0146_0FA5AD10F0ED0258"/>
in the covenant: one sin was sufficient to break the whole covenant, and expose unto death: one sin would make a course of righteousness for many years utterly ineffectual unto the purchase of any good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lay the sinner open unto the curse of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. whatever was done tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the performance of the condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, signified nothing, except the full was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that God required: so the condition of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Mediator was perfect obedience to the law of the Mediator, <hi>viz.</hi> perfect obedience to the commands of the law, and perfect bearing of the curse: 'tis true that the active and passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ have a distinct respect one of them to the possession of good, the other to the removal of evil; the one is meritorious, the other satisfactory, one procures the blessings promised, the other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the evils threatned: but yet Christ being made under such a covenant, the success of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the other, and they are joyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the purchasing cause of our salvation: and one of them would have had no efficacy at all towards our salvation, is not accompanied with the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that this principle stands firm, that that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that does not procure all the good of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, procures none, that righteousness can purchase no good for us, that is not sufficient for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat salvation, that cannot purchase the beginnings of salvation that does not justifie us: seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the account of Christs righteousness w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> have already the beginnings of salvation, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is sufficient for our Justification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>The Second Principle is,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:000434_0147_0FA5AD15768CF740"/>That God in giving the beginnings of salvation in a way of believing in Christs righteousness for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does own that to be the way of salvation: God does in this way give such mercies as are evidences of his savour, and such as do accompany salvation: he subdues sin, quickens the heart in holiness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his loving kindness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herein God does plainly testifie, that this is the way to salvation: <hi>and that the righteousness of Christ was the procuring cause of salvation: if the righteousness of Christ</hi> were not sufficient for our salvation, God would be angry with us for believing in Christs righteousness, we might expect frowns and judgments in this way: but Gods giving the beginnings of salvation in this way, does eminently own it to be the way of life: when did God in such a way own men in a way of depending upon their own righteousness or external priviledges? they have some common mercies, but none of the beginnings of salvation: but the beginnings of salvation being bestowed in this way, are an evident sign of divine approbation of it, God bore witness to the Apostles preaching this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>by many wonderful signs, Heb.</hi> 2.4. and he bears witness to those that by faith receive this doctrine by wonderful gracious effects in them, he gives the earnest of heavenly glory: which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews the efficacy of this righteousness which they trust in, to accomplish their salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> I 13, 14. <hi>in whom after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>IT is safe appearing before God in that righteousness, the efficacy whereof unto salvation we are taught in the Sacraments of the New-Testament:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the Sacraments of the New-Testament, we are taught the efficacy of Christ righteousness unto salvation: God in these Sacraments is by sensible signs teaching of us this truth: so that in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:000434_0149_0FA5AD19319E2600"/>1. We are taught the efficacy of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness unto salvation, by the ordinance of Baptism; as 'tis said of circumcision, that it was a seal of the righteousness of Faith; so is baptism; the washing of water, signifies our washing in the blood of Christ: as the legal washings had a respect unto the cleansing away of sin by Christs blood, so has our baptismal washing: this ordinance practised first by <hi>John,</hi> and afterwards appointed by Christ to be a perpetual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in the gospel church, is appointed on this design to strengthen our Faith in this Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This appears, because by baptism is held forth our fellowship with Christ in his sufferings, that is signified thereby, that we have an interest in the vertue of his sufferings; that his sufferings are made over unto us, that we do participate in the good and benefit of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 3. <hi>so many of us as were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death</hi>; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>here was sealed up unto us the vertue and efficacy of his death: therefore <hi>verse</hi> 4. <hi>we are said to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him by baptism into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Baptism is appointed to be a seal to this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of faith in the righteousness of Christ; 'tis a confirmation of this doctrine, and the covenant of God to give salvation through faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Because Baptism represents and shews forth the washing away the guilt of our sins by the blood of Christ.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. Baptism does save us, as it is a shadow of some spiritual thing: therefore it is said, the like figure even Baptism saves us: not but that Baptism has some real influence into salvation, as indeed all Ordinances have, so the Types of old: but the salvation he attr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our hearts in this Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God teach us this in the Sacraments of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> this shews that it lies much upon the heart of God to strengthen our Faith in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that it is safe appearing before God in Christs Righteousness: this shews that God is very careful that we may believe in Christ, if we see a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise another an Estate, make an instrument of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, sets his hand, and adds his Seal to it, we conclude that he desires to give him all manner of assurance, and would leave no room for doubting: so when we see God sending his servants to witness in his Name, that there is salvation in Christ; that he gives it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, has left it upon Record in his Word, and adds also, sensible signs for the establishment of our Faith, we may conclude that God is very careful to leave no room for doubting in this particular: his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is to put the thing out of all question: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God would never thus busie himself to delude us, nor take such care to satisfie us in this particular, but that this is the very way of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this be the thing that God teaches us in the Sacraments of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> then there are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:000434_0154_0FA5AD1C8BB2C428"/>
Ordinances founded upon this Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through the blood of Christ: this Doctrine is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that these Ordinances are built upon: the design of these holy Ordinances is to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to us of our Redemption and Salvation by the blood of Christ: and indeed the Ordinance of the Ministry is founded upon the same bottom: if this Doctrine were not true, there had been no occasion for these Ordinances: as it was with the Sacraments of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> they were seals of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith; so are the Sacraments of the <hi>New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>: and certain it is, that all the Ordinances of God are built upon realities: who can imagine that God would appoint any Ordinance, that should be like the stock, that is the graven Image, <hi>a Doctrine of Vanities,</hi> Jer. 10.8. God delights in no Worship but what has a good foundation: in the Sacraments God requires us to worship him, in a religious attendance upon him while he is teaching us this Doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the righteousness and blood of Christ: in the Sacraments God requires us to worship him in a religious acknowledgment of the truth of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and this would never be if the Doctrine were not infallibly true: God needs no such Worship as is not built upon a real foundation, it is not suitable to give him any Worship, that is not built upon realities, God would never accept any such honour as this from us, much less require us to give it him; if this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by the blood of Christ were not true: to deny the Doctrine of Salvation by the blood of Christ is to make the Sacrament a meer mockery: in the Sacrament God does by sacred Ordinances wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the salvation of Believers; and he will never prophane his own Ordinances by failing in the performance of that promise: these Sacraments being
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:000434_0155_0FA5AD1D8B149410"/>
Ordinances appointed of God to teach us this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of salvation by Christs blood, we are thereby warranted to pray for a blessing upon them, for the furtherance of our spiritual and eternal good: but this we might not do, if the Doctrine held forth by them were not true: the Sacraments being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to testifie this Doctrine to us; we have a warrant in the celebration of them and at other times to praise and bless the Lord for sending Christ Jesus to work out salvation for us: but certainly if this Doctrine were not true, there would be no reason for us so to do, neither would the Lord accept of such praises: if there were not certain salvation to be had by Christ, no man alive can give a reason of the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacraments, nor salve the honour of God who has appointed them to teach us this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of salvation by the righteousness of Christ.</p>
               <p>There be two things principally that may be objected against this Doctrine:</p>
               <p>Objection 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Faith is said to be imputed for righteousness,</hi> Rom. 4.3, 21, 22. Gen. 15.5, 6. to which it may be added, <hi>that Faith under the Gospel comes in the room of works that were required under the Law: hence Faith and Works are so often opposed by the</hi> Apostle <hi>in the matter of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Rom. 3.28. Gal. 2.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>That Faith that is imputed to us for righteousness; is believing in Jesus Christ: it is not any act of Faith nor any other act of justifying Faith that is imputed
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:000434_0156_0FA5AD1E28EE93A0"/>
for righteousness but only believing in Christ: this is evident, because that is the description of justifying Faith in other places of the Scripture; <hi>he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him shall have everlasting life,</hi> John 3 6. this Faith is described, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him, that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead</hi>: here this Faith is described;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is Faith on God: a relying or depending upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The consideration under which, this is acted on God, that is as having raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; that is, as having wrought out salvation for us by Jesus Christ: it may be objected against this interpretation, that this Faith that was imputed for righteousness to <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>a blessing God,</hi> Rom. 4.3. and the promise that he believed was a promise of a numerous posterity: <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Faith of his did include in it a believing of the promised seed, and a believing on him: God had before promised, <hi>that in him all the families of the earth should be blessed, Gen.</hi> 12.3. and now he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises him a posterity like the stars in number: and <hi>Abraham</hi> entertains this promise as it included in it the promised seed, and as Christ says, rejoyced to see his <hi>day, and saw it, and was glad, Job</hi> 8.56. this was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned unto him for Righteousness, this is plain from Gal. 3.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith in Jesus Christ does interest us in the righteousness of Jesus Christ: whoever has this faith has the righteousness of Christ: God might have made over this righteousness of Christ to us without any condition if he pleased, or upon any other, but
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:000434_0157_0FA5AD1EE4FB8B68"/>
faith was suitable and God has appointed this to be the way of our partaking in the righteousness of Christ: and hereby men come to have an interest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that: men come to have an interest in Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness called gold and white raiment, by buying that of him, that is, by believing on him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>The righteousness of God is through Faith in Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 3.9. so that all that have this faith, have the righteousness of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is very probable that the Apostle intends no more, when he sayes Faith is imputed for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then this, that Believers are reckoned righteous, through the righteousness of Christ: the phrase seems to import somewhat else, then if he had said, that their Faith was their righteousness: to be reckoned for righteousness seems to note to be accepted in stead of personal righteousness: and so Faith is accepted through the righteousness of Christ: this is further confirmed from that phrase, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>He became heir of the righteousness which is by Faith,</hi> that is, of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, which is applied unto us by Faith: and there is no necessity of understanding any thing more by that phrase, <hi>the righteousness of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11, 13. but the righteousness which we have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in by Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet it may be granted without danger, that Faith is our evangelical righteousness, but not our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal righteousness: God has made two covenants with men, the one is the covenant of works, the other the covenant of grace: in the covenant of works perfect holiness is the condition, that is the righteousness that must be fulfilled in order unto life: in the covenant of Grace believing is the condition, and this may be

called Gospel righteousness: because according to the terms of the Gospel all Believers are declared righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the sight of God: and the promise of salvation is made unto believing: but believing is not our legal righteousness, it does not answer the demands of the Law; there is a necessity of the righteousness of Christ which is legal righteousness, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1.30. and indeed Faith could not have been the condition of salvation, had it not interested us in the righteousness of the Law: the covenant of Works and covenant of Grace also must be fulfilled or we cannot be saved: Christ fulfilled the covenant of works for us, and gives us Faith in his righteousness, whereby we fulfil the covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas it is added to stengthen the Objection that Faith under the Gospel comes in the room of works under the Law; and therefore as works under the Law were to be the matter of justification, so is Faith under the Gospel:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith does not under the Gospel properly come in the room of works, for works are necessary under the Gospel unto Justification: works are the purchasing cause of life: only God has found out another way of performing those works than the Law speaks of, namely, by a Surety: but yet perfect Obedience is as necessary as at first, for our Justification: the Gospel does not justifie us in any way of contradiction to the Law: works now are the legal condition of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but Faith is the evangelical condition of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and every Believer does fulfil both those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions, one in his Surety, the other in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; Faith is the condition of the covenant of Grace,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:000434_0159_0FA5AD2053FDBCA0"/>
and Faith interests us in the righteousness of Christ, whereby the covenant of works is also fulfilled: and when the Apostle does oppose Faith, and the works of the Law, he does not oppose Faith to the works of the Law as performed by Christ; for they work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our Justification: but he opposes it to our works, that our works in obedience to the Law can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver justifie us: works under the Law were the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing cause of Justification, and so they are still: works under the Law were the condition of Justification and they only: but now they are the legal condition, and Faith is the evangelical condition: Faith is all the condition required to be performed by us in our own persons.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To the first part of the Objection from promises of forgiveness made to Obedience: I Answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That forgiveness is not alwayes taken in Scrp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the act of Justification, whereby God does take off the sentence of eternal condemnation. but many times it is taken for Gods overlooking sin so as not to bring that temporal calamity that he might have done: so when God removes a temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is said to forgive their sins, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. so when he forbears to destroy a people that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it, and only brings some less judgments on them, he is said to forgive them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 99.8. <hi>Thou wast a God that forgavest them though thou tookest vengeance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000434_0161_0FA5AD239B770950"/>
when God makes promises of forgiveness unto obedience and reformation: the meaning is, that God will prosper them and bless, and not pursue them with Judgments and calamities: this is evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sometimes God promises forgiveness to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a way of obedience, it is promised as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional blessing: so in that <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. therefore it does not intend deliverance from eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for God does not promise that as a publick blessing, depending upon publick reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes when God promises forgiveness unto Obedience, the meaning is, that if the soul do return unto God by a true work of conversion he shall be justified: when men are converted they are brought into a state of acceptance with God: God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto them: so that place is to be understood, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him:</hi> Act 3.19. <hi>repent therefore and be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes when forgiveness is promised unto particular acts of Obedience, the meaning is that those acts of obedience are a sign that a man is in a justified condition: so that is to be understood, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000434_0162_0FA5AD269C9598B0"/>
mans sins are forgiven and shall be forgiven in the day of Judgment: because they are things that do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Faith in Christ, though they have no influence unto justification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the second part of the Objection that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Salvation are made to Obedience:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That' the promises of eternal life are not made unto obedience as that which does merit eternal life: and therefore the best of Gods servants do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg themselves unworthy of any good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>They shall walk with me in white for they are worthy,</hi> Luk. 21.36. <hi>Watch ye therefore and pray alwayes, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man:</hi> but the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when men do merit a reward from absolute justice, from the meer dignity of the work: in this sence one man can merit from another, but no man from God: for whatever man does for God is but a due Debt: and because no man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> do any good but by the grace of God, the work it self is the gift of God: there is another way of meriting, and that is according to the tenour of the Law: when man keeps the Law he does deserve a recompence according to the tenor of it: thus Jesus Christ has merited life for us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. he has <hi>purchased</hi> the heavenly possession; so the Angels
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000434_0163_0FA5AD2A376E6A18"/>
merited blessedness for themselves: but the Obedience of the Saints is not meritorious in this sense: because it fails of legal exactness: there be many sins mixed with their obedience, and their best obedience is very imperfect and polluted: and indeed it is upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Christ that the obedience of the Saints is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>We offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The promises of eternal life are not made to obedience as the proper condition of it: because God is absolutely engaged to bestow eternal life upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: every Believer has already performed the condition of the Covenant; and is under an absolute promise of life, <hi>John</hi> 1 2. <hi>This is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life</hi>: and obedience is promised to them, therefore cannot be properly a condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The promises of eternal life are made unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as the sign of it: obedience is an evidence that a man is an heir of eternal life; good works do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that a man is one that shall be saved: obedience is an evidence of the love of God, it is from love that a man is enabled to live a life of obedience; and they are an evidence that a man is a believer: where there is obedience, there is Faith also: men are sanctified by Faith in Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The promises of eternal life are made to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as where in God has appointed to lead men to it: God has purposed to lead men in a way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto happiness, and wherever he begins to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men from sin here, to deliver them perfectly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: this is the order wherein God has appointed to bestow salvation, first to sanctifie and then to glorifie:
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:000434_0164_0FA5AD2C22EBED18"/>

                  </gap>re for that holy place, for that holy company, for that holy work that is there, though they shall be more fully prepared at the time of their dissolution: this is the method that God has designed to save men in, that they shall have <hi>their fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life,</hi> Rom. 6.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third part of the Objection, that Glory is called the reward of Obedience:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That when Heaven is called a recompence, the word is not taken for that which is deserved; there is a plain difference in the way wherein God inflicts death and bestows life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 23. <hi>the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Heaven is not properly bestowed upon the Saints upon the account of their obedience as the condition of it: it is upon the account of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ as the meritorious cause, and upon the account of their Faith as the condition of it: their obedience is indeed the way wherein they do receive it, and so it is a recompence of it: they have heaven in a way of obedience, and heaven will make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant recompence for all their labour and travail: the people of God take pains, undergo hardships, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo many temptations and conflicts in a way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but heaven will make amends for all, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompence all their trouble in the way of serving God: at the end of their journey they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive heaven, and that will make amends for all their trouble.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:000434_0165_0FA5AD2CDB2D7948"/>3. Saints when they go to heaven shall receive a recompence on the account of their good works: their good works are the condition of an additional glory: the essential glory of heaven is given on the account of Christs purchase: and that God has promised to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow in a way of obedience: but besides those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, there are others wherein God has engaged further degrees of glory upon condition of obedience: there will be a gracious reward by the covenant of grace given to every act of obedience performed by the Saints, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> God will take an account of all the good works of his Saints, and recompence eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one: so that the more any Saint does for God the more glory shall be bestowed upon him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.17. and hence it is, as one Saint does more for God than another, so the glory of one shall exceed the glory of another: God will not overlook any thing that is done by his people: though the obedience of the Saints be imperfect, yet it is capable of being rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the covenant of grace: it is not properly the condition of enjoying heaven, but it is the condition of enjoying further degrees of glory in heaven.</p>

their reconciliation by their own righteousness: when once the sinner is stung with the guilt of sin, and under the awful apprehensions of Gods wrath, the first way that presents it self for his relief, is the reformation of his sins, and diligent applying himself unto the duties of Religion: and they are travelling this way after peace, sometimes many years, with a neglect of Christ: men ought indeed to seek their peace with reformation, but not by their reformations: but men are mightily wedded to this way of seeking salvation by their own duties: this is one of those things that make the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version so exceeding difficult: it is a difficult thing to bring men to be earnestly seeking salvation, and when they are brought unto that, it is very difficult to bring them to seek it in the right way, <hi>they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, Rom</hi> 9.32. but men have no ground at all for this, it is safe appearing before God in the righteousness of Christ: but it is no ways safe for men to trust in their own righteousness: when men make their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness the ground of their confidence, they do but flatter themselves, and please themselves in a vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion: their own works can never procure their acceptance with God.</p>

child-hood to old age: therefore called <hi>the pride of life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16 how many methods have men found out to gratifie their pride: what cost are men at, what pains do they take, what hazards do they run, that they may satisfie this lust of pride? men are proud of every thing, all natural excellencies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired endowments, external enjoyments are fewel to pride; men are proud of their duties and graces, yea proud of their sins too: proud of the mercies that God bestows on them, and proud of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they have, or have had: pride is deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart of man; and hence it is that he is so addicted to seek salvation by his own righteousness: the spirit of a self-righteous man is to exalt himself: setting up a mans own righteousness is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the work of humiliation and the grace of humility: a Pharisaical spirit is a proud spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. pride is the reason of mens setting up their own righteousness; and it has an influence these two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pride makes men desirous to live upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to be beholden to the grace of God no more than needs must: proud man had rather be the author of his own happiness, than to have it in a way of free gift: most men had rather earn their living with their fingers end, than live upon the charity of other men: so in this case, men had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with God for heaven upon the account of their own services than be beholden to free grace: it would please the haughty heart of man exceedingly, to have the honour of saving himself; that he might have that to boast of, that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="174" facs="unknown:000434_0181_0FA5AD3F0077BC58"/>
that way: mens spirits will very hardly come down to take life as a gift from a provoked God: men can hardly stoop to it, to come to the door of mercy, if they can make any other shift they will not do it: it is exceeding cross to flesh and blood to have nothing of his own to glory in; and to yield himself to be a poor, vile and unworthy creature, to be altogether helpless in himself; man was once set out with a good stock, and might have earned heaven, and tis very hard to him to yield himself a prodigal, he sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks it to come for alms: it would be hard to one especially that has been rich so to do: this we may see in the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.14, 15. <hi>he began to be in want, and went and joyned himself to a Citizen of that Countrey</hi>: nothing but extremity would bring down his spirit, so as to make him return to his Father; he had rather work hard than come a begging to his Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pride makes men conceited of their own Righteousness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proud men are wont to have an high opinion of their own things: they set an high rate on their own excellencies, and so do men of their Righteousness; pride makes men unreasonable in their esteem of it, they magnifie it beyond all bounds: pride hinders them from passing an unpartial judgment upon what they do and are: they think their hearts are a great deal better than they be: when <hi>Hazael</hi> was told what he should afterward do, he answers the <hi>Prophet, Is thy Servant a Dog that he should do this thing?</hi> 1 Kings 8.12, 13. they imagine that their corruptions are mortifyed, that they love God and Jesus Christ, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet not cleansed from
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:000434_0182_0FA5AD41704A6D40"/>
their filthiness</hi>: pride makes them take up a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their own hearts upon small appearances: and when they have only a few pangs of affection, presently they are conceited that they have sincere desires after holiness and faith: or at least that there is such an inclinableness to the ways of God, which will with diligence grow up to be love to God and his Wayes.</p>
               <p>They think they shall bring their hearts to it after a while; and are conceited that their services are very pleasing and acceptable to God, they think there is worthiness in them, that they deserve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: they think they carry it better than others; pride makes men to admire their own excellency: to fall in love with their own beauty, they extol the services that they do, because they are their own: Luke 18.12. I <hi>fast twice in the week, and give tithes of all that</hi> I <hi>possess.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another temptation is that God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does manifest and testifie his great approbation, of holiness and obedience, prayer and repentance. God gives great encouragement unto men to walk in ways of holiness.</p>
               <p>He bears witness often to his acceptance of the obedience of his people: God is all along in the Scripture witnessing the regard that he has unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; sometimes he tells us that he does delight in it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.8. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight:</hi> that he loves it, <hi>Psal,</hi> 11.7. <hi>the Righteous Lord loveth Righteousness</hi>: that he loveth the Righteous, <hi>Isa.</hi> 146 8. <hi>The Lord loveth the Righteous</hi>; that he is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to such as do amend their ways, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>let

                  </gap>: and of eternal life; <hi>you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life, Rom.</hi> 6, 22. men meeting with abundance of such passages in the Scripture; are greatly strengthened in their apprehensions of the efficacy of their own righteousness, to procure their justification: such passages of Scripture are strained by them, and they grow up thereby into a more established opinion of their safety upon the account of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: meeting with such commendations of the practice of holiness: they are much confirmed in their carnal confidence, in such ways as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence they think their own righteousness does draw the heart of God unto them, they think that their holiness does attract the affection and good will of God unto them; they imagine that their holiness does work them into Gods love: that the beauty of their holiness does captivate the affections of God, and their cries and carriages do work upon divine compassions, and make God willing to bestow salvation upon them: and indeed a self-righteous man doth attribute more to his own righteousness, than a Saint does to the righteousness of Christ: a godly man neither does nor ought, to make the righteousness of Christ the foundation of Gods love. Christ has purchased the favour of God and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with him: but he did not purchase the good will and love of God, there was no need of purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:000434_0184_0FA5AD466910B9D0"/>God could love sinners freely, there was no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of purchasing that, that was too great a thing to be purchased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ procured the effects of Gods love, but not the love it self. Gods love was the cause of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not the effect thereof: but the self-righteous man i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magines a vertue in his own righteousness to draw the heart of God to him; and engage the love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence they think their own righteousness does make mends for their miscarriages: that they have made an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>onement for themselves for their former sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they think their repentance makes up that breach that sin had made, and that out of a respect unto that God forgets what they have done amiss: they imagine that there is a reconciling vertue in their reformations and good services, that they satisfie God for what has been past.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herein they attribute more to their own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience than we ought to do to the active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ: Christs active obedience was not sufficient to satisfie for sin: it purchased the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the covenant, but it did not deliver us from the curse: active obedience to the Law has merit in it, if it be perfect, but it has not any satisfying vertue: it is something of another kind that God requires for satisfaction: the Law threatens death for sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23, <hi>The wages of sin is death:</hi> so that Christs active obedience could not satisfie for sins: if he undertake to satisfie for sins, he must bear the punishment of death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence they think that out of a respect to their own righteousness, and upon the account ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:000434_0185_0FA5AD46ABF900F8"/>
God will bestow salvation upon them: they think that this is that which interests them, in all the good of the covenant: their own prayers and reformations, and affections and zeal in the cause of God is that which makes them heirs of glory, and gives them a title to the eternal inheritance. They look upon their own righteousness as the pric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of heaven, and think they have done something to the earning of glory, they are at work for God, and look upon heaven to be their wages.</p>
               <p>And herein they attribute that to their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness that ought to be attributed unto the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. This was the very design of the active obedience of Christ, to give us a claim to glory: because we were very unworthy, and could not fulfil the condition of the Law, Jesus Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for us, and has performed the righteousness of the Law, and merited eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another temptation to make men depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own righteousness, and seek salvation in that way, is the seeming excellency of their own righteousness: there is a real excellency in true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, it is the perfection of mans nature; sin is a vile thing, but holiness does advance and perfect mans nature; holiness is the glory of man: <hi>The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour:</hi> the Righteous are called excellent ones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. and though all the righteousness of self-righteous men is but hppocrisie, and therefore an abomination in Gods sight, yet they themselves do imagine that <hi>there</hi> is an excellency in it, and from hence they make it
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:000434_0186_0FA5AD4745A7D488"/>
a ground of confidence: imagining an excellency in it, they think God is taken with it, and that it is meritorious; they do from the excellency of their carriage promise salvation to themselves.</p>
               <p>And there is a four fold excellency which they are wont to take special notice of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The moral excellency of their carriage: they count their carriage excellent, because they live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to principles of honesty, and sobriety, and piety: they are no Drunkards, nor Oppressors, nor Railers, nor Sabbath-breakers, nor Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they have a good conversation: they do not live a prophane nor sensual life: are not blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves by vicious courses: they have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, lovely and justifiable carriage: their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriages are according to principles of reason and religion: their behaviour is equal, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; they walk without blame: the Pharisee was lifted up with that he was no Extortioner, unjust person, nor Adulterer: the young man was taken with that that he had been moral from his youth, <hi>Mat</hi> 19 20. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of that as a thing which men build much upon, that as touching the righteousness of the Law they are blameless, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The religious affections that they feel work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their hearts,</p>
               <p>Sometimes such men have great affections: they have melting affections under the considerations of their sins, and Gods mercies, outward salvation the sufferings of Christ for sinners, and the like: they have a delight in Ordinances, strong desires after
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:000434_0187_0FA5AD481D152120"/>
Christ and holiness; they have a zeal against the sins of the times, and for the better party: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is plentiful in instances of such affections in unconverted men, as <hi>Saul,</hi> the stony-ground hearers, and others, and they count these sincere, and are highly taken with them: they look upon these to be the very spirits of religion, things which do greatly ingratiate them with God.</p>
               <p>They look upon these affections as blessed frame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of heart: these they think are the things that God does especially delight in: they count these heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frames of heart: they are much affected with their affections; now they reckon they have a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table frame of heart to spiritual things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The difficulties that they go through in serving of God, which raises the price of their services, and makes them more available: they mind that they take a great deal of pains in serving God, in reading and praying, and taking spiritual opportunities, they dont gratifie a slothful spirit, but are laborious in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they hope God takes notice of that: so they are at considerable expense, they spend of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states in works of piety and charity: and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count value their duties highly, so they are much in fasting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in that way afflict their bodies, so they upon the account of Religion, have displeased friends, incurred the anger of men, been reproached, born Persecution: and upon this account they count their services excellent, they think it is no small matter to do what they have done, and are ready to please themselves that they have merited highly hereby: <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. <hi>I fast twice in the week, and give tithes of all that I possess.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:000434_0188_0FA5AD494D6440D0"/>4. The serviceableness of their carriages.</p>
               <p>They by their carriages have done great service, and upon that account they do extol and magnifie them; they have by their charity relieved many a godly man; and by their zeal, counsel, bounty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> learning the publick good has been promoted, they have been a means to promote religion in the place where they lived.</p>
               <p>They have put their shoulders to the cause of God when it needed a lift: they have been peace-makers, they have been ready to forward any good design; they have comforted mourners: they have stirred up others to godliness, there has been much good promoted by them, they have had an hand in many a good work; and have been instruments to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the glory of God in their place: and upon this account they think they have deserved well: such services are not to be forgotten, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Lord Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name</hi>:</p>
               <p>And there are two things that do considerably strenghth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n this temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That others have a good, and it may be an high opinion of them: they take notice of that that others esteem them: they pass currently for Saints where they are known: they have the good word of others, godly men that have a spirit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerning, do take them for Saints, they have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them into their societies, take delight in their company, entreat their prayers: this greatly establishes
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:000434_0189_0FA5AD4980D33E20"/>
them in that apprehension that they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves excellently: they think they are not alone in judging so of themselves, but others, wise and experienced men judg so too: it would shake their confidence if others thought them hypocrites: but they perceive that others have no suspicion of them</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their carriages are far better than the carriages of many others: When they compare themselves with many others, they are hugely tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with themselves, many others are prophane and vicious, but they are not, they don't lead such lewd lives as others do, yea they carry it better than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Professors, they are more exemplary in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, not carried away so with the sins of the times, more strict in sanctifying the Sabbath and the like: they are more forward for publick good: not so passionate, nor so covetous, nor so haughty, nor so complying as many others are: <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. <hi>I am not as other men, nor as this Publican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth temptation that proves a snare to them, is that God owns them in this way: since they have reformed their course, and taken up the practice of religion, Gods dispensations to them are otherwise than formerly.</p>
               <p>And this confirms their apprehensions that God is reconciled unto them that they are taken into his favour, and so that their works are taking with God, and prevail for their acceptance with him: they think the providence of God does witness for them that their services are of great account, And there are three things in providence that they build upon.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:000434_0190_0FA5AD4A7678B3C0"/>1. That God prospers them and succeeds them in their occasions, they thrive in the World more than they did formerly their estates are blessed, they don't meet with such crosses in providence as formerly: that promise seems to be made good unto them, <hi>Psal. i.</hi>3. <hi>Whatsoever he doth shall prosper</hi>: God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence smiles upon them: their cattle increase, their trading succeeds, and they have credit and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance among men, they are improved in publick service, and this they attribute to the delight that God takes in their conversation: they look upon this as the fruit of their goodness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God has given some remarkable answers to their Prayers: and that not only when they have joyned with others in prayer, but when they have prayed alone, in some particular case of their own, they have gone before God and poured out their hearts before him, and he has done the thing for them: and granted the desire of their hearts, and tho there be no evidence of favour meerly in Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which men ask for, <hi>God hears the Ravens that cry,</hi> Psal. 147.9. and sometimes he grants mens desires in judgment, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.15. yet these men build much on this thing, inasmuch as God has gratified them in a thing that lay much upon their heart, and did it also in answer to their prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God does sometimes draw nigh to them, and quicken and encourage them, when they have been serving him: sometimes when they have been at prayer, God has greatly enlarged their hearts; so in hearing of the Word and other Ordinances, their heart does many times melt, God assists them, and don't leave them to a dry sapless spirit in the practise

               <p n="5">5. The fifth temptation is, that they don't know any other way to get the favour of God but by their own righteousness: it is a dreadful thing unto them to go without the favour of God: they have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the dreadfulness of Hell; and they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think of being rejected, they would not for a world be cast away; it is an amazing thing to them to think of dwelling with devouring fire: so that they are pressed in spirit if it be possible to secure their salvation, and get as strong and sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Because terrors of Conscience put them upon their duties: tho afterwards they may find some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, and some affections to God and his wayes; yet the first thing that sets them going is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, fear makes them reform and pray, they are scared into Religion, they are forced out of these sinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, and fired out of those wayes of sin that they were addicted unto: their fear does direct them unto this way as the safest: if they knew a better way they would not violently pursue this, for there is that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in every man by nature that carries him out ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to seek his own happiness: fear and dread of hell make them do what they do in Religion, <hi>Job</hi> 41.25. <hi>by reason of breakings they purifie themselves.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In what way is this work of Humiliation wrought, and the soul brought to submit himself to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In general it is wrought by conviction: it is not wrought by the infusion of any new principle into him, the soul under this work is in a state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither is it wrought by mens own endeavours. Humilation is not the fruit of mans industry, but is a thing forced on him by conviction: as men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first work of the Spirit are by conviction forced to fear, and so by a work of conviction, they are compelled to yield themselves to God: their strong holds are pulled down, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to resign themselves: God works this work by conviction.</p>
               <p>Particularly 1. By giving him experience of the failing of all means: he sees no other way left, he has been trying to wring himself out of the hands of God: he has been turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of his skill upon his heart; sometimes he hoped that in time his heart would grow better, sometimes if he could hear such a Minister, sometimes if he could get such a good book that others had got much good by, then his heart would mend: the sinner is like a man lost in the woods, that thinks if he steers such a course that will bring him to the path, and if that fails, he thinks if he steers such a course that wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By convincing of the strictness of the Law: this is another thing that helps to make him yield: God convinces him of the rigour and exactness of the Law: he imagined before, that his duties would make amends for his sins, that God would be at peace with him, because of his affections: but God shews him
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:000434_0221_0FA5AE1952CDF700"/>
that the Law stands for perfect righteousness; the Law must be fully satisfied, that the Law pronounces a curse for every sin: that it can neither be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated nor moderated, but must be fulfilled: that the law curs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the sinner sees the insufficiency of all his duties, and is brought to despair in himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By leaving a hope in the heart that God may yet help him: this conduces much to make the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yield there is a secret hope that God leaves in the heart: that God will have mercy upon him: God leaves an apprehension in men of the possibility of their salvation: if they don't yield, there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain death, but there is some hopes that God may spare them, they have some hopes arising from the power of God, he can make dry bones to live: and from the mercy of God, whose thoughts are not as mens thoughts, nor his ways as mens ways, but high above them as the heavens are above the earth, that also begets some hope that there is a way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Christ: that others have found help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when they have been in such a case: that there are promises <hi>of taking away the heart of stone, Ezek,</hi> 11.19. this hope helps the Soul much, in submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By discovering his own Soveraignty: men are greatly offended at Gods proceedings and unsatisfied, about his decrees and providences; and this hinders them from submitting unto him: but God by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit lets in some discovery of his own soveraignty: and
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:000434_0222_0FA5AE1A0D411CB8"/>
thereby convinces him, that God does him no wrong: that God may bestow his grace where he pleases: that he has dominion over his creatures: this makes the soul confess with <hi>Job,</hi> Job 42.2. <hi>I know thou canst do every thing</hi>: the soul standing convinced of these things can do no other but yield up himself into the hands of God.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>I</hi> leave this way of trial, <hi>I</hi> shall answer two scruples that may arise in the hearts of some of the People of God about their Humiliation:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Doubt: I</hi> fear whether <hi>I</hi> had a thorow work of Humiliation: <hi>I</hi> never saw so much of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my own heart as some others do speak of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>There is no necessity of seeing all those sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations that are in the heart particularly: there is a great variety as to the particular discoveries that God makes to divers men: and one great occasion of it is, the different temptations that they are under: some see more of a worldly spirit; some more of a froward, some more of an aspiring spirit: a man may have discoveries of his own heart, after he hath been a Saint many years that he never had before: if a man see the fountain it is sufficient, though he do not see all those various channels wherein it may run.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no necessity of seing particularly their inability to every duty: they must feel themselves spiritually dead; they feel themselves unable to do any thing that is good: but some men can speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance more particularly to their inability to this
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:000434_0223_0FA5AE1ACB74B570"/>
and that duty than others can: there are some duties that did not come into their thoughts at that time: it is necessary they should lose their sense of their ability to any thing; should not be conceited of any power or sufficiency: it is not enough for men to see that they can do nothing of themselves: men may say that, when they only find need of assistance, and not of the infusing of a principle of grace into them: but it is sufficient if they feel themselves spiritually dead: but there is no necessity that at that time they must particularly take notice of their inability to love Gods People, to be thankful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though often they do; their thoughts are wont to be fixed at that time on such particulars as they were wont before to pride themselves most in: and such as they have special oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion at that time to think of from what the hear or read.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a necessity of seeing so much of his own heart, as to make him despair of mending it: to see it wholly under the power of sin: a man may see abundance of corruption and wickedness in his own heart, and yet be a stranger to it: though he sees a great deal, yet if he imagines that he can cure it: if he have hopes of getting victory over it, he will not be humbled, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57.12. <hi>thou art wearied in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy way, yet sayest thou not, there is no hope, thou hast found the life of thy hand, therefore thou wast not grieved:</hi> before he be humbled he must see himself altogether under the power of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a necessity of seeing so much, as to set him down that God may righteously cast him off: a man may see much and yet not yield it, that it is fair for God to reject him: one foundation of quarelling is an opinion of what he is and has been doing: this
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:000434_0224_0FA5AE1B89D9D5D8"/>
breeds a great deal of wrangling in the heart, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58 3 he is excusing of himself because he would be better, and has taken pains in Gods service; so that there is a necessity that he should see so much of his own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart as may quite silence him: that he may see himself inexcusable: that he may not have a word to say: but may be satisfied in Gods proceeding if he should cast him off, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doubt.</hi> 2 I fear whither I have had a through work of Humiliation, because I never found so much opposition to the yielding of my self into Gods hands as some others speak of: others have more dreadful risings of heart, and more horrible sturdiness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and bore more dreadful terrors before they could be brought to yield, were much longer opposing and resisting, than it was with me: somewhat this way <hi>I</hi> found, but not so much as others, and therefore <hi>I</hi> fear whither the work were true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Men have had a great deal more of opposition to this work of Humiliation than they take notice off or understand: all those methods and wayes that men take to establish a righteousness of their own, are from a spirit of opposition to this work of Humiliation: all mens endeavours to get any thing to commend them to God, are the workings of this spirit: mens flying to refuges of lies, and hiding themselves in the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds of their own righteousness, are because they are not willing to submit to God: all mens strivings to obtain the favour of God by their prayers, affections, reformations, are upon this account, that they are not willing to yield themselves to be lost: why do men
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:000434_0225_0FA5AE1C8A339668"/>
strive to earn their own salvation, but because they are unwilling to submit to the meer mercy of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some men are naturally of a more stubborn spirit than others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon that account they feel more dreadful opposition: though every natural man is equally under the power of sin: for they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally so: the disposition to sin against God does neither increase nor decrease in natural men, though particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar evil dispositions do: yet some men by reason of their temper are of a more stubborn spirit: and in other cases are wont to be more difficult to yield ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God or men than other men, and that is one reason why they in this case do experience more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a great difference in the risings of mens hearts against yielding to God, from the different manner of Gods dispensations, to the same under this work: Especially in three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some men had abundance more confidence that they were in a good estate than ever others did obtain unto: they were strongly perswaded that they were converted, had had abundance of joy under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of their good condition: and when these hopes come to be pulled away from them, it is no wonder that their hearts work exceedingly: they are like the troubled Sea that casts forth mire and dirt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some men when they are emptied of their own righteousness are left more upon the borders of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair than others are: there is a secret hope that God does sustain the hearts of all by; an hope rising from the power of God, and the deliverance he has wrought for others <hi>&amp;c:</hi> in some there is more
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:000434_0226_0FA5AE1F44FFD8A0"/>
of this hope in others less: the more there is of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more this work of submission is facilitated: an enemy will sooner yield where he has more hope of mercy than where he has less: the less hope men have, the more difficult their submission will be: that made the <hi>Syrians</hi> yield because they looked on <hi>the Kings of Israel as merciful Kings,</hi> 1 King 20.31.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God does discover his own soveraignty sooner unto some than unto others: the conviction of that is the thing that silences the heart, and makes it bow: that brought down <hi>Jobs</hi> Spirit, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2, 5 the soul will not yield till convinced of this, and God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to deal with men variously as to this, some he convinces sooner, and thereby prevents much of those stubborn workings, that otherwise would be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second way of trial is by the manner of the Souls first closing with Christ: there is a great difference between saints and hipocrites in their first venturing upon Christ: though there be a similitude, yet there is also a dissimilitude: some persons indeed through negligence, lose the distinct remembrance of this, which occasions much darkness afterwards, but a false heart does not experience such things in his first receiving of the Gospel as a sincere heart does: there are some things that are common to one and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but there are other things that are peculiar to the people of God: if the manner of their closing were the same, their Faith would be the same: the manner of closing is such as doth distinguish them, and take it up in such particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The soul is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="218" facs="unknown:000434_0227_0FA5AE2139AAC1A0"/>
doubts and questions, but when he closes with Christ he is assured of the truth of the Gospel: the reason that men do not entertain the truth of the Gospel is because they are not assured of the truth of it, when they believe the truth of it, then it works effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13. <hi>ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe:</hi> When the soul first closeth with Christ, it is satisfied in the truth of the gospel:</p>
               <p>In the consideration of this we may take notice of three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That at this time the soul knows the truth of the gospel: he had the notion of it before, but now he sees it to be so indeed: it is a real thing unto him; there is a light let into that soul discovering the truth of the gospel: the soul has not indeed at that time an actual and distinct consideration of all the fundamental truths of the gospel, so as to yield a particular assent to every one of them: but all those foundation truths are radically made known at that time: that is, there is that light put into the soul then, that will make him yield an assent to all those truths, when he comes to have the actual considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.26. <hi>ye have an unction from the holy One, and know all things</hi>: and at this time the soul has the actual consideration of some foundation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel truths; such as the infinite free mercy of God, the vertue of the blood of Christ, or the like; and sees such things as neither his own reason nor Satan could make him to apprehend: and although the soul has not the actual consideration of all foundation, gospel truths, yet he sees so much at that time as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies him in the truth of the gospel: for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

Hereticks; but natural reason can't satisfie men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout those scripture principles: yea though natural reason be enlightned by a common work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, so as to be greatly affected with the Gospel for a time, yet it cannot assure a man of the truth of it, neither is it possible for Satan to work any such assurance in men: men are sometimes afraid whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the discovery they have had were not the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Devil: but though the Devil may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort false hearts, and fill them with joy, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assure men of the truth of the Gospel: for he can only raise those principles that are in men, and not put a new principle of faith in them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is that the truth of the Gospel is discerned: neither can the Devil give a discovery to the soul of the glorious nature of God, or excellency of Christ, so as that the heart should trust him, love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Satan can make no such discoveries to a natural man, as a natural mind is uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, so that this assurance is the peculiar work of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>From this particular we may conclude the Faith of two sorts of persons to be false: on this account that they never have been assured of the truth of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as are perswaded of the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel only from tradition: the bottome of many mens perswasions is the profession and judgment of such men among whom they live: this is the doctrine that they have been bred up in, the principle that their Parents have taught them: they abhor to have any thoughts to the contrary, because they have been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated in this way, upon the same ground that a

               <p n="2">2. There is also another sort, whose Faith does appear from hence to be unsound: namely, such who be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eved that God meant them in the calls of the Gospel, because they found some good affections in themselves: if their heart had been dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury, they could not have thought that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them: but the foundation of their believing that they were invited, was, they found some good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in themselves: but certainly this was built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conjecture, and an opinion of their own: and therefore they could not be assured of it: they had no assurance that they were called, though they might have a strong confidence, yet they could not be assured from thence that they were invited</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the first closure of the soul with Christ, the Soul comes to him, meerly upon the incouragement of the call of God in the Gospel: God invites sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Gospel, to come to Christ, and many ways urgeth them so to do: and from thence the soul takes its encouragement.</p>
               <p>There were many other things that encouraged
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:000434_0232_0FA5AE254E297148"/>
them before to wait upon God for converting grace, as the power of God; Gods converting of others, his strivings with him by his Spirit, but the thing that is his encouragement to come to Christ, is the call of the Gospel: he sees his warrant in the call of the Gospel: the call of the Gospel is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his faith: that is the reason of his faith that God calls him in his Word. The call of God does contain in it sufficient encouragement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: for therein God shews his readiness to save sinners, therein he shews that there is a way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation prepared for them: therein he binds his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to them, and lays bonds upon himself to save them if they come to Christ, and this is the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them to believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 13 48. <hi>they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the Word of the Lord, and as many, or it may be read, such as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the right understanding of this:</p>
               <p>Consider 1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is indifferent with this first closing with Christ, whether the soul takes notice of the call to believe as Gods call or Christs call: some souls in their first closing, take notice that Christ calls them: others that God calls them: and it is no material thing which of these ways it be: if either the soul hear God, or hear Christ calling him, the answer to that call is true faith: for there is sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for us to come either from the voice of God, or the voice of Christ: this is an abundant demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it: that the call of the Gospel is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times propounded to us in Scripture as the call of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.9. and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:000434_0233_0FA5AE260DAF3838"/>
it is propounded unto us as the call of Christ, <hi>Rev,</hi> 3.18.20. there is this difference between them, that Christ calls us by an authority derived from God: God does derive his authority from none: but Jesus Christ as Mediator does derive his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from God: but his authority is a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>hear him:</hi> and hence Ministers may indifferently invite men in the name of God or Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no necessity that at the time of the souls closing with Christ he should be reading or hearing the call of the Gospel: it is by those calls, but many times they do not prevail while a man is hearing of them but afterwards: sometimes it is in the very time of hearing, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. but it may be as well afterwards: it may be in time of prayer, and often is, or in meditation: God does it for them that wait upon him in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but not always in the time of Ordinances: thus it is with other works of the Spirit, awakening of sinners, comforting of Saints and Sinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.29 <hi>he said I will not, but afterwards he repented and went.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no necessity that this closure with Christ should be wrought by the letter of the Scriptures: fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is by some particular word; but it is many times otherwise: sometimes the thing is urged by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, according to the Scripture, and God makes some sentence that he speaks effectual,</hi> Acts 16.31, 32. <hi>so som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in meditation God makes men see the general cal of the Gospel, though no particular place be pitched upon: thus 'tis sometimes afterwards with Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="225" facs="unknown:000434_0234_0FA5AE27B5804618"/>4. There is no necessity that the particular word that draws the soul to Christ, should be in the form of an invitation: it is many times so, as by those words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. but it may be by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Gospel expression; as by those words, 1 <hi>Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2.24. <hi>who bore our sins in his own body upon the Cross,</hi> Isai. 53.6. <hi>he was wounded for our sins, and bruised for our iniquities,</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>he hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to</hi> God <hi>of a sweet smelling savour</hi>: it may be wrought by any Gospel precept, promise, declaration: God by any such word may let in a light to shew the soul the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Call.</p>
               <p>From this particular we may conclude the faith of two sorts of persons to be false:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as ventured at first upon Christ from that encouragement that God loved them: they thought that God had a love for them, either from his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward providences, he smiled on them in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and blessed them, and heard their prayers, or he manifested his love to them by restraining their corruptions, and keeping of them from such evil practices as others are addicted unto or else from some inward comfort that God has given them: God gave them some inward comfort when they were in a sad condition, and from thence they conclude the love of God: and so are bold to venture themselves on Jesus Christ: they have had some inward joy, and that they make the foundation of their Faith: and so they quite prevent Gods order, they get first a faith of assurance that God loves them, and then they have a faith of dependance: but the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:000434_0235_0FA5AE286E2746F0"/>
love of God is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the foundation of our faith, there is no need of knowing that in order to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the love of God is to be cleared up by effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual calling, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10 Gods love to the soul is a secret, till he does believe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 13. <hi>after ye believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise</hi>: God may reveal the love he has to a man, unto some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the man believes, as the love God had to <hi>Jacob,</hi> was revealed to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> but not to the man himself: Gods particular love is not the foundation of Faith, but the call of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as ventured first upon Christ upon that encouragement that they loved God: they found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to God and Christ, and that made them think that God meant them in the call of the Gospel, that made them think that it was not presumption for them to come to Christ that made them think that God would not reject them: their first encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement rises from themselves, and then in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary way they take encouragement from the Gospel: that adds to their encouragement: but this faith is a rotten faith, it has not a right foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: such a faith may make men live more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table here, but it will deceive them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3: 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the first closure with Christ, there is such a light let into the Soul of the sinner, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wit in hell can't perswade him to stay away: where God begins to open the eyes, there may be some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting: but before God has done, the light is so full, that the soul is carryed captive by it: Ministers are required to compel men to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. that is to use compelling arguments, such as when God sets the same home will compell men: the light that God puts in to the soul at that time is such that he cannot withstand it: it silences all his carnal reasonings: stops his mouth, answers his objections, so that he cannot stand out any longer, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>every one that has been taught, and hath learned of the Father commeth unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I clear up from these considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All that have this inward light and teaching doe come unto Christ: 'tis true, there is an illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that is not effectual to work faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. that light is only the irradiation of the natural understanding; but there is an inward light that is always attended with faith: such men as have a thorow conviction of the gospel doe ever close with it: that light that is sufficient in order to faith is always efficacious; the inward call of the gospel is always answered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>whom he called, them he also justified,</hi> all those that God draws do run after him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. they that know Christ will come to him, <hi>John</hi> 17.38 <hi>Psal</hi> 9.10 and this shews that they cannot but come; if this inward light could be resisted, some would resist it: among so many thousands some would refuse to come: this way would not be universally successful with men of all tempers and inclinations, if it did not necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them: some or other would be found that would refuse.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:000434_0237_0FA5AE2B4E684F08"/>2. This inward light is said to come with power upon the soul: it has a perswading overcoming po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer with it: it has power to gain the will, and draw the consent of the heart: the gospel where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit does inwardly teach, it has a prevailing power: therefore it is called <hi>a rod of strength,</hi> Psal. 110.2. it comes with power upon the heart, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.5. when God convinces men of the truth of it, it alwayes works effectually upon them, 1 Thes. 2.13. let but the truth of it sink into a mans soul, and Christ will be precious unto him, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. the light of the gospel, turns about the wills of men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the sinner could stay away from Christ, the corruption of his heart would make him stay away from Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: if men were able to stay away, they would not be able to come: there is a great deal of opposition in the heart of a sinner to believing in Christ, men are as great enemies to the gospel as they are to the law,: sinners are dreadful averse to come to Christ: how many objections and cavils have men to keep them from Christ: how many by-paths will they turn into before they come to Christ: how much sorrow will they endure before they come to Christ? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18 <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. and this opposition of heart would not suffer them to come except they were made to come: if they were nor under a necessity of coming they would stay away.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is against nature when men have this inward light let into them to stay away from Christ: there is a principle put into every man in his first creation to seek his own happiness: and however the nature of

man be corrupted, yet that principle is not lost, but remains strong in men: however they mistake the way, yet the desire of all men is happiness: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil blinds men, and tells one that this is the way, and another that that is the way, but still they are driving an end that design, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.6 <hi>who will shew us any good?</hi> and therefore when the Spirit of God shews a man, that Christ is the way to happiness, that there is sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Christ, he cannot but come to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8 <hi>to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When the sinner comes at first to Christ, this inward teaching of the Father works such affectious that he cannot but come: when his eyes are opened his affections are so wrought upon, that he cannot but come: when he comes out of darkness into light, his heart is affected with the sight of Christ, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stay away: there are three affections that are wrought upon: one is hope, he sees a hope of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness if he comes to Christ: he sees in that way hopes of pardon and glory, <hi>Heb</hi> 6.18. <hi>who are fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope that is set before us</hi>: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Love, when the soul comes to see Jesus Christ offering himself, he cannot but love him, and look on this way of salvation as a glorious way, he despised Christ before, but now he charges his mind, he prizes him, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>to them that believe in Christ is precious</hi>: and then it works on fear, he dare not lose the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he does not know whether he shall have another call; so that he dares do no other than take God at his word.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Liberty does consist in an indifferency unto contrary Acts or Objects: sometimes indeed men have such a liberty, but that is peculiar to some cases: liberty is not opposed to necessity but to force: the will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be force by any external violence, but it may be necessitated by reason and conviction: natural men sin voluntarily yet necessarily: they reject the Gospel voluntarily, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. yet necessarily, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.

                  <hi>I fear my closing with Christ is not right, because, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God let light into me I objected awhile before I yielded: the light did not at first overcome me:</hi>

               <p>Many times when God comes with that inward call of the Gospel, he does not at one instant let in such light as does overcome all objections: but after God begins to bring the call home to the soul, there are some struglings of unbelief before he yields: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the light is such that it strikes all objections dead at a blow: sometimes it answers them gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the light breaks in fuller and fuller till at last it quite overcomes him, as in <hi>Moses</hi>

               <p>Where he is more clearly satisfied in his own good estate, there are times when the people of God have very comfortable satisfaction that they are in a good condition: they have comfortable hopes that they are in a state of Justification, that God has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their sins, and will save them; these hopes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from a discerning of their former actings of faith, their sanctification, and that joy in the Holy-Ghost which they have had, and at such times as these, they do live a life of Faith upon Christ, when they can see their sanctification, they do not build upon that as the matter of their justification, neither do they so live upon any signs, as to lie in the neglect of acting dependance on Christ: though there is too much of that Spirit to live upon signs, and to neglect Christ, yet this Spirit does not rule a Saint: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his hopes, his venturing himself upon the free and gracious offers of the Gospel, though he

                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is indeed a boldness to trust in God from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of mens worth; that is not right: but there is a twofold boldness that God will never blame men for: one is, the bearing up of their heart with the hopes of Gods favour upon good experience of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing sin: only you must beware you do not make light of sin, because God has given you such hopes: the other is, a depending on Jesus Christ for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin; and accepting Gods offer notwithstand-your sins: yea though you have not such brokenness of heart as does become you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Try the truth of your Faith by that holiness that does accompany and flow from Faith in Jesus Christ: they that are true believers do lead an holy life: Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness does accompany Faith: and therefore believers are commonly in Scripture stiled Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. there is a concatenation of Graces: where there is one grace there is all: as it is in a natural man, all the natural faculties of the soul do accompany each other, they live and dye together, so it is with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral graces that are in Saints; the same principle of Grace does inable the Soul to all sorts of holy actions; Grace in the heart is but one principle, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of its various actings and objects it does receive various denominations: and wherever Faith is, it is accompanied with universal holiness: and therefore holiness is given as a Sign and Character of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Gal</hi> 5.24. they that are Christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts: the actings of Faith go hand in hand with the excercise of other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Faith is alwayes attended with universal holiness
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:000434_0257_0FA5AE4363754D10"/>
hence there are so many promises of Salvation made unto those that are holy: though it be Faith only that gives men a title to heaven, yet there are promises made unto holiness because that is a property of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and hence also there are so many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings unto those that live unholily, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holiness no man shall see the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed holiness does not only accompany Faith, but the exercise of it does flow from Faith, Faith has a great influence into an holy life: the actings of Faith upon the whole Word of God does greatly quicken a spirit of obedience: it is a spirit of Faith that makes all the Arguments which the Scripture is full of to become powerful upon the heart: whatever God proposes to us in his Word to make us obedient, it will not have that effect upon our heart if it be not entertained by Faith: men believe commands, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, threatnings, and so they become efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon the heart: the whole Word of God works on men as it is entertained by Faith, all graces are quickened and drawn into exercise in this way: men believe and hope, they believe and love, they believe and repent: the Will and Affections never act in a gracious way, but when the understanding does dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ground so to do: by Faith we understand spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, and so our hearts are carried after them; what ever grace is acted Faith is acted together with it: and therefore in the 11<hi>th</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Patriarcks</hi> did and suffered for God is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Faith.</p>
               <p>But as other actings of Faith have an influence into Holiness, so in a special manner the actings of Faith upon Jesus Christ: <hi>we are satisfied by Faith in him,</hi> Act. 26.18. the peculiar actings of Faith on Christ have a
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:000434_0258_0FA5AE4445FB95F0"/>
special influence into an holy life: and that two wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The believing of the Gospel does in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture stir up men to holiness: when men by Faith do entertain the calls of God in the Gospel, it has a strong impress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss: when men see the readiness of God to pardon them, the wonderful grace of God in the Gospel, it prevails with them to lead an holy life, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.23. <hi>Thy loving kindness is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth:</hi> the sence of the grace of God appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Faith, makes men admire the glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God, love God, fear to offend him, troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that they have grieved him and wronged him: the discoveries of Gospel grace leave an everlasting impression upon the heart, to love and honour God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The believing on Christ is the way wherein God has promised to carry on the work of Sanctification: in this way God gives forth the assistances of his Spirit for the carrying on of this work: God in the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Gospel <hi>calls us to glory and vertue,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3.

               <p>For the opening of this way of Trial, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what an holy life is: It is a course of walking in all Gods Commandments from a gracious respect unto God: here you may distinguish between a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of holiness, an holy frame, an holy action, and an holy life: a principle of holiness is a quality ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and inclining a man to keep all Gods commands out of a gracious respect unto God; an holy frame is a raised prevailing disposition unto holiness, by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it is disposed to holiness, by an holy frame to a more ready and chearful practice of holiness: when the heart is in an holy frame, it is like an instrument in tune, like a good knife that has a good edge: an holy action is an action commanded of God, done out of a gracious respect unto God: an holy life is a course of walking in all Gods commands, from a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto God:</p>
               <p>In this discription three things are to be minded;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That where there is an holy life, there is a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Gods commands: there may be a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some particular sins where there is not an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, any one way of sin makes a mans life unholy: if men allow any way of disobedience the life is not holy: in an holy life there is an abstaining from every known sin, and the practice of every known duty,

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 1 6. <hi>They were both righteous before God, walking it all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameless</hi>: he that leads an holy life does observe all those commands that direct his outward behaviour of himself; and he attends all those commands that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the carriage and behaviour of the heart: those commands that require internal duty, love, fear, and those that do require the right manner of doing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doing of it for Gods glory, doing of it in the Name of Christ, doing of it with diligence, with delight: the casting off of any duty makes the life unholy.</p>
               <p>The principle of grace that is in a Saint does both inable and incline the heart to keep all Gods Commands there is no command given by God, but there is a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inclination in the heart of a Saint unto it: there be in the heart of a Saint some general inclinations to all Gods commands: some inclinations that respect every one of Gods precepts: that are principles of universal obedience; and they are three, love to God, fear of God, and faith in God; these three influence a man to all that obedience that God requires; these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the heart to do every thing that God requires: hence sometimes we read that love makes us keep Gods commands, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. so all Religion is called the fear of God; because that influences all, <hi>Isai.</hi> 50.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so Faith is a general principle of obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7, 8. &amp; besides these there are in a godly man more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inclinations to the commands severally: which are not of such latitude, these are the off-spring of the other: thus patience inclines a man to keep some commands, temperance others, bounty others, pity others, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
               <p>But this walking in all Gods commands does admit

               <p>There may be such actings of corruption in a saint as are inconsistent with the actual love of God: but men are often mistaken, in thinking that sinful actings are not consistent with the habitual love of God: many times a man sees such workings of grace as seems to him inconsistent with such sinful inclinations as afterwards he finds in his heart: so 'tis here, but there is no act of sin, (the sin against the Holy Ghost excepted) but is consistent with habitual grace: whatever lust is in the heart, it may be drawn into act notwithstanding the being of grace: that grace that does not altogether destroy the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot altogether hinder the working of it: there needs more than the being of grace, to hinder the workings of the vilest corruptions, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.9.</p>

               <p n="1">1. One Motive, is the great sin of rejecting of Christ, and not coming unto him: men have reason to be afraid to continue in unbelief, because there is so much sin and iniquity in it: many a wakened sinners that do confess and bewail other sins, and speak of them with bitterness of spirit: do not lye under the
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:000434_0274_0FA5AE5B52357FC0"/>
sense of this sin: here they are ready to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or justifie themselves: they don't take the blame of their rejecting of Christ to themselves: they plead for that, and vindicate themselves as if it was not their fault, as if they had not sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe: but herein you are greatly mistaken: you look upon your unbelief to be your infirmity and calamity but not your sin: this is a meer delusion: the professed rejecting of Christ was that which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the measure of the <hi>Jews</hi> sins: and the heart rejecting of Christ is sin, <hi>John</hi> 16 9. <hi>the comforter shall convince of sin, because they believe not in me</hi>: and tho this heart rejecting of Christ be not a flagitious, yet it is a crying sin: you cannot anger God more by any thing than by continuing in the neglect of Christ: this is the great controversie that God hath with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not that they have been guilty of these or those particular transgressions, but that they abide in the rejection of the Gospel: you may see the greatness of this sin, by the many rules that are broken by this sin, and by the fountain of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See the greatness of the sin by the many laws and rules that are broken by it: men do violate many Commandments at once in this sin; it is a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iniquity, it is not a single sin, but many evils are twisted together in it: the rejecting of Christ crosses a great many rules; men by their unbelief do cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of dishonour upon God, and lie in the breach of many Precepts.</p>
               <p>There are many Rules broken by this sin; For</p>
               <p n="1">1. You break that particular command of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ: believing in Christ is not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to many general rules, but there is a special command for it: we may not only argue this duty by consequence from some general Precepts: but here is an express commandment for it; it is <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> required: as we are beseeched to believe and invited, so we are required, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. <hi>this is the work of God, that we believe on him whom he hath sent,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> letter of the Word of God: if it were not so expresly set down, there might be more pretence for cavilling: you might have more to plead that there was some mistake in mens argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to be a duty: but now you do oppose a plain direct precept: what colour can men have to question whither it be their duty, when it is set down in the Scripture in so many letters and syllables: some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened sinners that have reformed their former wayes of sin, and taken up a course of Religion, are apt to please themselves that they don't live in any known sin, whereas they live all the while in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of coming unto Christ: but how can you sooth up your selves with this, when you neglect a plain and express Commandment?</p>
               <p n="2">2. You deny to Jesus Christ the honour of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorly Office; and of that great Sacrifice that he has offered up unto God: God had made Christ Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; he has committed the work of reconciliation unto Christ, and Jesus Christ has undertaken it: he was every way furnished for it, and has discharged it: and upon that account he is worthy to be depended upon: Faith in him is an honour due to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

your rejecting of him, you withhold that honour that belongs to him, you deny him the honour of having made satisfaction for sin: you should honour every one according to their desert, but you cast contempt upon his sacrifice as if it were not sufficient for you: you disparage him when you are afraid to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: you cast great reflections as if there were no such virtue in his death and righteousness as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: there is a great deal of despising of Christ: you belie him; the language of unbelief is, that his blood is not precious, that it does not cleanse from all sin; that his sacrifice is not pleasing unto God: that the gold he tenders will not make you rich, that the whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. You cast great contempt upon the wisdom of God in finding out such a way of Salvation: this is a way that God in infinite wisdom has contrived, <hi>collos.</hi> 2.3. <hi>there are in Christ all the treasures of wisdom and knowledg</hi>: but you do desert this way as an unsafe way: you dare not venture your selves in this way: as if God when he undertook to find out a way to bring sinners unto glory missed it: and did not discover a way that will do: that commends this way of life to us that God himself contrived it, it is not the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man; a thing plotted and devised by any finite understanding, but the contrivance of God himself: but you by refusing of Christ carry as if this were a deceitful way, as if this way did not reach the needs of your soul: this <hi>way</hi> is chosen of God, and refused <hi>by you</hi>; as if you understood better than God what you needed.</p>

                  <pb n="268" facs="unknown:000434_0277_0FA5AE5D8DFF2CF8"/>4. You refuse wonderful love: to reject the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and love of God is an abuse of it: you ought with thankfulness to entertain Gods love: but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of Christ, you reject the greatest love that ever was revealed: was it not an act of wonderful love for God to send his Son to dye for us: what need had he to be at any such cost, if we had been all damned, what would he have lost by it? we may see in this, how deeply the heart of God was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in our salvation: he did that for us which would have been too much for us to have asked: we may well wonder that God would be willing to do such a thing for our salvation: it was a great thing for God to be willing that sinners should be saved: but for him to lay out himself so in order to it was much more, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>so God loved the world:</hi> and again, it was a great act of love for God to make such a law of grace: that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth shall be saved; that he should make so small a thing the condition of salvation, and say to us as the Prophet did to him, wash and be clean: if God had laid the forest burdens upon us, and put us upon never so many difficulties as the condition of salvation, we should have had reason to bless his name: but he only lays this condition on us, to accept his offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was great love that God should make this offer to you, when he passes by thousands in the world: and never speak a word to them about the way of life, yet opens this way to you, revealing of it, and calling upon you to be saved: he call your lot in a time when and where these offers should be made: and the way of life is held forth with all plainness: and when he has snatched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers away younger than you, he is yet waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, keeps knocking at your door; and upon
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:000434_0278_0FA5AE5E43443268"/>
this account you are utterly inexcusable in refusing to come to Christ; shall God be at a great deal of cost and care in order to your salvation, and will you not accept of his Son? shall Christ make a journey from heaven to save you, and shall he lose his labour? God in compassion has provided bread for you, and will you not eat it, a garment for you, and will not put it on; has he sent a Physitian, and will you not accept his help? are Gods bowels earning over your dying souls, and will you reject his care? indeed when you refuse Christ you despise the tender love of God: and that heart is very hard that can slight such tender love: you are guilty of great ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that do reject this offer: you are greatly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unto God thus to blow upon his love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You act contrary to self-love: it is every mans duty to love himself, and seek his own good: God commands men to prosecute their own good in a way of subordination to his glory: God allows no man to ruine himself, but requires them to seek their own wellfare all their days, <hi>Mat</hi> 6.20. and indeed what ever sin a man commits he acts contrary to the rule of self-love; all sin is hurtful and not benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to men: but in a peculiar manner they act contrary to this rule in rejecting of Christ, for therein they refuse a tender of blessedness: God in the Gospel is offering salvation unto them, if they will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. Because the Sentence of God in the Gospel is that which men shall be judged by: God declares in the Gospel, <hi>that he that believeth not shall be damned</hi>: and if unbelievers be tried by this rule they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perish; if God should try them by some other rule that they might fancy or imagine they might make a shift to escape: but by this rule they are gone men: and this is the rule they must be tried by: God will have no respect in that day unto mens riches, or learning, or esteem among men, or their civil or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conversation; but their case must be determined by the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>God will judg the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel.</hi>

               <p>It is impossible for you to escape ruin if you do not believe; and that is not all, for your rejecting of Christ does not only expose you unto condemnation, but to a greater degree of misery than multitudes will endure that go to hell: you may not think to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape as heathens will do, your load will be heavier, and your fire will be hotter, and your judgment every way sorer than the judgment of other men; God will proportion every mans misery to his iniquity: and as you have enjoyed greater light and love, so you must expect more amazing and exquisite wrath than other men; conscience has more to accuse you of, and condemn you for, and so has God: and you will sink down deeper into hell than other men: you are treasuring up a greater measure of wrath than others against the day of wrath, you have blessed God it may be many times for the means of Grace that he has bestowed upon you: but you will curse your selves a thousand times more for not improving them; you will wish that you had lived in the darkest corners of the earth, among <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi>: it will be a terror to you to think of your Baptism, what books you have read, what Ministers you have heard, what counsels have been given to you: every sinner will be in a dreadful condition then: but it will be more tolerable for many than for you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.22, 24.</p>

God and man, and wonderful in the glory that he is advanced unto, you shall have external manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his favour: you shall hear his wisdom and see his glorious managements and behaviour of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: and have opportunity to express your thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto the face of Christ: then you shall have the gifts of the Spirit in a glorious manner, the company of holy Angels that have been helpful to you, and Spirits that you have heard and read of in the Book of God: <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham, Moses, David, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. there your imployment will be glorious, and your body will be glorious, if you will but come to Christ, besides a great deal of mercy that God will bestow upon you in this world, you shall partake of eternal salvation, as poor a sinful creature as thou art, the Lord is offering eternal life to thee, if you will but accept it as a free gift from him through Jesus Christ you shall be welcome to it; though heavenly glory be so great and you be so unworthy God will bestow it upon you; do you desire eternal life? are you indeed set for happiness in another world? if you are, you may soon secure it, and make it sure to you if you will; entertain these calls of the Gospel and you shall be saved: the Lord has given abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance assurance, this is no pleasing dream but a thing certain and infallible.</p>
               <p>This appears if you consider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because God has been at a great deal of cost in order to the salvation of Believers: if a man should engage so far in any undertaking as to spend a vast estate in it, we should readily conclude, that it lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed upon his heart, that he was real in it, and that his spirit was deeply engaged: and thus it is in this

case, God has been at great expense, he has laid out himself more for the salvation of Believers than he did for the making of the World: he has exercised much of his wisdom on this design, much power; yea he gave his only begotten Son, <hi>that whoever believeth on him might not perish, but might have everlasting life,</hi> Joh 3, 10. must not his heart be much in it when he gave his Son to die? could any thing have induced God to such a strange dispensation, had not the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers been a thing that his heart was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon? God has by this given conviction to the World, that he is set to save believers: when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how many wonders God wrought in order to it, how he sent his Son from heaven, constituted him a Mediator, delivered him over unto death, it may give us great satisfaction, that God is really bent to save them: why should he go so far if he did not intend to go thorow: God that has spent so much for the salvation of believers, will spend a little more to carry the work on to perfection: God loves his Son too much to let him die in vain; to put him to such sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and then to let the design of all his sufferings fall to the ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God has promised Jesus Christ to save those that believe on him; Christ Jesus did not die at uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, the Father had engaged to him the salvation of believers: God covenant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. There is an hardness of heart that is not judicial: indeed every man by nature is under the power of an hard heart: there may be abundance of hard hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in you though no judicial hardness: there may be some legal softness, and tenderness, and relenting where there is judicial hardness, as it was with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>: so there may be hardness where there is no judicial hardness: this is an evidence of it, because God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises them to take away the hardness of their hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Many others have feared that they have been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially hardened, that have afterwards been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: they that are judicially hardened do not use to be perplexed with this fear: the judgment it self is wont to deliver them from fears of this kind: but it is a frequent thing for souls under trouble to be afraid of this: others have seen afterwards that they have been mistaken, and so may you.</p>

that the Spirit of God has forsaken them, is because the spirit does after a while change its way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: when the Spirit begins to work upon them, his manner is to discover their danger, and after a while to give them some encouragement, whereby they come to have strong affections, sorrow, desire, delight, and now they are easily perswaded that the Spirit is at work with them, and dont look upon themselves har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, but after a while, when these affection fail them, and they find themselves dull and senseless, now they are afraid that the Spirit has left them: whereas the reason is, the spirit has changed his work, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to shew them what hearts they have in order to the work of Humiliation: if men could maintain their lively affections they would never come to Christ: therefore the Spirit of God does leave them unto, and lead them into an experimental knowledg of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their hearts: so that this is no sign of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits leaving you, but an effect of the presence of the Spirit: his manner is to convince men that they are poor and wretched, and blind, and miserable, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.</p>

               <p>For the answering of this Doubt I shall open this Scripture to you, and shew you what is meant by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and by wilful sinning:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By sinning here is not meant any sort of sin, but some special sin: particularly the sin of Apostacy and renouncing of the gospel: this is evident, because this sin is that which he speaks of in the verse imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding: there he speaks of mens casting off their Christian society, and therewith the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the truth: which is the thing he disswades from in this verse: and he evidently speaks of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy when he comes to explain his meaning more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. he calls this sin <hi>a treading under foot the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c, besides the same Apostle speaking of the same sin, <hi>Heb:</hi> 6.6. calls it a <hi>falling a way.</hi>
               </p>

a spirit of fear, as some good men have done, and many others that have not sinned unpardonably: in time of Persecution many have through weakness denied the Gospel: they may do it spitefully and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously, that is here intended, for they are said, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>to do despite to the Spirit of grace:</hi> by this you may see that though there have been many backslidings after your illumination, though you have had a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and rebellious heart, yet you may be free from the sin here intended, and have opportunity to come with acceptance unto Christ.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Some persons have these qualifications that fear they have not; some men think they are not a thirst, because they don't find longing desire after Christ: their hearts are dead and senseless: they don't find any love unto Christ: but souls may be said to be a thirst, when they are in want of refreshing, when their souls are parched under the sense of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, their hearts are ready to fail for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: so they think they are not heavy laden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sin is not such a burden to them as it should be; because they have not an heart to mourn for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>If you come to Christ meerly upon Gospel encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, you cannot come in a wrong way, if you come indeed upon such encouragements as these, that you have not much angred God, that you have pacified him, that you have a great love for him, that you have not been so bad as other men, that your heart is soft and broken for sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you don't come in a right way: but if you come meerly upon the encouragements that God sets before you in his Word, you do come in a right way: God offers sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>We must indeed take things upon trust, but it is upon the testimony of God if we must take it upon trust from man only, that would be hard: but it is not hard to take it upon trust from God: we have more for it, than against it: we have nothing against it but vain conjectures and surmises: the things themselves are not incredible: this way of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is neither contrary to the justice of God, nor beyond the mercy of God, no man was ever able to give any demonstration against this way of salvation. Men scare themselves with many vain scruples and ignorant imaginations of their own, and are such conjectures and guessings to be set against the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God? God has sent us word from heaven that we may have salvation by Christ; he gives his witness unto it, and that may well satisfie us: what God speaks he will make good: if we receive the witness of men, the Witness of God is greater, and we may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> safely venture our souls upon his Word, God assures us that it is so, and gives a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his Word how the thing is brought about, he gives us an account of the reason of it, the means and method of accomplishing it, and the design that is upon his heart, in such a way as is exceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto right reason: remoxing all weighty objections that can arise in your hearts: if you will hearken unto cavils and the pretenses of reason, and stand off from Jesus Christ, you must expect to rue it another day: but if you desire the good of your souls,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:000434_0318_0FA5B00C1BC0F718"/>
and to escape those miseries that shall come upon an unbelieving world, reject temptations, and cast away all the vain arguings of your hearts, and accept of this glorious call, and build upon this sure foundation; you need not have any greater assurance than Gods Word, which will endure when Heaven and Earth shall fail: it is well for those men and women that have Word of God for their salvation: it is bad building hopes of heaven upon mens fancies: but it is safe building them upon Gods Word.</p>

               <p>I Shall conclude the Discourse with an Exhortation to the people of God, to be often renewing acts of dependance upon Christs Righteousness for your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God; be believing on Christ for your
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:000434_0319_0FA5B00CE0005A30"/>
acceptance both now and in the day of Judgment: a great part of the life of a Christian lies in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Faith; and as you are to be exercising Faith in Christ for other things, so especially for your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and salvation: 'tis not enough that you have once ventured your selves on Christ, and accepted of the tender of life made to you through him, but you must live upon Christ for acceptance all your dayes: you ought to be alwayes in a believing frame, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to put forth any act contrary unto the act of Faith, and very often to be renewing of the acts of Faith for your acceptance: there are many special occasions, when it is duty so to do, as when God is setting the offers of this grace before you in his Word, and in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; so when you meet with any temptations, to beat you off from this way of believing, when you have been contracting any special guilt, when you go before God in solemn prayer: and besides what is to be done on such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as these, it is a duty to have the heart working and carried out in this way at other times, and it will be so where the heart is in a believing frame; men then will love to be thinking upon the precious righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ, and putting forth acts of dependance thereupon: God requires you to be much in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>those things have I written to you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the Name of the Son of God.</hi> This ought to be upon a double account:</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is an honour due to God and Jesus Christ: it becomes us to be putting honour upon them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niewing those acts of Faith, when a man is drawing his encouragement from the righteousness of Christ,
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:000434_0320_0FA5B00DA4B504B8"/>
and the free grace of God, prizing Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, satisfied with that, rejoycing in it, rolling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon it, he is putting honour thereupon: and it is no more than it does deserve: it becomes us to be giving this glory unto God and Jesus Christ: when the acts of Faith are much intermitted, and when there are any actings of unbelief: we do deny them their due honour, but the exercise of Faith is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical acknowledgment of their glory: and this is one part of that way of holiness, wherein the people of God are walking unto salvation: the first act of Faith in Christ is the fulfilling of the Covenant, other acts of Faith are a part of our attending that way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness which is the way of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the way of our comfort: we need to be from time to time renewing the acts of Faith, that we may live a comfortable life: this is a way to have a stable and well grounded comfort: for in this way of salvation, <hi>God has given us everlasting consolation and good hope,</hi> 2 Thess. 2.16. the actings of unbelief fill the soul with trouble: that faint must needs live a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful life, that is much carried away with an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving heart: such a life is attended with many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and fears: unbelief is the sinking of the heart: the prevailings of a spirit of discouragement, bring a man into a most perplexed condition: and he that lives in a way of carnal confidence will live a life of trouble: though at times his joy may be great, yet there will often be such discoveries of his heart, and convictions of his danger, as will fill his soul with fear and trembling: the only way to live a sweet and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table life is to live by Faith upon Christ: the actings of Faith give rest unto the heart: there will be some measure of comfort wherever Faith is in exercise,
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:000434_0321_0FA5B00E5452BA70"/>
though a man be in the dark about his condition, yet the very actings of Faith will support his heart: Faith discovers a resting place for the soul: in the exercise of Faith, the soul is receiving of encouragement: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith is often expressed in Scripture by joy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.18. indeed there is a sweetness and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singness in the exercises of every grace, because they are suitable to that new nature that God has put into his Saints; but there is a sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cial sweetness in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Faith, because the nature of it is to entertain a well grounded comfort and encouragement: the very actings of Faith have a great deal of comfort in them, and the reflection of the soul upon those acts of Faith has a great deal of comfort in them: Faith it self is comfortable, and the sight of Faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable: Faith comforts as it entertains the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Gospel, as it discovers a door of hope: the light of Faith comforts as it discovers a sure evidence of Salvation.</p>
               <p>In prosecuting of this <hi>VSE,</hi> we shall consider three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Saints are apt to be discourag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the righteousness of Christ for acceptance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What their discouragements are, together with proposals for the removing of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What course saints should take that they may live by Faith on Christs righteousness, and not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider,</p>
               <p>Saints are apt to be discouraged from believing on
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:000434_0322_0FA5B00F3464E720"/>
the righteousness of Christ for acceptance: there are two sorts of discouragements that Christians have with respect unto their acceptance: one sort is when they are discouraged as if they were not accepted, as if they were not saints, and in a state of salvation: their present state is dark unto them: and this arises either from Gods dispensations towards them, or their carriages towards God: God layes afflictions upon them, exercises them with inward temptations, don't give assurance of his love; don't answer their prayers, don't quicken their hearts in his Ordinances: and they are carried away with corruption, don't feel the working of love in their hearts, have not such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hearts as others of the people of God, and so they are ready to sink, as if their pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> sort of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is when they are afra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to come unto Christ for acceptance: they are called upon to believe, but are discouraged from that duty: it don't enter into them that God is free to accept of them through Christ: they dare not believe: and these two sorts of discouragements are generally Companions, and go together, though not alwayes: usually when Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are discouraged as to their present state, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y are also more backward to believe than at other times: and their hearts are frighted because of the greatness and number of their sins: and when they are in an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving frame, they are many times discouraged as if they were not Saints, and can't discern those signs that they can see plain enough at another time: this latter sort of discouragement whereby Saints are discouraged from believing in Christ is, that we are now discoursing of: and this discouraged frame is one of those frames that are contrary to a believing frame: there are two other frames in Christians that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:000434_0323_0FA5B0101388B798"/>
to believing in Christ: one is a slighty, careless and regardless frame of spirit respecting acceptance with God and eternal salvation, mens hearts are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so deeply engaged in the world, that they are little concerned about the state of their souls, they have not the weight of it on their hearts, to make sure a part in Christ; sometimes Christians are under the prevailings of a sensless Spirit, they have not sense nor solemnity enough upon their hearts to put forth an act of Faith: the other is a self-righteous frame, whereby Christians are apt to be drawing of their encouragements for their acceptance with God from their own righteousness: but besides these there is a discouraged frame of spirit whereby Saints are afraid to believe; as if there were not encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to believe, in the offers of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to them: this discouraged frame of spirit is, that we shall particularly consider of, as being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the doctrine of our safe appearing in Christs righteousness, which has been cleared up in the former part of this Discourse.</p>
               <p>That Saints are very apt to be discouraged from believing is evident from the universal experience of the people of God; they find it a difficult thing to live a life of Faith, and find many doubtings arising in their hearts, many jealousies that their hearts are suggesting: they are apt to be discouraged from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving for other things, outward blessings, divine assistance, and whatever God has promised, and thus it is also with respect unto their acceptance with God: were they not so apt to be discouraged they would live a more sweet and comfortable life than they do: the Disciples of Christ were <hi>slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have written,</hi> Luk. 24.25. Saints are
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:000434_0324_0FA5B013E40A5180"/>
ready to say as he, <hi>I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips,</hi> Isai. 6 5. their Faith would many time fail if there were not special assistance given unto them, <hi>Luk</hi> 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not:</hi> the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly implies that he found great want of Faith when he expresses his care <hi>to know Christ and the power of his resurrection,</hi> Phil. 3.10 and hence it is, that God is so often stirring us up in his Word to believe, and has appointed so many means for the confirmation and establishment of our Faith: and if we consider the state of the people of God, it is no wonder that they have many doubtings and risings of discouragement in their hearts: for the same principles that do so discourage natural men are in Saints; though they be in part mortified, yet they do remain there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ignorance of God, carnal reason, pride of heart are remaining in them: and Satan is busie to stir up jealousies in their hearts, he is striking at their Faith, <hi>casting in his fiery darts into them,</hi> Eph 6.16. and they have many discouraging temptations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, which are matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r for carnal reason to work upon; which are next to be spoken unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider what their Discouragements are, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Proposals for the removing of them:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Discouragement</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The unspeakable greatness of the blessings that are offered in the Gospel: he has a sense upon his heart that it is a wonderful priviledg to be brought into a state of acceptance with God, the savour of God is better than life: to be saved and translated from a mean condition in this world, into the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to behold the face of God for ever, to enjoy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:000434_0325_0FA5B0151E210B10"/>
for evermore at the right hand of God, to be made like the Angels of God; 'tis so great a thing, that it will scarce enter into him, considering how mean and unworthy he is: if God had spoken of some little thing, of some more moderate felicity, he should not have stuck so much at it: but this is so inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably great, that he is jealous whether God be willing to bestow it upon him: the greatness of it puts him to a stand, and makes it more unlikely in his eyes: sometimes when he begins to rejoyce in it, his heart checks him, and he fears it is too good news to be true: as the <hi>Disciples believed not for joy,</hi> Luk. 24.41 and as it is spoken of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.1. <hi>when the Lord turned again the captivity of his people, we were like them that dream</hi>: the heart does not so stagger at lesser mercies, but the sense of the greatness of salvation makes it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil and proves a temptation to unbelief: he doubts of it, and sayes, will God in very deed do this thing? when he would rejoyce in the thoughts of it, he is pulled back by fears, that it will not be so: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it begets a secret damp upon his soul, least it should not be true: it seems incredible:</p>
               <p>For the removal of this discouragement,</p>
               <p>Consider 1.</p>
               <p>The infiniteness of Gods mercy: this is a great gift, but it is not too great a gift for God to bestow: he has an heart large enough to entertain such purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as this, men are ready to think that God will count it too much for them, and that a more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate felicity were fitter for them, but the mercy of God is unlimited, he does not envy mans bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dness, he can find in his heart to bestow all his
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:000434_0326_0FA5B015C64145C8"/>
glory upon poor unworthy man, <hi>God is rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2.4. <hi>plenteous in mercy,</hi> Psal. 103.8. the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est act of mercy is not beyond the merciful nature of God: he can do any thing that is an act of mercy: his mercy is such that it cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with provocations, but it can overcome the greatest provocations, his mercy is such that it has no dependance upon mans worthiness: God has grace enough not to give earthly blessings only, but heavenly blessings unto men, he has such mercy as that he can bear to see men in the possession of heavenly glory, and not grudg at it, or think much of it, he has such mercy that he can take wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful delight to see men happy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no impoverishing of God to bestow bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness upon you: God is not the poorer for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king you and thousands of such as you happy: God does not empty himself and lose of his fulness, he has never the less for filling of you: if a man that has much for himself give any thing to you, he has the less for himself, and that makes men the more backward to give unto others: but it is not thus with God, the Sun has not the less light for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the world: God does bestow all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and salvation without any diminution to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; he is not the less happy himself by making you happy; he can spare all this glory to you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wrong to himself: though this salvation be so great a thing, yet God can afford to give it: it is a difficult thing to men sometimes to perform their engagments to others, but it is no difficult thing to God to perform his offers to you, <hi>in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house there is bread enough and to spare,</hi> Luke 15.17. God has not the less glory for himself, nor for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:000434_0327_0FA5B0168FA22E98"/>
of his friends by bestowing glory upon you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God made man capable of enjoying blessedness: God has made man not only capable of worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, but he has g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven him an understanding and free-will, whereby he is capable of enjoying God himself: man is made of such a nature that he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enjoying the presence of God: and being capable of it, he cannot be satisfied till he come to the enjoyment of him: he cannot rest but in his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he cannot be happy till he enjoyes his proper object: and surely God would never have created such a creature with such capacity, if he had not an heart to bring him to the enjoyment of himself in a way of hearkening to his counsels: why did God make such a creature that should have such a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and such desires, if he had not an heart to bestow this good upon him: God satisfies the desires of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very living thing; heavenly glory though it be great yet it is not too much for our need: he bestows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beasts of the earth, the fish of the sea, and Fowls of heaven, such things as are suitable to their needs, and why should we think that God is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bestow upon man what he needs, if men will take the directions that he gives unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God has made heaven on purpose to bestow it upon men; together with the angels: the earth was made for man, and so was heaven too: God raised this glorious building on purpose to entertain men: <hi>it is a Kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world,</hi> Mat 25.34. <hi>God has prepared for them a City,</hi> Heb. 11.16: this was one of the first works that God ever did to prepare this place of blessedness for men: he did not need any heaven for himself: he was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:000434_0328_0FA5B0174BA5A4C8"/>
happy before heaven was made: but he made it on purpose for such as shall come to Christ: how then can we think that God is unwilling to bestow it upon them: now it is made, he will not say it is too good for them: he turned man indeed out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise that was made for him, because that was made for him only so long as he retained his integrity: but the heavenly Paradise was made for such as will come unto Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is but proportionable to that design that is upon the heart of God: men do not stick to do great things for the accomplishing of designs that lie much upon their hearts; Princes will be at vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to shew their magnificence, the Artist will take a great deal of pains to shew his skill: and God has a design upon his heart to manifest his glory: and has done great things for that end: he made this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fabrick of heaven and earth, to be as a glass wherein his glory is represented, and the eternal salvation of such as you is greatly subservient to this end, <hi>Eph</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 6, 7. here is nothing in this contrary to Gods glory: nothing that is an hindrance to it: but it suits that end: the mercy of God is much honoured by his pardoning and saving of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. herein is seen what free compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is in the heart of God: it is much for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God to lead sinners through all the difficulties of the way unto heaven, it is much for the glory of God, notwithstanding all their unworthiness to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow heaven upon them: it is much for the glory of God to have multitudes in heaven to be spectators and admirers of his glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>That they may be with me where</hi> I <hi>am, to behold my glory which thou hast given me.</hi>

There has been a great price paid for it: if you had kept the covenant of works, and been perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly obedient unto God, without any defect, you would not have doubted of Gods readiness to accept of you and save you: but here is as fair a way made for your acceptance and salvation: God is fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for every jot of that glory that he promises un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you? Jesus Christ has payed the full price of it, according to the tenour of the covenant: it is a due debt to all that are partakers of the righteousness of Christ: it is an act of Justice in God to bestow sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon them: heavenly glory is purchased glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>until the redemption of the purchased possession.</hi>

               <p>The many sins that he has been guilty of: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Saint has a dismal frightful apprehension of his sins: they appear to him as a dark cloud: he knows that God is an holy and a jealous God: he speaks dreadfully in his Word against sinful practices, and has brought dreadful judgment upon angels and men for their sins: and hence he is fearful that God will not pardon him: his sins proves his great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, hence his heart is still harping upon that string, that God is an holy sin-revenging God: and that he hath been guilty of abundance of sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>mine iniquities take hold of me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that</hi> I <hi>am not able to look up, they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there are two things especially that prove matter of temptation, and make him afraid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>

                  <pb n="321" facs="unknown:000434_0330_0FA5B018C521ACC8"/>One thing is, the many aggravations that he sees in his sins, he sins against light, against covenant, notwithstanding abundance of mercy, with a great deal of perverseness; they have reiterated sins, after bewailing of the same, they have sinned with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, their sins seem to have exceeded the limits of pardoning mercy.</p>
               <p>The other thing is, that they fear that their sins do speak and evidence their hypocrisie: they are apt to think they should not, they could not do so, if they were not hypocrites, they fear that such carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are not consistent with grace: and thence they are much discouraged: they think if they have been hypocrites all this while; there is very little hope for them, that would be such a provocation that they fear God would never pardon it: the fear of their hypocrisie makes them fearful to cast themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ.</p>
               <p>For the removal of this discouragement,</p>
               <p>Consider: 1.</p>
               <p>That the law of God leaves as much room for the pardon of great sins as of little on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="322" facs="unknown:000434_0331_0FA5B0199653E588"/>
but it gives as much liberty for the pardon of great offenders as of lesser, there is no tittle that way in the covenant of works, that great sinners must d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in their own persons: the thing that the Law looks at is, that sin be punished according to the demerit thereof, that the Justice of God be vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but God does not bind up his own hands, that he may not forgive great sinners, he reserves that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to himself in the law of punishing any sins in a surety, and so of pardoning them: the law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the pardon of any sin if there be satisfaction: the reason that the sin against the Holy Ghost is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, is not from any thing in the covenant of works, but because God when he provided a surety, made an exception of that sin: but if sin be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the law is satisfied: the law does not forbid the pardon of great sinners: that is evident, because God does pardon great sinners, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>her sins which are many are forgiven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2: Jesus Christ has satisfied for great sins and great sinners as well as lesser: when God sent Jesus <hi>Christ</hi> it was in his liberty to appoint him to dye for what sins and sinners he pleased: Christ Jesus was capable of satisfying for one as well as for another, for he was so worthy a person that he was capable by his sufferings to expiate the greatest sins: his short suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were sufficient to satisfie for the greatest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: and God did put that work upon him to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for great sins: and he has discharged it: he has satisfied for great offenders, Christ has payed a price of redemption for the greatest sins, one excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: therefore generally in Scripture it is said that he has made reconciliation for sins without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; <hi>he bare our sins,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>he is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation

for our sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2. <hi>he has purged our sins,</hi> Heb. 1.3. yea the Scripture testifies <hi>that his blood cleanseth us from all sin,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. he died for the chiefest sinners as is implyed, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1.15. and therefore sinners without distinction are invited to come to Christ for forgiveness.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods manner is to suffer a great deal of sin to remain in his people here: he could if it pleased him purge it out all at once, but he suffers it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for many great ends; as to magnifie his power in preserving the seed of grace, notwithstanding all that opposition which is made by Satan and their own corruption, so to carry on the work of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in such a manner as that they shall stand in continual need of justification and pardon, and among other ends this is not the least to try the faith of his people, and exercise taht: there be none of the people of God but are attended with a great deal of sin: so was <hi>Noah, Jacob, Asa, Jehosaphat,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.23 <hi>I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the law of sin that is in my members</hi>: and that shews that God can love those that have a great deal of sin in them, and that he can pardon them, his suffering of it to be in his own, evidences the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of grace to pardon it</p>
               <p n="4">4. God is as free to pardon hypocrites as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, if they come unto Jesus Christ: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are afraid many times that they are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but that should not discourage them from believing; hypocrites are as wellcome to come unto Christ as Saints: God does not exclude those that have lived long in a way of hypocrisie: they may

come with freedom of spirit notwithstanding: men should not suspend the exercise of Faith until it be cleared up to them they are no hypocrites, when they are most in the dark about their state, their way is <hi>to trust in the name of the Lord, and stay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon their God,</hi> Isa. 50.10. if you should be hypocrites, there is encouragement enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Gospel: God has pardoned thousands that have spent a great deal of time in hypocrisie: were not the <hi>Jews</hi> that Christ and the Apostles offered salvation generally to hypocrites? had not <hi>Paul</hi> lived a great while in a way of hypocrisie? and <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> God rejects not any man that accepts of Jesus Christ, though he has been an hypocrite.</p>

               <p>That God passes by many others, and does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow salvation upon them, there be many whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that God passeth over, and leaves to perish, and many particular men among his visible people: <hi>many are called but few are chosen,</hi> Mat. 20.16. and they can't see any reason why God should bestow salvation upon them, when he does deny it to multitudes of others, why God should make such a difference between them and others: when they are called on to believe on Christ, they are afraid to do it, it damps their hearts to think that there are so few that God does save, so many rejected, and they can see nothing in themselves to incline the heart of God to them, God passes over many wise men, noble men, valiant men, rich men, learned men, good natur'd men, men of great accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments, and don't bestow salvation on them; if they could but see any reason why God should set his heart upon them, and make such a difference between

               <p>For the removal of this Discouragement,</p>
               <p>Consider, 1.</p>
               <p>The only reason why God sets his love on one man and not upon another is, because he pleases: he acts the soveraignty of his own will in it; it is his own will that makes the difference between men, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4.7. <hi>who maketh this to differ f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="326" facs="unknown:000434_0335_0FA5B0227A13B8B8"/>
his will: there is nothing in any man to sway the will of God any way: there is nothing in any man to be an argument with the Lord to love him; nothing that can work upon the affection of God to make God love him: he has no excellency that can perswade the Lord to love him: whatever beauty, understanding, good nature he has, those things can't sway God: God is not taken with those excellencies and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are in men, as to have his heart fastened and allured to them thereby: and on the other hand, there is nothing in man that can hinder God from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him; if the man be weak in understanding, of contemptible and wicked Parents, and his outwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, that this or that particular man is as capable of being loved of God as any other in the World: God has manifested special love unto thousands of men and women, and you are as capable an object of divine love as any of them: you are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable as <hi>Abraham, Moses, David, Paul,</hi> or any other: it is true you are as capable of Gods hatred also as any other: the meer pleasure of God does decide it, who shall by the objects o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as great likelihood as another, they that God brings under means, are the children of godly Parents, that God is striving with by his Spirit are more likely than others, but one is as capable as the other; for the free will of God is the only thing that does determine it: and therefore you have sufficient ground of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to accept the offer of salvation,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God have wrought a spirit of Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in you that is a manifestation that God has set his love upon you: though you can find no reason why God should love you, can't tell why God should have any respect unto you, yet it is certain he does love you if you have a gracious change wrought in you; though he has cast away thousands of greater natural and acquired endowments than you, and of greater external enjoyments than you; yet you are one of those that he has chosen, and has set his heart upon. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath loved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his purpose, and grace given us in Christ Jesus before the World began.</hi>

                  <hi>Discouragement</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>They find things since their coming to Christ much contrary to their expectation: they thought that they should have had more expressions of the love of God, more quicknings of the Spirit, more help a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst corruption, more visible answers of prayer, they thought that if they came to Christ, they should have had little trouble or temptation, but have lived a sweet, easie and pleasant life: but things are far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, things run very low in their souls, they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

evil workings of heart, and therefore they fear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God has accepted of them, or be willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them, and to bestow salvation upon them, did they walk in the light of the Lord, and enjoy such communion with God as they expected, and feel such evident fruits of the love of God as they promised themselves they should not be so backward to believe; but since it is otherwise, it begets a trembling and fearfulness in them, it puts them to a great stand, hence the calls of God take less impression on them: especially because they think it is not so with others that come to Christ; others do enjoy more manifest tokens of divine acceptance, but they are both in inward and outward respects under tokens of divine displeasure: and this is an hindrance unto their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>Job</hi> 9 16, 17. <hi>If I had called and he had answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet would I not believe that he had hearkened to my voice, for he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</hi>

               <p>Consider, 1.</p>
               <p>That many sad and sorrowful dispensations are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the favour of God: men are ready to think that if God delighted in them, he could not find in his heart to exercise them in such a manner, his compassion would work so towards them, that they should not experience such sorrows: but men greatly mistake, it is true that all the wayes of God are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them that fear him: but yet many times his wayes are in appearance contrary unto love; it is common with God to bring those that he has rejected into a prosperous condition, they are under very smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:000434_0338_0FA5B024C65F31F0"/>
providences; and on the other hand God fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently frowns upon his own children, not only in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal dispensations, but also by inward darkness, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to conflict with sore temptations; the love of God to his people, is not an affection, as love in men is; but it is a design to make them happy: not to bestow all those degrees of blessedness upon them that he can, but it is with subserviency to a greater design, even the glory of his Name; and therefore he leads them to happiness in such a way as is conducible to the manifestation of the glory of his pardoning grace, his holiness and soveraignty; and it is frequent with God to lay very heavy afflictions upon his dearest children, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.14. <hi>all the day long I have been plagued and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened every morning</hi>: and God leaves his sometimes to a great deal of inward darkness: <hi>Psal.</hi> 88.15. <hi>while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted: men that fear the Lord may be in darkness, and have no light,</hi> Isai. 50.10. the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations of God unto <hi>Joh</hi> and the issue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie between him and his friends stand upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to satisfie the hearts of Gods people in all ages in this particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God does sometimes withdraw from his own children the sensible quicknings of his spirit; God never takes away wholly his sanctifying presence from his people: God is present with them to uphold the being of grace, there is a divine manutenency whereby God does preserve the life of grace at all times: but the sensible quicknings of his spirit may be often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: God may often so far withdraw, that they may not perceive any special gracious operation of the spirit upon their hearts: and that as at other time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

stoniness of their own hearts, without any special im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions made on them by the spirit of God: there are times when God makes their hearts burn within them: but there are times when they are left unto a benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med frame of spirit, as if they had no spiritual senses, they have great cause of joy, but their hearts do not rejoyce therein, great cause of sorrow, but unaffected with it, great cause of fear, but fearless; their senses are bound up, and spiritual truths that they think of or hear of don't sink into them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.5. <hi>They all slumbred and slept.</hi>

The people of God ought not to count it a frown that they have not the immediate light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance frequently: we must have a care that we do not complain without cause: the sealings of Gods spirit are wonderful mercies, and special and more immediate discoveries of the love of God are glorious enjoyments: but it is not Gods manner with his people to give them frequently: when God bestows them he expects that men should go in the strength of them many dayes: <hi>Paul</hi> was but once <hi>caught up to Paradise</hi> in his life time, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 12.3. God has many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes to support the hearts of his people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Gods manner is, to be training up his people to live a life of Faith: to be depending upon him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word, he is striving to bring his saints to live upon his promise, he does in his providences put them upon that, he takes away other props that they may lean upon the promise more, they shall have time enough hereafter to see things; in heaven Faith will be swallowed up in vision: but here he would have them live by Faith upon his Word; the people of God are apt to have too much dependance upon signs, and

to lay more weight upon them than upon the Word of God: trusting more to signs, and sometimes to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ones, than they do unto the infallible testimony of God: and upon that account God many times takes signes away: Christians have enough left them to live upon when signs are gone: God many times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders the weakness of his Saints as he did the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Thomas,</hi> John 20.27, but yet he is by degrees bringing them more off from a dependance upon signs to live upon his bare word: they are apt to make too much of their signes, and too little of his Word; therefore he takes them away that they may have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Word to trust to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>for we walk by Faith and not by sight.</hi>

               <p>That it is no presumption to come unto Christ and rejoice in him: how sinful soever you be: though you feel your heart very hard, though you have just now done somewhat provoking unto God, and have not yet bewailed it before God, nor been labouring with your own heart to work the sence of the evil of it upon your own heart: it is a presumptuous thing
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:000434_0343_0FA5B02890416850"/>
to sin: men are too bold and daring when they take upon them to cross the commands of God: and it is a presumptuous thing to make light of sin, because Christ has died and salvation is procured by him: sin is never the less heinous because Christ has died: Gods mercy in pardoning of sin, should make us more sensible of the evil of it: but it can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption to come to Christ, though the heart be hard and senseless: because there is enough in <hi>Christ</hi> for such as are hard hearted, there is that precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the blood of Christ, that it has procured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin for such, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.19. and pardon is freely offered to you, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.33. <hi>whoever believeth on him, shall receive remission of sins</hi>; and it is no presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for you to accept of what God freely offers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and indeed if your eyes be opened to see the glorious excellency of Christ, and the grace of God, you will not make an excuse of an hard heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Entertaining the calls of the Gospel is the way to have a spirit of repentance: it is meet that you should repent and have your heart broken for your sins, but the way to come at it, is to entertain the Gospel offer; there are other means in their place to be used, but a principal means in order to repentance is to receive Christ: believing in Christ is the way to have grace quickned and strengthned: Faith in Christ is the greatest furtherance of repentance and holiness: Faith discovering the grace of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, melts the heart for sin, and arms the heart against it: and Faith in Christ is the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Gospel for the subduing of sin, in this way God will give his Spirit to work repentance and holiness, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>20. <hi>I live by Faith in the Son of God,</hi> Isa. 6.56. <hi>he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi>

               <p>Diligently attend the Ordinances of God unto that end: the Ordinances of God have a tendency to stir up Faith, as well as other graces, and it is in that way that God has promised his presence and Spirit: God delights to be found in ways appinted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: God has not said that we should seek him in vain; <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.19. Christ will be present with us in those ways, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. Gods very prescribing of means is an encouragement unto us to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, especially when he has annexed his promise to the same: if men be remiss and slighty in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Gods Ordinances, they are not likely to thrive in faith, or any other grace, it would be no wonder if they should wither away, and live in a dark discouraged condition: but if christians be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to attend Ordinances, and improve them for the strengthning of their faith: they are in a hopeful way to thrive: no wonder if there be a blast upon the inventions of men: but experience teaches the people of God to say: <hi>it is good for us to draw nigh unto God,</hi> Psal. 73 28.

God has appointed the place where we shall meet with him, and there we must wait for him: if men desire to flourish in faith, they must be diligently improving Ordinances that way: God loves to honour his own Ordinances, and help his people in a way of Obedience, and give forth his presence in such a way that they may see his fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Read the Word of God diligently: it is very useful to this end, to read the writings of faithful and experienced men, such books are of great use for the understanding of the Scripture: but there is a peculiar usefulness in the Word of God it self, because that is without error and mistake, <hi>it is given

               <p n="2">2. Frequently attend the preaching of the Word: that which God makes use of especially for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geting of Faith, is very proper for the nourishing of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing, by the Word of God</hi>: this is an ordinance as well as the reading of the Word: and there is a special usefulness in it several ways, the life and zeal that is in the delivery is of special use, and a great means to affect the heart: in the preaching of the Word, counsels and encouragements are directed more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto them; and that by those that God has set over them, that must give an account of their souls, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. yea the very solemnity of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, does help to solemnize the heart, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to receive what is spoken from the Word of God.

God many times considers the weakness of his people, and gives them signs, which are a strengthening unto hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4 and it is lawful to desire signs out of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibleness of the unbelief of our own hearts: under the sence of that, that we are easily outbid with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that our unbelieving hearts are ready to take advantage from the want of such evidences; we may desire signs: but it is not lawful to desire them from unbelief: unbelief is never good, nor any natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it: we have no reason to lie waiting for signs, when we have the Word of God to incourage us to believe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.4.

Frowardness makes men love to cavil against the encouragements that God sets before them: a man in a froward frame studies objections, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges himself in a way of cavelling: there is a great deal of wilfulness in their unbelief: a froward heart humours himself in his raising of objections, men take a pride in cavelling and turning of the calls of God: when the heart is discontented, there is a great deal of a sturdy spirit working in their unbelief: <hi>if I had called and he had answered, yet would I not believe that he did hearken unto my voice, for he breaketh me with a tempest,</hi> Job. 9.16, 17.</p>

               <p n="3">3. These examples of believing do provoke unto an holy emulation: as one Scholar is provoked to emulation by the learning of another, so is one saint provoked to emulation by the faith of others, the examples of other mens faith have a tendency to make you ashamed of your unbelief, you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to see your selves out-stripped by those that lived in darker times than you do: you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to think that you are worse then others: that you should be more backward to honour the grace and faithfulness of God than others: these examples have a tendency to make you pluck up, that you may honour God as others have done.</p>
