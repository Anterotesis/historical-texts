            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

work together for good unto us, among them that Love God.</p>
                  <p>It would be inexcuſable inadvertency in us, and a dreadful token of lamentable Stupidity in our Souls, if we ſhould take no Notice of the late Stupendous, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous dealings of the glorious Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, while the very bars of the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pit have ſeemed, as it were, to ſhiver and the dreadful Smoke of the bottomleſs Lake hath begun to break out and aſcend before our Eyes: And the venemous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Hell have had a Permiſſion to raiſe up their heads and after a very uncommon manner, to ſpit about their Venom upon us, and to ſhew us a little of their curſed and cruel diſpoſition, by the blood that hath been ſhed, and the fire that hath been kindled in our Neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>What means the heat of this anger of the Lord our God! The <hi>Words</hi> of God muſt be attended that we may underſtand the <hi>Works</hi> of God. We muſt regard the Works of the Lord and conſider the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of His hands, or we ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with yet more terrible deſtructions.

us upon whom the ends of the World are come, and we ſhall do well to give heed unto that ſure Word of Prophecy: The Oracles of God in His Book are to explain the operations of God in the World.

                  <p>In the beginning of this Sixty Chapter of <hi>Micah,</hi> the Lord by the Prophet mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a Controverſy with His People.

                     <p>We have ſeveral Propoſitions to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered under this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. PROP. <hi>The GOD of Heaven does frequently manage a controverſy with Sinners upon Earth for their Miſdemeanours before Him.</hi> He ſhews that he is diſpleaſed at them. And he ſhews them that he hath juſt cauſe to be ſo diſpleaſed. Their wayes are not pleaſing in his ſight, and ſo he walks in wayes toward them, that are not pleaſing nor eaſy to them. So in the Second Verſe of this Chapter, it is ſaid,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001729_0005_0FB77B59944623C8"/>
                        <hi>The Lord hath a Controverſy with his People and he will plead with Iſrael.</hi> Then he tells them what he had done for them. And they had not done before him, as he might juſtly have expected, and therefore he was offended, and they ſhould be made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his diſpleaſure. And ſo it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told unto the People of God, in Levit 26, 27 <hi>If you will walk contrary unto me, then I will walk contrary unto you.</hi> The Lord having told them that if they were willing to obey him, then they ſhould enjoy the bleſſings of his Covenant. But if they would not hearken to his voice and obey his Commandments and walk in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, then he would be angry againſt them, and they might expect the tokens of his anger: Then he ſhews them that if they would not repent and be reformed by leſſer Judgments, then he would bring up on them greater Judgments and puniſh them yet Seven times for their iniquities and yet Seven times more, and Seven times more, until their Uncircumciſed hearts be humbled When he hath begun a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with Sinners, he will go on with it until they be reformed or deſtroyed.</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001729_0005_0FB77B59944623C8"/>
II. PROP. <hi>The Lord is often pleaſed to bring Judgments upon Sinners for their Sins, while He is managing his Controverſy with then.</hi> He hath threatned them with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their Sins, if they don't turn from their Sins He muſt bring the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned, that he may appear to be the God of Truth. And he hath done from time to time according to his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, thus in the Thirteenth verſe of this Chapter, He declares, <hi>I will make thee ſick in ſmiling thee, in making thee deſolate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy Sins.</hi> Thus alſo in Deut 28 58. Sayes the Lord, <hi>If thou wilt not obſerve to do all the Words of this Law, that thou mayeſt year the glorious and fearful Name,</hi> THE LORD THY GOD. <hi>The Lord ſhall make thy Plagues wonderful.</hi> He told them that if they would be obedient, they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy abundance of bleſſings, but if they would be rebellious, then there ſhould be curſes multiplyed upon them. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it came to paſs. The Promiſes of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing having been fulfilled, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001729_0006_0FB77B5B8597A400"/>
[in Lam. 2. 17. Dan. 9 11.] So the Lord often brings various Judgments upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, while he manageth his controverſy with them. They find it a perillous thing to continue in wayes of Sin againſt the Holy God. But,</p>
                     <p n="3">III. PROP. <hi>GOD in pleaſed graciouſly to Warn Sinners, before He brings Judgments upon them in His managing to His controverſy with them.</hi> And theſe warnings of God are in various wayes delivered.</p>
                     <p>For ſometimes the Lord warns by his Word. So <hi>the Lords voice Cryes unto the City.</hi> People that read the Word of God, may diſcern a cry in the Word which they read, like that in Iſaiah 3. 10. <hi>We to the Wicked, it ſhall be ill with him.</hi> The Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God plainly cryes, <hi>Evil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth Sinners,</hi> it cryes, <hi>The Soul, that Sinneth, ſhall dye,</hi> it cryes, <hi>The wages of Sin is Death,</hi> The cry of the Word is, <hi>God will render to every one according to their Works: To them that are contentious and will not obey the truth, he will render indignation and wrath, tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh, upon every Soul of them.</hi> The plain cry of the Word is, The Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell &amp; all the Nations that forget God. God will rain upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners, fire and brimſtone, a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001729_0006_0FB77B5B8597A400"/>
burning Tempeſt muſt be the Portion of their cup. God will find a time to call to remembrance the Sins of Sinners, and will ſet their Sins in order before them for their Eternal confuſion. The plain Cry of the word is that in the a Theſ. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>—<hi>The Lord Jeſus will be revealed from Heaven, with his Mighty Angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; They ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and before the terrible things, that will come at laſt upon all finally Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners, there are awful cryes in the Word of God againſt them, denouncing terrible things in this Life and World. Would People Read the Word of God, as they ſhould, they might find the Written Word crying againſt them for their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Impieties againſt and before God.</p>
                     <p>So People that hear the Word of God, may often perceive a cry, like that in Ezek. 18 30. <hi>Repent and turn from all your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, that iniquity may not be your ruine.</hi> A cry, like that in John 3 36. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the Son of God, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> A cry, like that in Zeph: 2. 3. <hi>Seek ye the Lord, Seek Righteouſneſs and Meekneſs, that ye may be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001729_0007_0FB77B5F835A0458"/>
The Ambaſſadours of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who are to Preach the Word of God, are commanded, as in Iſaiah 58 1. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, ſhew People their tranſgreſſions.</hi> And as in Ezek 33 8. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt hear the word at my Mouth and warn People from me, when I ſay unto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely dye; and thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way the wicked ſhall dye in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheleſs if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn him from it, if he do not turn from his way, he ſhall die in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy Soul.</hi> Thus muſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God warn Sinners about their Sins, againſt their Sins, that they may turn from their Sins. They muſt cry with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, with vehemency, with ſolemnity againſt the Sins and Vices of the Times and Places, wherein they live.</p>
                     <p>Indeed Sinners don't love to have their Sins cryed againſt. And if the Miniſters of God will venture to cry againſt the Sins of Sinners, then will Sinners be ready to cry againſt the Miniſters of God. And if the Miniſters will not let Sinners alone to Sin quietly and to live in quiet, while they live in Sin, they be ſure Sinners will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But if Miniſters do let Sinners alone to live in Sin, to Sin as they pleaſe, then God will not let Miniſters no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Sinners alone very long They ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them enjoy any long time of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For,</p>
                     <p>So lies the caſe. If Sinners will Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and God ſend his Miniſters among them, He will have them to cry againſt their Sins. But if the Miniſters of God will not cry againſt the Sins of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but will be ſilent, then will Sinners be in danger of periſhing in their Sins: but negligent Miniſters muſt anſwer for the Souls of the periſhing Sinners. Their blood will be required at the hands of thoſe that ſhould have cryed and given them warning, that they might have turned from their Sins: Therefore the Miniſters of God muſt not dare, for their Lives, to be Silent; They muſt cry againſt Sin, if they love their own Souls. They muſt be as Trumpets thorow which the Lords voice cryes unto Sinners. Thus there is the cry of the Word, by which the Lord is pleaſed to warn Sinners, that they may turn from
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001729_0008_0FB77B67CEF55C68"/>
Sin, ſo as to prevent his Judgments from coming.</p>
                     <p>But ſometimes notwithſtanding all the cryes of the voice of the Lord by his Word, Sinners will go on ſtill in their treſpaſſes. But what comes then?</p>
                     <p>Then,</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Lord warns by His Rod And therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Hear ye the rod an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> they continue Impenitent, if they are no Reformed by leſſer Judgments. The rod comes to tell that the Sword is coming, in Sinners will not be perſwaded of the rod to forſake their Sins. For when God hath begun his controverſy with Sinners, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> may expect that he will go on, to finiſh in Righteouſneſs, if they will not be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed they muſt be ruined. The Lord will overcome when He judgeth. Thus we find it with the People of God, of old, it the fore-mentioned 26th of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and 28th of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and in divers other Places of Scripture we find that they were told that if they would not hear the Words
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001729_0008_0FB77B67CEF55C68"/>
of God, they ſhould feel the rod of God. There ſhould come leſſer Judgments, and if they did not reclaim them, then there ſhould come greater Judgments. And if they would not be Reformed by the Lord, by theſe Judgments, then He would puniſh them yet Seven times more for their Sins. The Lord would break the Pride of their Power, and would ſend the Sword to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the quarrel of his Covenant. So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we find, the Lord began with them as a Moth, by leſſer Judgments conſuming of them; and then went on as a Lyon, by greater Judgments, devouring of them. So the Lord is pleaſed to deal with Sinners. The Word cryes unto Sinners. <hi>You have Sinned againſt God, Oh! Turn from Sin, left God bring his rod.</hi> But if the Sinners do not turn from Sin, then they may juſtly look for the rod. And when the rod comes, then the rod cryes unto Sinners <hi>Oh! The Word of God has been deſpiſed therefore is the Rod come Take heed, leſt you deſpiſe the rod: For if you don't hear the Rod, the Sword may come next</hi> The cry of a leſſer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, Oh! Be Reformed by this leſt a greater come. And if there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, a greater does come, and if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners continue ſtill incorrigible, it may be ſtill complained according to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9 11.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001729_0009_0FB77B6952517018"/>
The Lord hath brought ſad things upon his People, they are environed with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; they know not which way to turn, they are exceedingly diſtreſſed, yet, <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill: For the People turneth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> him that ſmiteth them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> By theſe things we learn that God is pleaſed to give warning to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, before He brings Judgments upon them He warns by his Word, before he ſtrikes with his Rod. And by leſſer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments coming, He warns that greater will come, unleſs there be amendment by leſſer. So it is commonly with a People external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Covenant with God. He ſpeaks by the Word for their Inſtruction, before he ſmites with the Rod for their Correction: or ſtrikes with the Sword for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But if they will not be Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Word, nor Amended by the Rod, they may fear being ruined by the Sword.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. PROP. <hi>It would be the Prudence of all People to take ſuch Notice of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Diſpenſations of God, as to learn what is the deſign of God in his managing of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with His People by thoſe Diſpenſations.</hi> We are to remember that the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001729_0009_0FB77B6952517018"/>
is pleaſed ordinarily to walk in a way of Mercy toward Sinners, while they live in this World. The Sinfulleſt People in this World enjoy more Mercies than they endure Sorrows while they live here upon the Earth. And when God begins to bring any Sorts of Judgments upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: they are ſtrange, uncouth, unuſual, unexpected things; and ſo may be ſtyled the extraordinary diſpenſations of God. He goes out of his common Road, when he ſteps into a way of Judgment with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The judicial diſpenſations of God may be called <hi>His Strange Works,</hi> for at their firſt coming, they are frequently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and amazing unto Sinners. Tho' they have been told &amp; warn'd about them, yet when they come they ſeem to wonder at them, as new &amp; ſtrange things. Indeed when judgments have continued ſome time &amp; are grown common, then People grow leſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſs affected &amp; concerned with them. So when War, Famine or Peſtilence are grown common Evils among a People, then Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners frequently grow hardened, unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unaffected. They make light of the Evils. But then frequently the Lord is pleaſed to bring ſomething that is uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. There ſhall happen ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things, that ſhall mightily aſtoniſh

                     <p>Indeed He does not force the Wills of Sinners, nor compel them to Sin againſt himſelf in breaking of his Laws.

Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been a very bad man too long, but before his Death, he became a very good Man, he ſhewed and proved, beyond all contradiction, before he dyed, that he was a very good Man; he had the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the Atteſtation of Truth it ſelf, that he was become really good. So that tho' ſome of the circumſtances of his death were very doleful, yet he dyed happily he was unſpeakably happy in his Death at his End.

Among the Ancient Predictions about our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, regiſtred in the holy Bible, it was foretold by the Prophetical Evangeliſt, the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> [whoſe Name ſignifies, <hi>The Salvation of the Lord.</hi> And ſo clearly does he propoſe the Methods of Salvation for Sinners, by our anointed Lord, and ſo plainly does he deſcribe the Perſon, who is the Author of eternal Salvation, that he may well wear that Name, He foretold,] in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Fifty-third Chapter of his book, That the Lord, our Saviour, ſhould be numbred with Tranſgreſſors, while he bare the Sin of Multitudes, and made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for Tranſgreſſors. Now we find that all the Four Evangeliſts, who wrote the Life and Death of Jeſus Chriſt, have taken expreſs notice of the Punctual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of this Remarkable Prediction.</p>
                  <p>There were two notable Tranſgreſſors crucifyed with our Saviour, while he was hanging on the Croſs, bearing the Sins of all Multitudes of his People, making Interceſſion for the Tranſgreſſors that Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed him. One Tranſgreſſor was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Right Hand, another Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor was hanging on his Left Hand, He being placed between them, as if he had been the wickedeſt of all Tranſgreſſors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:001729_0040_0FB77BDFCA4D0238"/>
One of thoſe Tranſgreſſors continued Impenitent, manifeſted his impenitence in the time of his Crucifixion, dyed a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Impenitent.'</p>
                  <p>The other of thoſe Tranſgreſſors diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf a true Penitent, evidenced his Repentance in the time of his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion, dyed a truly repenting Believer.</p>
                  <p>Whether he was a true Convert before his being guilty of the crime, for which he was Crucifyed, or whether he might be Converted after his Apprehenſion, before his Condemnation; or after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, before his being brought unto the Place of Execution; or whether he might receive the Principle of Saving Grace, and might begin the exerciſe of Repentance, after he was nailed to, and hanging on the Croſs; are all of them things not ſo eaſily and certainly to be determined, as that he was a true Penitent, before he dyed, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he began to Repent. We have as clear evidence that he was a true Penitent, as we have concerning any Perſon, that we read of in the whole Book of God. We are ſure and certain that he was a true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. Some of the ſure ſigns, the certain tokens of his Repentance are to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by us, with ſome other conſiderable things, in the Sermon that is now Preaching.</p>

Our Text may be divided, according to the Two Parts of the Speech of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner mentioned in the Text. And both Parts of his Speech have ſeveral things in them, well worthy of our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have the Speech of the Penitent Sinner unto his Impenitent Companion, with the occaſion of that part of his Speech.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion of his Speech to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, was the railing expreſſion of his Companion againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is ſaid, <hi>One of the Malefactors, which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Chriſt, ſave thy ſelf and us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the other Malefactor joyned with him, for a while, in reviling of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or doubting whether he were the promiſed Meſſiah, yet we are ſure that he Repented of that wickedneſs, that ſinful In belief, or disbelieving or queſtioning the. Truth of the Word of God. But there is room for us to ſuppoſe that he did not joyn with him at all, in his Unbelieving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, nor ſo much as countenance him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001729_0041_0FB77BE305150298"/>
however, certain it is, he did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently clear himſelf, at laſt, from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, in his Impiety. For his Speech to his Companion will be his own everlaſting Vindication. It will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Teſtimony for him, that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſeparated from the Sin of that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if he had, for any time, at all partaken with him in his Sin. He ſhewed that he would no longer have any fellowſhip with him in his wicked expreſſion, but rather would rebuke him for the wickedneſs of his words. When his Companion ſhe was his Impenitence by his wicked words, he would not ſuffer thoſe wicked words to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> unrebuked.</p>
                  <p>And in his rebuking of his Companion, for his Impenitence, he diſcovers that he had himſelf truly Repented, when he ſayes, <hi>

                  <p>But here is not all the evidence of his own Repentance, for he does not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke his Companion for his wickedneſs, but he alſo acknowledges the Juſtice of their Puniſhment; <hi>They were juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for they received the due reward of their deeds.</hi> And he juſtifies the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, acknowledging that <hi>He had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs.</hi> Nor is this all the evidence of

Sinner. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, verily, I ſay unto thee, To day, thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> It means, that immediately after the ſeparation of his Soul from his Body, he ſhould be lodged in a Place of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a State of bleſſedneſs; and ſhould certainly be brought unto the poſſeſſion of what he humbly deſired; he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he came into his Kingdom.

The Day of Judgment will be the moſt glorious Day of God, that ever has been: Then will the glorious Perfections of the ever glorious GOD ſhine forth moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, before the whole World of Men and Angels, in ſuch a manner, as never before.

                  <p>For as at the Day of Judgment, there will be ſome ſtanding Condemned at One Hand of the glorious Judge, and ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted on the other Hand; ſo on the Day of our Lords Crucifixion, There was one, Impenitent, on one ſide of Him, and another Penitent, on the other ſide of Him.</p>
                  <p>And as at the Day of Judgment, the Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will appear glorious in the Salvation of them that are Saved; and his Juſtice will appear glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Deſtruction of them that are Condemned. So in the time of his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, He appeared glorious both in his Righteouſneſs, and in his Mercy; Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuffering one Sinner to continue Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent in his wickedneſs, &amp; leaving him to Periſh in his Impenitence; and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enclining &amp; enabling another Sinner

Some are bettered and benefitted by what they experience, and furthered in holineſs, and prepared for eternal happineſs; while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be hardned and confirmed in their wickedneſs, and ripened for eternal miſery, by what they experience.</p>
                     <p>This comes to paſs by the Sovereign diſpoſal of the All-wiſe God, who is not obliged to give an account about any of his Matters, unto any of his Creatures. He may do what he will with his own; we are all the work of his hands, He hath brought us out of nothing into being, and ſo may diſpoſe of us for Time and for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity as He pleaſes. And beſides this, we are all Sinners, and by our Sins we all deſerve the Wrath and Curſe of God for ever, and he would be juſt, if he ſhould leave us all to Periſh eternally in our Sins, He might juſtly with hold from us oil the Means of Grace, or a bleſſing from all thoſe Means. It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Mercy, that any are ſaved or advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Means of Grace. Therefore ſhould not any truſt in the Means of Grace nor bleſs themſelves in their enjoyment of the Means of Grace, nor imagine that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

they enjoy the Means of Grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in a happy condition: For Perſons may enjoy the Means of Grace, and yet Periſh in their Sin. Salvation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcertained to all them that enjoy the Means of Grace. For we ſee that ſome who enjoy thoſe Means of Grace, that as far as we can diſcern, are exceedingly benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to others, yet periſh themſelves. The Impenitent Sinner on the Croſs periſhed in his Sin, tho' he were near unto that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, by whom his Penitent Companion obtained Eternal Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Yet we are not excuſed from ſerious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in all ſuitable endeavours, to get good by all the Means of Grace, tho' Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be not infallibly annexed to thoſe means. We muſt be diligent in the improvement of all the Means of Grace, that we can improve, acknowledging, that if we obtain ſaving Grace, in the uſe of any of the means of Grace, it muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto the Free Grace of God, by whoſe Grace we are ſaved, through Faith, and that not of our ſelves, that is the Gift God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we muſt not ſay, that becauſe others have got no good by the Means of Grace, there is no hope that we ſhall ever get any good, and ſo it is in vain for as
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:001729_0046_0FB77BF5A66FD418"/>
to uſe thoſe Means, But we muſt in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God and with Dependence on Chriſt, for aſſiſtance and acceptance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Means of Grace, with hopes for benefit, by the Grace of God, whatever has been the effect thereof unto others, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the event thereof unto our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Had the Penitent Thief on the Croſs been diſcouraged, by hearing the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expreſſions of his Impenitent Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he would have made an ill uſe of what he heard. But when he exerciſed the Grace of God in his rebuking of his Companion for his Wickedneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Righteouſneſs, of God and the Innocence of Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his Faith in the Glorious Redeemer, Prayed to Him for His Mercy, humbly referred himſelf to His Will; we ſee that things then iſſued well to him.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, that the Impenitent Thief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Impenitent, is to be aſcribed unto the Wickedneſs of his own heart; and that the Penitent Thief diſcovered his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, muſt be aſcribed unto the Free Grace of God.

                     <p>So it is with all Impenitent Sinners, might they live in Sin for ever, and be free from Miſery: they would have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment about being Saved to Glorify God: they would be contented to live in Sin for ever, to the diſhonour of God. This is the diſpoſition of all Impenitent Sinners Univerſally.</p>
                     <p>Indeed ſome Sinners do, more plainly, diſcover this diſpoſition, than ſome other Sinners. But all Impenitent Sinners have ſo much of this ungodly diſpoſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in them, as long as they are Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, that might they be Saved and Freed from Eternal Miſery, let who will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Glory of God, they take no care about Glorifying God.</p>
                     <p>Thence it is, partly, that ſo many Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do ſo Shamefully and Wickedly put off the Work of their Souls, from time to time, and follow their ſinful courſes, until they think they are near Dying, and then they begin to think ſomething muſt be done, to get ready for Death, to make their Peace with God, that He may be willing to take their Souls into Happineſs, when
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001729_0048_0FB77BFC4FEEF6D8"/>
they go out of this Miſerable World. They deſire that God would take them to Himſelf, now they think, they can live no longer. But if God remove the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their preſent fear of Dying, and they ſeem like to live longer; they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently take to the ſame Courſe of Sin, that they were in before, they go on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes. They are not concerned For the Glory of God in their Salvation. All the Salvation that they deſire, might be ſeparated from the Glory of God.</p>
                     <p>And ſo ſome, that ſeem to be Mightily concerned for ſome of the Means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Eccleſiaſtical Privileges, the Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinances of God, Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord to be Adminiſtred to themſelves and to others, they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently too little concerned for the Glory of God. If they might be admitted to Evangelical Privileges, they would be contented to live in their Sins, to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the reproach of Religion. So, it ſeems, it was with ſome of the Hearers of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, if they deſired to be Baptized now they were up grown. So they that deſire Goſpel Privileges, in a Church State now, muſt be concerned to prepare
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001729_0048_0FB77BFC4FEEF6D8"/>
for thoſe Privileges, that they may Glorify God in their injoyment of them. They muſt endeavour that there may be, at leaſt, room to hope that they do ſincerely deſire to turn from all Sin to God in Jeſus Chriſt, and to live holily by the Grace of Chriſt, and to follow and perfect Holineſs in the fear of God, for the Glory of God; before they can be regularly admitted unto the Table of the Lord, or unto Baptiſm, if they are come to years of underſtanding.

If People did rightly Fear God, they would Repent of Sin.

                     <head>DOCT. VI. The Truth of Repentance for Sin ſhould be diſcovered in Penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not only by their Serious Concernment for the good of others and the Glory of God, as well as their own good; but alſo by their Humbleneſs before God, and their Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto God.</head>
                     <p>They muſt humbly refer themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sovereign Pleaſure of God, and Thankfully accept and improve the leaſt Mercy from God. So the Penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in our Text, not only endeavours to reclaim his Impenitent Companion from his unreaſonable Wickedneſs, but he alſo ſenſibly acknowledges the Righteouſneſs of God, in the Puniſhments that were come on them for their Wickedneſs. And he humbly Prays unto the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and humbly Submits himſelf unto the Will of that Glorious Lord, and ſhews a willingneſs to be contented with the leaſt Mercy that might be conferred on him, and waits on the Lord for His own Time to know His Will. So Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo Thankful was he in his Repentance:</p>
                     <p>We might here ſay, that the Penitent Sinner on the Croſs, having Preached a good Sermon, he then made a good Prayer, in the hearing of Jeſus Chriſt. His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was Occaſioned by what was La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:001729_0057_0FB77A85560659F8"/>
the Railing Language of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature at our Suffering Saviour. His Prayer was anſwered with what was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, the Gracious Promiſe of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Saviour to a Diſtreſſed Sinner.</p>
                     <p>The Converted Sinner concerned for the Glory of God, perceiving his Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Companion to be in a very bad Frame under his terrible Sufferings, for his heinous Wickedneſs, he Preaches unto him an Excellent Sermon to promote his Repentance toward God, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Excite him unto a Conſideration of his Duty, under his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, adviſing him to Evidence more of the Fear of God, than had hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his Language, and to conſider and Acknowledge the Righteouſneſs of God in the Puniſhment that was Inflicted upon them both for their Wickedneſs. And then he Preaches about the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, declaring His Righteouſneſs, while he Condemned himſelf and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for their own Wickedneſs, and manifeſted an acceptation of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his own Wickedneſs, and would have his Companion to be ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his Ill deſerving that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Puniſhment of his Wickedneſs. Thus he Preached to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Companion.</p>

But it is poſſible that the Penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeeing little or no Evidence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in his Companion, he then Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and makes unto him an Excellent Prayer, to entreat His Compaſſion for his own Soul. But probably with an earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſtill for the Welfare of the Soul of his Companion; for he ſo Expreſſes himſelf in his Prayer, that his Companion might be encouraged to Believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. He plainly diſcovers before all People, his own firm Confidence in the Tender Compaſſions of his Gracious Lord, ſo that he could venture the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Affairs of his never-dying Soul with Him. This might have been for the Encouragement of his Companion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in his Prayer, <hi>Lord, Remember me, when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom;</hi> he Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, the Saviour of Souls, and the King of Heaven; that He was then going into His Kingdom, that if He had but a kind Thought about him, and would but think upon him with Compaſſion, it would be to his Advantage; and he is contented with the ſmalleſt Mercy, a kind Thought: And he deſires this Kindneſs of the Lord, when he ſhould come into
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:001729_0058_0FB77A89466A41F8"/>
His Kingdom. He would wait His Will about the Time and Way for the beſtowing of any the leaſt Mercy that He ſhould ſee cauſe to beſtow upon him. Thus he Prayed to his Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>Now for the USE of this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Let all Perſons thus diſcover the Truth of Repentance for Sin, imitate the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner on the Croſs. in his diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Repentance for Sin.</p>
                     <p>It is not enough to ſay, that you have Faith in your Souls, toward the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; nor is it enough to ſay, that you have Repentance toward God in your hearts; but you muſt endeavour to ſatisfy others, that you do truly Repent.</p>
                     <p>All Sinners have diſhonoured God, by Sinning againſt Him. They ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour to honour Him by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Sins. But ſome of their Sins have been committed before others, they ſhould therefore endeavour that others may know, as well about their Repentance for Sin, as they have known about their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin. The Salve ſhould cover the Sore: and if the Sins of any Perſons have been openly committed, then ſhould Repentance for thoſe their Sins, be openly evidenced.</p>

And if God hath, in His Holy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, brought Sinners out upon the Stage of the World, to make them to be Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unto others, then it is their Duty to Glorify God before the World, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of thoſe their more Secret Sins, that have Provoked the Lord to leave them unto the more Open Sins, that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them before the World; that others may be warned againſt, and ſo preſerved from the like Out-breakings into Sin, ſo as to prevent further Diſhonour from coming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He acknowledged Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, the God of Iſrael for his God. It is hop'd that he became a true Penitent, that he truly Repented of his Sin.</p>
                     <p>But when Sinners become true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, it becomes them to evidence the Truth of Repentance by their endeavours

And one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of his going his Duty, is this that it is Recorded for his Everlaſting Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that he pleaded againſt Sin, and for God, and for Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſaddeſt condition of Humiliation, that our Lord was ever in, while He was living upon Earth, before He gave up the Ghoſt.

And beſides this, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sinners do owe more than this unto the Glorious God, for what He has done for them, in granting unto them ſaving Repentance. They ſhould acknowledge their Thankfulneſs unto Him for His Grace, by endeavouring that others may be Partakers with them in His Grace, or at leaſt, that He may have His Grace Glorifyed, in helping them to perform their Duty.</p>

Thus did the Penitent Sinner on the Croſs, he not only ſuitably adviſed his Companion to what would have been for his benefit, if he had taken his advice; but he alſo took time, while there was time, to Pray unto the Glorious Redeemer to remember him, and he ſhowed his humility in his Prayer, and

On this Inſtance we may ſay, as hath been ſaid a long Time ago. If the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner on the Croſs began his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance there, then there was one Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that began to Repent in ſome of the laſt Hours of his Life, and is gone to Glory; and but one ſuch Inſtance recorded in all the Hyſtories of more than four thouſand Years. <hi>There was One, that none might Deſpair; and but One, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is a great Sin to go to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Righteouſneſs of your own, by any of your own Doings, or by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Sin. But when you have done all that can be done, acknowlege that you are Unprofitable before God, and that

you deſerve nothing of Good from God, and that God muſt Glorify His Free Grace unto you, if you are Saved. And keep ſtill relying on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for all Good; for Pardon, for Healing, for Aſſiſtance, for Acceptancce, for every Bleſſing, that is needful for your Soul. And beg of God, that whatever He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies you, yet you may not be Deceived about your Soul, ſo as to loſe your Soul for ever; that whatever He denies you, yet you may be remembred by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Redeemer, and received into His Kingdom, tho' a Miſerable Sinner. And if it ſhould be ſo, that after all your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours about your Soul, the Righteous and Holy Lord ſhould ſee Cauſe to hide the Light of His Countenance from your Soul, ſo that you muſt go out of this World in the Dark, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Satisfaction of his being Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to your Soul, or Aſſurance of the Pardon of your Sins; yet be ſure to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Him in all, Acknowlege His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Holineſs to the laſt; and try to keep the Eyes of your Soul upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, remembring that He is able to Save unto the uttermoſt, all that come to God thro' Him, ſeeing He ever liveth to make interceſſion for them, and
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:001729_0069_0FB77AB03034FCF8"/>
He can Save at the Laſt. And remember what the Penitent Sinner on the Croſs hath Experienced, at the Laſt, for your Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. God can take from the Croſs into Paradiſe, and from the Gallows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Glory; and He can help you ſo to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of all your Sins that you may Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify Him before you Dye.</p>
                     <p>And ſo far as you may be Encouraged by this (and this may be ſome Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement) you may be ſatisfyed, that they that Fear God will not ceaſe to Pray to the Lord for you. They will continue to take all proper Seaſons, both in Publick now, and in Private and in Secret to Pray for you, as long as you continue a proper Subject for Prayer. But if you would have any ſaving benefit by their Prayers, you muſt be ſure to continue to take all Times to Pray for your ſelf, and continue Repenting of Sin as long as you Live, and continue Believing on Chriſt as long as you Breath, and keep longing for ſuch Manifeſtations of Gods Love in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto your own Soul, that you may be able truly to ſay (as in Pſal. 49. 15.) <hi>God will redeem my Soul from Hell, and he will receive me.</hi>

If you hope that you get any good, Aſcribe the Glory of all to the Free Grace of God, in Chriſt, (for there it is all due) and Praiſe the Lord for His Grace to you, and Pray that the Riches of His Grace may be ſo Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to me, that I may be Saved and they that hear me.</hi>
