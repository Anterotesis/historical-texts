         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Methods now purſued in teaching the <hi>Engliſh Tongue,</hi> are ſuch as give all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, that formerly could only be acquired by an Acquaintance with the dead Languages; This has raiſed its Value, and brought into Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem many of the Productions, and elegant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that have appeared in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, whoſe Beauties and Value were hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, only perceptible to thoſe who had labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the learned Languages, or had walked in the Fields of Science.</p>
            <p>The preſent Method of teaching the <hi>Engliſh Language,</hi> adopted in our firſt Schools, where Gentlemen of the moſt claſſical as well as liberal Education preſide, not only leads the Scholar into a proper Knowledge of <hi>Grammar,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces him to the more polite Parts of Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, whereby he is inſtructed in <hi>Syntax, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody,</hi> and all the Beauties of <hi>Trope</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, while they refine the Taſte, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Conception, and ſo improve the Mind, as to fit it for the moſt rational of all Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that of ſtudying a good Author, entering thoroughly into his Meaning, and as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing his Spirit. In theſe Purſuits ſome of the
<pb facs="unknown:021495_0003_0FB404229094CBF8"/>
moſt admired of the Engliſh Writers, both in Proſe and Verſe, have been introduced into our Schools; whoſe Beauties and Excellencies being firſt laid before the Pupil by his Tutor, he in a little Time becomes capable of himſelf to point them out. And as that Part of THOMSON'S WORKS, which include the SEASONS, is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly adapted to the Purpoſe, a very correct Edition is here offered, Printed from his laſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; to which is added his Poem, entitled, BRITANNIA, which breathing the Spirit of true <hi>Patriotiſm, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Love of Mankind,</hi> is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly well calculated for Youth and tender minds; and, as our Author himſelf expreſſes it,
<q>
                  <l>—"to rear the tender Thought,</l>
                  <l>To teach the young Idea how to ſhoot,</l>
                  <l>To pour the freſh Inſtruction o'er the Mind,</l>
                  <l>To breathe th' enlivening Spirit, and to fix</l>
                  <l>The generous Purpoſe in the glowing Breaſt."</l>

               </q>
But that this Piece may be ſtill more uſeful, and more fully to anſwer the Deſign, and lead the Youth into a Variety of the pleaſing Paths of Poetry, a Collection of other Pieces are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, to inſtruct him in the Beauties of an <hi>Ode,</hi> an <hi>Elegy,</hi> &amp;c. without raiſing the Purchaſe above the Rate of common School Books.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE AND LITERARY CHARACTER OF JAMES THOMSON; Pointing out ſome particular Beauties of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor for the Uſe of young Minds.</head>
            <p>JAMES THOMSON, an eminent Britiſh poet, was the ſon of a Divine in Scotland, and born at Ednam, in the ſhire of Roxburgh, the eleventh of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1700. He gave early marks of genius, which was diſcoverable through the rudeneſs of his puerile eſſays; and, after the uſual courſe of ſchool educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dburgh, was ſent to the univerſity of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. In the ſecond year of his admiſſion, his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were for ſome time interrupted by the death of his father; but his mother ſoon after repaired with her family, which was very numerous, to Edinburgh, where ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> lived in a decent frugal manner, till her favourite ſon had not only finiſhed his academical
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:021495_0005_0FB40425910CDA58"/>
courſe, but was even d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtinguiſhed and patronized as a genius. About this time the ſtudy of poetry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came pretty general in Scotland, the beſt Engliſh au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors being univerſally read, and imitations of them attempted; but taſte as yet had made but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ticiſm being there limited to rules and forms, which ſerved only to diſcover the inaccuracies of a poet, while his fire and fancy eſcaped their notice. Thomſon, who believed he was entitled to judges of a more exalted genius, began to turn his views to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London which an accident ſoon after intirely determined him in.</p>
            <p>The divinity chair at Edinburgh was then filled by Mr Hamilton, whoſe lectures our author attended ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut a year, when in an exerciſe in the pſalm, in which the power and majeſty of God were celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he gave ſo highly poetical and ſublime a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe and illuſtration, that it ſurprized the whole audience. Mr. Hamilton complimented him on this performance in a particular manner; but at the ſame time told him, in his ſmiles of approbation, that if he expected to be uſeful in the miniſtry, he muſt keep a ſtricter rein upon his imagination, and expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in language more ſuitable to an audience, where the learned and unlearned are equally reſpectable. Thomſon concluded from this, that his expectations from the ſtudy of theology might be precarious, even though the church had been his choice; ſo that, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome encouragement from a lady of quality, a friend of his mother, then in London, he quickly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his journey, which ended in no more than giving him an opportunity of entering on the ſtage of the unknown world, without a patron, and but ſparingly provided with caſh.</p>

to rouſe the nation to revenge. His poetical purſuits were now interrupted by his attendance on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mr. Charles Talbot in his travels, with whom he viſited moſt of the courts and capital cities of Europe. How particular and judicious his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations were, appears from his poem on Liberty, in five parts, thus in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

While he was writing the firſt part of Liberty, he received a ſevere ſhock, by the death of his noble friend and fellow-traveller, and this was ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by another ſtill more ſo, and of more general concern, the death of lord Talbot himſelf; which Mr. Thomſon ſo pathetically laments, in the poem dedicated to his memory. At the ſame time he found himſelf from an eaſy competency, reduced to a ſtate of precarious dependence, in which he paſſed the remainder of his life, excepting only the two laſt years of it, during which he enjoyed the place of ſurveyor general of the Leeward iſlands, procured for him by the generous friendſhip of lord Lyttleton.</p>

It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, however, that the favour of his royal high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was, in one inſtance, of ſome prejudice to Mr. Thomſon, in the refuſal of a licence for his tragedy of Edward and Eleanora, which he had prepared for the ſtage in the year 1739. This proceeded from the miſunderſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His next dramatic performance was the maſque of Alfred, written jointly with Mr. Mallet, who was his good friend on many occaſions, and by command of the prince of Wales, for the entertainment of his royal highneſs's court at his Summer reſidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the year 1745, his Tancred and Sigiſmunda, taken from the novel in Gil Blas, was well received.

            <p>Mr. Thomſon himſelf hints, ſomewhere in his works, that his figure was not the moſt promiſing, his make being rather robuſt than graceful; and his worſt appearance was, when he was ſeen walking alone, in a thoughtful mood: but when ſaluted by a friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they entered into converſation he would inſtantly brighten into a moſt amiable aſpect, his features no longer the ſame, and his eyes darting a peculiar and animated fire. He had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his taſte by the beſt originals, both ancient and modern, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What he borrowed from the ancients, he gives us in an avowed faithful paraphraſe, or tranſlation, as we ſee in a few paſſages taken from Virgil, and in that beautiful picture from the elder Pliny, where the courſe and gradual increaſe of the Nile are figured by the ſtages of man's life The Autumn was his favourite ſeaſon for poetical compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the deep ſilence of the night the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me he commonly choſe for ſuch ſtudies: ſo that he would often be heard walking in his ſtudy till near morning, humming over, in his way, what he was to correct and write out the next day. The amuſements of his leiſure hours were civil and natural hiſtory, voyages, and the beſt relations of travellers; and, had his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation favoured it, he would certainly have excelled in gardening, agriculture, and every rural improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exerciſe. Although he performed on no inſtrument, he was paſſionately fond of muſic, and would ſometimes liſten a full hour at his window to the nightingales in Richmond-gardens. Nor was
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:021495_0010_0FB4042D1008ACE0"/>
his taſte leſs exquiſite in the arts of painting, ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and architecture. In his travels, he had ſeen all the moſt celebrated monuments of antiquity, and the beſt productions of modern art, and had ſtudied them ſo minutely, and with ſuch true judgment, that, in ſome of his deſcriptions of his poem on Liberty, we have them ſo delineated as to place them in a ſtronger light, perhaps, than if we ſaw them with our eyes. As for the more diſtinguiſhing qualities of his mind and heart, they are beſt diſcoverable in his writings, than they can be preſented by the pen of any biographer. There his love of mankind, of his country and friends; his devotion to his God, founded on the moſt elevated and juſt conception of his operative power and providence, ſhines in every page. So unbounded was his tenderneſs of heart, that it took in even the brute creation: he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely tender towards his own ſpecies. He is not indeed known, through his whole life, to have given any perſon one moment's pain by his writings, or otherwiſe. He took no part in the poetical ſquabbles of his time, and ſo was reſpected and left undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by both parties. Theſe amiable virtues, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine temper of mind, did not fail of their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the beſt and greateſt men of his time honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with their friendſhip and protection: the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the public attended all his productions; his friends loved him with an enthuſiaſtic ardour, and ſincerely lamented his untimely death.</p>
