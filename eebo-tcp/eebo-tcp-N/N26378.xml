            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN circumſtances of extraordinary danger or alarm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meaſures muſt be adopted: for ordinary means are incompetent for extraordinary occaſions. Tho' I may not kill a man, while I am in no danger from him; yet if he be in the act to kill me, or I find him breaking into my houſe, in the night-time to rob me, I may put him to death. This reſults from the general law of ſelf-defence. The ſacred right of property will not forbid us, when a houſe is on fire, to pull down the adjacent buildings, to ſave the reſt of the town.—Nor will the right of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal liberty reſtrain the magiſtrate from committing to gaol a man who has actually done no miſchief, if another is juſtly afraid of miſchief being done by him. All theſe are extraordinary caſes, to which the ordinary rules of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or of perſonal liberty and ſafety, are not applicable: and the violation of thoſe rules, in ſuch caſes, is, in true conſtruction, no violation of them: for they were never meant to be applied to ſuch caſes, but only to the ordinary and peaceful ſtate of ſociety, and muſt yield to the great law of ſelf-preſervation and common welfare.</p>
            <p>Nations, like individuals, are alſo bound, by the law of ſelf-preſervation, in times of danger, to adopt meaſures, which would be altogether unjuſtifiable in ordinary times. They may deſtroy an hoſtile army. If a hoſtile army be ſuffered to march through a neutral country, to attack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother nation, this nation may alſo enter that country,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:035077_0003_1000A2B6114BA490"/>and oppoſe its enemy. If fields, gardens, houſes, or towns, ſhelter its enemy from the full force of attack, they may be deſtroyed. If it be neceſſary to weaken the enemy by want, the corn, cattle, and all kinds of proviſion may be carried off, and the frontier made, as it were, a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>art. Such things are, in times of danger, juſtifiable by the law of ſelf-defence; though, in ordinary times they would be unlawful and inhuman. On the ſame principles of ſelf-defence, to prevent a dangerous communication of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or any meaſure unfavourable to its ſafety, when a nation is, or is likely to be, engaged in war, it may order any aliens, who may be ſuſpected of promoting or favouring the deſigns of its enemy, to depart out of its territory.— This may be always, and has been generally done. And, unleſs where this right is regulated by treaty, this may be done at the diſcretion of the government under which the aliens reſide. For every government muſt be ſole judge of what is neceſſary to be done, for its own ſafety or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, within its own territory<note n="*" place="bottom">Vattel. L. of N. Prel. ſect. <hi>17, 20.</hi> B. <hi>2,</hi> ſect. <hi>94.</hi>
               </note>. And, even with reſpect to their own ſubjects, moſt governments have reſerved a right, without being required to ſhew any cauſe, to commit to cloſe cuſtody any ſubject ſuſpected as dangerous to the peace or welfare of the community. In England, this right is reſtrained by the writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> which gives to every ſubject impriſoned an opportunity of requiring the cauſe of his commitment, and of obtaining, in all proper caſes, his enlargement. When, therefore, the King of Britain's miniſters find it neceſſary, for political reaſons, to reſtrain the perſonal liberty of any ſubject, without ſhewing any cauſe for it, a law muſt be obtained from Parliament, ſuſpending the privilege of the writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> and Parliament may, whenever it pleaſes, paſs ſuch a law.</p>
            <p>Conforming to the principles of liberty inherited from our anceſtors, the privilege of the writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> is eſtabliſhed, as a principle, in the government of this State and of the Union<note n="†" place="bottom">U. S. Corſt. Art <hi>1,</hi> ſect. <hi>8.</hi> Penn. Conſt. Art. <hi>9,</hi> ſect. <hi>14.1</hi> U. S. L. <hi>101.2</hi> St. L. <hi>241.</hi>
               </note>. And, though Congreſs or the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:035077_0004_1000A2CA25BF8748"/>Aſſembly may, reſpectively, like the Britiſh Parliament, by law, ſuſpend this privilege; yet they cannot, like the Britiſh Parliament, paſs ſuch law whenever they pleaſe. For the Federal and State Conſtitutions have declared, that "The privilege of the writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> ſhall not be ſuſpended unleſs when, in caſes of rebellion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, the public ſafety may require it." So that, in this country, no citizen can be deprived of his liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an avowed and ſufficient cauſe, unleſs, in caſe of rebellion or invaſion, the legiſlature think the public ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires it, and ſuſpend the privilege of the writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi> But here the Conſtitution leaves aliens, as in other countries, to the protection of the general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the law of nations, or of the particular proviſions of treaties made between the United States, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whoſe ſubjects or citizens the aliens ſeverally are.</p>
            <p>Congreſs, in its laſt ſeſſion, found the United States in extraordinary circumſtances of peril, unequalled ſince their Independence was ſolemnly acknowledged. France, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without any reſpect to the principles of liberty, the law of nations, or the rights of individuals, plundered the land to the utmoſt reach of her graſp; extended the ſame unprincipled rapacity to the ocean, and plundered indiſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inately friends and foes. Of all nations and governments none had with more affection regarded the revolution of France, none had more aſſiduouſly cultivated her friendſhip, none had more ſcrupulouſly obſerved the rules of neutral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, or, conſiſtently with thoſe rules, partially indulged the views of France; than the nation and government of the United States. And if neutrality, juſtice, affection, and gratitude, could have exempted any government and nation from injury from France, the nation and government of the United States might juſtly have claimed this exemption. But what weight has juſtice, with a government without principle, without religion, and without an intereſt in the proſperity of the people over which it is placed! If the French government had regarded only the intereſt of France, it would have cultivated the affections of America. But the French government, like the falſe mother indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035077_0005_1000A296AF4FADD8"/>to the life of the child, regarded not the intereſt of the French nation, but the indulgence of its own paſſions, and the triumph of its own pride, which, exalted by ſucceſs, beyond the bounds of moderation, ſought to humble all authorities in univerſal proſtration at its feet. She commenced and proſecuted ſpoliations of our trade to an extent that threatened its ruin: and the diſmal effects are diſplayed in the bankruptcies of our merchants, and the languiſhing ſtate of our commerce and agriculture. The American government patiently and peacefully ſought redreſs by negotiation; but the preſumption and rapacity of France roſe in proportion to the patience and peace of America; and, with unexampled inſolence, ſhe repeatedly drove away our ambaſſadors ſent to claim only an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from injury, and apayment of juſt debts; required us, by an ignominious tribute and bribe, to double the damage we had ſuffered; and threatened us, if we refuſed this, with war and ravage on our coaſts, burning of our towns, and even diſſolution as a nation.</p>
            <p>What could have ſwelled the inſolence of France to this pitch of extravagance? Had we done her any injury? She can ſhew none. Was it her great ſucceſs, and mighty power? We are at a diſtance to defy her power. How then dared ſhe thus to inſult and injure us? She accounted us a divided people, ſplit into factions, among which ſhe had zealous partizans. In this ſtate, ſhe knew, we muſt be an eaſy prey: in this ſtate, ſhe knew, we could make no reſiſtance. And, while we remained in this ſtate, ſhe might ſafely perſiſt in her proud oppreſſion: and ſhe d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſo. For men, without regard to religion and juſtice, <hi>will</hi> do whatever they <hi>can</hi> do: and nothing but reſiſtance and force will reſtrain them from injuring others. France had long known and promoted diviſions and factions among us. And had ſent ſpies into all parts of our country, to procure information of our circumſtances and opinions.— Theſe travelled through America, under various pretexts, of curioſity, of philoſophy, or of avoiding tyranny or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution at home. This Talleyrand, who demanded the bribe and loan from our ambaſſadors, travelled through America as an emigrant; and, after his return to France,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035077_0006_1000B5838893F410"/>was appointed miniſter of foreign affairs. From its ſpies and other agents here, the French government received conſtant intelligence of the ſentiments of the citizens, and the meaſures of the government of America; and was thus prepared to promote its own views, and defeat ours.</p>
            <p>If ever there was a time in which it was proper for any government, to order aliens to depart out of its territory, it was proper for the American government to do ſo at this time. In other countries, this would have been done by a proclamation of the Executive. This was a new caſe under the American Conſtitution, and proper for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference of the legiſlature.—Congreſs, therefore, paſſed a law<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>"It ſhall be lawful for the Preſident of the United States, to order all ſuch aliens, as he ſhall judge dangerous to the peace and ſafety of the United States, or ſhall have reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grounds to ſuſpect, are concerned in any treaſonable or ſecret machinations against the government thereof, to depart out of the territory of the United States, within ſuch time, as ſhall be expreſſed in ſuch order.—Which order ſhall be ſerved on ſuch alien, by delivering him a copy thereof, or leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame at his uſual abode, and be returned to the office of the ſecretary of ſtate, by the marſhal or other perſon to whom the ſame ſhall be directed."</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This law further enacts, <hi>"That it ſhall be lawful for the Preſident of the United States, whenever be may deem it neceſſary for the public ſafety, to order to be removed out of the territory thereof any alien who may be in priſon in purſuance of this act; and to cauſe to be arrested, and ſent out of the United States, ſuch of thoſe aliens as ſhall have been ordered to depart therefrom, and ſhall not have obtained a licence as aforeſaid, in all caſes, where, in the opinion of the Preſident, the public ſafety requires a ſpeedy removal.

            <p>But it is provided, <hi>"That it ſhall be lawful for any alien, who may be ordered to be removed from the United States, by vritue of this act, to take with him ſuch part of his goods, chattles, or other property, as he may find conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; and all property left in the United States by any alien who may be removed, as aforeſaid, ſhall be ſubject to his diſpoſal."</hi>

            <p>One would have thought, that a law ſo reaſonable in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo conformable to the law of nations, and the practice of all governments, and, while it is altogether conſiſtent with the Conſtitution, ſo neceſſary to the ſafety and defence of the United States; if it did not obtain all praiſe, would, at loaſt, have eſcaped all cenſure. Yet this law was not only vehemently oppoſed in Congreſs; but, even ſince it was paſſed, has been reprobated by ignorant, or wicked and ſeditious men; and, for their vile and ſelfiſh purpoſes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035077_0008_1000B585AE273368"/>has been held up to deteſtation, as unconſtitutional and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical. In many parts of the Union, it has been uſed as a pretext and inſtrument, to inflame the paſſions of the people, diſturb the peace of the country, deſtroy reſpect for the laws, and relax the authority of the government; and, in one State, to produce ſuch a commotion, as threatens an inſurrection, if not a ſeparation from the Union.</p>
            <p>It is proper for men in all ſtations, and peculiarly in my ſtation, to endeavour to counteract ſuch miſchievous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and miſerable conſequences. With this view, I ſhall examine the objections, which I have obſerved to have been offered againſt this law ſolemnly eſtabliſhed by the authority of the United States.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is objected to this law, that it is contrary to the expreſs words of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>We perhaps ought not to wonder, that this objection is made. Added to the want of ſenſe and knowledge in ſome or the objectors, of modeſty in moſt of them, and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral diſpoſition, from prejudices excited and nouriſhed by ſlander, to believe every act of adminiſtration wrong; the habit of oppoſition prepares their minds to make and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. For a habit of oppoſing every thing makes dreadful havoc, not only on the feelings and conſcience, but on the underſtanding itſelf.</p>
            <p>This objection is made on two grounds.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that the Conſtitution declares, that "the migration or importation of ſuch perſons, as any of the States now exiſting, ſhall think proper to admit, ſhall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be prohibited by Congreſs, prior to the year one thouſand eight hundred and eight; but a tax or duty may be impoſed on ſuch importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each perſon<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9.</note>." From this it is inferred, that, as Congreſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet prohibit ſuch migration or importation, they canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> remove the perſons, who have migrated or been imported for this, it is ſaid, would be, in effect, prohibiting the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration or importation.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the prohibition in view, reſpected only ſlaves. This was univerſally underſtood, at the time
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035077_0009_1000A2983321B8C0"/>of the publication of the Conſtitution, during its diſcuſſion, and ever ſince. All the members of the Convention know this. The Speaker of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of Congreſs, who was a member of the Convention, did, in the argument on this bill, in a committee of that houſe, expreſsly declare this to have been the avowed ſenſe of the Convention, on this clauſe of the Conſtitution; and no man, of any knowledge of the ſubject, has ever ſeriouſly entertained a doubt of this. The Convention was ſo averſe to the traffic in human beings, that they would not directly name ſlaves, ſlavery, or the ſlave-trade. The ſouthern members thought their States not yet prepared for the prohibition of this traffic. The other members agreed to give thoſe States twenty years to think of it. In that ſpace, they would probably aboliſh the ſlave-trade themſelves; or, after that, Congreſs might do it. In the mean time, the Convention would not give ſlavery the ſanction of being expreſsly named. Inſtead of the word <hi>ſlaves,</hi> the word <hi>perſons</hi> was uſed; and, to correſpond with this, the word <hi>migration,</hi> and explanatory of this, the word <hi>importation,</hi> as more properly applicable to ſlaves, or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> conſidered, not as aliens, but as <hi>property.</hi> Or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this prohibition as reſpecting only ſlaves, we find another reaſon for this conſtruction, in the power reſerved to Congreſs "to impoſe a tax on ſuch <hi>importation;</hi>" while no ſuch power is expreſſed as to migration; and thus for conſtruing thoſe words as meaning a different manner of introducing ſlaves. Congreſs is reſtrained from prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting their <hi>importation</hi> by ſea, or their <hi>migration</hi> by land, into any of the States; but may ſay a duty on their firſt. importation, not on any ſubſequent migration; the duty in that caſe being preſumed to have been paid before.— While the prejudices or neceſſities <hi>of the State then exiſting</hi> were thus indulged; the Convention confined this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to them, and did not reſtrain Congreſs from prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the migration or importation of ſlaves into any State <hi>thereafter to be establiſhed;</hi> but left them to the diſcretion of Congreſs. Whatever reaſon may be aſſigned for it, this is certain, that it was the plain meaning of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and has been the uniform conſtruction of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035077_0010_1000B587E0190698"/>Conſtitution, that the reſtraint laid on Congreſs, by this clauſe of the Conſtitution, applies only to the prohibition of introducing ſlaves.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing this not the true conſtruction of this clauſe of the Conſtitution, and ſuppoſing that Congreſs is thereby reſtrained from prohibiting the migration or importation of any aliens whatever; it does not follow, as a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from this, that Congreſs can make no law to remove ſuch aliens. A rule will not be extended beyond the ſtrict words, if this extenſion will promote mischief; eſpecially if it endanger the ſafety of the people, which is the ſupreme law. I would aſk whether this reſtraint, ſuppoſing it to reſpect aliens generally, muſt not be limited to times of peace; and whether it muſt govern in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary times of danger, or muſt then give way to the great rule of ſelf-defence and general welfare? Let us try this conſtruction by the rules of reaſoning. It is a rule, that, if an argument prove too much, it is unſound.— Suppoſe a body of Frenchmen to arrive at Boſton, with arms and ammunition, which men may carry for their own defence, and tell the people there, that they are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> who have migrated, to ſettle peaceably in the country. Another body of ſuch emigrants, with the ſame tale in their mouths, arrives at New-York; another, at Philadelphia; another, at Norfolk; and another, at Charleſton. Muſt the State Legiſlatures of Maſſachuſetts, of New-York, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well; the Boſton emigrant march peaceably into Connecticut; and the South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina emigrants into North Carolina; and ſo of the others till they all meet peaceably in Maryland; and then declare that they are come, by order of the Directory, to ſettle there, and to prevail on the Preſident and Congreſs, to give the tribute demanded by the Directory. All this they may do; and yet, if Congreſs had proceeded to make a law to prevent their landing, or effect their rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </note>" The reſtraint or expulſion of aliens, in times of war or danger, has, by almoſt all nations, been conſidered as a neceſſary meaſure of protection and ſelf-defence: and, from the nature of the caſe, the law of nations, and the general conſtitutional authority of the government, I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit myſelf to doubt, that a power to reſtrain or expel them neceſſarily exiſts in the government of the United States, as in every government charged with the general welfare the common defence, and protection againſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and domeſtic violence. If this be a neceſſary and proper mean of accompliſhing any object, with which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he government of the United States is charged; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of exerting it is clearly veſted in that government. The difficulty of obtaining the univerſal conſent of the individual States to any meaſure, however ſalutary, was
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035077_0012_1000A2D13677A638"/>ſufficiently experienced, as the great evil to be remedied by the Conſtitution. And a conſtruction of this Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were it admiſſible, will not be favoured, which would leave the general defence of the nation at hazard, on the caprice of a ſingle State.</p>
            <p>But this law is ſaid to be contrary to the expreſs words of the Conſtitution, becauſe the Conſtitution declares, that "the trial of all crimes ſhall be by jury."<note n="*" place="bottom">Conſt. Art. <hi>3,</hi> ſect. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>There is one general obſervation, which applies to all the objections to this law drawn from the Conſtitution. It is this; that aliens are not pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ties to this inſtrument, and, therefore, can claim no benefit under it, unleſs they are expreſsly named. The Conſtitution is made by "the people of the United States."<note n="†" place="bottom">Conſt. Preamble.</note> And for whoſe benefit? For the benefit of the people of the United States ſurely. It is the charter of the privileges of the citizens of the United States, to which none but citizens of the United States can thereby claim title. The people of the United States therein limit the power of their government over themſelves; but lay no reſtraint on the power of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over aliens. This was not in their view at all. Until aliens become citizens, they are in the power of the ordinary legiſlature. The legiſlature may receive them, and admit them to become citizens; or may reject them, or remove them, before they become citizens. When they come here, they know, that they come at the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ordinary legiſlature, can claim no privileges as citizens, and have no reaſon to complain, if this legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature remove them, before they become citizens. The legiſlature may refuſe to admit them to become citizens, by enacting, that citizenſhip ſhall be acquired only by birth. If the legiſlature receive them, retain them, and admit them to become citizens; then, and not before, have they a right to claim the benefit of the Conſtitution made for citizens. This is clear reaſoning. The citizens, who made the Conſtitution, bargained for themſelves, and all who, after them, ſhould become citizens; but did not bargain for aliens. Would an American citizen, removing into France, claim, as a citizen, the benefit of the French
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035077_0013_1000A29E616948A0"/>Conſtitution, againſt an act of the legiſlature? Would a man received, under the laws of hoſpitality, into the houſe of another, tell the maſter of the houſe, when he orders him to depart, becauſe he ſuſpects him of ill deſigns; <hi>"I will not go, you have a leaſe of this houſe, you have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, I will continue in it under your leaſe?"</hi> Aliens are tenants at will, and may be removed at the diſcretion of the owner. When they become citizens, they become tenants on fixed terms, and cannot be removed, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe terms: they are freeholders, and cannot be deprived of their rights, but on a known forfeiture regularly aſcertained.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, aliens have no right to remain, it is no deprivation of right to order them to depart; and, if it be no deprivation of right, it can be no puniſhment; and, if it be no puniſhment, this order may be made, without any crime, on the mere ſuſpicion or arbitrary will of the legiſlature, which, with reſpect to them, is ſovereign, as, with reſpect to citizens, the Conſtitution is ſovereign. Even a citizen may be deprived of his right to perſonal liberty, without any actual crime, on the mere ſuſpicion of another, on which a magiſtrate deems it neceſſary to require ſecurity of the peace. So may an alien be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of our indulgence to remain among us, on the mere ſuſpicion of the legiſlature, that his reſidence here is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the public peace. This, being no deprivation of right, but a mere denial of a favour; is no puniſhment, but a mere exerciſe of the right of ſelf-defence, which the government of the United States, like that of every other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may exert at diſcretion, without any crime or any trial.</p>
            <p>All that is ſaid of a right to trial by jury is out of the queſtion. That refers to an inveſtigation of offences pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to puniſhment, or a deprivation of a right.—Here there is no offence, but a ſuſpicion, alledged: and, as, even in the caſe of a citizen, he may be impriſoned, for the ſecurity of an individual; ſo, in the caſe of an alien, he may be removed, for the ſecurity of the nation. And, in this, there is no puniſhment, becauſe there is no depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a right. It is neither an injury nor a puniſhment; it is a meaſure of ſelf-defence, inherent in every owner
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035077_0014_1000A2DA51346758"/>of a houſe, to turn out of his houſe a ſtranger, whom he does not chooſe to entertain longer.</p>
            <p>I will again put the caſe of a ſtranger admitted, under the laws of hoſpitality, into a houſe. The owner thinks he has reaſon to ſuſpect, that this ſtranger intends to rob or murder him; or to aſſiſt a gang of thieves, whom he ſuſpects of this intention. He tells the ſtranger, that he has ſuch ſuſpicion; and deſires him to depart. If the ſtranger ſay, <hi>"Your ſuſpicions are wrong, you must prove them, carry me before a magistrate, and let me be tried and convicted, before you take upon you to turn me out of your houſe;"</hi> would this be an anſwer? Shall the maſter of the houſe, in order to give the ſtranger the privilege of being tried and convicted, give him and his aſſociates an opportunity of accompliſhing the wicked purpoſes ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Suppoſe the maſter of the houſe reply, <hi>"I am not well acquainted with your character, but, whatever it be. I have a right to turn you out; go to my ſteward, and, if you can ſo explain yourſelf to him, as that he chooſe to permit you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, I agree; but, if he order you to depart, you must go;"</hi> would not this be reaſonable? Would this be any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtranger? No; it is the right of ſelf-defence. But, as a right to exerciſe this power will not authoriſe the maſter of the houſe wantonly to beat the ſtranger, or violently to take his money from him; ſo a right, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move an alien from our territory, does not authoriſe a power to puniſh him without a trial by jury.</p>
            <p>That aliens, before they can be puniſhed, or deprived of any right, for an offence, muſt be tried by a jury, reſults not from the expreſs words of the Conſtitution, which refer not to them, but to citizens. It reſults from this, that our Courts know no other mode of trial, and have no authority to adopt any other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, if this law ſhould not be contrary to the expreſs words, it is objected, that it is contrary to the principles, of the Conſtitution, which diſtributes the legiſlative, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and executive powers into three departments; while this law confounds them all in the Executive; and this, it is ſaid, eſtabliſhes deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035077_0015_1000B56D32738AE8"/>
I might reſt the anſwer to this objection, of a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and accumulation of powers being a violation of the Conſtitution, on the obſervation already made, that this law operates upon none, for whoſe benefit the Conſtitution was eſtabliſhed, or whom the Conſtitution was intended to affect; and cannot, therefore, be a violation of the Conſtitution. It operates only on aliens. No citizen has any deſpotiſm to fear from this law. Any citizen may, notwithſtanding this law, plot as many "treaſons, ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, and ſpoils," as he pleaſes; and, if he can eſcape the judiciary, may bid the Preſident defiance.</p>
            <p>But, the fact is, there is no confuſion of powers in this law, but ſuch as convenience or neceſſity, conſiſtently with the principles of the Conſtitution, introduces into many other laws, to which no man would dream of objecting.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution has not eſtabliſhed, and no human conſtitution can eſtabliſh, a perfect, but only a modified, ſeparation of powers. What work of Man is perfect?— It is very common, and it is convenient and neceſſary, for the legiſlature to paſs a law fixing certain principles, and leaving it to ſome other part of the adminiſtration, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive or judiciary, to aſcertain the caſes to which ſuch principles ſhall be applied, to detail the minute modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which no foreſight can ſuggeſt, and experience alone can diſcloſe; or to paſs a law, which ſhall operate on a certain contingency, leaving it to ſome other part of the adminiſtration, to declare when this contingency occurs, and the law begins to operate. This leſſens not the authority of the legiſlature; for ſuch diſcretion cannot be exerciſed by any other part of the adminiſtration, without the authority of the legiſlature; may be reſtrained, correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſuppreſſed, whenever the legiſlature thinks fit; and is, therefore, altogether under the control of the legiſlature. The legiſlature, therefore, only determines ſomething, which it is neceſſary for them to determine; and leaves it to ſome other part of the adminiſtration, as caſes ſhall occur, to determine ſomething elſe reſpecting this, which the limited powers of man, the principles of juſt diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and public convenience, render it impoſſible for them to determine. Were the legiſlature to take upon
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035077_0016_1000B58967B29900"/>them to modify their laws to every caſe, they muſt be conſtantly in ſeſſion; and human capacity would render it impoſſible for any one body of men, to diſcharge their taſk. Therefore, the legiſlature wiſely contents itſelf with eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing general rules, and leaves, to ſome other part of the adminiſtration, authority to aſcertain the modifications and exceptions. Thus the legiſlative power determines, that certain actions ſhall be puniſhed; but, as there may be degrees of ſuch actions, more or leſs aggravated, leaves it to the judiciary to aſcertain the degree of puniſhment; and, as, in ſome caſes, all puniſhment may be diſpenſed with, leaves it to the executive to pardon, at his diſcretion. All this is neceſſary for the ſake of humanity, juſtice, and public convenience; and it ſeems abſurd to ſay, that the principles of the Conſtitution are thereby violated.</p>
            <p>On ſuch principles this Alien Act is framed. It eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes an authority in the Preſident <hi>"To order all ſuch aliens as he ſhall judge dangerous to the peace and ſafety of the United States, or ſuſpect are concerned in any treaſonable or ſecret machinations againſt the government thereof, to depart out of the territory of the United States."</hi> But, as a general exertion of this authority may not be neceſſary, it provides, <hi>"That if any alien, ſo ordered to depart, ſhall prove, to the ſatisfaction of the Preſident, that no injury or danger to the United States will ariſe; from ſuffering ſuch alien to reſide therein; the Preſident may grant a licence to ſuch alien to remain within the United States."</hi> What more prudent or proper method could the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have adopted? While they were in ſeſſion, and a war was in view; muſt they wait, till there was a declared war, or an actual invaſion, before they eſtabliſhed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that aliens might be removed, in a certain manner? When they eſtabliſhed this principle, were they obliged to eſtabliſh it without any exception? Or muſt they ſit or be convened, to decide on every caſe proper as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? This would ſeem, if not abſurd and impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at leaſt, very inconvenient. Surely the legiſlature die better. Congreſs has, by this law, declared, that aliens are removeable; juſt as that offenders are puniſhable; and has ſaid, that the Preſident may chooſe, out of all, what aliens ſhall be removed, juſt as he may chooſe out of all what offenders ſhall be puniſhed. The Preſident may tell
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035077_0017_1000B56FCAD94860"/>any alien, "<hi>I will permit or licenſe you to remain;</hi> as he may tell any offender, <hi>"I will pardon you."</hi> And, in doing this, Congreſs has violated no principle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Leſt this law, when' tried by the words, and by the principles, of the Conſtitution, ſhould appear unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, and eſcape cenſure; it has been endeavoured to excite a clamour againſt it, by drawing a melting picture of the diſtreſs of aliens, who may thus be ordered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the country, at the will of one man.</p>
            <p>This is all work of imagination. It cannot be denied, that there is a right in the United States, as in every other nation, to remove aliens; and that there may be caſes, in which the ſafety of the nation will render it neceſſary to exert this right.—And, I think, it cannot be denied, that, in the laſt ſeſſion of Congreſs, the United States were, of any nation ever was, in a condition that required it, as it ſolemn duty, to exert this right. The rights and ſafety of individuals muſt never be put into competition with the rights and ſafety of a nation. Aliens have but an <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> right, the right of hoſpitality and civility, to remain in any nation, to which they are not bound to permanent allegiance. And if the rulers of the nation, in which they have a temporary indulgence to reſide, ſuſpect any danger to the nation, from their reſidence, and order them to depart, they have <hi>no right</hi> to remain. The United States were threatened with danger from France, and by the ſame means which France has uniformly adopted, to bring danger and deſtruction on other countries; inteſtine diviſions. Aliens having the leaſt intereſt in the proſperity of this country, and owing the leaſt duty, only a temporary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

May the God of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom open our eyes to the excellence of our Conſtitution, and the purity and prudence of our adminiſtration; and to the folly, madneſs, and wickedneſs of thoſe demagogues, who miſlead this people from their intereſts and duties, and glory in their guilt. May he wean us from all partialities and prejudices towards any foreign nation; unite our hearts in love, and ſupport of our government; and preſerve us from the machinations of a government, ambitious, deſperate, faithleſs, and corrupt; which flatters only to deceive; and careſſes only to deſtroy.</p>
