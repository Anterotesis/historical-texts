            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVICE to a <hi>Young</hi> Tradesman. Written by an Old One. [Sold at the <hi>New Printing-Office,</hi> in <hi>BOSTON.</hi>]</head>
            <head type="sub">To my Friend <hi>A. B.</hi> As you have desired it of me, I write the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hints, which have been of Service to me, and may, if observed, be so to you.</head>
            <p>REmember that TIME is Money. He that can earn ten Shillings a Day by his Labour, and goes abroad or sits idle one Half of that Day, though he spends but Six-Pence during his Diversion or Idleness, ought not to reckon <hi>that</hi> the only Expence; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five Shillings besides.</p>
            <p>Remember that CREDIT is Money. If a Man lets his Money lie in my Hands after it is due, he gives me the Interest, or so much as I can make of it during that Time. This Amounts to a considerable Sum where a Man has good and large Credit, and makes good Use of it.</p>
            <p>Remember that Money is of a prolific generating Nature. Money can beget Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and its Off spring can beget more; and so on. Five Shillings turned, is <hi>Six</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, 'tis Seven and Three Pence; and so on till it becomes an hundred Pounds. The more there is of it, the more it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces every Turning; so that the Profits
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009119_0002_1030F8936AF87530"/>
rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding Sow, destroys all her Off-spring to the thousandth Generation. He that murd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a Crown, destroys all it might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, even Scores of Pounds.</p>
            <p>Remember that Six Pounds a Year, is but a Groat a Day. For this little Sum (which may be daily wasted, either in Time or Expence, unperceived) a Man of Credit may, on his own Security, have the constant Possession and Use of an Hundred Pounds. So much in Stock briskly turned by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Man, produces great Advantage.</p>
            <p>Remember this Saying — <hi>The good Pay-Master is Lord of another Man's Purse.</hi> He that is known to pay punctually and exactly to the Time he promises, may at any Time, and on any Occasion, raise all the Money his Friends can spare. This is sometimes of great Use. After Industry and Frugality, Nothing contributes more to the Raising a young Man in the World than <hi>Punctuality</hi> and Justice in all his Dealings: Therefore never keep borrowed Money an Hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Time you promised, lest a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment shuts up your Friend's Purse forever.</p>
            <p>The most trifling Actions that affect a Man's Credit, are to be regarded. The Sound of your Hammer at Five in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Nine at Night, heard by a Creditor, makes him easy Six Months longer. But if he sees you at a Billiard Table, or hears your Voice in a Tavern, when you should be at
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009119_0003_1030F89A055F32C8"/>
Work, he sends for his Money the next Day. Finer Clothes than he or his Wife wears, or greater Expence in any Particular than he affords himself, shocks his Pride, and he duns you to humble you. Creditors are a Kind of People that have the sharpest Eyes and Ears, as well as the best Memories of any in the World.</p>
            <p>Good-natured Creditors (and such One would always deal with if One could) feel Pain when they are obliged to ask for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Spare them that Pain, and they will love you. When you receive a Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, divide it among them (if you can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly spare the Whole) in Proportion to your Debts. Don't be ashamed of paying a small Sum, because you owe a greater. Money, more or less, is always welcome; and your Creditor had rather be at the Trouble of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Ten Pounds voluntarily brought him, though at ten different Times or Payments, than be obliged to go ten Times to demand it, before he can receive it in a Lump. It shews, besides, that you are mindful of what you owe; it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest Man; and that still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases your Credit.</p>
            <l>Be ever virtuous: Soon or late you'll find</l>
            <l>Reward and Satisfaction to your Mind.</l>
            <p>Beware of thinking all your own that you possess, and of living accordingly. 'Tis a Mistake that many People who have Credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact Account for some Time, both of your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009119_0004_1030F89D34220DD8"/>
and your Incomes. If you take the Pains at first to mention Particulars, it will have this good Effect; you will discover how wonderfully small trifling Expences mount up to large Sums, and will discern what might have been, and may for the Future be saved, without occasioning any great Inconvenience.</p>
            <p>Be encouraged to Diligence in your Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and trust in Providence. Establish a Character as an <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>faithful,</hi> as well as <hi>skilful</hi> Workman, and you need not fear the Want of Employment. Industry pays Debts, while Despair increases them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doing, something coming. Industry is sure of Profit.</p>
            <l>Do not despair; but strive to do your best.</l>
            <l>No more's requir'd: Let Heav'n make out the Rest.</l>
            <p>In short, the Way to Wealth, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it, is as plain as the Way to Market. It depends chiefly on two Words, INDUSTRY and FRUGALITY; that is, <hi>Waste neither Time nor Money, but make the best Use of both.</hi> Without Industry and Frugality nothing will do, and with them every Thing. He that gets all he can honestly, and saves all he gets (necessary Expences excepted) will certainly become RICH — If that Being who governs the World, to whom all should look for a Blessing on their honest Endeavours, doth not, in his wise Providence, otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
