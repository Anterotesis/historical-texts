            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am sure every Souldier ought to be a Believer: and of all men Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary men, when they are commanded out upon real Service, to look Death and Danger in the Face, and carry their Lives in their Hands, had need of Faith and Grace, and Interest in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Souls well secured for Eternity But it is Infallibly and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally true, that every Believer is a Souldier in a spiritual Consideration. The whole Body of Christians that walk by Faith in this lower World, the place of Sin, and Sorrow, and Temptation, and Absence from the Lord, is apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly called the <hi>Church Militant</hi> in Contra-Distinction from that which is <hi>Triumphant</hi> in the highest Heavens. Those that are arrived at a state of Glory have fought their fight, and finished the Course of their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and are <gap reason="foreign">

They are marched out of the Field, and discharged from any further Service, and enjoying their Reward. But the people of God in this world are in a warfaring state and Condition. The first moment that any man is effectually called and converted, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly wrought upon, He is engaged on Christs side against the world, the Flesh, and the Devil, taken into Christs pay, puts on his Armour, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Battel.

But he is neither engaged in, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and accomplished for the <hi>Holy Warre</hi> we are discoursing of.

And if Christ <hi>laughs at them,</hi> why should not his Friends and Followers also? <q>For he laughs (as <hi>Luther</hi> goes on) <hi>not for his own, but for our sake, that we also through Faith may laugh at the vain Counsels of Men: So much need there it of Faith, that the Cause of Faith may not be managed without Faith,</hi> Ne Causa Fidei sit fine Fide.</q> He that is sure of Victory may well laugh in the Face of his Enemies.

In the mean time it is the wisdom and duty of the people of God to improve all Advantages that are providentially put into their Hands, to secure their peace and precious Enjoyments, and to put themselves into a Posture and Condition of disputing it with those that may invade or assault them, <hi>Military Skill</hi> is necessary in <hi>Military</hi> times and <hi>Martial</hi> Dayes; and these <hi>Military</hi> exercises are not only Lawful and Allowable, but lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea, and necessary also: and the persons by whom they are supported and carried on deserve singular Commendation and Encouragement. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Mart al</hi> mighty men are <hi>Catalogui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
