            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ONE of the moſt ſacred and invaluable rights of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and conſequently of the inhabitants of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's American colonies, is <hi>the liberty of the preſs.</hi> By this is meant the liberty of publiſhing, by means of the preſs, remarks upon, objections to, and diſcuſſions of, all public tranſactions, whether relating to religion or government. Every Engliſhman claims this liberty as his birth-right: the law has made it a part of his property; none can deprive him of it without his conſent; it is not even in his own power to alienate it; and he ought in duty to exerciſe this right, as often as he thinks his communications would be of ſervice to the public.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>liberty of the preſs</hi> is ſo eſſential to the well-being of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in general, that the late <hi>Congreſs,</hi> in their <hi>Addreſs to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of</hi> QUEBEC, mention it as one of thoſe
<q>rights, without which a people cannot be free and happy, and under the protecting and encouraging influence of which, theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies have hitherto ſo amazingly flouriſhed and increaſed.</q>
They complain that the King's "<hi>profligate</hi> miniſtry," are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to wreſt it from us, and declare their reſolution not to reſign it but with their lateſt breath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:013866_0003_0F925D5347005008"/>It is a pity that theſe generous Patrons and Defenders of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican liberty <hi>forgot</hi> in their <hi>Memorial to the inhabitants of the</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated <hi>Colonies,</hi> to take notice of what ſo greatly concerned them; and that they did not place ſome guard for the ſecurity of a right, which was deemed by them ſo eſſential to the freedom and happineſs of Americans; and which, they knew, was in ſome danger of being violated and trampled upon by a ſet of people, whoſe views were more contracted, whoſe ſentiments were leſs generous, and whoſe zeal was more dimly enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than their own. To this unlucky omiſſion we muſt aſcribe it, that even <hi>the Sons of Liberty,</hi> of the lower and more illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral claſſes, are perpetually running counter to the ſentiments of the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> in ſtriving to intimidate writers, and printers, and readers, and ſpeakers, and thinkers, on the ſide of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>One of <hi>their</hi> ways of confuting pamphlets, like the old popiſh way of confuting heretics, is by fire and faggot. This proceeds from the ſame bigotry, and is dictated by the ſame ſpirit, which commonly diſgraced the dark ages preceding the Reformation. And when theſe burning zealots aſſemble together, in order to hold an <hi>Auto de Fe,</hi> I adviſe all dealers in political hereſy, to take care of themſelves. And in general, I adviſe all writers of unpopular pieces to keep their own ſecrets, as we know not what revolutions may happen.</p>
                  <p>For ſhould the writers in behalf of peace, order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be certainly known, or only ſtrongly ſuſpected, and ſhould the nominal <hi>Sons of Liberty,</hi> but the <hi>real</hi> Sons of Licentiouſneſs, Faction and Confuſion, be in full poſſeſſion of that power which they are ſtriving to obtain; there is reaſon to believe, that the <hi>writers</hi> and their <hi>writings</hi> would be both conſumed together in the ſame fire.</p>
                  <p>For thus ſays <hi>Holt,</hi> in his <hi>Journal</hi> of November 24, ſpeaking of ſome of our <hi>beer-houſe</hi> gentry, who aſſembled on occaſion of a new publication:
<q>It was with <hi>one conſent</hi> concluded, to treat the pamphlet (the <hi>Farmer</hi>'s FREE THOUGHTS, &amp;c.) as it <hi>was thought the</hi> AUTHOR DESERVED <hi>to be treated</hi>; and it was <hi>accordingly committed to the flames!</hi>
                     </q>
This is fine. It ſhews the ſpirit of the times; and clearly intimates what kind of law and goſpel may be expected, if ever we ſubmit to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſuch <hi>Sons of Liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet of ſuch a ſubmiſſion in this province, I think there can be no danger. The pretended <hi>Sons of Liberty</hi> here, have already paſſed the meridian of their power and importance. The eyes of my countrymen and fellow-citizens begin, at laſt,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013866_0004_0F925D5763677DE8"/>
to be opened to their true intereſt and happineſs. They have been witneſſes of a long train of ſuch infamous abuſes of, and inſults upon, true conſtitutional Liberty, as they think are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable. And the time is haſtening on, when men will not only venture to write and ſpeak their own ſentiments, but, in ſpite of Comittee-men, to eat and drink as they pleaſe, without any other reſtraint than that of the laws.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, under ſuch protection as our legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution can at preſent afford me, and (which is much more) under the ſanction and auſpices of the late Congreſs, who <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually guaranteed</hi> to all Americans the <hi>Liberty of the Preſs</hi>; I ſhall proceed, in the exerciſe of ſo beneficial and eſſential a right, to <hi>diffuſe</hi> ſome
<q>liberal ſentiments on the adminiſtration of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</q>
amongſt my countrymen, relating to a matter of the utmoſt importance to all the Americans; I mean, the late "adminiſtration of government" by the <hi>Congreſs</hi> itſelf.</p>
                  <p>In what is now to be offered to the public, I mean to avoid all perſonal reflexions upon the members of the Congreſs; for I never had any perſonal objections to any of them. Some of them are men for whom I have a peculiar regard, and who are generally eſteemed for many excellent qualities. If I ſhould therefore happen to ſpeak of our own Delegates, or of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates in general, diſreſpectfully; and yet I here pledge myſelf to the public that I will not ſpeak of them ſo diſreſpectfully, as they themſelves ſpeak of the King and Parliament; the reader will be kind enough to remember, that what is thus ſpoken, is it to be conſtrued as ſpoken, of them, not in their private or perſonal, but their <hi>congreſſional</hi> capacity. A man's private cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter may be amiable, while his public proceedings are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Thus, for inſtance, it is allowed, both by friends and foes, that there is not a more amiable and worthy character in the kingdom, in private life, than that of the King's preſent <hi>Prime Miniſter</hi>; and yet no monſter can be more deteſted, than his Lordſhip is in his public character, by our American pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots.</p>
                  <p>In order to form a right judgment of the Proceedings of the late Congreſs, we ought to recollect the occaſion of its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, if I miſtake not, was this. The peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the American colonies had been, for ſome time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and diſturbed, by certain acts of the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, laying reſtrictions upon our trade, and impoſing duties on ſome articles of our commerce; and it was thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the reſtoration of peace and happineſs among us, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a repeal of thoſe acts, and ſome proper ſecurity that we
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013866_0005_0F925D5967910B28"/>
ſhould not be diſturbed again by acts of a ſimilar nature. As the colonies were circumſtanced, it required the moſt prudent management and addreſs to gain ſo important a point; for it was apparent, that a ſmall degree of miſconduct would defeat the whole purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs was therefore taken out of the hands of the people, whoſe imprudence already had much injured the cauſe; and it was committed to the conduct of a few Gentlemen of diſtinction and character, in whoſe wiſdom, integrity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the greateſt confidence was repoſed. The exerciſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary power, in impoſing what we called <hi>taxes</hi> upon us, was the evil complained of by the American colonies; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this evil, and not to increaſe it, was conſequently the commiſſion with which our Delegates were veſted.</p>
                  <p>And had they attended to the nature and deſign of their commiſſion, and acted according to it, no one would have thought it expedient to queſtion their authority. The fomentors of our diſturbances would have been under peculiar obligations to acquieſce in their determinations; and I am ſure that the friends of peace would all have exerted themſelves to give full force and efficacy to them.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the Gentlemen of the Congreſs have ſo widely miſtaken their proper buſineſs; ſince the whole tenor of their proceedings was calculated to increaſe the evil, which they were ſent to remove; it has become neceſſary to <hi>inquire,</hi> previouſly to our entering into more particular diſputes, <hi>how far the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are bound to abide by, and to execute the deciſions of, the late Congreſs?</hi> For though they ſpeak in a high and abſolute tone, and undertake
<q>ſolemnly to bind themſelves and their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents;</q>
yet there is room to queſtion, whether, in ſuch a courſe of proceedings, they were able to bind any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But ſuppoſing they were able to bind their <hi>conſtituents,</hi> that is, the perſons who gave their votes for ſending them to the Congreſs; yet, be it remembered, that a very great part of the Americans are not their <hi>conſtituents</hi> in any ſenſe at all, as they never voted for them, nor ever ſignified any approbation of their acting in behalf, and in the name, of the colonies.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed farther, I think proper, in order to remove prejudices againſt what may be offered, to declare, (regard it who will) that I am not conſcious of being under the influence of any mercenary or private motives. I have no ambition, nor reſentment, nor envy, nor jealouſy, nor ill-will, that I can propoſe to gratify by writing. I feel myſelf warmly affected to the happineſs of mankind in general, and of my
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013866_0006_0F925D5A16FA2038"/>
preſent countrymen in particular; and I ſincerely wiſh, that all Americans may enjoy as much liberty, of every kind, as is conſiſtent with good order and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>I do alſo farther declare, honeſtly and candidly, that I think the <hi>policy</hi> of ſome of the late acts, reſpecting the colonies, to have been wrong;—that we do not enjoy all the privileges of Engliſhmen, while we give no kind of conſent to the laws that govern us;—and, that it is time that we were exempted, in a regular way, from parliamentary taxation, on ſome generous and equitable plan.</p>
                  <p>But then it is but fair, on the other hand, to declare my belief, that the Americans, with their own <hi>free conſent,</hi> were originally placed under the abſolute authority of the Engliſh Parliament;—that they never yet have been legally exempted from it;—that they have neither right nor ability to exempt themſelves;—and that they never can be properly exempted, but by the generous and friendly conceſſions of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now examine the grand queſtion, Whether the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans are bound to abide by, and to execute the deciſions of, the late Congreſs, or not. And here it is allowed, that ſo far as we could <hi>lawfully</hi> authoriſe them, and in reality <hi>did</hi> authoriſe them, to act, and ſo far as they acted agreeably to their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, their proceedings are undoubtedly binding upon us.</p>
                  <p>But then, if they either departed from their commiſſion, or if their commiſſion was unlawful in any degree, ſo far their proceedings can lay no obligation upon any of their conſtituents. Thus, if I empower a perſon to do for me ſome particular act, that act when done is binding upon me; but if the perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds his commiſſion, and does in my name ſome other act, it is at my own option whether I will abide by it or not. Thus again, if the commiſſion I give him be invalid, or contrary to law,—it conveys no power, and all that is done in virtue of it, is ineffectual. There can be no difference in the caſe, where the parties are a number of perſons jointly concerned.</p>
                  <p>Whether the late Congreſs was an aſſembly ſtrictly lawful or not, I ſhall not now take time to enquire. For the preſent I will <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> that it was, conſidered in itſelf, materially lawful; and that no objections could properly be made to it till it acted illegally. It is one of the undoubted privileges of Engliſhmen to <hi>petition,</hi> in caſes of grievance; and conſequently to meet together for ſettling the ſubſtance and forms of petitions, under certain preſcribed regulations. Yet, by the way, what right the Americans have to plead the privilege of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> any more than the privilege of Dutchmen, if they are not in full

ſubjection to the authority of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> let thoſe who can, ſhew.</p>
                  <p>Looking then upon the Congreſs as lawfully aſſembled, let us now atttend to their proper buſineſs. This was, as has been already obſerved, to procure for the American colonies relief from parliamentary taxation. If we examine the <hi>credentials</hi> that were laid before the Congreſs, we ſhall find, that the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> were ſent, to <q>conſult and adopt (ſuch) meaſures, as may have the moſt likely tendency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate the colonies from their preſent difficulties, to ſecure and perpetuate the rights, liberties and privileges, and to reſtore that peace, harmony and mutual confidence, which once happily ſubſiſted between the parent country and her colonies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Delegates from the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> were <hi>publicly</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to proceed <hi>no farther</hi> than, in conjunction with the other members of the Congreſs,
<q>to deliberate and determine upon wiſe and proper meaſures, to be by them recommended to all the Colonies, for the recovery and eſtabliſhment of their juſt rights and liberties, civil and religious <note n="†" place="bottom">Quere, What <hi>religious</hi> rights had been invaded by the Parliament?</note>, and the reſtoration of union and harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies, moſt ardently deſired by all good men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe from <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> were authoriſed and empowered by the Governor,
<q>to meet and join with the Commiſſioners or Delegates from the other Colonies, in conſulting upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaſures to obtain a repeal of the ſeveral acts of the Britiſh Parliament, &amp;c. and upon proper meaſures to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the rights and liberties of the Colonies upon a juſt and ſolid foundation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Delegates from <hi>Connecticut</hi> were authoriſed and empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to attend the Congreſs,
<q>to conſult and adviſe with the Commiſſioners or Committees of the ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies in America, on proper meaſures for advancing the beſt good of the Colonies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we come home to <hi>New-York,</hi> our confidence in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence of the Gentlemen appointed to go as Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from hence, was ſo great, that we gave them no particular inſtructions, but only a general commiſſion "<hi>to attend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> at Philadelphia."</p>
                  <p>The Delegates from <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> had the like general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, being only nominated and appointed,
<q>to <hi>repreſent</hi> the colony of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> in the ſaid general congreſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013866_0008_0F925D5B8F8FA868"/>In <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> the Houſe of Aſſembly appointed a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee from themſelves to attend the Congreſs, in behalf of that province,
<q>to conſult upon the preſent unhappy ſtate of the Colonies, and to form and adopt a plan for the purpoſes of obtaining redreſs of American grievances, aſcertaining Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican rights upon the moſt ſolid and conſtitutional principles, and for eſtabliſhing that union and harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies, which is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to the welfare and happineſs of both.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Deputies from the <hi>Three Lower Counties,</hi> were ſent to the Congreſs,
<q>to conſult and adviſe with the Deputies from the other Colonies, and to determine upon all ſuch prudent and lawful meaſures, as may be judged moſt expedient for the Colonies immediately and unitedly to adopt, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain relief for an oppreſſed people, and the redreſs of our general grievances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far all ſeems to be fair and pacific. The Delegates from theſe eight colonies are ſent to the Congreſs, for the moſt laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſes, of obtaining the repeal of certain obnoxious acts, and of promoting the reſtoration of peace and harmony between Great Britain and her Colonies. And in the proſecution of this great and good work, they are generally confined by their inſtructions, to the uſe of ſuch means as are <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>lawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if we go on to <hi>Maryland,</hi> matters there will appear doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſuſpicious. The Delegates from thence are appointed to do all in their power, in the Congreſs,
<q>to effect one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral plan of conduct, <hi>operating on the commercial connexion</hi> of the Colonies with the Mother Country.</q>
This expreſſion is ambiguous. To operate on this <hi>commercial connexion</hi> may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify either to ſtrengthen or weaken it, with equal propriety. If the <hi>former</hi> was intended, then their Delegates were employed to conſult the Congreſs in forming a plan, for increaſing the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between Great Britain and her Colonies, in the way of <hi>commerce.</hi> And why they ſhould have meant the latter, I cannot conceive. For I ſhould think the people of Maryland would have no objections againſt a <hi>commercial connexion</hi> with Great Britain, however adverſe they may be to a connexion of another kind.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſtep from Maryland into <hi>Virginia,</hi> and we ſhall hear more of this operation upon <hi>commercial connexions.</hi> For there the Delegates are inſtructed, nay the whole Congreſs is inſtructed,
<q>to conſider of the moſt proper and <hi>effectual</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſo operating on the <hi>commercial connexion</hi> of the colonies with the mother-country; as to procure redreſs for the much
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013866_0009_0F925D5C3A778B68"/>
injured province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, to ſecure <hi>Britiſh</hi> America <hi>from</hi> (not <hi>againſt</hi>) the <hi>ravage</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> of arbitrary taxes, and ſpeedily to procure the return of that harmony and union ſo beneficial to the whole nation, and ſo ardently deſired by all Britiſh America.</q>
From the language that is here uſed, a ſtranger would imagine, that all <hi>Britiſh America</hi> was reduced to the utmoſt extremity of diſtreſs by the <hi>arbitrary</hi> and oppreſſive tyranny of Great Britain. But God be thanked! whatever the <hi>poor</hi> Virginians may have ſuffered, we ſee no marks yet of the <hi>ravage</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> abovementioned in the province of New-York, or in the adjacent colonies. The Virginians have a right to ſeek relief from their diſtreſs, and with that view they may, at any time, reſolve for themſelves to operate on their own commercial connexion with Great Britain, if they think proper to try the experiment. But if this operation is to put an end to, or to ſuſpend, all commerce with Great Britain, how it can be productive of the harmony, and union propoſed, is more than I can gueſs. The breaking of a connexion between two diſtant bodies can have no tendency to produce an union between them; and the ſetting up a fixed oppoſition on either ſide, is not the moſt likely way to obtain harmony.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>South Carolina,</hi> while <hi>rice</hi> is their ſtaple commodity, they know better than to think of <hi>operating</hi> in ſuch a way, upon the <hi>commercial connexion</hi> aforeſaid. Therefore they only gave it in charge to their Delegates,
<q>to concert, agree to, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proſecute ſuch <hi>legal</hi> meaſures, as in the opinion of the ſaid deputies, and of the deputies ſo to be aſſembled, ſhall be moſt likely to obtain a repeal of the ſaid acts, and a redreſs of thoſe grievances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt commiſſion produced in the Congreſs was from <hi>North-Carolina</hi>; by which the deputies from that colony were authoriſed
<q>to deliberate upon the preſent ſtate of Britiſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and to take ſuch meaſures as they may deem prudent to effect the purpoſe of deſcribing with certainty the rights of Americans, repairing the breach made in thoſe rights, and for guarding them for the future from any ſuch violations done under the ſanction of public authority.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee now the powers that were committed to thoſe, who were to conſtitute the congreſs. If we compare their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions together, it will appear that the general and grand deſign was, as was aſſerted before, to obtain for the colonies an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from taxation by the Britiſh Parliament. In the purſuit of this great object, many of the Delegates are expreſsly directed by their reſpective conſtituents, to confine themſelves to the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013866_0010_0F925D5D1CD9FC80"/>
uſe of ſuch means and meaſures as are proper and lawful; ſome of them are particularly cautioned to obſerve the rules of <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the courſe of their proceedings; and ſome of them are very ſeaſonably reminded, that they were to negociate, not for an <hi>independent</hi> community, but for <hi>Britiſh</hi> America; that is, if I underſtand the expreſſion, for North America, conſidered as a part of the <hi>Britiſh dominions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe commiſſions are thought by any to require a more particular explanation, they may have recourſe to the <hi>reſolves</hi> of the ſeveral Aſſemblies and Committees, which they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed previouſly to their nominating and appointing Delegates to repreſent them in Congreſs, and in which their principles and their views are particularly explained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of theſe <hi>reſolves</hi> more will be ſaid preſently.</p>
                  <p>The Congreſs being met together, and having inſpected and compared their various commiſſions, were next to proceed upon buſineſs. With a view of facilitating the proceedings, a very worthy and reſpectable member, eminent both for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law, and his love of conſtitutional liberty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a plan, which he carefully drew up in the cool hours of leiſure and retirement, and in which he endeavoured to point out ſuch claims of the colonies as might be prudently aſſerted, and the particular modes of addreſs that would be moſt likely to ſecure them. This paper of propoſals, at firſt, met with all the reſpect that was due to the author's abilities; and nothing appeared that was inconſiſtent with the genuine ſpirit of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and moderation on one ſide, and a due regard to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and honour of Great-Britain on the other.</p>
                  <p>During this ſtate of flattering tranquillity, the artful leaders of the Congreſs found no great difficulty in perſuading thoſe members who were patriots in reality, moderate and pacific, honeſt and unſuſpicious, to bind themſelves in an agreement, that their names ſhould be ſubſcribed to whatever ſhould be carried by a majority of votes, and that no <hi>proteſt</hi> or <hi>diſſent</hi> ſhould appear in the <hi>minutes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this great point was ſecured, it was not long before thoſe ſame leaders took occaſion to throw off their maſk, and to diſcover their own natural features. This new appearance was no more expected by ſome that were preſent, than the ſpringing of a mine, or the burſting of a bomb, in Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's-Hall; nor was it leſs aſtoniſhing to them, than ſuch an exploſion would have been. The moderate party ſoon found, that they had been circumvented and enſnared; that they were allowed to have no influence in the debates; that their remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013866_0011_0F925D5DC1085BC8"/>
were ſlighted; and that every thing was borne down by the impetuoſity of their managers. Then it was, that duty and honour required them, as I conceive, to leave the Hall. This account of the unpubliſhed tranſactions within doors, is not a fiction of the writer's imagination, but what he has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from credible report.</p>
                  <p>Let us now proceed to form a judgment from more indiſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence, and ſee how matters ſtand in the <hi>publications</hi> of the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>There are but four poſſible ways of ſecuring to the colonies an exemption from the authority in queſtion; namely, by force of arms, by force of threatenings, by force of evidence that we are juſtly entitled to our claims, and by the efficacy of reſpectful repreſentations and petitions.</p>
                  <p>As to the two firſt of theſe ways the congreſs had no authority or directions from their conſtituents to purſue them; but, on the contrary, moſt of them were forbid to purſue them, by being charged to keep within the bounds of what was <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>lawful.</hi> Whatever therefore was done by them, in either of theſe ways, was <hi>without</hi> orders, in ſome inſtances contrary to orders, and can lay no obligation even upon their <hi>conſtituents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If paſſing by the words of their <hi>inſtructions,</hi> we have recourſe to the general ſentiments of the Colonies, when the Congreſs was appointed, it will not help the matter. At that time it was the opinion of the Colonies, that ſubjection and obedience were due from us to Great-Britain, in moſt caſes.</p>
                  <p>Her general ſupremacy over the Colonies was then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; and it was the opinion that the time was not come, in which it was proper to claim an independency, or in which they were able to ſupport it. On theſe principles, the uſe of force or compulſion againſt Great-Britain is both imprudent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, as being inconſiſtent with that ſubjection which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be due. Conſequently we cannot ſuppoſe, that the Colonies, at that time, intended to make the Congreſs a meer <hi>Council of War,</hi> to concert plans of hoſtility againſt Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in order to diſpoſſeſs her of her American juriſdiction; and if the Congreſs was not erected into a council of war by their conſtituents, they had no right to act in that capacity, and every hoſtile effort that they made, was in virtue of an uſurped or ſelf-delegated authority.</p>
                  <p>What the general opinion, even of the moſt diſſatisfied part of the Colonies, then was, relating to theſe points, may be ſeen in the <hi>printed reſolves</hi> from all parts of the country; and it is not to be gathered from the paſſionate <hi>verbal</hi> declarations of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013866_0012_0F925D5E83250208"/>
fellows, whoſe greateſt merit conſiſts in bluſtering and bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at town meetings, or in aſſemblies of the <hi>mobility.</hi> In moſt of thoſe reſolves, the <hi>loyalty</hi> of the people is warmly aſſerted, and their abhorrence of an abſolute independency, as deſtructive to the Colonies, is as warmly avowed. And therefore, if any weight was to be allowed to the many public and ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of thoſe <hi>reſolves,</hi> the Congreſs muſt have known, that it was no part of their buſineſs to concert meaſures that were inconſiſtent with the loyalty profeſſed, or with the ſubordination acknowledged to be due to the mother country,—at leaſt, till all other methods ſhould be tried, and found to be ineffectual, and till they ſhould receive new inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>It follows from this view of the caſe, by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that all that was done or projected by the congreſs, in the way of hoſtility againſt Great-Britain (and little was done or projected by them in any other way) was uncommiſſioned and unauthoriſed, and cannot be binding even upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>ſecond</hi> way abovementioned, I will, at preſent, only obſerve, that what they had no right nor power to do, they had no right to <hi>threaten</hi> that they would do; and that we are no more obliged to adopt the language of their threatenings, than to execute their projects of hoſtility.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> way of ſecuring to the Colonies an exemption from the authority of parliament, with regard to taxation, would have been to prove, that this privilege had been properly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, either in the original eſtabliſhment of the colonies, or by ſome legal ſubſequent act. A point of this nature muſt be proved by clear <hi>facts,</hi> and not by metaphyſical arguments, taken from the abſtract nature of Engliſhmen, and of ſuch Engliſhmen too as refuſe ſubmiſſion to the Engliſh laws. For though the parliament has always exerciſed the authority which is now conteſted, and has in a late act declared,
<q>that the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies have been, are, and of right ought to be ſubordinate unto, and dependent on the imperial crown and parliament of Great-Britain; and that the King and Parliament of Great Britain had, have, and of right ought to have full power and authority to make laws and ſtatutes of ſufficient force to bind the Colonies, and his Majeſty's ſubjects in them, <hi>in all caſes whatſoever</hi>;</q>
which doctrine is as firmly believed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Great-Britain in general, as the contrary is by perhaps one half of the Americans: yet, if the congreſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013866_0013_0F925D5F40290FB8"/>
could have made it appear, either by authentic facts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive arguments, that the parliament was miſtaken, it would have gone far towards ſecuring the great object in view. If after that the parliament would have ſtill perſiſted in its claim, we might have appealed to the world for its invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and none of us would have had <hi>ſcruples of conſcience,</hi> to prevent our joining in a general aſſociation to recover by a vigorous effort, a right that was rendered unqueſtionable. But the Congreſs has neither proved the right, nor attempted to prove it. <hi>Non ad diſputandum, ſed ad judicandum, ſe conveniſſe aiebat ſynodus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> way for obtaining the relief propoſed, is that of reſpectful repreſentation, or remonſtrance, and petition. The Congreſs indeed, has remonſtrated and petitioned; but to whom? Why, not to the King <hi>and</hi> parliament, as they ought to have done; but, as they by no means ought to have done, to the inhabitants of the Colonies, with a particular view to the diſaffected part of them,—to the <hi>people</hi> of Great-Britain,—and, as very "ſincere and affectionate friends," to the Papiſts in Canada.</p>
                  <q>"Flectere ſi nequeo <hi>Superos, Acheronta</hi> movebo."</q>
                  <p>And what is the purport of theſe ſeveral addreſſes? Inſtead of exhorting the inhabitants of the Colonies, as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to return immediately to their duty, to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peaceably, to purſue the buſineſs of their reſpective ſtations and occupations, not pragmatically to meddle with matters out of their line, and above their capacities, and to leave the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of political affairs to the conſtitutional guardians of their liberties; I ſay, inſtead of doing this, they ſet them all up for politicians and patriots, inflame their minds with reſentment againſt their lawful ſuperiors, and animate them to rebellion.</p>
                  <p>The tendency of their addreſs to the people of Great-Britain, is ſimilar, it being artfully adapted to the purpoſe; which is to perſuade them to take part with the malecontents of America, in oppoſition to their own Sovereign, and the whole legiſlative body, and in defiance of all laws human and divine. Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this addreſs, there ſeems to be no ſmall diffidence of its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; and therefore under the alternate operation of hope, and fear, and contempt, the blind and ſtupid Engliſhmen are occaſionally either coaxed, or threatened, or given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we look upon them as a parcel of fools and puppies.</p>
                  <p>After all, the addreſs to the Canadians is undoubtedly the moſt unpardonable of the three, as it diſcovers the deepeſt and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013866_0014_0F925D6001CDDE48"/>
moſt inveterate malignity againſt the mother country. In that we ſee every mean, cajoling art practiced, that was thought likely to diſaffect the Canadians to the government they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to corrupt their fidelity.</p>
                  <p>This is what the Congreſs has done in the way of petition and remonſtrance; excepting the petition to the King, which they tell us they have ſent. But if the petition be of a piece with the addreſſes, and dictated by the ſame evil ſpirit; it would have ſhewn more wiſdom, and modeſty, and as much loyalty, to have preferred a petition, on ſuch an occaſion, to the King of France, or the Emperor of Morocco.</p>
                  <p>The only way that had ſo much as a chance for ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which all reaſonable men, ſo far as I can learn, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Congreſs would purſue, was that of dutiful and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful application to the <hi>King, Lords and Commons</hi> of Great-Britain, upon whoſe united conſent and concurrence the important conceſſion depended, and if the Congreſs had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed <hi>only</hi> the three branches of the legiſlature of Great Britain, in behalf of the colonies; and if the addreſſes to them had been duly expreſſive, of loyalty to the King— of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to continue members of the great Britiſh empire,—of a willing ſubmiſſion to the ſuperintending authority of Great-Britain—of an averſion to a ſtate of independency, except in matters of taxation only—of a readineſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the King's requiſitions in all caſes of exigency, and alſo to contribute ſome equitable annual ſum, towards defraying the annual charges of government, in conſideration of being releaſed from parliamentary taxation; and if, at the ſame time, they had endeavoured to excuſe, as well as they could, the late unwarrantable proceedings in moſt of the Colonies, begging they might ſink in eternal oblivion: I doubt not but petitions, formed on ſome ſuch plan, and attended with no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that were offenſive or exceptionable; would have had much weight with the King and Parliament; and it is not improbable that the prayer of them would have been granted.</p>
                  <p>Nor let it be ſaid, that <hi>ſuch</hi> petitions from the Congreſs would not have been received. They could not have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as coming from a legal body; but they might have been received, as coming from a number of reſpectable men, and relating to matters of great importance to the public. In January, 1769, a petition on this very ſubject of parliamentary taxation, was preſented to Parliament, from a number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Maſſachuſetts Bay, which included a majority of the members of the Council, and was ſigned by Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013866_0015_0F925D60B5267200"/>
as Preſident.
<q>It however appearing that this petition had not paſſed in a <hi>legal aſſembly</hi> of the Council, and that conſequently no perſon could be authoriſed to ſign it <hi>as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,</hi> it was refuſed under <hi>that title,</hi> and was ordered to be brought up, only as a petition from <hi>Samuel Danforth,</hi> in behalf of the ſeveral individual members of the Council, at whoſe requeſt it had been ſigned.</q>
This is a caſe directly in point; and we may infer from it, that although the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not have received an addreſs, ſigned by Mr. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph,</hi> as <hi>Preſident of the Congreſs,</hi> yet that they <hi>might</hi> have received one as coming from <hi>Peyton Randolph,</hi> in behalf of all thoſe individuals who were members of the Congreſs. This way of <hi>addreſſing</hi> the Parliament would therefore have been prudent and rational, and far more likely to ſucceed than any other which the Congreſs could have taken. And after ſuch a trial, if it failed of ſucceſs, the colonies would have been leſs inexcuſable in proceeding to violent meaſures.</p>
                  <p>The reader will be better able to form a proper judgment of this matter, if he attends to the following excellent letter, written to the Governor of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay in 1765, by <hi>General</hi> CONWAY, then one of his Majeſty's Principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State, and as true a friend to the rights and liberties of America, as England has ever bred. Though he wrote <hi>officially,</hi> yet the letter is known to expreſs his own particular ſentiments, as well as thoſe of the adminiſtration. It is in the following words:</p>
                  <p>"It is with the greateſt concern his Majeſty learns the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances which have lately ariſen in your province, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral confuſion that ſeems to reign there, and the total langour and want of energy in your government to exert itſelf with any dignity or efficacy, for the ſuppreſſion of tumults, which ſeem to ſtrike at the very being of all authority and ſubordination amongſt you.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing can certainly exceed the <hi>ill-adviſed</hi> and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conduct held by a party in your province, <hi>which can in no way contribute to the removal of any real grievance</hi> they might labour under, but may <hi>tend to impede and obſtruct</hi> the exertion of his Majeſty's <hi>benevolent attention to the eaſe and comfort, as well as to the welfare</hi> of all his people.</p>
                  <p>"It is hoped and expected, that this want of confidence in the juſtice and tenderneſs of the mother country, and this open reſiſtance to its authority, can only have found place among the <hi>lower and more ignorant</hi> of the people: The <hi>better and wiſer</hi> part of the Colonies will <hi>know,</hi> that <hi>decency and ſubmiſſion may
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013866_0016_0F925D6182E8A100"/>
prevail,</hi> not only to <hi>redreſs Grievances,</hi> but to <hi>obtain Grace and Favour, while the outrage of a public violence can expect nothing but ſeverity and chaſtiſement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Theſe ſentiments you and all his Majeſty's ſervants, from a ſenſe of your duty to, and love of your country, will endeavor to excite and encourage; you will all in a particular manner, call upon them, <hi>not to render their caſe deſperate.</hi> You will in the ſtrongeſt colours repreſent to them the <hi>dreadful conſequences</hi> that muſt inevitably attend the <hi>forcible and violent reſiſtance to acts of the Britiſh Parliament,</hi> and the ſcene of miſery and deſtruction to both countries, inſeparable from ſuch a conduct.</p>
                  <p>For however unwillingly his Majeſty may conſent to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of ſuch powers as may endanger the ſafety of a ſingle ſubject; <hi>yet can he not permit his own dignity and the authority of the Britiſh Legiſlature to be trampled on by force and violence, and in avowed contempt of all order, duty, and decorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"If the ſubject is aggrieved, he knows in what manner <hi>legally and conſtitutionally to apply for relief</hi>; but <hi>it is not ſuitable either to the ſafety or dignity</hi> of the Britiſh Empire, that any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, under the <hi>pretence of redreſſing grievances,</hi> ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to <hi>violate the public peace.</hi>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">All the Printers of NEWS-PAPERS on this Continent, who have a Regard for the true Intereſts of their Country, are requeſted to publiſh the above Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in order to give ſome check to the Operation of that ſeditious Poiſon which ſo many of the Americans have been perſuaded inadvertently <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In this Letter, with which the Congreſs muſt have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, the only way of procuring the redreſs of American Grievances, and of obtaining favour from Great-Britain, is pointed out <hi>by authority</hi>; and a friendly caution is given againſt a contrary way of proceeding, as it can expect <hi>nothing but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and chaſtiſement.</hi> The Congreſs <hi>therefore,</hi> in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a redreſs of American grievances, and to obtain the favor of a free American conſtitution (which was the purport of their commiſſion) in their profound Wiſdom and Sagacity, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the only way, which they had been told would be likely to ſucceed, and have adopted that ſpecific mode of conduct which they had been told would not ſucceed, but would bring down upon them and their adherents <hi>ſeverity</hi> and <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> and <hi>render their caſe deſperate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this was ſuch a breach of the truſt repoſed in them, and ſo contrary to the very end and deſign of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, that even thoſe whom they call their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents cannot poſſibly be bound, either in honour or conſcience
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013866_0017_0F925D6236C26AD8"/>
to abide by it. Some that were forward in voting for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates to repreſent them in the congreſs, are highly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined and diſguſted at their proceedings, and ſcruple not to declare, that, for their parts, they gave them no power to ſhut up the ports, and ſtop their neceſſary buſineſs of the country, upon which the proſperity and happineſs of the people abſolutely depended; much leſs to provoke and inſult a power, which never yet has been provoked and inſulted with impunity. And as to others, who ſtill appear to approve of the proceedings of the Congreſs; they did not, becauſe they <hi>could</hi> not, give their Delegates a power to act in oppoſition to the laws of their country and that the general courſe of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was, in almoſt every point contrary to law, will ſhortly be proved.</p>
                  <p>If then their <hi>conſtituents</hi> are not bound by their proceedings, there can be no diſpute with regard to others, who amount to a large majority of the inhabitants, eſpecially in the province of New-York. In ſome Parts of this province, the people had no meetings at all, as they would have no hand in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing of committees. In other parts, the meetings did not conſiſt of a hundredth part of the inhabitants; and there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there county, town nor precinct in the province, excepting the county and city of New-York, in which the number of voters for Committee-men, was comparable with the number of thoſe who refuſed to be concerned in the buſineſs, if I have been rightly informed. The greateſt part of this province therefore are under no ties, either real or imaginary, to ſubmit to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of the Congreſs; but, on the contrary, they are under the ſtrongeſt ties, both of duty and intereſt, to give them no countenance. We are not to judge of the province in general, from appearances in the city; nor ought we to imagine, that our ſubſtantial Farmers, or the Store-keepers and Tradeſmen in the country, becauſe they have tamely ſubmitted, in moſt caſes, to be <hi>governed</hi> by the city, will conſent to be <hi>ruined</hi> by it.</p>
                  <p>As matters have turned out, it is much to the credit of this province, that ſo very ſmall a part of it was repreſented in the Congreſs. It is a farther credit to us, that, as <hi>we have reaſon to believe,</hi> the Delegates from hence oppoſed, with all their influence, the headlong and deſtructive meaſures taken by the Congreſs, that they ſtill diſapprove of them, and that they do not really wiſh that we would purſue them. This is naturally inferred from their known diſpoſition and ſentiments; and our opinion is confirmed by certain <hi>anecdotes</hi> from Philadelphia, that have reached us. If this was actually the caſe, our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013866_0018_0F925D6305108DF8"/>
to the proceedings of the Congreſs, or rather our total diſregard of them otherwiſe than to ſhew our contempt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of them, is alſo juſtified by the oppoſition that was made to them on the ſpot, by the New-York Delegates, on their firſt propoſal. None of us had any thing to do with the Congreſs but by repreſentation; all that we did by repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was to oppoſe and proteſt againſt what was tranſacted; and after having oppoſed the proceedings of the Congreſs by our particular <hi>repreſentatives,</hi> thoſe of us who were then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, are bound in honour <hi>perſonally</hi> to oppoſe them too.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch was the conduct of the Delegates from New-York, is the general opinion. We think however, that we are juſtly entitled to more direct and authentic information; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Gentlemen are now called upon explicitly to declare, how far they conſented to, or oppoſed, the reſolutions of the Congreſs. When <hi>the people,</hi> under no directions of the law, but prompted by their own alacrity, chooſe agents to appear for them, and negociate their concerns at a general meeting of <hi>popular</hi> committees from different parts of the country; they have always a right to be informed, in what particular manner the truſt has been executed. No reſolves of perpetual ſecrecy, no combinations to keep their employers always in the dark, <hi>could</hi> diſſolve the prior obligations our Delegates were under, to make report, on their return, in what manner they diſcharged their commiſſion, and how far they exerted themſelves to fulfil the deſign of their appointment.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly it is hoped, that the worthy and candid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who appeared at the Congreſs in behalf of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, will take the hint, and not wait to be called upon again, as they certainly will be if they refuſe to comply; and make a full and clear report of their own particular tranſactions, during the debates and proceedings of the Congreſs. Till we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know <hi>how</hi> they acted to <hi>thank</hi> them for their actions, will be premature, abſurd and prepoſterous,—aſking the pardon of our city <hi>Mechanics.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is called a <hi>Journal</hi> of the tranſactions of the Congreſs, after a long while made its appearance. Why this was kept back near a month, unleſs to ſee in what manner the <hi>Extracts</hi> that had been publiſhed would be received by the public, I am unable to explain. I pretend not to fathom the depth of <hi>congreſſional</hi> politics. I can only ſay, that on peruſing the <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> I was not a little diſappointed. I imagined that after a month's labour of the preſs, the production would have been a huge volume of <hi>the Proceedings,</hi> which would have clearly and

faithfully ſhewn, what part each member contributed to the mighty work that was formed. But—<hi>parturiunt montes.</hi> We are ſtill in the dark, nearly as much as ever. We are told in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what Committees were appointed to frame the ſeveral addreſſes; but we are not told what particular members of thoſe Committees diſſented from the reſt, and were over-ruled by the majority. In ſhort we know not from the <hi>Journal,</hi> what part any one gentleman acted, who was honoured with our confidence, and entruſted in ſome degree with our intereſts and ſafety. Till this matter is explained, or, at leaſt, till ſome aſſurances are given, that it ſhall be explained, every member of the Congreſs muſt bear a part of the odium of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jointly contributed to the formation of a plan, which is, like what they are pleaſed to call the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> religion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada "fraught with ſanguinary and impious tenets," and which will go near to prove fatal to the Colonies.</p>
                  <p>If the greateſt Enemies of Britiſh-America had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to contrive the ruin of the colonies, they could not have propoſed a more effectual ſcheme for the purpoſe, than that we ſhould be led on to provoke the reſentment, and enrage the power, of Great-Britain, by acts of hoſtility and rebellion. Now the Congreſs appears to me, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to thouſands of others in this country, not indeed to have contrived, but to have adopted from New-England, this very ſcheme; and then to have recommended it to the Americans with all their influence.</p>
                  <p>That a forcible oppoſition to the King's troops, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to protect the Kings civil officers in the execution of the Britiſh laws within the Britiſh dominions, is an act of hoſtility againſt Great-Britain, is ſurely too plain to require proof. The laws of England have made it <hi>treaſon,</hi> which is the higheſt and moſt unpardonable of all crimes relating to the ſtate. For when crimes of this nature are properly claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<q>The third ſpecies of treaſon is, if a man do <hi>levy war againſt our Lord the King in his realm.</hi> And this may be done by taking arms, not only to dethrone the King, but under pretence to reform religion, or the <hi>laws,</hi> or <hi>to remove evil councellors,</hi> or <hi>other grievances,</hi> whether real or pretended</q>

the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Realm or not, it is certain that Great-Britain claims a juriſdiction over the colonies <hi>as a part of its realm,</hi> and will conſider the ſame actions to be <hi>treaſon</hi> here which are <hi>treaſon</hi> in England; and there can be no doubt but that a war levied againſt the King by any of <hi>his ſubjects,</hi> whether in Europe or America, will be treated as equally criminal. Yet ſuppoſing the contrary, we know that force oppoſed to the Kings troops in America will be repelled by force; and this will neceſſarily produce a war between Great Britain and theſe colonies, in which the ſtrongeſt muſt conquer.</p>
                  <p>The people in New-England, if they have not actually <hi>levied</hi> war againſt the King, have manifeſtly diſcovered a <hi>diſpoſition</hi> to levy war againſt him; and throughout the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paſt they have been making ſuch military preparations, as can have no other end than to enable them to fight the King's troops. Nay, on a certain falſe alarm, that was given to try the temper of the people, they were all in arms, and aſſembled together by thouſands, with no other deſign than to fight the King's army in Boſton; and they <hi>would</hi> have fought them, if they had met with an opportunity.</p>

                  <p>Now if all this does not amount to an open revolt and rebellion, I have always miſtaken the meaning of the word; and I ſhall be obliged to any gentleman, learned in the law or acquainted with hiſtory, if he will inform me, or the public, what rebellion is.</p>
                  <p>Indeed what rebellion is not, we have been lately told, with much confidence, in the STRICTURES of a certain <hi>wandering ſpirit</hi>; who has thought fit to interpoſe in the <hi>literary</hi> way for the honour of New-England. This writer contends, that
<q>no man who is not blinded by the Daemon of <hi>Jacobitiſm,</hi> could poſſibly be guilty of the weakneſs,</q>
of calling <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s reſiſtance a <hi>rebellion.</hi> It will be allowed on all ſides, that if <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s dethroning and murdering his Sovereign, whoſe right to the throne was unqueſtionable—his ravaging and laying

waſte his kingdoms—his diſſolving the authority of the Lords and Commons,—and his total ſubverſion of the conſtitution,— did not amount to a rebellion; then the people of <hi>Suffolk</hi> are not guilty of rebellion. But whatever this political <hi>partizan</hi> may think of the matter, all reputable writers, whether of our own or of foreign nations, and all our acts of Parliament, that mention it, call <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s outrageous oppoſition to legal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, a <hi>rebellion</hi>; and one act in particular calls it,
<q>the unnatural rebellion, uſurpation and tyranny of ungodly and cruel men.</q>
In the ſenſe therefore of all thoſe writers, and of all thoſe acts of Parliament, the people of <hi>Suffolk</hi> muſt appear, in no ſmall degree, to be guilty of <hi>rebellion.</hi> The writer here referred to, intimates, that he himſelf is no <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite.</hi> So far may be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Let us now lift up our eyes, and turn them to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. As ſoon as thy received, by expreſs, an authentic copy of the above-mentioned <hi>Suffolk Reſolves,</hi> they broke through all their rules of ſecrecy, and, at once, gave ſuch a blaſt from the trumpet of ſedition, as made one half of America ſhudder. If this language be too figurative, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to expreſs myſelf in plainer terms. Know then, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reader, that the Congreſs, on receiving thoſe <hi>Suffolk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves,</hi> which they ought to have ſent back with indignation and abhorence; on that very day, ſome ſay in the ſame hour, but however, without any heſitation, or taking time to debate, reſolved to proclaim from the preſs, their approbation of them,—and, which is more, their <hi>thorough approbation</hi> of them,—nay, which is more ſtill, their <hi>moſt thorough approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them, without any exception. This appeared from the <hi>minutes</hi> then publiſhed, and ſigned, by order, CHARING THOM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, Secretary; in which the whole copy of thoſe <hi>reſolves</hi> is inſerted, and honoured with the following encomium.</p>

                     <p>That this aſſembly deeply feels the ſuffering of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, under the operation of the late unjuſt, cruel and oppreſſive acts of the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they <hi>moſt thoroughly approve</hi> the <hi>wiſdom and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> with which oppoſition to thoſe wicked miniſterial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures has HITHERTO been conducted, and they <hi>

temperate conduct as expreſſed in the reſolutions determined upon at a meeting of the Delegates for the county of Suffolk, on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the</hi> 16<hi>th inſtant,</hi> truſting, that the effect of the united efforts of North-America in their behalf, will carry ſuch conviction to the Britiſh nation, of the unwiſe, unjuſt, and ruinous policy of the preſent adminiſtration, as quickly to introduce better men and wiſer meaſures.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>It is denied, I am told, by ſome of the advocates for the Congreſs, that they (the Congreſs) ever meant to ſignify their approbation of the <hi>whole</hi> proceedings of the county of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> But ſuch an inſult upon common ſenſe is abſolutely unſufferable. If their meaning is to be taken from plain and unequivocal language, they certainly meant, in this <hi>reſolve,</hi> to expreſs the ſtrongeſt approbation of the whole, and every part, of the <hi>Suffolk</hi> proceedings.</p>
                  <p>That the Congreſs have, in reality, given their ſanction to the rebellion that has begun in the county of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> is to me as evident as words, and correſponding facts, are able to make it. In this ſenſe, the people of <hi>Suffolk</hi> themſelves have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>reſolve</hi>; in this ſenſe, the Americans in general are known to underſtand it; and not a member of the Congreſs has ſtood forth, to remove the miſtake, or to ſoften the common interpretation. Till ſomething of the Kind is thus done, and the language of the <hi>reſolve</hi> is otherwiſe fairly accounted for; it will be impoſſible for the Americans not to continue in the belief, that the Congreſs have taken the part which is here aſcribed to them, and have recommended a rebellious oppoſition to the ſupreme authority of the Britiſh empire.</p>
                  <p>What muſt be the conſequence of a rebellious war with the Mother Country, any perſon of common ſenſe, if he will take the liberty to exerciſe it, may eaſily foreſee. Even a final victory would effectually ruin us; as it would neceſſarily intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce civil wars among ourſelves, and leave us open and expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the avarice and ambition of every maritime power in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope or America. And till one part of this country ſhall have ſubdued the other, and conquered a conſiderable part of the world beſides, this peaceful region muſt become, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be, a theatre of inconceivable miſery and horrour.</p>
                  <p>But that we ſhould have any expectation or hope of being able to conquer or with ſtand the force of Great-Britain, is to me aſtoniſhing. I doubt not but the Americans are naturally as brave as any other people; and it is allowed, that they are not wanting in numbers. But they are without fortreſſes, without diſcipline, without military ſtores, without money.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013866_0025_0F925D72E83428F8"/>
Theſe are deficiencies which it muſt be the work of an age to remove; and while they continue, it will be impoſſible to keep an army in the field.</p>
                  <p>Some may imagine, that diſcipline of itſelf will be ſufficient for the purpoſe; and that diſciplined men may be eaſily made in ſuch a country as this. But it is not in the power of all the friends of the Congreſs, to introduce what deſerves the name of diſcipline into any of the colonies to the ſouthward of New-England; not for want of men capable of teaching it, but for want of a fund for regular pay, and authority, to keep a proper number of ſoldiers together. But had they men enough that were completely diſciplined, they would not be able to march one regiment ſo far as to Boſton. A regiment on actual duty, at a diſtance from home, muſt be punctually paid, and muſt be governed by an authority, the <hi>legality</hi> of which they are unable to queſtion; otherwiſe, they will ſoon grow tired of the ſervice, become mutinous, learn to be jealous of their own rights and liberties, and refuſe to be led on, or governed by a ſet of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional officers.</p>
                  <p>The circumſtances of New-England are ſuch, that a large number of armed and half-diſciplined men might be got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the neighbourhood of Boſton, on ſome great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral alarm; but they could not continue there a week, without eating up the country, and being obliged to diſperſe to avoid ſtarving. If it is their buſineſs to fight the King's troops, they muſt be able to bring them to a battle immediately, and at their own time; or elſe they will have reaſon to rue the attempt. Beſides; ſuppoſing they had an army of 50,000 men, provided for in ſuch a manner as to be able to form a regular encampment; if the appearance of the King's troops would not, yet a report that the <hi>ſmall-pox</hi> was among them, inſtantly would put them to flight. This is not ſaid by way of reflection on the people of New-England; for were the ſmall-pox to get into their army, and by that means, to ſpread through the country, it would undoubtedly ſweep off a great part of its inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall purſue the ſubject of the inability of America, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend itſelf in a war with Great-Britain, no farther; as the reader may eaſily improve upon theſe hints.</p>
                  <p>To thoſe who are ſo abſurd as to depend upon <hi>poſſibilities</hi> only I have but little to ſay. It is barely poſſible that the ſtars in their courſes may fight in favor of the colonies, that an earth-quake may ſwallow up the King's army in Boſton, and that every ſhip of war and every tranſport ordered from England to America may be blaſted with lightning, or overwhelmed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013866_0026_0F925D7377F2B160"/>
in the ocean. But if there ſhould be no miraculous interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heaven to defeat the natural power of the mother country, ſhould we go on to enrage it, it muſt at laſt fall upon us with an irriſiſtible impetuoſity.</p>
                  <p>I have often thought that all our hoſtile declarations and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances were never intended for any thing more than threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, in order to intimidate Great-Britain. If this is the caſe, it appears impoſſible that they ſhould anſwer the purpoſe. Whatever we may think of ourſelves, it is not the opinion in England that our power at preſent is equal to theirs. Our threatnings therefore will appear to the mother country to be ridiculous and contemptible. If we have no power to execute, we have no right to threaten; and every effort in this way will expoſe our folly.</p>
                  <p>But the Congreſs, not relying altogether on the military ſtrength of the colonies, nor on the ſucceſs of their threatning to exert it, have proceeded alſo to form an <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> in which they bind themſelves and all whom they repreſent, as far as they are able, not to import any Britiſh goods, after a certain limited time, and to ſupport this reſolution by a non-conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreement. The non-importation is extended to Ireland, the Weſt-Indies, the Weſtern Iſlands, &amp;c. After a while a non-exportation is to follow. We are then to cut ourſelves off from all communication with thoſe foreign markets, which have ſupplied and enriched the colonies; and there is not to be the leaſt relaxation, till twenty acts of Parliament are repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pleaſe us, ſome of which immediately affect us, and ſome of which do not concern us.</p>
                  <p>It is no ſmall thing to obtain the repeal of one act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, even when the regular and proper ſteps are taken; but to demand the repeal of a long ſucceſſion of acts, and to require that the Parliament ſhould make the moſt humiliating conceſſions to us, is ſuch a piece of heroiſm as has no parallel. And the penalty of non-compliance is ſtill more heroical than the demand itſelf; for it is inflicted upon ourſelves, principally and chiefly. We engage to deprive ourſelves of the comforts of life, to become as poor as dogs, and to live like ſavages, if the Parliament will not conſent to give up its authority. I have heard of non-importation ſchemes before; but of none that was comparable with the preſent one.</p>
                  <p>In our former non-importation agreement, ſome regard was ſhewn for the <hi>lives</hi> of the Americans, and therefore drugs and medicines were excepted. But now, conſiderations of this kind are not regarded, and we are not allowed to import anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013866_0027_0F925D744935C1F0"/>
nor mercury, either crude or prepared, nor Jeſuit's bark; though we know that every year thouſands of lives in America are owing to a proper uſe of theſe capital medicines. We may think little of ſuch matters, ſo long as we or our families are in health, or before the preſent ſtock is exhauſted; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſhould we, or our wives and children, come to ſtruggle with ſickneſs, and to be ſeized with obſtinate diſorders, which will yield to the force of no medicines, but ſuch as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of by our non-importation agreement, we ſhall be apt to entertain no very high opinion of the wiſdom of the Congreſs in this particular.</p>
                  <p>There ſeems to have been much pains beſtowed upon the non-importation plan, in ſelecting and rejecting, and putting diſtinctions on the various articles of commerce; but after all, many parts of it appear to be whimſical and partial. Thus, for inſtance, foreign indigo is excluded, while foreign coffee, liable to the ſame objections, is admitted. Foreign molaſſes is not to be imported, while it pays a duty of a penny ſterling; but as ſoon as the preſent act is repealed, by which it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubject to a duty of ſix pence, the importation of it is conſidered as not interfering with the rights of the colonies. This, by the way, is opening a fine back-door for the ſmugglers, with all that train of guilt which commonly attends them.</p>
                  <p>In the 4th article of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> the Congreſs reſolve, after a certain period, not to
<q>
                        <hi>export</hi> any merchandize or commodity whatſoever to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> Ireland, or the Weſt-Indies, <hi>except rice to Europe.</hi>
                     </q>
This phraſeology is original, and hardly intelligible. In exactly the ſame ſtyle the <hi>Provincial</hi> Congreſs of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay might reſolve:
<q>
                        <hi>We will export nothing to</hi> Pennſylvania, the three Lower Counties, or Long-Iſland, except cod-fiſh to the North-American colonies.</q>
But to let this paſs. By the <hi>artful</hi> conſtruction of the ſentence, it ſeems to have been the deſign of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to delude the Americans with an inſinuation, that <hi>rice</hi> might be exported from Carolina, to Europe in general, without ſending any part of it to Great-Britain. It may therefore be proper to explain to the reader, under what regulations the exportation of American rice has been placed by acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>By an act, in the reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> all rice produced in the Engliſh plantations in America, that ſhould be ſent abroad, was required to be imported into <hi>England, Wales,</hi> or <hi>Berwick upon Tweed,</hi> or to ſome other of the <hi>Plantations,</hi> under ſuch ſecurities and penalties as certain <hi>enumerated</hi> goods and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013866_0028_0F925D750DF62478"/>
were made ſubject to by an act of the 12th <hi>Charles</hi> II. But by an act of the 3d <hi>George</hi> II. it was provided, that rice may be carried from Carolina directly to any part of Europe ſouthward of Cape <hi>Finiſterre,</hi> without landing it in England, as formerly required, on the following conditions:—That the veſſels in which it is exported, be <hi>built</hi> in Great-Britain, owned by perſons <hi>reſiding</hi> in Great-Britain, navigated chiefly by Britiſh ſailors, and cleared outwards from ſome port in Great-Britain, for Carolina:—That every maſter of ſuch veſſel, before he can be entitled to a clearance, muſt obtain a <hi>licence</hi> from the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, for loading in Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, with rice, for ſuch parts of Europe as are ſouthward of Cape <hi>Finiſterre</hi>; in order to which he muſt produce a <hi>certificate</hi> from the collector and comptroller of the port where the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is applied for, certifying that he has given bond, for not leſs than £.1000 ſterling, be his veſſel ever ſo ſmall, with ſufficient ſecurity, that no tobacco, ſugar, &amp;c. ſhall be taken on board, unleſs for the neceſſary uſe of the ſhip:—That every ſuch veſſel, after landing its rice in the ſouthern European ports, ſhall proceed to Great-Britain <hi>before</hi> it returns to America; and in caſe the maſter, or others in his name, do not produce, within a limited time, a <hi>certificate,</hi> from the Britiſh <hi>Conſul,</hi> or, in his abſence from ſome principal merchants of the foreign port made uſe of, of having landed the rice in the manner preſcribed, his bond ſhall be forfeited.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all, nor yet half. It is farther enacted, that before taking in the rice, the maſters of the veſſels ſhall deliver to the collector of the port in Carolina, the abovementioned li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences and certificates, and make <hi>oath</hi> of their intentions relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their cargoes; and after going through as many other forms, and ſubmitting to as many other reſtraints, as have been already mentioned, (all which it would be tedious to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) that they ſhall pay to the collector or comptroller in Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,
<q>the full ſum for the half-ſubſidy for all the rice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in their papers; and in caſe the ſame is not paid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thirty days after the demand made, the bond ſhall be forfeited, and ſhall and may be put in ſuit, and the perſons bound therein, ſhall pay <hi>treble coſts.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the act under which rice may be exported from Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina; and from the foregoing particulars we may be able to judge, what the Congreſs <hi>mean</hi> by exporting <hi>rice to Europe.</hi> For unleſs they can believe, that the commiſſioners of the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013866_0029_0F925D75C293A718"/>
cuſtoms in England will give their <hi>licence</hi> to the Carolina ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, from time to time, to carry <hi>all</hi> their rice to the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean ports<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are to the ſouthward of Cape <hi>Finiſterre,</hi> their agreement to export <hi>rice to Europe,</hi> muſt imply their <hi>conſent</hi> to export no ſmall part of it directly to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; though they attempt ungenerouſly to conceal it from the nothern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by a ſtudied vagueneſs of expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to ſingle out any one act of Parliament, that is more obnoxious for its diſplay of that parliamentary ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy which is denied by the Congreſs, than this act which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates the exportation of rice. And yet a quiet ſubmiſſion is paid to this act, while others leſs exceptionable are oppoſed with ſuch a ſpirit of licentiouſneſs, as threatens the deſtruction of all the colonies.<note n="*" place="bottom">This rice act ſhews what the opinion of Parliament was forty years ago, and the ſubmiſſion of the Americans, ſhews their opinion at that time, concerning the authority of Parliament in American affairs.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the reaſon of this partiality is known in part. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates from Carolina were firmly attached to the intereſts of their conſtituents, and would not conſent to their immediate ruin. They oppoſed and remonſtrated with ſpirit; and rather than they ſhould be ſuffered to withdraw themſelves from the Congreſs, as they threatened, their requiſition was granted. Had the Delegates from this province, who are not ſuſpected of wanting as firm an attachment to our intereſts, been poſſeſſed of as intrepid a reſolution as their brethren from Carolina, and followed their ſpirited example; we might have come in too for ſome ſhare of indulgence. But they always ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be borne down by a majority of votes, from the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> of the Eaſt, and the <hi>Ariſtocratics</hi> of the South; and the conſequence is, that we have received no more benefit from an <hi>actual</hi> repreſentation in the Congreſs, than from a <hi>virtual</hi> one in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>It would be endleſs to point out, and remark upon, all the inſtances of the fanciful and whimſical diſpoſition of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, which appear in their papers: ſuch as their regulating the expences of <hi>funerals,</hi> but not of <hi>weddings,</hi>—their making <hi>ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary,</hi> but not <hi>agrarian</hi> laws; the latter of which a majority of the Americans would perhaps like much better, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of which, ſome people of New-England, of <hi>levelling</hi> principles, have already taken into conſideration, as I have been credibly informed. But one or two articles more of the <hi>aſſociation</hi> deſerve particular notice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:013866_0030_0F925D76796880B0"/>In the 12th article, the Committees of Correſpondence are ordered, in their reſpective colonies, to
<q>frequently inſpect the entries of their <hi>Cuſtom-Houſes,</hi> and inform each other from time to time of the true ſtate thereof.</q>
This is a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which there can be no proſpect of executing, but by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of violence. For it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the officers of his Majeſty's Cuſtoms will ſubmit their books and papers to the inſpection of thoſe, who have formed a confederacy to rob the King of his Cuſtoms. However, the Committee-men, it ſeems, <hi>muſt inſpect</hi> the entries; and if they cannot obtain them by fair means, they muſt get them as they can; or elſe this decree of the Congreſs cannot be executed.</p>
                  <p>In the 14th article the Congreſs reſolve, to have no trade or friendly communication with any colony or province of North-America, which ſhall not accede or adhere to their <hi>aſſociation</hi>; while they know it is not in the power of ſeveral of them to join in it, however favourable their diſpoſition may be to ſuch a junction. This puniſhment therefore (for as ſuch it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is decreed againſt thoſe who are unqueſtionably innocent, and againſt thoſe who may be ſome of the beſt friends to the general proceedings of the Congreſs. And, which is ſtill worſe, this puniſhment is to continue, till a complete political revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is effected, till the Britiſh Parliament is diſpoſſeſſed of every claim of juriſdiction over the colonies, and not only till every enumerated obnoxious law reſpecting ourſelves ſhall be repealed, but till the eſtabliſhed landmarks and boundaries of one of the King's provinces, which has been lately conquered from the French, ſhall be altered and removed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our dictates. Till the whole of this work is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the provinces of <hi>Quebec, Nova-Scotia, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Florida,</hi> muſt all continue under the <hi>ban</hi> of our new Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican <hi>empire:</hi> And none of us are allowed to purchaſe ſo much as a beaver-ſkin that has been brought acroſs any of the lakes, under pain of the penalties to be inflicted on the violaters of the aſſociation agreement.</p>
                  <p>If we turn back from the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> to the <hi>declaration of Rights,</hi> we ſhall ſee the principles of the Congreſs, and be able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſome proofs of their aiming at a total independency. By their demand in the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> it appears, that they mean to emancipate themſelves at once from all the Acts of Parliament that have been paſſed under his preſent Majeſty. If they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this, they know, that by the ſame methods they can clear themſelves of all former acts, and become independent; and that this is intended, is probable from ſome broad hints which
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013866_0031_0F925D7741B38818"/>
they drop in their <hi>declaration.</hi> Thus they ſay there are many other <hi>infringements and violations</hi> of their <hi>rights,</hi> of a date more ancient than the preſent reign, which
<q>we paſs over <hi>for the preſent,</hi> and proceed to ſtate ſuch acts and meaſures as have been adopted ſince the laſt war.</q>
So again:
<q>we have <hi>for the preſent</hi> only reſolved to purſue the following <hi>peaceable</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</q>
From hence Great-Britain will naturally judge, that granting even all that they demand <hi>at preſent</hi> will be no ſecurity for the future peaceable demeanor of the Colonies; ſince inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations are here given, that there are many other infringements and violations of their rights, which alſo in due time muſt be rectified.</p>
                  <p>That the views of the Congreſs are thus immoderate, is no more than might be naturally expected from a review of their principles, as expreſſed in their <hi>declaration</hi>; a full examination of which I ſhall defer <hi>for the preſent.</hi> I ſhall now only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a few particulars in this part of their exhibition, which are the moſt glaring and ſtriking.</p>
                  <p>In their <hi>preamble,</hi> they complain that our Aſſemblies have been frequently diſſolved, <hi>contrary to the rights</hi> of the Americans.— This implies, that they claim in behalf of our Aſſemblies, a right not to be diſſolved, or interrupted, by the King's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, let the tendency of their temper and proceedings be ever ſo injurious to the peace and ſafety of the public. Yet it is an undoubted prerogative of the crown to diſſolve the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whenever and as often as the intereſt of the public is thought to require it. The Congreſs therefore will not allow the King to exerciſe the ſame authority over our American Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, in any of the Colonies, which the conſtitution allows him to exerciſe over the Parliament in England. Thus, we ſee, after having rejected all the authority of Parliament over the Colonies, their next attempt is to reduce and farther circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe that of the King.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of this part of their plan, the Congreſs remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the King's Governor and General, acting by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate authority, againſt his fortifying the neck of land that leads into Boſton, and magiſterially require him to deſiſt: Whereas the King has as unqueſtionable a right to erect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes in any part of his dominions, as to erect <hi>Beacons,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Let the Reader conſult <hi>Blackſtone's</hi> COMMENTARIES.

                  <p>One of the moſt <hi>eſſential</hi> rights of the Britiſh crown, without which the King can be but little better than a cypher, is the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013866_0032_0F925D7805AB5EC8"/>
command of the <hi>militia,</hi> and of all the ſea and land forces within the Britiſh dominions. But in America the Congreſs have already wreſted from the King the command of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, in one of our largeſt provinces, and not only ſo, but they have armed that militia againſt him; and unleſs he will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to walk in their leading-ſtrings, he is likely to be treated in the ſame manner in the reſt of the Colonies,—Good Heavens! let the province of New-York be excepted.</p>
                  <p>That he ſhould have the command of any regular troops in America is thought intollerable; and therefore, the Congreſs, in their proceedings of Oct. 14, reſolve, <hi>N. C. D.</hi>
                     <q>That the keeping a ſtanding army in theſe Colonies, in time of peace, without the conſent of the legiſlature of that Colony, in which ſuch army is kept, is <hi>againſt law.</hi>
                     </q>
But this is not enough. They reſolve <hi>again,</hi> in the very <hi>ſame day,</hi> in the very <hi>ſame words</hi>; and print the reſolve a <hi>ſecond</hi> time, <hi>verbatim,</hi> in the proceedings of <hi>that very day,</hi> that it might be ſent abroad armed with a double force.</p>
                  <p>Yet what are we to underſtand by the expreſſion <hi>againſt law,</hi> is not eaſy to determine. If they mean by it, contrary to any laws that have been enacted in the Colonies, I conceive, that an attempt to point out ſuch laws, would puzzle the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>They cannot mean, that it is contrary to acts of Parliament, becauſe, they know that the Parliament has provided for the troops in queſtion from year to year, for the very purpoſe that an army might be kept in America, without having once thought of aſking the conſent of the Colonies.</p>
                  <p>If they mean, contrary to the <hi>common law</hi> of England, the poſition is more than they can defend. They indeed <hi>reſolve,</hi> that the Colonies are entitled to the <hi>common law of England</hi>; but if they are not ſubject to the <hi>ſtatute law</hi> of England, they have no more right to the <hi>common law</hi> than the Inhabitants of <hi>Otaheite.</hi> But allowing that the Colonies are entitled to the <hi>common law</hi> of England; yet there is an act of Parliament, now in force, that declares, that the <hi>government</hi> of the military, forces (which includes the <hi>aſſignment</hi> of their <hi>poſts</hi> and <hi>ſtations</hi>) "<hi>within</hi> ALL <hi>his Majeſty's realms and dominions, ever was and is the undoubted right of his Majeſty, and his royal predeceſſors, the Kings and Queens of England; and that both or either Houſe of Parliament cannot, nor ought to pretend to the ſame.</hi>" If this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways or <hi>ever was</hi> the caſe, as the act of Parliament aſſerts; then it is certain that the <hi>common law</hi> of England can afford no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for this claim of the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>After thus maiming and mangling the regal authority in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, the Congreſs, it muſt be confeſſed, in order to make
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013866_0033_0F925D78B5FA0610"/>
ſome amends, are willing enough to give it full ſcope in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and even to enlarge it there beyond its natural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional dimenſions. They apply to the King, and to him only, to relieve them from the obnoxious acts; as if they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to him a full power of repealing, diſpenſing with, or ſuſpending, the laws made by Parliament. But no addreſſes to the two Houſes of Parliament are prepared, explaining the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and foundation of the demand, and requeſting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. Does not this imply an opinion, that the King may take upon himſelf to do all that is needful, for the relief of the Colonies, without waiting for the approbation or conſent of Parliament? or, muſt we ſuppoſe, that the repreſentatives of America in Congreſs, had too much pride to ſtoop to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of a ſmall European iſland in parliament; and that they imagined, that the hoſtile preparations made in America, would terrify the Parliament into a compliance with their ſchemes?</p>
                  <p>The way being thus prepared, by an entire demolition of the authority of Parliament over the Colonies, and by a diminution of that of the King; the next part of the plan is, to make proviſion for enlarging the authority and dignity of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Congreſs and ſome of their friends. This part of the ſcheme has not yet been expreſsly avowed. It is rather too ſoon to ſpeak plainly to the public; but ſomething of this ſort may be inferred from the tenth Article of the Declaration, which is as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Reſolved, N. C. D. It is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to good government, and rendered eſſential by the <hi>Engliſh conſtitution,</hi> that the conſtituent branches of the Legiſlature be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of each other; that, therefore, the exerciſe of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power in ſeveral Colonies, by a council appointed, <hi>during pleaſure,</hi> by the crown, is <hi>unconſtitutional,</hi> dangerous, and deſtructive to the freedom of American Legiſlation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, <hi>Reader, if thou canſt but read,</hi> you may ſee, that an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> is in agitation; in which the members muſt have the ſame right, privileges and honours, which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conſtitution</hi> has given to the members of the Houſe of Lords in the Mother Country. They muſt be independent of the Crown, and independent of the repreſentatives of the people. They muſt continue for life; and according to the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, their rights and titles muſt deſcend to their heirs, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten, and from them again, to their heirs, forever and ever. There muſt alſo, I ſuppoſe, be the ſame Orders of the American nobility, that belong to the Engliſh; and then none can diſpute or queſtion, that the gentlemen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will have a right to the higheſt Order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="unknown:013866_0034_0F925D79772120F0"/>For my part, I am raviſhed and tranſported at the foreſight of this American grandeur. I long for the day, in which I may expect to ſee ſuch articles as the following, in HOLT's Paper. <hi>Laſt Friday arrived in this City, from the Eaſtward, the moſt noble and puiſſant Prince — Duke of — in America. His Grace late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was dangerouſly ill of a Megrim in the head, and a griping in the bowels, attended with an over-flowing of the gall; but we have the pleaſure of aſſuring the public, that he is perfectly recovered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh! how we ſhall ſhine with Dukes in America! There will be no leſs than fifty three of them. There will be Duke Timnah, Duke Alvah, Duke Jetheth,—Aye, we ſhall have two-and-forty more Dukes than the ancient and celebrated Edomites could muſter for the blood of them. The Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of Correſpondence will furniſh us with Marquiſſes; and the Committees of Obſervation, with Earls. The Viſcounts may conſiſt of Heroes that are famed for their exploits in <hi>tarring and feathering</hi>; and the Barons, or Loweſt Order, of thoſe, whoſe merit has been ſignalized in burning ſuch Pamphlets as they were unable to anſwer. If there muſt be Lords <hi>ſpiritual</hi> too, as well as temporal; Boſton, we know has two, that are well fitted for the purpoſe; New-Jerſey has one, and moſt of the Colonies can furniſh their quota. But to return from this digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Congreſs in the laſt mentioned reſolve, contend, that it is Unconſtitutional for the members of our provincial coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to be appointed by the crown, to continue <hi>during pleaſure</hi> only; and yet this was the original conſtitution of every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, in which ſuch appointments now take place. If we call ſuch a council unconſtitutional in New-York, we muſt mean by the word, not what is <hi>contrary,</hi> but what is <hi>agreeable</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this province. A council thus appointed, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by an act of our aſſembly, paſſed in 1691, by way of <hi>Bill of Rights,</hi> to be a proper and conſtitutional branch of the legiſlative authority here. King William himſelf, the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and true patron both of civil and eccleſiaſtical liberty, was of the ſame opinion, and appointed counſellors for this and other Colonies on the ſame terms. Notwithſtanding, and though the matter is overſtrained by the Congreſs, I have no objections againſt an appointment of Counſellors <hi>during good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi>; and I believe, that the independency of our councils, on the Crown, after their appointment, would be a real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Conſtitution, relating to that branch of our legiſlative authority.</p>
                  <p>While the Congreſs aſſert, that it is
<q>indiſpenſibly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</q>
to good government, that the conſtituent branches of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013866_0035_0F925D7A371A3380"/>
the legiſlature ſhould be independent on each other, they ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly urge, that the Council in the Maſſachuſetts Bay, ſhould be reſtored to a dependency on the repreſentatives of the people. For, according to the tenor of their late charter (a charter which it is thought better that all America ſhould periſh than not ſee replaced) the members of the council are all choſen by the houſe of aſſembly; and it depends upon that houſe, whether they ſhall be confirmed or diſplaced, at the end of every year. Could the Congreſs imagine that ſuch a dependency as this, on the loweſt branch of the legiſlature, will not have as bad an effect on the council, as a dependency on the higheſt? If not, why did they diſcover ſuch glaring impartiality? The reaſon may be eaſily gueſſed: It is the ſpirit of the preſent ſyſtem, to depreſs the power of the crown, and to exalt the power of the people; and the deſign of it, to prepare the way for introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eſtabliſhing an American Republic, or Ariſtocracy, or rather both; the former to the Eaſtward, and the latter to the Southward,</p>
                  <p>It has been long ſuſpected, and indeed pretty well known by ſome perſons, that a ſet of people in the Colonies, whoſe head quarters are at Boſton, have for many years been aiming at, and preparing the way for, a government of their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling, independent of Great Britain, to be erected as ſoon as the diſpoſition of the Colonies could be brought to favor the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Their machinations, for the moſt part, have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in the dark; but yet in the exuberance of their zeal, and in ſome of their unguarded moments, they have diſcovered enough to alarm all the friends of our excellent conſtitution, and all who eſteem the kind and parental protection of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, as eſſential to the happineſs and ſafety of the Colonies.</p>
                  <p>Near ſeven years ago, a writer, who made much noiſe in this city, who was well acquainted with the ſecrets of the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land republican faction, and whom ſome ſuppoſe to have been their agent in this province, in the warmth of an unreined ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, was led to utter more in an apocalyptical ſtrain, than was probably intended. While his mind laboured with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceptions of the progreſs that was making towards an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent American eſtabliſhment, confident of ſucceeding, and regardleſs of precautions, he took up his parable, and ſaid:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Courage then, Americans!—The finger of God points out a <hi>mighty empire</hi> to your ſons.—We need not be diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—The angry cloud—will ſoon be diſperſed.—The <hi>day dawns,</hi> in which the foundation of this mighty empire is to be laid, by the eſtabliſhment of a regular American conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013866_0036_0F925D7BC39EDD58"/>
All that has hitherto been done, ſeems to be little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the <hi>collection of materials,</hi> for the <hi>conſtruction of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fabrick.</hi> 'Tis time to <hi>put them together.</hi> The transfer of the European part of the great family is ſo vaſt, and our growth ſo ſwift, that <hi>before ſeven years</hi> roll over our heads, the <hi>firſt ſtone</hi> muſt be laid.—Peace or war; famine or plenty; poverty or affluence; in a word, no circumſtance, whether proſperous or adverſe, can happen to our parent; nay, no conduct of hers, whether wiſe or imprudent, no poſſible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on her part, whether kind or croſs-grained, will put a ſtop to this <hi>building.</hi> There is no contending with omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the <hi>Prediſpoſitions</hi> are ſo numerous, and ſo well adopted to the riſe of America, that our ſucceſs is <hi>indubit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
                     </q>
And in the next paragraph, ſhifting his imagery, he ſays: "We are <hi>moulding</hi> the great political maſs into order."<note n="§" place="bottom">See <hi>the American Whig,</hi> No. v.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe figurative expreſſions, though not <hi>fully</hi> underſtood by readers in general, enough was diſcovered to juſtify the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that preparations were then making for a revolution in the colonies, that much had been already done towards it, and that in a ſhort time the effects of it would be viſible to the world.</p>
                  <p>The grand object in view was no leſs than a
<q>mighty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</q>
for the Americans. This expected and intended <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> under the repreſentation of a <hi>building</hi> or magnificent temple, the writer views with rapture and <hi>prophetic</hi> enthuſiaſm. The time ſwiftly approaches, nay, "the day dawns," ſays he, in which the <hi>foundation</hi> of it is " to be laid." The <hi>materials</hi> are already <hi>collected,</hi>
                     <q>for the conſtruction of this glorious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric,</q>
and nothing is now wanting but to <hi>put them together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſpecimen of theſe <hi>materials</hi> was ſoon after exhibited in the town of Boſton; and if any one is deſirous of knowing their form and qualify, let him carefully read the <hi>Copy of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entered into by the inhabitants of Boſton,</hi> on Auguſt 1, 1768; the <hi>declaration</hi> and <hi>reſolves</hi> made by them in the September fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing—The <hi>Circular Letter</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>To the above mentioned <hi>Circular</hi> letter, a very ſenſible and ſpirited, though inaccurately penned anſwer was returned, by the <hi>Select Men</hi> of the Town of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> of the ſame province, dated September 23d, 1768. <hi>Part</hi> of the anſwer is in the following words.</p>
                        <floatingText type="letter">
                           <body>
                              <p>We are not ſenſible that the ſtate of America is ſo alarming, or the State of this province ſo materially different from what <hi>it was</hi> a few Months ſince, as to render the meaſure you propoſe, viz. a <hi>provincial convention</hi>) either ſalutary or neceſſary.</p>
                              <p>And here we propoſe to your conſideration, whether the <hi>circular letter,</hi> which gave ſuch umbrage, containing theſe expreſſions, or others of the like import:
<q>That the King and parliament, by the late revenue act, had <hi>Infringed</hi> the rights of the colonies, impoſed an <hi>inequitable</hi> tax, and things yet worſe might be expected from the independance and unlimited ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of crown officers therein mentioned,</q>
was ſo perfectly innocent, and entirely conſiſtent with that duty and loyalty profeſſed by the Houſe of Refreſentatives the laſt year, in their petition to his Majeſty; and whether the laſt houſe might not have complied with his Majeſty's requiſition, with a full ſaving of all their rights and privileges, thereby prevented our being deſtitute of a general court at this day.</p>
                              <p>We cannot comprehend what pretence there can be <hi>for</hi> the propoſed <hi>convention,</hi> unleſs the probability <hi>of</hi> a conſiderable number of regular troops being ſent into this province, and an apprehenſion of their being quartered, part in your town and part at the caſtle—and here we would obſerve, that it was a matter of doubt and uncertainty, whether any were coming or not; if otherwiſe, for what purpoſe the King was ſending them, whether for your defence in caſe of a <hi>French war</hi> (as you tell us there is in the minds of many a prevailing <hi>apprehenſion of one approaching,</hi> and if we do not miſunderſtand your letter, induced them to paſs the votes tranſmitted to us), or whether they are deſigned for the protection of the new-acquired territories, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncertain. That they are to be a ſtanding army in time of peace, you give us no evidence; and if your apprehenſions are well grounded, it is not even ſuppoſeable they are intended as ſuch—and if your town <hi>meant ſincerely,</hi> we cannot ſee the need they had of interpoſing in military matters, in an unprecedented way requeſting their inhabitants to be provided with arms, &amp;c. (a matter till now always ſuppoſed to belong to another department) eſpecially as they muſt know ſuch a number of troops would be a much better defence, in caſe of war, than they had heretofore been favoured with. To ſuppoſe what you ſurmiſe they may be intended for, is to miſtruſt the King's paternal care and goodneſs. If by any ſudden excurſions or inſurrections of ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate people, the King has been induced to think them a neceſſary check upon <hi>you,</hi> we hope you will, <hi>by your loyalty and quiet behaviour</hi> ſoon <hi>convince his Majeſty,</hi> and the world, they are <hi>not longer neceſſary for that purpoſe</hi>; that thereupon they will be withdrawn, and your town and the province ſaved any farther trouble and expence from that quarter.</p>
                              <p>We are ſenſible the colonies labour under many difficulties, and we great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, what the conſequences of the diſputes with our mother country will prove; however we are far from thinking the meaſures you are purſuing have <hi>any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> to deliver the good people of this province, but on the contrary, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge them into greater. After all, we ſhould hope (were it not for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent attempt, attended with a bad complexion) we might ſoon have deliverance from our preſent troubles, and things reſtored as at the firſt. The governments have, in our opinion, conſulted, and are purſuing, the propereſt methods to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain redreſs of their grievances [<hi>In conſequence of the uſe of theſe methods, the duties upon paper, glaſs, and pointers colours were taken of.</hi>]; our duty is, to wait with patience the event, unleſs we are determined to take the alternative. How far paſſion and <hi>diſappointment,</hi> and <hi>private reſentment</hi> may <hi>influence any</hi> to hurry their neighbours into ſuch <hi>mad</hi> and <hi>deſperate</hi> meaſures, we don't know, but pray God pevent.</p>
                              <p>Suffer us to obſerve, that in our opinion, the meaſures the town of Boſton are purſuing, and propoſing to us, and the people of this province to unite in, are <hi>unconſtitutional, illegal,</hi> and <hi>wholly unjuſtifiable,</hi> and what <hi>will give the enemies of our conſtitution the greateſt joy, ſubverſive of government, deſtructive of that Peace and good order which is the cement of ſociety</hi>; and <hi>have a direct tendency to rivet our chains, and deprive us of our rights and privileges,</hi> which the inhabitants of this town deſire may be ſecured to us, and perpetuated to our lateſt poſterity.</p>
                              <p>Thus we have freely expreſſed our ſentiments, having an equal right with others, though a leſſer part of the community, and take this firſt opportunity to <hi>proteſt</hi> againſt the propoſed <hi>Convention,</hi>—and hereby declare our <hi>loyalty</hi> to his preſent Majeſty, and <hi>Fidelity to our country</hi>; and that it is our firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the utmoſt of our power, to maintain and defend our rights in every prudent and reaſonable way, as far as is conſiſtent with our duty to God and the King.</p>

ſent about the ſame time, from

the <hi>Selectmen</hi> of Boſton to the Selectmen of the <hi>ſeveral towns,</hi> within that province—and ſome other publications of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. He will there ſee that the <hi>materials</hi> collected were all of

the right ſtamp, and excellently calculated to anſwer the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The writer goes on, and ſhews that he was well acquainted with the whole deſign of thoſe <hi>preparations,</hi> and could tell the very time when the foundation of the "glorious fabrick" was to be publicly laid,
<q>
                        <hi>Before ſeven years</hi> roll over our heads, the firſt ſtone <hi>muſt</hi> be laid.</q>
Thus we ſee the particular time for beginning this work was then already fixed and determined; and ſuch <hi>prediſpoſitions</hi> were made, that the event was rendered <hi>indubitable,</hi> in the opinion of the workmen. All theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars were declared to the public, by the <hi>American Whig,</hi> on the 11th of April, 1768; and his <hi>prophecy</hi> was fully verified by the event. For, we all know, that before the revolution of <hi>ſeven years</hi> was compleated, and exactly at the end of ſix years and five months, the firſt ſtone of the long projected building, actually was laid by the people of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> This corner ſtone bears an inſcription, and the inſcription informs us, in CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PITALS, That it was laid during the adminiſtration, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>auſpices,</hi> of the late Congreſs, then ſitting, with exquiſite propriety, in <hi>Carpenters-Hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards this ſame writer conſiders the intended <hi>American Empire</hi> under the more natural emblem of an image to be made of <hi>clay</hi>; and then he tells us in correſponding language, that all hands are briſkly at work, mixing and kneading the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients together, and "<hi>moulding</hi>" the great political maſs into "order."</p>
                  <p>Now, comparing all this with other appearances and known facts, it ſeems impoſſible for any judicious perſon to doubt, but that there is a ſet of people among us, diſaffected to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional ſupremacy of Great Britain over theſe Colonies, who have formed a ſcheme for eſtabliſhing an independent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013866_0039_0F925D8298F79618"/>
or empire in America; and that they have been regularly purſuing it for many years paſt. Nor can it be doubted, but that the late Congreſs, though ſeveral of its members perhaps were not admitted to the ſecret, was under the influence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of, and meant nothing leſs than to co-operate with, the maſter builders abovementioned, in making a proper arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſpoſition of the <hi>materials</hi> that were plentifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. With this <hi>key,</hi> the aenigmatical proceedings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may be explained; and what has hitherto appeared to be extravagant and abſurd, will be found to be regular and conſiſtent. If we conſider them as endeavouring to obtain a reconciliation of Great Britain to the Colonies, on ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and honourable plan, their conduct is unaccountable; but if we conſider them as aſſociated with, and directed by, the projectors of the <hi>glorious fabric</hi> of an independant American republic, the whole myſtery is unriddled; and whatever we may think of their principles or their deſigns, we ſhall have a more favourable opinion of their underſtandings.</p>
                  <p>We have now taken a view of the original deſign of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and of the authority with which the members were joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeverally veſted. We have compared their conduct with their inſtructions; and have ſtated the difference between the work propoſed and the work done. And on the review, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that inſtead of promoting, they have counter-acted, the deſign of their appointment; that they have altogether neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work they were ſent upon; that the powers delegated to them by their conſtituents, for the good of the colonies, were proſtituted to the purpoſes of private ambition; and that all their proceedings as far as we can judge, were inſtigated and directed by the New-England republicans, to the utmoſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Colonies, the diſgrace of their conſtituents, and their own infamy.</p>
                  <p>It cannot therefore remain a queſtion one moment, whether we are under obligations to adopt and purſue the meaſures they have preſcribed, or not; we manifeſtly owe them no obedience at all; we owe them no reſpect as a body: Much leſs are we bound to plunge ourſelves headlong into that abyſs of miſery and deſtruction which they have opened; an abyſs, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed muſt ſoon ſwallow us up, unleſs we reſolve to proceed in direct oppoſition to the impulſes and inſtigations, with which they and their adherents endeavour to puſh us on.</p>
                  <p>Rebellion and civil war are the neceſſary conſequence of our being governed by the Congreſs. They are the <hi>neceſſary,</hi> tho' not perhaps the <hi>immediate</hi> conſequence. For we cannot ſuppoſe that Great Britain, conſcious of her own ſuperior ſtrength, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013866_0040_0F925D854BE6F388"/>
jealous of her rights, will meanly put up with our wanton in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults; or that ſhe will be ſo intimidated with any threatenings of ours, as to ſacrifice at once her own dignity, honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, at the ſhrine of <hi>Carpenters-Hall,</hi> in Philadelphia. Such conduct would render her a laughing-ſtock to all Europe, and cauſe the Americans themſelves moſt heartily to deſpiſe her.</p>
                  <p>I have too good an opinion of the wiſdom, diſcretion and loyalty of the inhabitants of this province in general, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that any ſophiſtry can miſlead them, that any inſidious arts can ſeduce them to engage in the execution of the <hi>moſt violent</hi> part of the plan recommended by the Congreſs; which is to ſupport the <hi>rebellion</hi> in New-England with their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to the irrecoverable ruin of their families. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch a frantic adventure, muſt be the buſineſs only of fools or fanaticks, and is contrary to the prevailing diſpoſition of this ſenſible and ſober province.</p>
                  <p>But as to the leſs horrible part of the plan, which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>aſſociation</hi>; the danger of adopting it is greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its appearance is leſs tremendous. And yet when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that we are under no obligations to the Congreſs, that we are at perfect liberty to judge for ourſelves, and to conſult our own happineſs, as if the Congreſs had never exiſted, and that our condition would ſoon become inexpreſſibly miſerable by purſuing even this part of the ſcheme; I hope we ſhall have the prudence and grace to avoid it.</p>
                  <p>It has generally been thought, and is now pretty well known, that our reſolving to import nothing from Great Britain, will produce another act of Parliament for ſhutting up our ports; and that our commerce will be at a total ſtand, till the reſolution is recalled, in ſuch a way as will be acceptable. Now, if the operation of ſuch an act upon the ſingle town of Boſton only, has brought ſo much diſtreſs upon ſo many of its inhabitants, that all America has been obliged to contribute to their relief; we may judge in what manner we ſhall be affected by the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of this port, while all the neighbouring ports will be in the ſame condition, and our poor will have no proſpect of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from any of the other Colonies.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible that we can hold out, under ſuch circumſtances, for any conſiderable time. According to the common courſe of things, we ſhall be obliged at laſt to ſubmit to the authority of Great-Britain; and then, after a conteſt of this kind, ſhe will have a right to eſtabliſh new and leſs favourable terms for us, with which notwithſtanding we ſhall readily comply, as they will be the only conditions of peace and ſafety. So that this non-importation project, inſtead of relieving us from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013866_0041_0F925D87353AE460"/>
taxation, will in the end, naturally and almoſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, cauſe it to fall upon us with more than double weight.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort: If we regard the Congreſs at all, we ſhall bitterly repent it. But if we have recourſe to our legal repreſentatives, allow them their due honour and influence, and under their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection purſue only <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>conſtitutional</hi> meaſures, it will undoubtedly prove, in a more proper ſenſe than the word has commonly been uſed in, the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of this province.</p>
                  <p>If our preſent aſſembly ſhould refuſe to act a worthy part, on this occaſion, which I can hardly ſuſpect that they will; we muſt, for the preſent, bear it with as much patience as we can, conſiſtently with our duty;—looking forward to the time, which in that caſe will be haſtened when we ſhall have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a new choice, and when it will be our own faults, if we are not repreſented by men, who will pay a proper regard to the happineſs and proſperity of their conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>Let us then, my friends and fellow-ſubjects of this province, withdraw ourſelves immediately from within the <hi>vortex</hi> of the Congreſs—that we may be at liberty to purſue the real good of our country, under the friendly direction of the law and ſound policy. Let us diſband our Committees, but without any perſonal reproaches or reflexions on account of what is paſt; and, for the future, like men of ſenſe and ſpirit, let us ſcorn to yield any obedience but to the laws and to lawful authority. In ſeeking for the redreſs of our grievances, let us neither practice nor countenance any violent methods, till mild and ſafe ones ſhall have been fairly tried, and found to be ineffectual. If our caſe cannot be bettered, let us be careful however not to render it worſe, by our own miſmanagement. If we ſhould be unable immediately to procure an exemption from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament; yet that is no reaſon for our not ſecuring to ourſelves as much liberty as we can; and, in order to that, we muſt reſcue our necks from the <hi>yoke</hi> of the Congreſs, and our legs 2nd arms from the <hi>fetters</hi> of Committees. This is the bondage we have moſt reaſon to dread, as it is equally oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and diſgraceful.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, permit me, in a few words, to addreſs <hi>you,</hi> Gentlemen, who are authoriſed to <hi>repreſent</hi> the free-holders of this province, in the HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</p>
                  <p>After hearing ſo much of <hi>Congreſſes</hi> and <hi>Committees,</hi> it gives me peculiar pleaſure to conſider, that our conſtitution is not yet diſſolved, that our legal repreſentatives are not yet diſcarded, that they are now met together in their legiſlative capacity, and that their authority may ſtill be vigorouſly exerted. It is to you, Gentlemen, that I would perſuade my fellow-ſubjects of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013866_0042_0F925D87CBB8FDE8"/>
this province to have recourſe, at this time of difficulty and danger, and not to any power that is foreign and unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                  <p>I will venture to ſay, that neither you nor your predeceſſors have ever met together at ſo critical a ſeaſon as the preſent; that ſo much has never depended on the wiſdom of your deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; and that you have never had ſuch a call for the full exertion of your united abilities.</p>
                  <p>The people whom you repreſent are dreadfully perplexed, embarraſſed and divided. They know not what meaſures to purſue, to obtain ſafety. If your wiſdom and prudence can procure for them an adequate relief, you will henceforward be loved and revered as ſo many guardian angels to your country, and your names will be tranſmitted with peculiar luſtre, in the annals both of Great-Britain and her colonies, to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Although ſome of you are partly indebted to my <hi>vote,</hi> and much more to my influence, for ſeats in your honourable houſe; yet I preſume not to dictate to any of you, nor would I <hi>obtrude</hi> my advice upon your reſpectable body. But, convinced that you are willing to hear the opinion of any conſtituent, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to offer it, with becoming deference, on a ſubject that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the attention of all; I beg your indulgence for a few moments.</p>
                  <p>You will undoubtedly be urged by many, to give your ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the proceedings of the late Congreſs; and the example of ſeveral aſſemblies on this continent will be propoſed, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your compliance. But do not forget, Gentlemen, the nature and dignity of your own ſtation, and of the truſt that is repoſed in you. <hi>You</hi> are the lawful and proper guardians of our rights and liberties; and you have ſolemnly engaged your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to guard them, whenever they are invaded or expoſed. In this honorable and important work, you are not to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the <hi>example of others</hi>; but you are expected to act with a ſpirit of independency and freedom, that is worthy of your political character. The law, and <hi>your own</hi> wiſdom, are to be your only guides; and the happineſs of the province is to be your only mark. The conſtitution is the ground you ſtand on, and while you adhere to it, it will be your ſupport. But the moment you quit this ground, you are unſafe; as ſoon as ever you purſue or countenance unconſtitutional meaſures, you expoſe yourſelves, you injure us, you deſert your ſtation, you betray your truſt.</p>
                  <p>If you give your ſanction to the proceedings of the Congreſs in general terms, and without exceptions, as ſome other aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013866_0043_0F925D8886227710"/>
have done; you will, like them, become anſwerable for the guilt of ſuch proceedings, as are contrary to law and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the conſtitution. You will then be neceſſarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to approve of the <hi>approbation</hi> of the Congreſs, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their <hi>recommendations,</hi> and conſequently to approve of and recommend all the <hi>rebellious</hi> tranſactions of the people of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Are you willing, Gentlemen, to be conſidered in this light? Can you, who are the repreſentatives and legiſlators of one of the firſt provinces in America, of a province which has hitherto been reſpected for its loyalty and ſound policy, think of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading yourſelves ſo far below your proper rank, as to become the <hi>rear-guard</hi> of a faction againſt that ſupreme power, which preſides over, and muſt of neceſſity govern the whole Britiſh Empire? Forbid it, Honour! Forbid it, Decency! We do not think ſo contemptuouſly of you, as to believe it is poſſible. We ſhould be extremely unhappy at ſuch a time as this, if we had not great confidence in your firmneſs and ſteadineſs, and in your diſpoſition to ſupport your own dignity and the real inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the province.</p>
                  <p>There is no occaſion for entering into a detail of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which all are acquainted with. However it may be proper to obſerve to you, Gentlemen, that though your conſtituents in general are willing to allow, that hitherto they have not been <hi>oppreſſed</hi> by the power of the Britiſh Parliament; yet, that they imagine there is reaſon to complain of ſome late acts, as viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their conſtitutional liberty. In this caſe, a ſilent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, they think, would have a dangerous tendency; and the continuance of thoſe acts, they believe, would be productive of evil, both to the mother country and her American colonies. They wiſh therefore, from the moſt generous motives, that all ſuch acts may be repealed, and, at the ſame time, that a barrier may be fixed between the ſupremacy of Great-Britain and the rights of the Americans, in ſuch a manner, and on ſuch equit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able principles, that hereafter no infringements may be made, and that no jealouſies may be likely to ariſe, on either ſide. They conceive, that now is the proper time for this ſettlement to be made on a laſting baſis, and that you are the only proper perſons to appear in behalf of this province. They have le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally deputed you to act in their ſtead, and they rely on your wiſdom, caution and prudence to conduct a concern of ſuch great importance and delicacy.</p>
                  <p>Of the different methods that have been propoſed for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end in view, ſome are unqueſtionably right, and ſome wrong. If any doubts can remain with you, Gentlemen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what is right or wrong in this caſe; you will naturally
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013866_0044_0F925D8941681798"/>
think it expedient, before you determine which methods to purſue, to examine the matter carefully and impartially, that you may not be miſled by any error of judgment. In this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry you will attend to the true merits of the cauſe, and found your determination on evidence ariſing from the nature of the caſe, and the fitneſs of things; without ſeeing with other men's eyes, or ſuffering yourſelves to be warped by other men's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. For, we humbly conceive, that you are bound, by the nature of the truſt repoſed in you, to act according to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed direction of <hi>your own</hi> judgment, and not according to the contrary opinions of any people whatever.</p>
                  <p>If then you believe that the Congreſs acted wrong, or that they might have taken more prudent or ſafe meaſures, in order to ſecure the rights of the colonies, as I am perſuaded that you do; it then clearly follows, that you are bound in honour, and in duty to your conſtituents, to reject what appears to be wrong, and to proſecute thoſe meaſures which appear in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be moſt prudent and ſafe. He that can heſitate a moment in ſo clear a caſe, is not worthy to repreſent a virtuous and well-meaning people.</p>
                  <p>I know very well the difficulty that will preſs you. The generoſity of your diſpoſition will render it diſagreeable and painful to you, to act on a plan that is not only ſeparate, but eſſentially different from that which has been generally adopted by the other colonies; and perhaps you are afraid of being ſtigmatized as traitors to the common cauſe of America. I would by no means altogether condemn ſuch feelings; they are generous and honourable, when duly regulated. But truth, propriety and reaſon, are always entitled to our <hi>firſt</hi> regard; to a regard, which muſt not give way to more private affections.</p>
                  <p>The neighbouring governments are conſidered by this as <hi>ſiſter colonies</hi>; and as ſuch we have always loved them with ſincere affections, and we are deſirous of promoting their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts whenever we can, conſiſtently with our own. But the moſt favourite ſiſter is not to be juſtified or ſupported, in doing what is evidently wrong. If the other colonies are juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by this as <hi>ſiſters,</hi> we ſhould remember too, that, in the ſame ſenſe, England is to be conſidered as its <hi>mother</hi>; and the natural connexion is much ſtronger between a child and its parent, than it can be between a ſiſter and ſiſters.</p>
                  <p>To purſue the metaphor a little farther. If we ſee our ſiſters be taking themſelves to wrong courſes, we ſhould endeavour to reclaim them, by affectionate admonitions, and eſpecially by a <hi>good example.</hi> This will be much more to our honour, and finally more to their advantage, than if we encourage them to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013866_0045_0F925D8A07248978"/>
go on by our weak compliances. Theſe ſiſters of ours, of whom we are ſpeaking, are allowed to have many good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for which we eſteem them. They are naturally good-tempered; but for ſome time paſt they have been in an ill humour, and they are perpetually quarrelling with our mother, a venerable and worthy lady, but not intirely without foibles. The beginning of the diſpute was tolerably decent; but they now go on like a parcel of ſaucy and impudent huſſies, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and abuſing her; and they inſiſt upon it, that ſhe ſhall fall down upon her knees, and publickly aſk their pardon—for having lately exerciſed ſuch an authority over them as ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed to exerciſe, and in ſuch a way as ſhe thinks is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the laws of the land. It has been propoſed to theſe daughters, to try if the matter in diſpute with their mother cannot be ſettled in an amicable conference. But no; they ſwear and proteſt, that they will not exchange a ſingle word with her in that way; but that they will ſtab the <hi>old hag</hi> to the heart, or ſtarve her to death, but they will force her to a ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Such, Gentlemen, I conceive, is the conduct of our ſiſter colonies at this time, with regard to our common and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parent. Such is their conduct towards her, though they know that they are ſtill greatly dependent on her, and that ſhe has a ſufficient number of dutiful and brave ſons, who are reſolutely determined to revenge her quarrel, and maintain her authority. The queſtion then is, whether this province ſhall act, unbiaſſed by partial affections, according to its own real judgment and principles, or not: Or, whether ſhe ſhall enter upon a courſe of extravagant, profligate and dangerous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, merely in compliance with a termigant <hi>ſiſterhood,</hi> that has been lately deluded and debauched, and rendered almoſt deſperate by the Congreſs? To this queſtion you will certainly give an unanimous negative. If you act at all in this matter, it will be on a different plan, and mere conformably to the general opinion of the freeholders in the province.</p>
                  <p>But, for God's ſake, Gentlemen, why ſhould you not act? Will it juſtify inactivity in you, that others are acting wrongly? Are you afraid or aſhamed of appearing ſingular in doing what is right? You muſt know, that ſingularity in right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will be an honour to you, and a ſhame only to them that act otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you mean that the grievances you complain of, ſhould, if poſſible, be redreſſed; ſomething ſhould be done to promote the redreſs of them; for it is not to be expected, that they will redreſs themſelves. If you aim at the end, common ſenſe requires you to uſe ſuch means as are moſt likely
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013866_0046_0F925D8AC5790040"/>
to effect it. Such means as were moſt proper before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Congreſs, are moſt proper ſtill; for, with all their aſſumed powers, they were not able to alter the nature of things.</p>
                  <p>Let it then be the buſineſs of this ſeſſion, after providing for the immediate exigencies of this province, to do what ought to be done by every province on the continent; that is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and tranſmit proper addreſſes to the King, Lords and Commons of Great-Britain; decently ſtating your whole claims, and dutifully requeſting that they may ſpeedily be confirmed to you. Addreſſes from your body will be received and regarded; which is a greater honour than could have been allowed to addreſſes from the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>In your addreſſes declare, that you act in behalf of a loyal province, which you conſtitutionally repreſent, and that you have no connection with the late Congreſs. Candidly and generouſly confeſs, that a miſtaken zeal for liberty has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among us ſome tumultuous and diſorderly proceedings, which are not to be juſtified, Beg that all theſe things may be buried in oblivion, and that there may be no repeating of paſt grievances. Profeſs, in your own names and in ours, loyalty and allegiance to the King in the ſtrongeſt terms; and expreſs our willingneſs to acknowledge the ſupremacy of Great Britain in all caſes, excepting thoſe of taxation. Give aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that we dread the very thoughts of an abſolute indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; and that we ſee no proſpect of ſecurity or happineſs, but under the powerful protection and mild ſuperintendency of the mother country.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration of our being indulged with the favours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, ſignify your willingneſs to bind yourſelves and your conſtituents to raiſe annually, without any deduction, ſuch a ſum as may be thought equitable, for the general ſupport of government; and promiſe, at the ſame time, that this province will always pay due regard to his Majeſty's farther requiſitions, in caſes of emergency. In ſhort, propoſe and ſay whatever you may think proper; only be careful that your addreſſes be duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, your requeſts reaſonable, and your offers generous; and then, I doubt not but this province will be received by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country with open arms.</p>
                  <p>In this way, you will effectually provide for the happineſs and ſecurity of the people whom you repreſent, and probably contribute, in no ſmall degree, to the general happineſs of America. All good members of ſociety within the Britiſh empire will eſteem and reſpect you; and none will blame or reproach you but thoſe turbulent ſpirits, whoſe cenſures are much more deſirable than their praiſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:013866_0047_0F925D8B87C2E488"/>Before I withdraw, ſuffer me to remind you, Gentlemen, that, in this province, the friends to peace and political mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration have always been more than twenty to one; and to aſſure you, that their numbers are daily increaſing. Every day confirms them in their opinion. There is no danger of their falling off; they underſtand one another; they have formed their judgment on conviction; they are connected by princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they are animated by the conſideration both of public and private intereſt; and they now compoſe a body, which, notwithſtanding any domeſtic aſſaults they may meet with, will not be diſordered, but will remain as firm and impenetrable as the Macedonian <hi>Phalanx.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude. I have offered my ſentiments on a queſtion of the utmoſt importance to the colonies, with that plainneſs and freedom which every Engliſhman, in ſuch caſes, has a right to uſe. The real good of my country, was the ſincere aim of this inquiry. If I ſhould be thought to have ſpoken too harſhly of the late Congreſs, this muſt be my apology: It was an object that appeared to me in every view, hideous and deteſtible. I meant no perſonal reflections on any of its members, as has been intimated before; I reſpect ſuch of them as I have any particular knowledge of. My moſt earneſt wiſh is for the happineſs of America. I conſider Great-Britain and her colonies, with her other dependencies, as but one body, which muſt be affected throughout by the ſufferings of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member. I conſider them as conſtituting one great and illuſtrious family, to which I have the honour to belong; and I pray that its tranquillity may be ſpeedily reſtored, and that peace and harmony may forever reign through every part of it. Government and good order are its ſtrength; Liberty, civil and religious, is its glory. Every thing that contributes to its reputation and happineſs, I love; every thing that tends to diſtreſs or diſgrace it, I abhor. For this reaſon I abhor the late Congreſs. Its firſt appearance raiſed our curioſity, but excited no terror. But it was not long, before it turned out to be a perfect monſter,—a <hi>mad, blind</hi> monſter!</p>
