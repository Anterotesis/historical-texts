            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU have given us lately a fine and juſt Dialogu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e between a <hi>Dutch</hi> Magiſtrate and a <hi>French</hi> Hugonot Preacher; let me here preſent you with one between a Clergyman and a Quaker. It lately happened at a Meeting of ſome Gentlemen of our Country; and I was ſo taken with it, that as ſoon as I came home, I recollected what had been ſaid on both Sides, and think I have done both Sides Juſtice. This Dialogue will ſhew that the Quakers are not ſuch contemptible Reaſoners as Men of more Learning and Name would gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally make them; and that good Senſe is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Match for Art, and ſome Sorts of Education.</p>

Why doſt thou fall upon me with bitter Words, for telling thee a Fact, which, in Anſwer to thee, it was neceſſary to tell. Is it profane to ſay that the Heathen Clergy took Offerings? Nay, ſince thou doſt urge me, doſt not thou take Offerings? and did the Apoſtles take any?

I beg thou wouldſt not be provok'd, if I mention to thee once more the Example of the Apoſtles: Where did they juſtify Savageneſs and Severity to any Man for any Opinion, or any Words?

Pride and Impatience are inſeparable from it: It deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Humility, and maketh Men imperious, and Perſecutors. Why are the Popiſh Prieſts more cruel and miſchievous than Proteſtant Prieſts, but becauſe they have more Power? And why is the Pope the moſt miſchievous of all Prieſts, but becauſe he hath moſt Power?</p>

               <p>Friend, they who are rich in Grace, want no other Riches to ſave them from Contempt; and they who are rich without it, ought to be contemn'd. Riches may render them formidable; but Piety only, and a holy Converſation, can make them reverenced. Revenues do not place them above Contempt, but only encourage them to deſpiſe their People. The Poverty of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was great Part of their Glory.</p>

               <p>So I would, if my Affairs would let me; as I might here, under the Protection of the Law, if thou wouldſt let me. Let me tell thee, Friend, for the Credit of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Government in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> there is not a more thriving Colony in <hi>America.</hi> They encourage and protect all Men, and perſecute none: They are friendly to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage <hi>Indians,</hi> who come freely into their Houſes by Day, and by Night; and any Man in a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Habit may travel ſafely and ſingly thro' all the Nations of <hi>North America,</hi> who will be ready to receive and aſſiſt him.</p>

               <p>Knoweſt thou any better way to avoid Fighting, than a peaceable Spirit? And ought not all Men to avoid Fighting? The Quakers, ſince their firſt Eſtabliſhment there, have had no Wars: It is not ſo in <hi>New-England,</hi> where Men like thee, are for ſpiritual Dominion, and truſt to the Sword. There they uſe the poor Natives ill, who make frequent Incurſions upon them. Men who will take away by Violence the Lands and Goods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and domineer over them, muſt fight to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what they do. The Quakers have hurt no Man, and no Man offers to hurt them.</p>

               <p>Friend, thy Abuſe ends in Praiſe. The Quakers uſe no Man as an Enemy for his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and they who do have not Zeal, but Fury and Fanaticiſm. Our Saviour and his Apoſtles

But with what Face can ſuch as thou art, tell a Nation of Heathens, <q>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, be of my Religion, and in Requital I will be your Lord and Maſter, and take the Tenth of all you have, and all elſe that I can get: None of which can ever return to you again, let me uſe it, or abuſe you how I will.</q> And yet can Men of thy Spirit and Pretenſions reaſon in Sincerity at any other Rate with any Set of Men in the World.</p>
